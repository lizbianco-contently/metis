Res. 4\n\n       Whereas the Honorable Barbara Mikulski has had a long and \n     distinguished career as a United States Senator from the \n     State of Maryland;\n       Whereas Senator Mikulski was first elected to the United \n     States Congress as a member of the House of Representatives \n     in 1976, where she served until winning election to the \n     Senate in 1986;\n       Whereas Senator Mikulski is the first woman to be elected \n     to statewide office in Maryland;\n       Whereas in the 103rd Congress, Senator Mikulski was the \n     first woman to be elected Assistant Senate Democratic Floor \n     Leader;\n       Whereas Senator Mikulski was the first woman in the Senate \n     Democratic Leadership, serving as Secretary of the Senate \n     Democratic Conference in the 104th through the 108th \n     Congresses;\n       Whereas in 1997, Senator Mikulski became the most senior \n     woman serving in the Senate;\n\n[[Page S7]]\n\n       Whereas Senator Mikulski is the first woman to serve on the \n     Appropriations Committee of the Senate and the first woman to \n     chair the Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on \n     Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies;\n       Whereas Senator Mikulski has not only had a path breaking \n     career, but has won the admiration and respect of colleagues \n     on both sides of the aisle for her hard work, passionate and \n     effective advocacy, commitment to social and economic \n     justice, and willingness to serve as a mentor and role model \n     to other senators; and\n       Whereas Senator Mikulski has now surpassed the record of \n     former Senator Margaret Chase Smith as the longest serving \n     female Senator in the history of the United States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate recognizes and honors Senator \n     Barbara Mikulski for becoming the longest-serving female \n     Senator in history.\n\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote by which the resolution was \nagreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent the following \nSenators be recognized to speak on this resolution and Senator \nMikulski's historic milestone--I would note for Senators, we will be in \na period of morning business when we complete the business of today--\nReid of Nevada for 2 minutes, McConnell for 2 minutes, Cardin for 2 \nminutes, Snowe for 2 minutes, and Mikulski for 3 minutes. I ask \nunanimous consent.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I came to the Senate in January 1987, in the \nsame class as Barbara Mikulski. Every sixth January since, including \ntoday, Barbara Mikulski and I have been sworn in together. Taking that \noath is humbling and meaningful for every Senator, but it is a little \nmore meaningful this time around for Senator Mikulski, for Maryland, \nand for our country. She is now the longest serving woman Senator in \nour Nation's history.\n  She has had a pathbreaking career, and that is an understatement. She \nwas the first woman to serve in the Senate Democratic leadership when \nwe elected her our caucus secretary and she was the first woman ever to \nserve on the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  The woman whose record she breaks was a significant Senator in her \nown right. Margaret Chase Smith of Maine was the first woman to be \nelected to both the House and the Senate.\n  I know Senator Mikulski very well. She is my friend and my confidant. \nI know that more than any records, she is most proud of what she has \ndone with that time, time she has dedicated to tireless, passionate, \nand effective advocacy for those who need a voice or even a hand.\n  She is as committed to social and economic justice as any Senator who \nhas ever served in this great Chamber and she has won the admiration \nand respect of her colleagues, both Democrats and Republican, \nespecially those for whom she has given her time and her advice as a \nmentor and a role model.\n  Alongside all her records and accomplishments, I will always admire \nthe way she led us in one of our darkest days. As evening fell on \nWashington, DC, for the first time after the Twin Towers fell in New \nYork, hundreds of Members of Congress, from the House and the Senate, \nwalked outside to the steps of the Capitol. We joined hands. Then, in a \nmoment of silence, Senator Mikulski suggested we all sing ``God Bless \nAmerica.'' We did. I will never forget that moment.\n  I will always remember a speech this good woman gave more than two \ndecades ago. Senator Mikulski, Senator John Glenn, and I went on a trip \nto Poland, back when it was behind the Communist Iron Curtain. John \nGlenn, who, of course, was an international celebrity in addition to \nbeing a Senator, captivated the crowd. We were in a basement, meeting \nwith some dissidents. Knowing Senator Mikulski is of Polish descent, I \nasked if she could speak next, after Senator Glenn. I thought she would \nsay a few words about her heritage. I have heard a lot of speeches in \nmy life, but none has ever moved me more than the speech Barbara \nMikulski gave in that basement in Warsaw, Poland.\n  Congratulations to my friend, Senator Barbara Mikulski, and the State \nof Maryland for returning such a strong public servant to the Senate on \ntheir behalf.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I, too, rise to honor our colleague, \nthe senior Senator from Maryland, on becoming the longest serving \nfemale Senator in the history of the Senate. In achieving this \nmilestone, Barbara passes Margaret Chase Smith, as the majority leader \nindicated, who served the people of Maine from 1949 to 1973. As was \nindicated, she is also only the second woman to be elected to both the \nSenate and the House.\n  When first elected to the Senate in 1986, Barbara was only the 16th \nwoman to ever serve. Today, there are more female Senators than that in \nthe 112th Congress alone.\n  Barbara has served as a role model and mentor to many of them, and I \nknow they are grateful for it. She has been a champion of the space \nprogram, scientific research, welfare reform, major transportation, \nhomeland security, and environmental issues in Maryland.\n  I think Barbara would be the first to tell you that becoming the \nlongest serving female Senator wasn't easy. Like all streaks, including \nthat of another Marylander Cal Ripken, there are a lot of bumps in the \nroad. But she has made it through it all and we are happy to share in \nthis milestone with her today.\n  I wish to recognize Barbara not only for her accomplishment as the \nlongest serving female in the Senate history but also for all of her \nmany accomplishments as a Senator and for the pioneering model she has \nbeen to so many women in her distinguished career. Again, \ncongratulations, Senator Mikulski.\n\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, Marylanders take pride in their Hall of \nFamers, from Cal Ripkin, our ``Iron Man,'' to Brooks Robinson with the \nGolden Gloves, to Johnny Unitas with the Golden Arm, to Frank Robinson, \nwho was an All-Star in both the American and National Leagues. Now we \nadd to that list our own Senator Barbara Mikulski, the longest serving \nwoman Senator in Senate history.\n  Marylanders are proud of Senator Barb not because of her length of \nservice but for what she has done as a Senator and throughout her \nentire career. If you ask any Marylander what they think about Senator \nMikulski, they will start off by saying: She is a fighter. Then they \nwill say: We are glad she is on our side.\n  She is an effective fighter for the people. From protecting \nneighborhoods from an unwanted highway to keeping jobs in Maryland from \nbeing shipped overseas, there is no more effective fighter than Senator \nBarbara Mikulski.\n  She has protected our national security from her position on the \nIntelligence Committee, she has strengthened the U.S. Space Program in \nher position on the Appropriations Committee, she provided equity in \nhealth care from the HELP Committee, and she stands up for our Federal \nworkers, advancing gender equity issues, and the list goes on and on \nand on.\n  She has taken her social worker background, her political training \nfrom ward politics in east Baltimore, and her hard work ethic from her \nparents and her own common sense to be the voice for working families \nin the Halls of the Senate.\n  On a personal note, I thank my friend for always being there for me, \nworking together as a team for the people of Maryland. On behalf of my \ntwo granddaughters, my daughter, my wife, and all Americans, thank you, \nSenator Mikulski, for living the American dream and making that dream a \nreality for so many Americans.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, there are certain occasions in the life of \nour Nation and this esteemed institution that are so steeped in history \nthey remain indelibly etched in our minds and upon our hearts. This is \none of those iconic moments as we share in recognizing Senator \nMikulski's venerable achievement with her colleagues, her family, loved \nones, friends, constituents, staff, and indeed the Nation.\n  This is also a special day of pride most especially for those of us \nwho are\n\n[[Page S8]]\n\nwomen Senators for whom Senator Mikulski has been a role model and \nmentor as well as coleading numerous efforts with Senator Hutchison, \nour senior Republican woman, to foster camaraderie among all of us.\n  Having been privileged to know Senator Mikulski for more than 30 \nyears, beginning with our mutual service in the House of \nRepresentatives, I cannot conceive of anyone I would rather witness \novertaking such a sacrosanct milestone than the senior Senator from \nMaryland, a beloved, vigorous champion of the people of her State and \nunquestionably the women of America.\n  Indisputably, for both of her Maine colleagues, Senator Collins and \nme, the landmark occasion we are commemorating is all the more personal \nand poignant given we are both colleagues and dear friends of Senator \nMikulski and also direct inheritors and beneficiaries of Senator \nMargaret Chase Smith's groundbreaking service. It is in that light that \nI am deeply privileged today to stand at the very desk she once graced, \nand having sat across her desk when I first met her in Washington years \nago, to also pay tribute to Senator Smith by wearing her pin given to \nme by a very good friend from Maine, Susan Longley, one of the actual \npins in which Senator Smith would famously place the trademark rose she \nwore daily on the floor of the Senate.\n  Indeed, there are numerous similarities between Senator Margaret \nChase Smith and Senator Mikulski that transcend longevity. They both \nlive the ideals of hard work and earning their own way in life. Senator \nMikulski, the proud descendent of Polish immigrants, worked in her \nparents' grocery store during her formative years in Baltimore, and \nyears later, after she graduated from college, acquired a master's \ndegree and pursued the noble calling of social work.\n  Senator Smith was a textile worker, telephone operator, newspaper \nwoman, teacher, and an office manager. The point is, neither started at \nthe top, but they most certainly arrived there. Senator Smith rose from \nthe humblest beginnings to represent Maine in the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate for more than 32 distinguished years \nwith unequalled courage, civility, compassion, and integrity. She was a \nvisionary of endless firsts, but, undoubtedly, Senator Smith will best \nbe remembered for the moment during her only second year in the Senate, \nwith truly uncommon courage and principled independence, she \ntelegraphed the truth about McCarthyism during the Red Scare of the \n1950s with her renowned ``Declaration of Conscience'' speech on the \nSenate floor. In 15 minutes she had done what 94 of her colleagues, \nmale colleagues I might add, had not dared to do, and in so doing \nslayed a giant of demagoguery prompting American financier Bernard \nBaruch to say: Had a man made that speech, he would have become the \nnext President of the United States.\n  Yet even as Senator Smith was a political pioneer, she never \ndeliberately set out to establish some sort of precedent for women. \nRather, what her life proved is that gender was not the key factor in \npublic service but dedication and energy, confidence, ability, and \nsheer guts were. If those foundational qualities do not also \nencapsulate the essence of the public service of Senator Barbara \nMikulski, then I do not know what does.\n  It is, therefore, all the more appropriate and fitting that of anyone \nit would be a person of Senator Mikulski's legislative stature who \nwould exceed Senator Smith's length of service in the Senate.\n  As if this benchmark established today were not enough, on March 17, \n2012, we will all be back on the floor of the Senate because Senator \nMikulski will become the longest serving female Member in the history \nof the Congress, House or Senate. She probably did not even have a \nchance to think about that one.\n  Moreover, like Senator Smith, Senator Barbara Mikulski has always \nbrought an unyielding tenacity, a cornerstone of her fighting spirit \nand character, that has time and again been reflected in her \nlegislative fight on behalf of the people she represents. This will not \nbe a news flash to my colleagues or even those, our new colleagues, who \nwill soon discover that taking no for an answer is simply not in \nSenator Mikulski's vocabulary nor her DNA. As she has often said, she \nis not ``caffeine free.'' And nowhere have I witnessed that ardent \nfocus and commitment more intensely than in Senator Mikulski's \nsignature battle for equity in women's health research, one that \nCongresswoman Pat Schroeder and I were waging from the House side as \nwell.\n  We all set aside our partisan labels at a time when, incredibly, \nwomen and minorities were systematically excluded from clinical medical \ntrials at the National Institutes of Health, trials that often made the \ndifference between life and death.\n  At a pivotal juncture, Senator Mikulski tackled this travesty head on \nand launched a key panel of stakeholders, as she can do, to explore the \nshocking discriminatory treatment which further galvanized national \nattention, and, in the end, we produced watershed policy changes that \nto this day are resulting in lifesaving medical discoveries for \nAmerica's women.\n  Ultimately, what we are celebrating today are two legislative \njuggernauts who have defined the standard of principled public service \nby exemplifying a special bond of trust that should exist between the \ngoverning and the governed. They have seen problems confronting their \nconstituencies and the Nation and left no stone unturned to solve them. \nThey recognized injustice and acted boldly to quell it. They have given \na voice to the voiceless, power to the powerless, and they were always \nat one with those they represent because they never ever forgot their \nroots.\n  That is why, as Senators from the State of Maine, where Senator \nMargaret Chase Smith's legacy has been forever enshrined, Senator \nCollins and I are profoundly honored to share in this rarified moment \nas Senator Mikulski assumes the historic mantle of longest serving \nwoman in the Senate. Indeed, it bodes well for the venerable \ninstitution of this Senate and our great Nation to have the senior \nSenator from Maryland to be at the vanguard of our ranks.\n  Congratulations.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate boasts many persuasive voices, \nbut there are few stronger than that of Senator Barbara Mikulski. To \ncall her a trailblazer does not do justice to her long and storied \ncareer in Congress, representing the people of Maryland and advancing \nwomen's rights, civil rights, and justice for all Americans. This week, \nshe becomes the Senate's longest serving woman Senator in U.S. history.\n  First elected to the House of Representatives in 1976, and to the \nSenate in 1986, Senator Mikulski has served the people of Maryland with \nhonor and distinction. In Congress, she has remained committed to her \nroots in public service, which began as a social worker in Baltimore, \nhelping at-risk children and helping seniors. After 5 years on the \nBaltimore City Council, Marylanders in the State's third congressional \ndistrict sent Senator Mikulski to Congress, where she has continued her \nhard work and tireless advocacy for women and families.\n  Atop her list of priorities has been giving voice to issues \nconcerning women's health. She worked to establish the National \nInstitutes of Health Office of Women's Health and to implement \nstandards to ensure that all women have access to quality mammography. \nShe fought to expand access to maternity care. Most recently, through \nSenator Mikulski's leadership, the historic Affordable Care Act \nincluded strong antidiscrimination provisions to ensure that being a \nwoman is no longer a pre-existing condition.\n  In early 2009, Senator Mikulski further proved she is, in fact, a \nforce to be reckoned with, when her tireless efforts to advance the \nLilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act resulted in that legislation being one of \nthe first laws to be signed by President Obama. Since the Supreme \nCourt's 2007 decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire, Senator Mikulski \nworked relentlessly to restore congressional intent and reverse the \nCourt's decision to give employers blanket immunity for their \ndiscriminatory pay practices. The Ledbetter Fair Pay Act restored \nvictims' ability to file suit for pay discrimination, and was an \nimportant step forward in ensuring that all workers receive equal pay \nfor equal work.\n  I have been honored to work with Senator Mikulski in her capacity as\n\n[[Page S9]]\n\nchairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, \nJustice and Science, where she has championed important programs to \nsupport state and local law enforcement, crime victims, and critical \nsupport programs for victims of domestic violence. I share her \ncommitment to investing in the men and women who are charged with \nkeeping our communities safe, and providing important support to \nvictims of violence.\n  There is no question that Senator Mikulski is a leader in the Senate. \nAs the dean of the Women of the Senate, she serves as a mentor to other \nwomen Senators who join the Chamber. She is a dedicated public servant, \na strong voice for women, a consensus builder. She has said she is \n``first and foremost the Senator from Maryland and the Senator for \nMaryland.'' For more than three decades, many of us have been proud to \ncall her a friend.\n  I join with many others in congratulating Senator Mikulski on this \nhistoric achievement.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate my \nfriend and colleague, Barbara Mikulski, who is now the longest-serving \nwoman in the history of the U.S. Senate.\n  Barbara has been a forceful advocate for the people of her beloved \nMaryland and a role model for women everywhere--beginning with her \nelection to the Baltimore City Council in 1971, to her election to the \nHouse of Representatives in 1976, to her election to the Senate in \n1986.\n  Barbara is a pace-setter in the fight for equality for women. When I \nfirst ran for the Senate in 1992, Barbara reached out to me to offer \nher support, for which I am grateful, and she welcomed me when I joined \nthe Senate.\n  Barbara is indomitable, not only in the fight for equality for women \nbut in the broader fight for human rights for all mankind. I am proud \nto have worked alongside Barbara in opposing tyranny in Burma, in \npushing to restrict cluster munitions that pose a grave threat to \ninnocent people around the world, and in pushing to free Burmese \ndemocratic leader Aung San Suu Kyi.\n  And I am proud to work with her on the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence, which I chair, where I know I can count on Barbara to do \nthe hard work required to oversee America's intelligence agencies and \nkeep America safe.\n  Any discussion of Barbara would be incomplete without acknowledgment \nof her effort to improve bipartisanship in the Senate--something sorely \nneeded right now--an effort aided by her monthly bipartisan dinners for \nwomen Senators.\n  These dinners bring us together and make the Senate a more hospitable \nplace for women. But they are more than that. These dinners are a way \nto forge relationships and friendships that transcend party lines. \nThese gatherings have created a community of interests among Senators \nof divergent backgrounds and political views. I think that is a very \nbig contribution.\n  So I want to salute you, Barbara. I am proud to call you colleague \nand friend. And I look forward to working with you for many more years \nto come.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my \ncolleague and friend, Senator Barbara Mikulski.\n  Earlier today, when Senator Mikulski took the oath in this Chamber to \nserve, protect, and defend the U.S. Constitution, she became the \nlongest serving woman in the history of the Senate.\n  Senator Mikulski is no stranger to making history, and today she has \nmade history once again.\n  When Senator Mikulski was first sworn in as a Senator in 1987, she \nwas the first Democratic woman Senator elected in her own right. And, \nalong with Senator Kassebaum, she was one of only two women in the \nSenate at the time.\n  Today, 17 women were sworn in on the Senate floor and I know many of \nus might not be here today without Senator Mikulski's support and \nencouragement. She truly is the dean of the women in the Senate.\n  Senator Mikulski and I became very close friends when I joined the \nHouse of Representatives in 1983. She was always someone I respected \nbecause she was always focused on making life better for the middle- \nand working-class people she serves.\n  When I first thought about running for the Senate, Senator Mikulski \nwas the first person I went to see, and she gave such sage advice. She \nsaid ``You'll love it here in the Senate because you have an ability to \nhelp the people you serve.'' Senator Mikulski told me it would be the \ntoughest thing and the best thing I would ever do.\n  I give Senator Mikulski such credit. That is the role she has played \nwith so many women Senators from both sides of the aisle. She regularly \nbrings the women of the Senate--together Republicans and Democrats--for \na friendly dinner.\n  One of Senator Mikulski's wonderful gifts is her humor. When she and \nI served together in the House, women were unable to use the main \nfacilities of the House gym. Along with Geraldine Ferraro, Olympia \nSnowe, Barbara Kennelly and others, we worked together to ``integrate'' \nthe House gym.\n  At the House gym, a friend would lead us in exercises. One time, she \nsaid to us: ``OK everyone, hands on your hips.'' Senator Mikulski \nretorted, ``If I had hips, I wouldn't be here.''\n  That is so typical of her style--warm, funny and to the point. It \nbrought us all together.\n  And it is one reason why this daughter of east Baltimore has been \nsuch an inspiration to millions of women across our country.\n  Senator Mikulski is an accomplished legislator and leader who knows \nhow to get the job done.\n  She has long fought to protect the health and well-being of women and \ntheir families.\n  Not only did she support the historic health care reform legislation \nthat is making sure every American has access to quality, affordable \ninsurance, but Senator Mikulski fought to make the legislation stronger \nfor women. I was proud to stand with her to pass an amendment that \nguarantees women will have access to the preventive care they need such \nas screenings for breast, ovarian and cervical cancer.\n  Senator Mikulski championed the Mammography Quality Standards Act, \nwhich requires mammography facilities across the Nation to meet uniform \nquality standards. This law has saved lives by improving preventive \ncare that can lead to early diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.\n  When we saw how little health science and research addressed women's \nhealth, Senator Mikulski and I helped lead the fight for health equity. \nWe helped create the National Institutes of Health Office of Women's \nHealth to study women's needs and health issues.\n  Senator Mikulski believes everyone should be fairly paid for a hard \nday's work. We stood together as vocal advocates for the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act--a historic bill by Senator Kennedy that is now \nthe law of the land.\n  And, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Mikulski \nhas fought for critical funding to clean up and protect Maryland's \ntreasured Chesapeake Bay.\n  Senator Mikulski's tenacity is undeniable. Several years ago, she was \nmugged one evening outside her home in Baltimore. A man pushed her to \nthe ground and grabbed her purse.\n  Even though she is only 4 feet 11 inches, Senator Mikulski fought \nback and defended herself.\n  Yes, Senator Mikulski stands up for herself and stands up for the \npeople of Maryland. She has fought hard for change and equal rights. As \nshe likes to say, there are times when you need to ``(s)quare your \nshoulders, suit up, put on your lipstick and get ready for battle.''\n  Senator Mikulski has always been out in front. She has used her role \nas the senior woman in the Senate to focus on issues that matter to her \nconstituents. Her power lies in her ability to organize people. That is \none reason she is so beloved by her colleagues--we love it when she \nbrings us together on issues.\n  I stand today to honor my good friend, a trailblazer and a mentor, \nSenator Mikulski.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is a great honor to join in recognizing \nand celebrating my colleague, the senior Senator from Maryland. Senator \nBarbara Mikulski became the longest serving woman Senator in our \nNation's\n\n[[Page S10]]\n\nhistory today when she completed the oath to begin her fifth term in \nthe Senate. Indeed, this is not the first time Senator Mikulski's name \nwill be etched in history for her groundbreaking service: she was the \nfirst woman elected to statewide office in Maryland and the first \nfemale Democrat to serve in both Chambers of Congress.\n  During her 24 years in the Senate, she has won the admiration of her \ncolleagues for her resolve, hard work and dedication to her \nconstituents. It is an honor to call Senator Mikulski a friend. As \nrepresentatives of neighboring States, we have often had the \nopportunity to work together on issues of regional importance. I can \nnever thank her enough for her commitment to NASA-Wallops, one of many \nexamples in this regard.\n  Today marks a special milestone in the Senate's history. I join my \ncolleagues in commending Senator Mikulski, not only for her enormous \nservice to this body and to our country but as someone who has been a \ntireless advocate for her home State of Maryland.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to add my voice to the many others \nheaping deserved praise onto Senator Barbara Mikulski, who sets a \nrecord today as the longest serving woman in the history of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Tough but compassionate, an effective advocate for Maryland and for \nthe national interest, Senator Mikulski has achieved more than just \nlongevity. She has been an energetic and effective advocate for the \ninterests of children, a staunch ally of seniors, a defender of \nservices for our veterans, and a supporter of efforts to involve all \nAmericans in solving our Nation's problems through service and \nvoluntarism. Her support of education and scientific research promises \nbenefits that will last long after we all have departed the Senate.\n  I have been a proud partner with her on making commonsense changes to \nour Nation's immigration system. She also has been a strong advocate \nfor Federal programs that promote manufacturing, such as the Commerce \nDepartment's Manufacturing Extension Program and the Technology \nInnovation Program.\n  Senator Mikulski is rightly seen as a mentor and leader of women who \ncome to the Senate. The successes of the many female Senators who have \nbeen the beneficiaries of her guidance stand as a testament to the \npower of her example.\n  Senator Mikulski has admirably brought the lessons of her early \ncareer as a social worker to her work in the Senate, understanding that \nreal families with real problems are looking to us for solutions.\n  The people of Maryland and of this Nation are fortunate to have the \nbenefit of her service. I am proud to call her a colleague and a \nfriend. I congratulate her on her accomplishment and I await the many \nmore achievements I know are to come.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it is a great pleasure to offer my \nheartfelt congratulations to Senator Barbara Mikulski on becoming the \nlongest-serving woman in Senate history. While this is a milestone to \ncelebrate, the true cause for celebration is not just Senator \nMikulski's decades of service to this chamber, but her lifetime of \nservice to her beloved Baltimore, her state of Maryland, and our \nNation.\n  This occasion has a special meaning for Sen. Snowe and me. As she \nbegins her 25th year in the Senate, Senator Mikulski now surpasses my \npersonal role model in public service, Senator Margaret Chase Smith. \nJust as the Great Lady from Maine inspired Sen. Snowe and me as well as \ncountless other young women of my generation to serve, Senator Mikulski \ninspires the young women of today.\n  As a new Senator in 1997, I was one of those tutored by Senator \nMikulski. She taught me the ropes of the appropriations process and \ninstituted regular bipartisan dinners for the women of the Senate.\n  It has been a privilege to work with Senator Mikulski for 14 years. \nDuring that time, I have come to know her as a fighter, a trailblazer, \nand as a dear friend. She is committed to the people of her state and \nof America.\n  Senator Mikulski is, above all, a hard worker. Growing up in East \nBaltimore, she learned the value of hard work at her family's grocery \nstore. Her commitment to making a difference in her neighborhood led \nher to become a social worker, helping at-risk children and the \nelderly.\n  Her activism and understanding of community needs led to her first \nsuccessful run for public office, the Baltimore City Council in 1971. \nFive years later, she came to Washington as a member of Congress, \nrepresenting Maryland's 3rd District.\n  After 10 years of service in the House, she was elected to the Senate \nin 1986. In so doing, she became the first Democratic Senator elected \nin her own right. The people of Maryland wisely returned her to office \nin 1992, 1998, 2004, and again in 2010.\n  Senator Mikulski's longevity is only the preface to her story of \nexceptional accomplishment. She has fought for increased access to \nhigher education and for improved health care for our seniors. I am \nproud to have fought at her side on those issues, as well as for \nincreased Alzheimer's research, improved women's health care, and \nenhanced educational opportunities for nurses.\n  Working with her on the Appropriations Committee, I have witnessed \nfirsthand how seriously she takes her responsibility to the American \ntaxpayers.\n  Throughout her life in public service, Senator Mikulski has lived by \none guiding principle: her obligation is to help our people meet the \nneeds of today as she helps our Nation prepare for the challenges of \ntomorrow. It is an honor to congratulate the Great Lady from Maryland \nfor her many years of service, and to wish her many more.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise to honor a distinguished colleague, \nSenator Barbara Mikulski, who is celebrating a major milestone--today \nbecoming the longest serving female in Senate history.\n  Elected to the House in 1976 and the Senate in 1986, Senator Mikulski \nis the first woman to win statewide office in Maryland, the first \nfemale Democrat to serve in both the House and the Senate, and the \nfirst female Democrat elected to the Senate in her own right.\n  As one of the most effective Senators, Senator Mikulski used her \nexperience as a social worker and activist to ardently work on behalf \nof her constituents giving them a strong voice in the U.S. Senate. A \nleader in the Senate she has successfully fought for a variety of \nissues ranging from women's rights to protecting our law enforcement.\n  Throughout our 8 years of serving together in the House and 24 years \nin the Senate, Senator Mikulski and I have worked on many issues \ntogether. We have a strong bipartisan relationship that is reflected in \nthe numerous accomplishments we have achieved working together as the \nchair and ranking member on the CJS appropriations subcommittee. I have \nalways appreciated Senator Mikulski's candor, sense of humor, and \nwillingness to cross party lines to work in the best interest of our \nNation.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Mikulski on reaching this \nhistoric milestone today. I am honored to call Senator Barbara Mikulski \nmy colleague but prouder to call her my friend.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nhonoring the Senator from Maryland, Barbara Mikulski--the longest \nserving woman in the history of the U.S. Senate.\n  It has been an honor to serve with Senator Mikulski in my 2 years in \nthis body. She quickly became a dear friend and a valuable mentor--just \nas she has been for all of her other female colleagues as the dean of \nthe women Senators.\n  It wasn't until 1932 that Hattie Caraway became the first woman ever \nelected to the U.S. Senate. And it wasn't until a half century later--\n1986--that against all odds, Barbara Mikulski became the first \nDemocratic woman ever elected to the Senate in her own right.\n  Now the longest serving woman in this Chamber's entire history, \nSenator Mikulski is showing just what is possible when you ignore \nconventional wisdom, never stop fighting for what is right and just, \nand honor our commitment to the families that elect us every single \nday.\n  One of her hallmark battles has been the fight for equal pay for \nequal work for women. This is not only an issue of\n\n[[Page S11]]\n\njustice, but an economic imperative. Even today, for every dollar a man \nmakes, a woman makes just 78 cents--a disparity that is even worse for \nwomen of color. Latino women make just 53 cents, and African-American \nwomen make just 62 cents for every dollar a man makes. I know Senator \nMikulski won't give up until we correct this outrageous injustice.\n  She also fought to strengthen our laws against domestic violence, and \nopen up access to health screenings and treatment that can save lives. \nAnd, she led the fight against insurance companies that made being a \nwoman a pre-existing condition.\n  Senator Mikulski has always fought to protect women's health and a \nwoman's right to choose. Last year, I was proud to stand with her to \ndefeat the dangerous Stupak amendment that would have denied lifesaving \nreproductive care for the women of this country--a victory we would not \nhave won without Senator Mikulski.\n  In the words of Eleanor Roosevelt, ``the battle for the individual \nrights of women is one of long standing, and none of us should \ncountenance anything which undermines it.''\n  It is that spirit--never backing down in the face of injustice--\nSenator Mikulski is one of the strongest voices we have for women in \nthis country and women around the world.\n  And every single day she's paving the way for more women in leading \nroles in America. There still may only be 17 women serving in the \nSenate today, but with her leadership and her strong voice, Senator \nMikulski is showing the young women and young girls of this country \nthat women's voices matter and are needed in the public debate.\n  Whether it is here on Capitol Hill or in State capitols around the \ncountry or heading small business or the boardrooms of major companies, \nSenator Mikulski is helping to inspire the next generation of women \nleaders by showing that our voices solve problems and lead to change.\n  Each of us owe her a debt of gratitude for her vision and pioneering \nspirit.\n  Thank you, Senator Mikulski, and congratulations on your historic \nachievement. It is an honor to work with you, and I hope to serve with \nyou for many years to come.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Senator \nBarbara Mikulski for her trailblazing career in the U.S. Senate. As we \nbegin the 112th Congress today, Senator Mikulski will begin her fifth \nconsecutive Senate term making her the longest serving female Senator \nin American history. She joins legendary Maine Senator Margaret Chase \nSmith in the history books today. This accomplishment is a testament to \nher dedication to the State and the people of Maryland, and a \ncommitment to serve which I aim to emulate with my constituents in \nMissouri. She is, quite simply, a remarkable, dedicated, focused and \nperseverant woman and these attributes have led to this wonderful \nmoment in her continued service.\n  Starting out as a social worker in Baltimore, and later becoming a \nmember of the Baltimore city council, Senator Mikulski went on to \nbecome a U.S. Representative for the Third Congressional District of \nMaryland for 10 years. In 1986, she was elected to the U.S. Senate \nwhere she has served ever since.\n  Barbara Mikulski has continuously broken barriers for women and made \nhistory in her over 40 years as an elected official. And yet, in this \n112th Congress, even as we mark this historic moment for women in the \nSenate, Senator Mikulski carries on her career in such a way that sets \naside the pomp and circumstance of making history and instead remains \nfocused on the most basic, pure and selfless form of public service.\n  In closing, although Senator Mikulski's tenure in the Senate as a \nwoman is an important milestone, I believe that it will ultimately be \nthe Senator's leadership fighting for women, children, seniors and \nveterans which will be her lasting legacy in Congress. I have had the \nfortunate opportunity to work with Senator Mikulski on some of this \nhistoric legislation for women and families, including the Lily \nLedbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act to protect against pay \ndiscrimination, and the TRICARE Dependent Coverage Extension Act which \nexpanded health insurance for military families.\n  I want to congratulate Senator Mikulski on her pioneering career in \ncivil service and on making history in the U.S. Senate today; I am \nhumbled to be working on historic legislation alongside my colleague \nfrom Maryland.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues in \ncongratulating Senator Barbara A. Mikulski as she becomes the longest \nserving female Senator in American history.\n  Senator Mikulski and I began our Senate careers in the 1980s, and it \nhas been my privilege to serve with her. We have worked together on \nmany, many issues, including 975 bills. Two hundred eighty-five of \nthose bills passed the Senate and 184 were signed into law, including \nthe Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 in the last Congress. I am \nproud of our combined accomplishments and to call her my colleague and \nfriend.\n  It is a great honor to serve with Senator Mikulski. Senator Mikulski \nand I have more in common than some know. My life-changing experience \nwith the VISTA program in the 1960s fueled my commitment to public \nservice in much the same way Senator Mikulski's experience as a social \nworker in Baltimore fueled hers. Our early experiences remain the \nfoundation of our shared commitment to quality health care for all \npeople. Senator Mikulski and I have worked tirelessly together to \nexpand access to cancer screenings and increase funding for medical \nresearch, including Alzheimer's disease. I was proud to stand with \nSenator Mikulski last year to pass historic health care reform. Her \ncommitment to opening doors for all members of our society is to be \ncommended.\n  Even though she stands at 4'11\" and I at 6'7\", we have stood eye-to-\neye in supporting our veterans. And, we had many opportunities for \ncollaboration as she was working on the Appropriations Committee and I \nchaired the Veterans' Affairs Committee. It is easy to work with \nsomeone like Senator Mikulski who is so committed to her values and the \npeople she represents.\n  The first female senator, Rebecca Latimer Felton of Georgia, only \nheld office for 1 day in 1922, having been appointed by Governor Thomas \nHardwick upon the death of Senator Thomas Watson. During her first and \nlast Senate address, she said ``When the women of the country come in \nand sit with you, though there may be but a very few in the next few \nyears, I pledge that you will get ability, you will get integrity of \npurpose, you will get exalted patriotism, and you will get unstinted \nusefulness.'' Rebecca Felton's words forecast Senator Mikulski. There \nis no question that she has brought all of these skills and attributes, \nand much more, to the U.S. Senate over these last 24 years.\n  In some ways it is hard to believe Senator Mikulski is now the \nSenate's longest serving female Senator. She does a great job, and I \nunderstand she takes on the additional role of mentor to many new \nfemale Senators. I am thankful for that contribution which surely \nstrengthens our entire Senate.\n  The people of Maryland made a wise choice in reelecting this \nremarkable Senator. I look forward to celebrating her next milestone in \njust over 2 years when she will become the longest serving female \nMember in the history of Congress.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to recognize and congratulate my \ngood friend from Maryland, Senator Barbara Mikulski, on today becoming \nthe longest serving female Senator in the history of the Senate. This \nis an achievement that takes courage and passion and commitment, three \nthings all of us who know her so well know she has in abundance.\n  Even more important than honoring my friend on the length of her \nservice today, I believe it is important to recognize what she has done \nwith that service. The senior Senator from Maryland, over her 24 years, \nhas established herself as a trailblazer, a legislator, a leader, and, \nabove all, a fighter for her people and her State. But to me and to all \nthe other women Senators who have followed in her footsteps, she is \nsimply a mentor. She is the Senator who has offered us guidance, taught \nus to be fearless, and who has set a standard for all women Senators to \nfollow.\n  From the first time I ever spoke to Senator Mikulski, one thing was \nclear.\n\n[[Page S12]]\n\nShe didn't run for the Senate to be one woman Senator. She ran to be \none of many. I first came to the Senate in 1992, the so-called year of \nthe woman. I can remember a lot of the press that year being about how \nour incoming class of four women Senators would open the door to \nchanges in the culture of the Senate. But when I got here, I quickly \nrealized that door had not only already been opened, it had been broken \ndown by Senator Mikulski. She was the first female Democrat to serve on \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee, and she was also the very first \none to take all the new women Senators under her wing. Senator Mikulski \nrealized back then there was no rule book for women in the Senate. So \nshe took it upon herself to help guide the way. She drew on her own \nexperiences to make the transition for all of us easier. She organized \nseminars, taught us about working together, taught us about the \nlegislative process and the rules on the floor and the many more subtle \nrules off the floor. In short, she showed us the ropes, and she has \nbeen doing it ever since.\n  But her work doesn't end with helping women Senators get their foot \nin the door. I don't know if it is because she was a social worker \nbefore she came to Washington, but one thing Senator Mikulski knows is \nthat relationships matter. That is why she has worked to make sure that \nonce women Senators get here, we are working together on both sides of \nthe aisle. It is why she brings Republican and Democratic women \ntogether for dinners, so we can find common ground and help solve \nproblems. While Senator Mikulski knows it is important and courageous \nto be the first, she also understands the first ones have to be \nresponsible and successful so others can and will follow. It is because \nshe has done her job so well that other women have been able to follow \nin her footsteps, and she has done her job well.\n  Senator Mikulski is here today as the longest serving woman Senator \nnot by accident or by happenstance. She is here because she earned it, \nbecause the people of her State know she is an indispensable champion \nfor their causes, because she works across party lines, because she \ndelivers results and because, as she has said to us so many times, she \nis always ready to square her shoulders, put on her lipstick, and suit \nup for the people who need it most.\n  Whether it is leading the fight for the very first bill President \nObama signed into law that guarantees women cannot be paid less than \nmen for doing the same job or fighting for seniors who rely on Social \nSecurity or delivering investments for firefighters, police officers, \nand first responders or standing up for all those in Maryland who \ndepend on her State's environmental resources for their livelihood, \nthere are few others I want in my corner like her and there are few \nothers who work as hard as she does to give a voice to those who would \nnot otherwise have it.\n  Since Senator Mikulski was elected in 1986, she has helped guide the \nway for 22 more women Senators. Today there are 17. But she will also \nbe the first one to tell us we are not yet where we need to be, that \nmore women need to serve in this body. That is why she has built a team \nof women Senators behind her that continues to grow--every generation, \nevery election, every year.\n  Today, Senator Mikulski makes history by serving longer than any \nother woman. But I know many years from now women will have achieved a \nlarger, more representative role in this body than we now have, Senator \nMikulski will be at the very top of the list of people to thank, the \nperson who not only cut the path but who went back and guided so many \nof us down it. Thanks to her, one day the remarkable accomplishment we \nare celebrating today may no longer be such a remarkable thing for a \nwoman to achieve; it will be commonplace. That will be her true and \nlasting legacy.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I am honored to join my colleagues in \nhonoring my mentor and dear friend, Senator Barbara Mikulski, on \nbecoming the longest serving woman in the history of the Senate. For \nmore than 24 trailblazing years, Senator Mikulski has been one of the \nSenate's fiercest advocates for women, families, and for the people of \nMaryland who have now elected her to the Senate for five consecutive \nterms. Before she arrived in Washington in 1977 as the Representative \nfrom the Third District of Maryland, Senator Mikulski already had a \ndistinguished career in public service, working in Baltimore as a \nsocial worker, then a community activist, and as a city council member. \nWhen she was first sworn in as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, she was one of just 18 female Members. When she \nentered the Senate 10 years later as the first Democratic woman Senator \nelected in her own right, she was one of just two women in this upper \nChamber. But while those numbers have intimidated most, they only \nmotivated and emboldened Senator Mikulski. She soon impressed her \ncolleagues, as she continues to do today, with her work ethic, \ndetermination, keen understanding of issues, humor, and her commitment \nto her constituents.\n  She has broken many barriers in her career. She was the first woman \never elected statewide in Maryland, the first to chair an \nappropriations subcommittee, and the first woman to serve in the \nDemocratic leadership. If we are no longer surprised today when we see \nwomen in power in Washington, it is only because we had pioneers such \nas Barbara Mikulski. As she recently told CNN: ``I might be the first, \nbut I don't want to be the last.''\n  There are now 17 women serving in the Senate, and Senator Mikulski, \nthe dean of the women, is our leader and our champion. I was both \nhumbled and honored to have her escort me when I was sworn in as a \nSenator 2 years ago. That was just the beginning of her ongoing \nmentorship. Although the Senate can often be bogged down by \npartisanship, I appreciate that Senator Mikulski encourages and creates \nan environment of teamwork, respect, and friendship. But while we today \nmark her place in history as a woman Senator, she is widely regarded as \none of the most respected, accomplished, and effective public servants \nin all of Congress. To use Senator Mikulski's own words, she showed it \nis not about gender, it is about agenda.\n  She is one of the Senate's strongest advocates for science and \ntechnology and the importance of investing in innovation to spur our \neconomy. In fact, earlier this year, I was watching a 3D movie about \nthe Hubble telescope at the Smithsonian with my daughter, a scientist, \nand there was Senator Mikulski featured in the movie for her role in \npreserving the telescope's budget, a feat she calls one of her proudest \naccomplishments.\n  She also wrote the Spousal Anti-Impoverishment Act, which protects \nseniors across our country from going bankrupt while paying for a \nspouse's nursing home care.\n  She shepherded through the Lilly Ledbetter Act, which helps to ensure \nthat no matter your gender, your race, your national origin, religion, \nage, or disability, you will receive equal pay for equal work.\n  She fought tenaciously for her important amendment to health care \nreform legislation ensuring that a comprehensive list of women's \npreventive services, such as screenings for breast and cervical cancer, \nwould be covered with no added out-of-pocket expenses.\n  I thank Senator Mikulski for her mentorship, her leadership, and her \nfierce belief in the empowerment of women in our communities and in \npublic office. I congratulate her on this tremendous accomplishment, \nand I join my colleagues in looking forward to many more years of her \ndistinguished service.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about my dear \nfriend, dear colleague, someone I so admire--Senator Barbara Mikulski--\non her remarkable accomplishments. Today, she took the oath of office, \nthe Senator from Maryland, and made history as few others can make. \nSenator Mikulski has long been affectionately known here in the Senate \nas the dean of the women. Now she is officially the longest serving \nfemale Senator in the history of this great Nation.\n  This distinction adds to the considerable respect and admiration I \nalready have for Senator Mikulski and who she is and what she does. \nBarb, like me, came from a decidedly middle-class beginning. We often \ntalk about her dad, Willie, who owned a grocery store in east \nBaltimore, and my grandfather and dad--Jake and Abe--who were \nexterminators. They were similar because they were people of the \ncommunity. Barb would tell me that people\n\n[[Page S13]]\n\nwould come in during difficult times--they had lost their job--and \nWillie would say, pay me when you can. It wasn't quite the same with my \nfamily, but my grandfather and then father, like him, felt people who \nhad roaches or rats crawling through their little houses and \napartments, when they couldn't pay, shouldn't have that service cut off \nfor them.\n  So we were both infused with that great upwardly mobile, middle-\nclass, help your neighbor, be part of a neighborhood, be part of a \ncommunity feeling. Barb started her career as a social worker and made \na name for herself when she led the fight to stop a highway project \nfrom destroying a historic section of her community. That is what \nlaunched her into politics. Like our best politicians, she came from \nthe community. She didn't decide to be a politician, she came from the \ncommunity, took on a fight, and saw how she could make government a \nfriend to the people. So she went from the Baltimore City Council to \nthe House of Representatives, and then, of course, to this august \nChamber.\n  Throughout that time, she has never lost sight of from where she \ncame. She has fought tirelessly and effectively to protect Maryland's \nseniors, ensuring they have access to an affordable, healthy, and happy \nenvironment. She has been a leading advocate of medical research, \nsecuring billions in funding for cutting-edge research into things as \ndiverse as breast cancer and Alzheimer's. She has helped countless \nwomen and veterans get the health care they need, and the list goes on \nand on.\n  Let me say one other thing. As somebody who believes that we have to \nfocus on the middle class, talk to the middle class, and have middle-\nclass feelings and values infused in our bones, no other Senator does \nthat as well as Senator Mikulski because it is who she is and because--\nbeing the essentially humble and modest person she is--she has never \nlost sight of where she has come from.\n  So Senator Barb--as her constituents know her--you are beloved here \nas much as you are beloved in your home State of Maryland. Your sense \nof humor, your tenacity, your work ethic, your love of community, and \nyour mother's crab cake recipe are unrivaled.\n  It is an honor to serve alongside such an accomplished woman. Senator \nMikulski, congratulations again. You are a great Senator and a great \nfriend.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their very \nwarm words. Today, when I walked down the aisle, escorted by my \nesteemed partner, Ben Cardin, my former and beloved colleague, Senator \nPaul Sarbanes--when I walked down that aisle, I walked into the history \nbooks.\n  I never set out to do that and, for me, it is a great honor to join \nMargaret Chase Smith in the history books. As Senator Snowe has said, \nand also Senator Collins on a number of occasions, Margaret Chase Smith \nand I share many things in common. Today they wear the rose, but those \ntwo outstanding Senators from Maine also wear the values of Maine and \nthe values of Margaret Chase Smith: a strong belief in constituent \nservice, staying close to the people, focusing on jobs for the State, \nbeing a strong supporter of innovation, and a fearless, unrelenting \nstreak of independence. I hope I am like her. I know they bear that \nsame set of characteristics.\n  For me, it is not how long I serve but how well I serve. Service for \nme is about being connected, connected to my constituents, staying \nclose to them so they do not fall between the cracks, meeting their \nday-to-day needs and also looking at the long-range needs of the \nNation.\n  Nobody comes here by themselves. Later on today I will thank my \nfriends and supporters. But I want to thank the wonderful people who \nshaped me, the wonderful nuns who taught me, the school Sisters of \nNotre Dame and the Sisters of Mercy who taught me about leadership, who \ntaught me about service, who taught me about my faith in Matthew 5, the \nBeatitude that said hunger and thirst after justice.\n  But today as I stand here, I also think about my mother and father. I \nam filled with great emotion. I wish my mother and father were here \ntoday. They worked so hard for my sisters and I to have an education. \nBut though they are not here with me today in the Senate gallery, I \nknow they are in my heart. I want them to know they are with me when I \nfight for what we believed in.\n  My father ran a small grocery store. Everybody loved my father and \nmother. They were known for honesty and integrity. When my father \nopened the grocery store every morning, he would say: Good morning. Can \nI help you? And that is the kind of values I bring to the Senate.\n  Our family came from Poland. When my great-grandmother arrived in \nthis country she had little money in her pocket, but she had a big \ndream in her heart. That dream was the American dream where through \nhard work, hard work and dedication, you could make something of \nyourself. You could own a home, you could have a job, you could get an \neducation for your family. She did not even have the right to vote, and \nin this great country of ours, in three generations, I joined the \nSenate. She knew about hard work in terms of economic opportunity. She \ndid not think too much about the Constitution, but I do--particularly \nthat first amendment.\n  I got into politics fighting a highway. In other countries they put \ndissidents in jail. In the United States of America, because of the \nfirst amendment, they put you in the United States Senate. God bless \nAmerica.\n  When I came to the Senate, though I was all by myself, I said I was \nnever alone because of the wonderful way the men have treated me. The \nhistory of the women in the Senate is short--I might add, 4-foot-11 \nshort. But everything we have done we have been able to work on \ntogether.\n  I fought for seniors to try to pass, and passed, the Spousal \nImpoverishment Act to make sure the very cruel rules of our government \ndid not force people into bankruptcy when they had to turn to a nursing \nhome. I worked to pass the Lilly Ledbetter bill to give equal pay for \nequal work; our wonderful work on women's health, where we broke \nbarriers in terms of research. We know we have saved lives because of \nwhat we have done in research in our preventive health amendment, and \nfor young people in national service.\n  I have also fought for Maryland--whether it is cleaning up the bay or \nfighting for jobs in the Port of Baltimore, whether it is looking out \nfor the Goddard Space Agency or doubling the funding at the National \nInstitutes of Health. For me, again, it is all about service. I am \nfighting for a stronger economy and a safer America. For me it is not \nabout the past, it is about the future. Though I break one record \ntoday, I want to work with all of you on both sides of the aisle to \nbreak other records.\n  Let's break that high record of unemployment in our country. Let's \nbreak that record of low graduation rates in our high schools. Let's \nbreak the record of the longest war in American history and bring our \ntroops home as safely as we can. I want to build a strong economy.\n  I am going to work to build a strong economy, an innovation economy \nso we are able to move ahead. Today when I took my oath, I pledged that \nI want to help America be great again with a renewed self-confidence \nand achievement. I want us to be a global leader in this innovation \neconomy. I want to help America be excellent again so we not only win \nNobel Prizes--and I want us to win lots of them--but win international \nmarkets and win lots of them. I want to promote a sense of community \nwhere we look out for each other and for our community and where the \npeople of the United States know they have a government on their side.\n  I will close with a quote from George Bernard Shaw.\n\n       I am convinced that my life belongs to the whole community; \n     and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it \n     whatever I can, for the harder I work, the more I live.\n       I rejoice in life for its own sake. Life is no brief candle \n     to me. It is a sort of splendid torch which I got hold of for \n     a moment, and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible \n     before turning it over to future generations.\n\n  Someday in the future, someone else will break this record. Let's \nwork together to break those other records.\n  Thanks for everything. God bless America.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority leader.\n\n[[Page S14]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/05/senate-section/article/S14-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n       ELECTING GARY B.

One of the issues we must reform is the confirmation \nprocess in the Senate. I have heard from a number of Senators on both \nsides of the aisle who think we should address this.\n  Clearly, all Presidents are entitled to choose well-qualified \nindividuals to\n\n[[Page S15]]\n\nserve in their administration. In the vast majority of instances, the \nindividuals nominated by the President are not controversial, but many \nhave faced delays before assuming their positions. These delays mean \ncritical decisionmakers are not in place. And, the delays make it \nharder to find qualified people--many great nominees simply cannot wait \naround for months as the stress and uncertainty affects their families \nand careers. We need to do better in the 112th Congress. According to \nthe Congressional Research Service, the Senate has a constitutional \nduty to exercise ``advice and consent'' on more than 1,215 executive \nbranch nominees. That is a large number. Is my friend from Kentucky \naware of that the Senate confirms more than 1,215 executive branch \nnominees?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am aware that the number of presidential appointees \nhas grown substantially. According to the bipartisan Commission on \nPublic Service report from 2003, President Kennedy took office in 1960 \nwith only 286 positions to fill by Presidential appointment. Many of \nthose required Senate confirmation. About 40 years later, President \nGeorge W. Bush faced a total of 3,361 Presidential appointment slots to \nfill. I am sure the current President faced a similar number of \nappointments.\n  Mr. REID. I remember the Public Service Commission well and its \nChairman Paul Volcker. We may need a new working group in the Senate to \nexamine the confirmation process and ways to improve, streamline, and \nin some cases perhaps eliminate the confirmation process for lower \nlevel nominees. I would like to propose a new working group on \nexecutive nominations headed by Chairman Schumer and Ranking Member \nAlexander of the Rules Committee. We will develop the details of this \neffort in the coming weeks, but I think a Senate level working group is \na good place to start. And I would also recommend that Senators Schumer \nand Alexander work on this effort in conjunction with Senators \nLieberman and Collins. The Homeland Security and Government Affairs \nCommittee has held hearings on the confirmation process in the past, \nand Senators Lieberman and Collins have been engaged in this issue for \nsome time. They can bring a valuable perspective here.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I agree the Senate should establish a working group to \nexamine this issue. Surely, Senators Lieberman and Collins have \nbipartisan respect and should be a part of any such group on executive \nnominations. Senators Alexander and Schumer are good choices to \nspearhead this effort. I look forward to working with the majority \nleader and my colleagues in the coming weeks as we finalize this \nproposal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/05/senate-section/article/S15-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       FIRST DAY FOR INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, happy new year to you. And happy new year to \nall my colleagues, those returning to the Senate and those taking \noffice today for the first time.\n  I am honored, humbled, and will forever be grateful that the people \nof Nevada have entrusted me with another term as a Senator. I will \ncontinue working hard to create jobs for the people of my State and our \ncountry and get our country back on track. I am also grateful for the \ncontinued support and confidence of my caucus, which has given me the \nhonor of serving as its leader. Neither title--Senator nor majority \nleader--is a responsibility I take lightly or for granted.\n  They say you can never step in the same river twice; new water flows \nin replacing the old and continually renewing the river. The Senate is \nthe same. This body never stops changing. Every 2 years--occasionally \nmore frequently--new Senators take their seats in this Chamber. They \njoin the Senate family in this ever-evolving team of 100 tasked with \nmoving the country forward. Our fundamental responsibilities and \ntraditions anchor us in that river. Our respect and reverence for the \npeople we serve and this institution never wavers or changes.\n  According to academics, pundits, and Congress watchers, the 111th \nCongress was the most productive in American history. But many \nchallenges and opportunities still lie ahead for this new Congress that \nstarts today. We have to do even more to help middle-class families, to \ncreate jobs, to hasten our energy independence, to improve our \nchildren's education, and to fix our broken immigration system. We also \nhave to make sure the Senate can operate in a way that allows the \npeople's elected legislators to legislate.\n  We will soon debate some reforms to Senate procedure, reforms \nproposed not for the sake of change itself or for partisan gain but \nbecause the current system has been abused and abused gratuitously. The \nfilibuster in particular has been abused and in truly unprecedented \nfashion. There are strong passions on both sides of this debate on this \nissue. There are nearly as many opinions about what to do about these \nabuses as there are Senators. But let's start the conversation with \nsome facts.\n  There were about as many filibusters in the last two Congresses as \nthere were in the first six and a half decades the cloture rules \nexisted. There were nearly as many filibusters in just the last 2 years \nas there were in the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, and half of the \n1970s, all combined. In the entire 19th century, the Senate saw fewer \nthan 12 filibusters. Now we see that many in a single month. Many of \nthese recent filibusters were terribly unproductive. Many of them \nprevented us from even holding debate on a bill, let alone an up-or-\ndown vote. After we wasted hour after hour, day after day, sometimes \nweeks, many of those bills passed and\n\n[[Page S16]]\n\nmany of those nominations were confirmed overwhelmingly and sometimes \nunanimously.\n  I have been forced to use my right as majority leader to fill what we \ncall the amendment tree more than I would have liked to, but it has \nbeen for a simple reason. Rather than offer amendments to improve \nlegislation or compromise for the greater good, as Members of this body \nhave done for generations, the current minority has offered amendments \nsimply to waste time, delay us from proceeding to a bill or for scoring \npolitical points. The American people love government, but they don't \nlike too much politics in government.\n  Finally, these rules are central to the Senate, but they are not \nsacrosanct. Senate procedures and rules have changed since the Senate \nwas founded at the beginning of this country when necessary and after \nserious consideration. Those decisions have never been made without \ngreat deliberation, and no future change should be made any \ndifferently.\n  The recent abuses we have seen have hurt the Senate and hurt our \ncountry. They have hurt our economic recovery, and they hurt middle-\nclass families. They hurt the institutions that lead and shape America \nbecause they keep public servants and judges from these posts for no \nreason other than partisanship. Even Chief Justice Roberts criticized \nthe Senate a few days ago for how few judges we confirmed and how \nslowly we do even the few we confirm. His criticism and concern are \nwell founded. I hope all my colleagues consider the Chief Justice's \nwarning and what it means for the pursuit of justice.\n  Here is the bottom line: We may not agree yet on how to fix the \nproblem, but no one can credibly claim problems don't exist. No one who \nhas watched this body operate since the current minority took office \ncan say it functions just fine. That wouldn't be true. It would be \ndishonest. No one can deny that the filibuster has been used for purely \npolitical reasons, reasons far beyond those for which this protection \nwas invented and intended.\n  I say through the Chair to my distinguished Republican counterpart, \nmy friend, Senator McConnell, in the coming days, let's come together \nto find a solution. That is why we are here. I say to the 16 new \nSenators, we need to do some things to correct some of the things that \nhave taken place. The Senate must solve problems, not create them. I am \ngoing to work to the best of my ability with my friend, the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, to work this out, to work out a compromise.\n  The last time Congress convened without Senator Robert Byrd as a \nMember, Harry Truman was President of the United States and 42 of our \n100 Senators had not even been born. No one knew the Constitution \nbetter than Robert Byrd, and no one revered it more. He taught many of \nus many things. Among them, he taught me to carry the Constitution with \nme every day.\n  I do that, Mr. President. I always have this copy of our founding \ndocument in my pocket, signed by Senator Byrd, one of the most fervent \ndefenders of the Constitution. He has given me two of them. The first \none wore out, but I have it in my desk in Searchlight. I have such \nfondness looking at what Senator Byrd wrote in it. As we all know, in \nhis later years he had a benign tremor, and he shook a little bit when \nhe wrote. But he wrote this, and I will always, always remember Senator \nByrd, that fervent defender of this Constitution.\n  He loved the Constitution. This coal miner's son loved the \nConstitution. Just like everyone in America, whether you are a coal \nminer's son or an academic's son, we all should love this Constitution, \nnot just because of what is written in it but how those words were \nwritten and how it all came together.\n  Senator Byrd knew our Constitution was created through compromise. At \na moment of particular partisan strife, 15 years ago Senator Byrd came \nto this floor and said the following:\n\n       I hope that we will all take a look at ourselves on both \n     sides of this aisle and understand also that we must work \n     together in harmony and with mutual respect for one another. \n     This very charter of government--\n\n  Talking about the Constitution--\n\n     under which we live was created in a spirit of compromise and \n     mutual concession. And it is only in that spirit that a \n     continuance of this charter of government can be prolonged \n     and sustained.\n\n  That is what he said.\n  Our friends in the House have decided to begin their daily business \nby reading the Constitution. In these first few minutes of the new \nSenate session, I think we should reflect on Senator Byrd's wise \nreminder of this Constitution's history. Like the Constitution, the \nagreement that established two separate and different Houses in the \nlegislative branch was itself a compromise.\n  Mr. President, it is written to be the Great Compromise that allowed \nus to have a Constitution. As much as ever before, our two branches \nneed to find common ground if we are going to be productive for the \npeople we serve and serve together.\n  In that same speech a decade and a half ago, Senator Byrd reminded us \nthat ``the welfare of the country is more dear than the mere victory of \n[a political] party.'' I think we would do well to heed those words as \nwe debate and decide how to best serve the Nation and its people in \nthis new year.\n  Senators come and go. Majorities and minorities rotate like a rolling \nwheel, and records of service are written and rewritten. The only \nconstant in this great democracy is change--a change we never \nanticipate. Sometimes we do, but most often we do not. Sixteen Senators \nwho were here just a few days ago have moved on, and 16 new ones now \ntake their seats. Laws that govern this Nation and the rules that \ngovern this body continually evolve carefully and by necessity.\n  But the most important change we can make in the 112th Congress is to \nwork better and more closely as teammates, not as opponents; as \npartners, not as partisans; to fulfill our constitutional \nresponsibility to pursue a more perfect union, establish justice, \nensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote \nthe general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves \nand our posterity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/05/senate-section/article/S16-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S16]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico).

Mr. President, first, I would like to take a moment to \nwelcome back all of my colleagues and particularly the 13 new \nRepublican Senators whom we officially swore in just a few moments ago.\n  Americans are looking for creative, principled leaders. I am \nconfident this impressive class of new Republicans will not disappoint.\n  I would also like to welcome my good friend, the majority leader. At \na time when some people think the two parties in Washington cannot even \nagree on the weather, I will note that Senator Reid and I get along \njust fine. I expect it will stay that way, and I look forward to \nworking with him again throughout this Congress.\n  The biggest changes today are, of course, happening across the dome, \nand I would like to welcome the many new Republican Members of Congress \nwho have come to Washington to change the way things are done around \nhere. In this, they will be led by a very talented and determined \nOhioan, whom I now have the great honor of referring to as Speaker \nBoehner. I congratulate Speaker Boehner and the new Republican majority \nin the House, and I wish them great success in achieving the kinds of \nreforms and policies the last election was all about.\n  Americans want lawmakers to cut Washington spending, tackle the debt, \nrein in the government, and to help create the right conditions for \nprivate sector job growth. They also want us to reform the way laws are \nmade. They are looking to Republicans to provide an alternative to the \nkind of lawmaking we have seen too much of around here in the past few \nyears--a vision that disregards the views of the public in favor of an \nelite few, a vision that tells people they can look at legislation \nafter it is passed, that Washington knows best. In short, Americans are \nlooking for an entirely different approach.\n\n[[Page S17]]\n\n  The new Republican majority in the House has shown every sign that \nthey have heard the public on all of this, and Senate Republicans join \nthem in their efforts, conscious of the limitations and the \nopportunities that our minority status and the President's veto pen \ninvolve. We will press the majority to do the things the American \npeople clearly want us to do, and we will insist in every possible way \nthat the voices of our constituents are heard, realizing at the same \ntime that the best solutions are forged through consensus not through \nconfrontation.\n  Fortunately, the Senate was designed as a place where consensus could \nand would be reached. Look through modern history. The Social Security \nAct of 1935 was approved by all but six Members of the Senate. The \nMedicare and Medicaid Acts of 1965 were approved by all but 21. And all \nbut eight Senators voted for the Americans with Disabilities Act 21 \nyears ago this year.\n  The lesson is clear: Americans believe on issues of this importance, \none party should not be allowed to force its will on anyone else. \nThanks to the Senate, it rarely has.\n  That is why a recent proposal to change the Senate's rules by some on \nthe other side is such a bad idea. For 2 years, Americans have been \ntelling us they are tired of being shut out of the legislative process. \nThey want to be heard. The response they are now getting from some on \nthe other side instead is a proposal to change the Senate rules so they \ncan continue to do exactly what they want with fewer Members than \nbefore. Instead of changing their behavior in response to the last \nelection, they want to change the rules.\n\n  Well, I would suggest this is precisely the kind of approach a \nsupermajority standard is meant to prevent. It exists--it exists--to \npreserve the Senate's role as the one place where the voices of all of \nthe people will, in the end, be heard. As a result, it has helped \nensure that most major agreements enjoy the broad support of the public \nand the stability that comes with it.\n  Regrettably, the current majority has too often lost sight of this \nimportant truth. Since assuming control of the Senate in 2007, it has \nsought to erode the traditional rights of the minority, and, by \nextension, the rights of our constituents. The nonpartisan \nCongressional Research Service has looked into the way the current \nmajority has run the Senate. Its conclusions are revealing.\n  Here are just a few: The current majority has denied the minority the \nright to amend legislation a record 44 times or more often than the \nlast six majorities combined. It has moved to shut down debate the same \nday measures are considered nearly three times more often, on average, \nthan the previous six majorities. And its unprecedented denial of the \nrights of the minority to debate and amend on the floor is compounded \nby its practice of regularly bypassing Senate committees. All too often \nthe majority has chosen to write bills behind closed doors, depriving \nAmericans of yet another opportunity to have a say in the legislative \nprocess. The current majority has set the record here as well, \nbypassing committees 43 times or double the previous average.\n  Now, the goal of all of this, of course, is to pass the most partisan \nlegislation possible while at the same time avoiding difficult votes. \nTo listen to the leaders of the Democratic Party over the past several \nmonths, they have had some success at it. The President, the former \nSpeaker, and the majority leader have all described the past Congress \nas the most successful in memory. Yet the most vocal elements of their \nparty remain frustrated. They say the Senate is broken, even though the \nsame people are describing it as the most successful in memory.\n  Why? Their primary complaints appear to be these: The stimulus \npassed, but it was not big enough; the health care bill passed, but it \ndid not include the government plan; the Senate extended unemployment \nbenefits and cut payroll taxes but was blocked from raising taxes on \nsmall business owners in the process.\n  In other words, the majority may have been able to achieve most of \nwhat it wanted, but because it did not achieve everything it wanted \nsome are not happy. They are not happy that those Americans who have a \ndifferent view of things actually had a say in how some of the \nlegislation they have passed over the past 2 years turned out.\n  The impulse to change the rules is, in some ways, understandable. No \none likes to take difficult votes, but that is nothing new. As the \nmajority whip often says: ``If you don't like fighting fires, then \ndon't become a fireman.'' If you don't like casting votes, don't come \nto the Senate.\n  Some have also suggested that one's view of the filibuster depends on \nwhere one sits. It is true that when I was in the majority, I opposed \nfilibustering judicial nominees. But I opposed doing so when I was in \nthe minority as well. I opposed doing so regardless of who was in the \nWhite House. In short, I was against expanding the use of the \nfilibuster into an area in which it traditionally had not been used, \nperiod.\n  One can agree with that view or not, but it is one thing to disagree \nwith expanding the use of the filibuster into nontraditional areas, \nregardless of who is President and who is in the minority, it is \nanother thing altogether to be in favor of expanding it when one is in \nthe minority, and then turn around and urge its elimination when one is \nin the majority.\n  When it comes to preserving the right to extended debate on \nlegislation, Republicans have been entirely consistent. What is being \nconsidered is unprecedented. No Senate majority has ever--I am going to \nsay this twice--no Senate majority has ever changed the rules except by \nfollowing those rules; that is, with the participation and the \nagreement of the minority.\n  I am going to say it one more time. No Senate majority has ever \nchanged the rules except by following those rules; that is, with the \nparticipation and the agreement of the minority. But it also promises \nto frustrate those who would approve it.\n  First, it is stating the obvious, that anything that passes in the \nSenate with a narrower majority than 60 is going nowhere--absolutely \nnowhere--in the newly Republican House. So any short-term gain ends \nhalfway across the dome. Second, a change in the rules aimed at \nbenefitting the Democrats today could just as easily be used to benefit \nRepublicans tomorrow. Do our friends across the aisle want to create a \nsituation where 2 or 4 or 6 years from now they suddenly find \nthemselves completely powerless to prevent Republicans from overturning \nlegislation they themselves have worked so hard to enact, particularly \nover the last 2 years?\n  But the larger point is this: The Founders crafted the Senate to be \ndifferent. They crafted it to be a deliberate, thoughtful place. \nChanging the rules in the way that has been proposed would unalterably \nchange the Senate itself. It will no longer be the place where the \nwhole country is heard and has the ability to have its say, a place \nthat encourages consensus and broad agreement. In short, it would make \nthis place even less like the place Americans want it to be.\n  So it is my hope that our friends on the other side will put aside \ntheir plans, respect the rules of the Senate and, more importantly, the \nvoice of the people those rules are meant to protect. Then we can get \nabout the business the people sent us here to do.\n  Today is a day to renew our purpose and our commitment to \nbipartisanship, not to double down on a partisan approach that has too \noften marred lawmaking in Washington over the past 2 years. It is a day \nto look ahead to what we can achieve together, prompted by the urgings \nof an electorate that has made its views very clear, and united by a \nlove for this institution and this Nation. The problems we face are \nenormous--once-in-a-generation challenges that will require vision, \nhard work, and a commitment to work together to reach consensus, and \nthe Senate is the place for that. At its best, it is a workshop where \nthe Nation's most difficult challenges are faced squarely and addressed \nwith civility and goodwill. At a time like our own, when 1 in 10 \nworking Americans is looking for a job and can't find one, when the \nnational debt threatens the American dream itself, when the solvency of \nthe social safety net is threatened, we must come together. We must \nfind a way to forget the petty skirmishes of the past and forge a new, \nmore hopeful path. We must be motivated by a determination to seek \nsolutions, not mere partisan advantage.\n\n[[Page S18]]\n\n  Americans are looking for Republicans to address the problems we \nface, but Republicans cannot solve them alone. The problems are too \nbig, too demanding for one party, and we will never succeed in solving \nthem if we retreat to our corners until another election comes around. \nIf our predecessors had done that, they would have never solved \nanything at all, and this institution would have lost its relevance a \nlong time ago. But they didn't, and neither can we.\n  The men who established this place have left us the right tools for \nthe job. It is my hope that in the weeks and months ahead, we will use \nthem to renew the promise that inspired them and that continues to \ninspire Americans even in difficult times. That promise is the American \ndream. It is what unites everyone in this Chamber. Preserving it must \nbe our common task.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to make some remarks regarding my \ndear friend and seatmate on the Appropriations Committee and a member \nof my Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.\n  I join with the entire Senate family in saluting my good friend, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Maryland, on becoming the longest \nserving woman in the history of the Senate. This is truly a remarkable \nmilestone.\n  I note that Cal Ripken, the former star of Senator Mikulski's \nhometown Baltimore Orioles, became known as the ``Iron Man'' for going \n16 consecutive years without missing a game. Now perhaps Senator \nMikulski has earned the title of ``Iron Woman'' for going 24 \nconsecutive years in this body without ever deviating from her role as \na fierce advocate for Marylanders and for working people across our \ncountry.\n  I hasten to add that the measure of a Senator is not how many years \nhe or she serves in the body but what he or she accomplishes during \nthose years. That is where Senator Mikulski has truly distinguished \nherself over the last quarter of a century.\n  I especially salute her activism and leadership on the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions, formerly chaired, of course, by \nSenator Kennedy and which I am now privileged to chair. She has been a \nleading champion of Pell grants and for expanding access to higher \neducation for students of modest means. Of course, as has been stated, \nshe has been the Senate's leading voice on women's health issues, \nfighting to ensure women are included in clinical trials and medical \nresearch at the National Institutes of Health, and securing access to \nbreast and cervical cancer screenings for women without health \ninsurance.\n  Senator Mikulski took the lead in writing the sections of the new \nhealth reform law that focus on improving the quality of care. At every \nturn in the drafting of that historic legislation, she fought to ensure \nthat the unique health needs of women were fully recognized and \naccommodated.\n  As chair of the Subcommittee on Retirement and Aging, Senator \nMikulski has been an outspoken advocate for seniors, focusing \nespecially on combating elder abuse and neglect. I know she is \nespecially proud of authoring the Spousal Anti-Impoverishment Act, \nwhich keeps seniors from going bankrupt while paying for a spouse's \nnursing home care. I might also add, no one has been a more fierce \nsupporter and defender of the right for people to have an attorney \nthrough the legal aid system in America. She has fought very hard to \nmake sure we strengthened the National Legal Services Corporation and \nto make sure it receives adequate funding so people who have no money \naren't barred from the courthouse door.\n  We admire the work of Barbara Mikulski not as a female Senator per se \nbut as one of 100 Senators. On this day we also recognize that she was \nthe first woman elected to the Senate whose husband or father did not \nserve in high office. We salute her as the proud dean among Senate \nwomen who has gone to extraordinary lengths for so many years to mentor \nand guide newly elected women Senators of both parties.\n  I join my colleagues in congratulating Senator Mikulski as our \nlongest serving female Senator and wishing her many more years of \naccomplishment and service in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to those \nof my colleagues as we commemorate an extraordinary milestone for a \nremarkable woman. Today, Senator Barbara Mikulski becomes the longest \nserving woman Senator.\n  For anyone who has had the privilege of working with or for Senator \nMikulski, this milestone comes as no surprise. She is a devoted public \nservant and a dogged advocate for her constituents. She has spent the \nvast majority of her life in public service as a social worker, as a \nmember of the Baltimore City Council, then as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, and finally as a Senator. With each step, her \nconstituency got larger and she worked even harder to fight for the \npeople of Maryland.\n  Senator Mikulski is no stranger to celebrating firsts or milestones. \nShe was the first Democratic woman to be elected to the Senate in her \nown right without succeeding a spouse or a father. She was also the \nfirst woman to serve on the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  It is also worth reflecting on how far we have come in the 24 years \nsince Senator Mikulski was first elected. She was one of only two women \nin the Senate in 1987. In the next Senate, as in the last Senate, we \nare now up to 17 female Senators, meaning that they can no longer call \nus ``Sweet 16.''\n  As the dean of women Senators, Senator Mikulski has always been ready \nto help women who are thinking about running for the Senate and then \nhelp newly arrived women Senators when they get here. Her wise counsel \nis absolutely invaluable. Senator Mikulski has always reached across \nthe aisle to bring women Senators together. As she puts it: ``Women in \nthe Senate understand issues not just on the macro level, but on the \nmacaroni and cheese level.''\n  Two years ago around this time, I went to the Senate floor with \nseveral of my women colleagues to speak about the importance of passing \nthe Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. Senator Mikulski had championed the \nbill for years. I remember Senator Mikulski bringing us all together \nand I will always remember her words. She would say:\n\n       To the women of America: Suit up, square your shoulders, \n     put your lipstick on. We're ready for a revolution.\n\n  Senator Mikulski has always been a master of words and quips. She did \nit again, and we passed that bill.\n  On that issue, as on so many others, the cause that Senator Mikulski \nchampioned was victorious due in large part to her tremendous work \nethic and her devoted advocacy.\n  Senator Mikulski, today we salute you for suiting up and squaring \nyour shoulders for 24 years and counting, and we look forward to so \nmany more.\n\n[[Page S19]]\n\n  I see my great colleague Senator Stabenow from the State of Michigan \nis here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I am so pleased to be here today. I \nappreciate the words of the great Senator from Minnesota. I am very \npleased to rise with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pay \ntribute to somebody who is much more than a colleague--someone who is \nalso a mentor and a great friend, the Senator from Maryland, Barbara \nMikulski.\n  Today, as we all know, she became the longest serving woman Member of \nthe Senate in the history of our Nation. I have a 3-year-old \ngranddaughter Lilly who will be able to read now in the history books \nabout not only her grandmother but the woman who holds this record, \nSenator Barbara Mikulski, and all she has done and all she means to \neach of us, particularly as a role model for my granddaughter and other \nyoung children, other young women who will be coming after all of us.\n  She is here today because she is bold and fearless and determined, as \nwe all know. In 1986, when she first ran for the Senate, she looked for \ninspiration from her own great-grandmother who came to the United \nStates from Poland with no money and no job. But her great-grandmother \nknew the importance of hard work and she built a life for her family \nhere, a new beginning, and in so doing opened the door for future \ngenerations. I know today she is looking down from a special place with \ntremendous pride.\n  When Senator Mikulski won that election, becoming the first \nDemocratic woman to win a Senate seat in her own right, she carried on \nher great-grandmother's legacy--opening doors for future generations of \nwomen to follow in her footsteps. Thanks to that, there are more women \nserving in the Senate today than have ever served in the entire history \nof our great country. When Senator Mikulski was elected in 1986, from \nthe moment she arrived in this august body, she has been a tireless \nchampion of working families in Maryland and across the country. I am \nproud to have partnered with her on so many important efforts to make \nsure we are building things in America again and supporting the people \nwho have built the great middle class of this country by their hard \nwork.\n  She grew up working in her parents' grocery store and understands the \nstruggles of working families who want nothing more than to create a \nbetter life for their children and their grandchildren.\n  She got her start in politics fighting to save the Fells Point \nneighborhood in Baltimore, stopping a proposed highway that would have \ndivided a neighborhood and destroyed that community. Today, because of \nSenator Mikulski, Fells Point is a thriving residential and commercial \ncommunity. She has continued from that day, every day, fighting for \nneighborhoods and families and standing for the men and women who work \nhard every day to make a better life for themselves and their families.\n  When Barbara first arrived in the Senate, she was one of only two \nwomen Senators, as we know. Before then, women were appointed to the \nworst committees, were locked out of the ``old boys' club'' and didn't \nhave much of a voice. But she changed all that.\n  She got appointed to the powerful Appropriations Committee--the first \nDemocratic woman to do so, giving the women of America a voice, for the \nfirst time, on how we set our priorities for the investments of our \ncountry. More importantly, she learned how to build coalitions, to work \nwith colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and get things done for the \npeople who sent her here to work for them.\n  Today, as dean of the women Senators, Barbara continues that \nleadership. Thanks to her, the women of the Senate get together--both \nDemocrats and Republicans--for fellowship and friendship on a regular \nbasis. Now, following in her footsteps, there are woman Members on \nevery single committee in the Senate. That is important to the \noperation of our country's business.\n  Her example shows us all the importance of hard work, determination, \nand courage.\n  I congratulate my friend, Senator Barbara Mikulski, today on her \ngreat accomplishment and, most importantly, on a distinguished record \nof public service on behalf of the people of Maryland and our country. \nI thank her for all she has done for me personally and for all the \nother women in the Senate--the ones who have already followed in her \nfootsteps and the many who are still to come.\n  This is an exciting day for the history books--as some of us like to \nsay, it is another step in ``herstory''--Barbara's story--which is a \nspecial one for our country.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Under the unanimous \nconsent agreement, there was a period of 30 minutes for tributes to \nSenator Mikulski. Is there any of that time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has been consumed.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I am not mistaken, under the unanimous consent \nagreement, I was deemed to have 45 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/05/senate-section/article/S19-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19-S33]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FILIBUSTER RULE\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have a resolution for myself, Senator \nDurbin, Senator Mikulski, and Senator Shaheen, which I send to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 8) amending the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate to provide for cloture to be invoked with less than \n     three-fifths majority after additional debate.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I had a good discussion with the \nSenator from Iowa. This is a longstanding proposal of his. He has \nthoughtfully considered it. Even though I admire him, I do not admire \nthe proposal.\n  What we would like to do is let the Senator from Iowa make his \nproposal. I will listen, and when he has made the proposal, I will ask \nhim to yield me a few minutes and we may have a little discussion back \nand forth on the merits of the proposal. With that in mind, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection having been heard, the resolution \nwill go over under the rules.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am sorry my good friend from Tennessee \nhad to object, but I understand. We are going to engage for some time \nnow on the Senate floor in a discussion on the filibuster, something \nthat has been around a long time but which, in the last several years, \nfew years--I would not say ``several''--in the last 20, 30 years, has \ngotten to the point where it has paralyzed the Senate and has paralyzed \nthe country.\n  I intend to make some remarks for a while. I appreciate my friend \nfrom Tennessee and also my friend from Kansas who is here. I hope we \ncan engage in a nice colloquy and a discussion about this in a back-\nand-forth way. I look forward to doing that. I do wish to take some \ntime to at least lay out my case, as I did 15 years ago--I am sorry, 16 \nyears ago. On January 4, 1995, I submitted this same resolution. I was \na member of the minority party in the Senate for the first time in 8 \nyears. When I first came to the Senate, the Republicans were in charge \nand then the Democrats got in charge and then the Republicans got in \ncharge and then the Democrats got in charge and then the Republicans \ngot in charge and then the Democrats got in charge. Since I have been \nhere, since 1985, five times the Senate has changed hands.\n  I note that at the beginning of that Congress in 1995, the \nRepublicans outnumbered Democrats 53 to 47, the same majority-minority \nratio that exists today, just on the other side. Even though I was \nopposed to the then-majority party's agenda, I submitted the\n\n[[Page S20]]\n\nsame basic resolution to change the Senate rules regarding the \nfilibuster.\n  My plan would have ensured ample debate and deliberation. The stated \npurpose of a filibuster is to have debate and deliberation. But it \nwould also have allowed a bill or nominee to receive a ``yes'' or \n``no'' vote. Unfortunately, my proposal did not pass. It received 19 \nvotes. My cosponsors were Senator Lieberman, Senator Pell, and Senator \nRobb of Virginia.\n  I submitted my bill--and if you care to go back and read that debate, \nit is the January 4, 1995, Congressional Record in the Senate. I saw an \nescalating arms race, where each side ratcheted up the use of the \nfilibuster. That is what I called it then.\n  Sadly, in the intervening years, my prediction has been fulfilled. \nThe sad reality is that today, because of the indiscriminate use of the \nfilibuster, the ability of our government to legislate and to address \nproblems is severely jeopardized. Sixteen years after I first submitted \nmy proposal, it is even more apparent that for our government to \nproperly function, we must reform and curb the use of the filibuster.\n  The filibuster was once an extraordinary tool used in the rarest of \ncircumstances. When many people think of the filibuster, many times it \nbrings to mind the classic film of ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.'' It \nis ironic that in 1939, the year Frank Capra filmed ``Mr. Smith,'' \nthere were zero filibusters in the Senate. From 1917 across the entire \n19th century--for 100 years--there were 23 filibusters in 100 years. \nIndeed, through 1879, there were only four. From 1917, when the Senate \nfirst adopted rules to end the filibuster, until 1969, there were fewer \nthan 50--less than 1 filibuster a year. Unfortunately, since then, the \nnumber has skyrocketed.\n  The current concerns I raise are not new. The problem has become far \nmore serious. In 1982, my good friend and colleague, Senator Dale \nBumpers of Arkansas, said this about the filibuster: ``Unless we \nrecognize that things are out of control and procedures have to be \nchanged, we'll never be an effective legislative body again.'' That was \n1982.\n  During the 2 years of that Congress, there were 31 filibusters as \nmeasured by the number of cloture motions filed. In 1985, former \nSenator Thomas Eagleton of Missouri remarked:\n\n       The Senate is now in the state of incipient anarchy. The \n     filibuster, once used, by and large, as an occasional \n     exercise in civil rights matters, has now become a routine \n     frolic in almost all matters. Whereas our rules were devised \n     to guarantee full and free debate, they now guarantee \n     unbridled chaos.\n\n  That was 1985, my first year here. But during that Congress there \nwere 40 filibusters.\n  Again, I wish to refer to the number of filibusters as a visual aid \nto see what has happened.\n  As we go back to 88th, 89th, 90th, and on up, we can see the number \nof filibusters escalating from less than 10 a year--4 or 5--up to \nalmost 140, 139. In 1994, former Republican Senator Charles Mathias of \nMaryland said:\n\n       Today, filibusters are far less visible but far more \n     frequent. The filibuster has become an epidemic,--\n\n  An epidemic. That is former Republican Senator Charles Mathias--\n\n     used whenever a coalition can find 41 votes to oppose \n     legislation. The distinction between voting against \n     legislation and blocking a vote between opposing and \n     obstructing has nearly disappeared.\n\n  That was Senator Mathias of Maryland.\n  During that Congress, again right before I first submitted \nlegislation to modify the filibuster, there were 80 filibusters that \nyear. If I may quote myself, 1 year after Senator Mathias made his \nstatement about the filibuster, this is what I said in 1995:\n\n       It is used, Mr. President, as blackmail, for one Senator to \n     get his or her way on something they could not rightfully win \n     through the normal process. I am not accusing any one party \n     of this. It happens on both sides of the aisle.\n\n  I said that in 1995. Quoting myself from the Record:\n\n       Mr. President, I believe each Senator needs to give up a \n     little of our pride, a little of our prerogatives, and a \n     little of our power for the good of this Senate and the good \n     of this country. I think the voters of this country were \n     turned off by the constant bickering, the arguing back and \n     forth that goes on in this Senate Chamber, the gridlock that \n     ensued here, the pointing of fingers of blame. Sometimes in \n     the fog of debate, like the fog of war, it is hard to \n     determine who is responsible for slowing something down. It \n     is like shifting sand. People hide behind the filibuster. I \n     think it is time to let the voters know that we have heard \n     their message in the last election.\n\n  I said this in 1995.\n  They did not send us here to bicker and to argue and to point \nfingers. They want us to get things done to address the concerns facing \nthis country. They want us to reform this place. They want this place \nto operate a little better, a little more openly, and a little more \ndecisively.\n  I said that when the Republicans were in charge.\n  With all those filibusters, it was not until the 110th and 111th \nCongress that the true scope of the filibuster abuse would truly be \nrealized. In the 110th Congress, there were an astonishing 139 motions \nto end filibusters. In the 111th, there were 136--275 filibusters in \njust 4 years.\n  The fact is, in successive Congresses, Democrats and Republicans have \nmade the filibuster an everyday weapon of obstruction, not as a way to \nensure debate and deliberation but as a way of obstruction. I say both \nsides have done it. I said that in 1995. I predicted an escalating arms \nrace. I said: If we do not do something about it, it is going to get \nworse--and, unfortunately, it has.\n  On almost a daily basis, one Senator is able to use just the threat \nof a filibuster to stop bills from coming to the floor for debate and \namendment. In the past Congress, we started seeing the minority \nfilibuster bills they did not even object to solely in order to slow \ndown unrelated measures they did oppose. The result is a legislative \nprocess that is simply overwhelmed, squeezing out the ability to do \nimportant, relatively noncontroversial legislation.\n  It is no accident that Norm Ornstein, the esteemed congressional \nscholar, wrote an article, titled ``Our Broken Senate,'' in which he \nwrote that ``the expanded use of formal rules on Capitol Hill is \nunprecedented and is bringing the government to its knees.''\n  Just the other day, I received a petition signed by nearly 300 top \nhistorians, legal scholars, and political scientists urging Senators \n``to restore majority rule to the United States Senate.'' I ask \nunanimous consent to have this petition printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                  January 4, 2011.\n       ``We, the undersigned, American historians, political \n     scientists, and legal scholars, call upon our senators to \n     restore majority rule to the United States Senate by revising \n     the rules that now require the concurrence of 60 members \n     before legislation can be brought to the floor for debate and \n     restoring majority vote for the passage of bills.\n       Joyce Appleby, UCLA, retired; Katy Harriger, Wake Forest \n     University; Senator Gary Hart, University of Colorado, \n     Denver; Sanford Levinson, University of Texas Law School; \n     Lawrence Lessig, Harvard Law School; Peter Onuf, University \n     of Virginia; Jack Rakove, Stanford University; David RePass, \n     University of Connecticut, retired; John K.

Mr. President, last month, our former colleagues, Gary \nHart, a Democrat, and Chuck Hagel, a Republican, published an essay in \nTime magazine calling on us to ``restore democracy to the U.S. Senate'' \nby reforming the filibuster. In their words, the abuse of the \nfilibuster ``is no way to govern a great democracy.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that essay printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From Time, Dec. 21, 2010]\n\n                 Restoring Democracy to the U.S. Senate\n\n                     (By Chuck Hagel and Gary Hart)\n\n       Few principles are as central to democracy and the ideals \n     of the American Republic as majority rule. Though James \n     Madison and his colleagues in The Federalist acknowledged the \n     necessity of protecting the rights of minorities, the course \n     of our nation was to be determined by the will of the \n     majority. No other system consistent with democracy would \n     prove workable.\n       There is nothing in the United States Constitution that \n     permits a minority to frustrate the will of the majority.\n       Yet in the early 21st century, the will of the majority of \n     Americans, expressed on a daily basis by our elected \n     representatives in Congress, is consistently thwarted by a \n     minority in the United States Senate. This minority resorts \n     to the Senate rule requiring a three-fifths vote--60 votes--\n     to close (invoke cloture on) debate.\n       Article One, Section five, of the U.S. Constitution \n     provides that ``Each house [of Congress] may determine the \n     rules of its proceedings. . .'' Based upon Thomas Jefferson's \n     notion that the Senate was to be the saucer in which \n     controversies cooled, Senators have, from the beginning, been \n     at liberty to express their views at such length as they \n     wish. (Jefferson, it should be noted, was the author of the \n     Manual of Parliamentary Procedures for the Use of the Senate \n     of the United States in 1801.) But the Senate has always \n     recognized that even the principle of unlimited speech has \n     its conditions based upon comity and common sense.\n       Yet today the Senate conducts its business, or not, under \n     the constant threat of a filibuster. Important legislative \n     measures having to do with the vital interests of our nation \n     and the rights of our citizens will not even be introduced if \n     a minority of Senate members refuse to permit them to be \n     considered. Thus, a rule to protect debate is systematically \n     used to prevent debate. Even worse, secret ``holds'' by \n     individual Senators prevent confirmation of federal judges \n     and administration officials.\n       Though the Senate filibuster rose to prominence during \n     civil rights debates in the 1950s and '60s, it ran its course \n     and the majority prevailed. Today, it is commonplace and a \n     matter of course for such a lock-step minority systematically \n     to prevent consideration of the clear majority will.\n       The Constitution prevails over congressional rules. Can it \n     be seriously argued that the Senate could adopt a rule that \n     individual Senators could only vote on every other bill or \n     that they could only vote on trade issues, for example, in \n     the fourth year of their term?\n       Rules of the Senate cannot trump the obvious intention of \n     the Founding Fathers that legislation passed by majorities of \n     both houses, except for the explicit exceptions for \n     ratification of treaties, becomes the law of the land. This \n     is not a partisan question; today the filibuster, real or \n     threatened, dominates virtually every significant issue \n     confronting the Senate and our nation. The law of political \n     payback will ensure that today's Senate majority, once it \n     becomes the minority, will exact its revenge on today's \n     opposition minority party.\n       Examples of recent abuse of the cloture rule include the 53 \n     to 36 Senate vote to end tax cuts for the wealthy. \n     Regardless, the measure, like so many others (including an \n     earlier attempt to repeal the military's ``Don't Ask, Don't \n     Tell'' policy), failed under the threat of a filibuster. \n     These and other examples are clear violations of the \n     fundamental principle of majority rule.\n       This is no way to govern a great democracy, not to say also \n     a democracy seeking to democratize other nations.\n       We believe the abuse of the cloture rule ending debate is a \n     violation of fundamental Constitutional principles. Should a \n     judicial test of this notion occur, it will at the least \n     prove which of the current Supreme Court Justices are, or are \n     not, true ``originalists.'' Resolutions have been introduced \n     in the Senate to alter the cloture rule and permit majority \n     rule, while continuing to protect the rights of individual \n     Senators.\n       In the interest of the nation and the U.S. Constitution, \n     the Senate must once again become a democratic institution.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, editorialists from across the country have \nrecognized the filibuster must end. The Concord Monitor of New \nHampshire called on the Senate to ``Remove the Senate filibuster \nroadblock,'' noting, ``The filibuster rule has rendered the Senate \ndysfunctional and harmed the nation's ability to deal with pressing \nissues.''\n  The Los Angeles Times said `` . . . both parties should be willing to \neliminate such anti-democratic practices as the filibuster. . . .''\n  Editorials throughout the country have called for reform of the \nfilibuster. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record these \neditorials.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Concord Monitor, Dec. 17, 2010]\n\n                 Remove the Senate Filibuster Roadblock\n\n                             (By Anonymous)\n\n       On Jan. 5, 2011, the first day of the first session of the \n     112th Congress, Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin and other Democrats \n     promise to hold a historic vote to change the Senate's 60-\n     vote cloture rule. The vote to end the filibusters that have \n     made the Senate a place where needed legislation and \n     presidential appointments go to die could be the first of \n     Senator-elect Kelly Ayotte's career. How she votes will be \n     telling.\n       A super-majority voting requirement makes sense in rare \n     circumstances, ratifying a treaty for example or overriding a \n     presidential veto. But the filibuster rule is not in the \n     Constitution; it's an artifact that may have worked once but \n     has broken and jammed the Senate. When used judiciously, as \n     it was throughout most of its history, the filibuster rule \n     safeguards the rights of the minority. But when abused, as it \n     has been by Senate Republicans who have called for 87 such \n     votes to end debate so far this year, it creates a tyranny of \n     the minority.\n       There are divisions in both parties on the issue, in part \n     because there are dangers for both parties. Republicans are \n     currently filibustering to stop any and all legislation--and \n     will not vote to end debate until they succeed in winning tax \n     breaks for the nation's wealthiest citizens. Change the \n     filibuster rule--one proposal calls for a simple majority \n     vote--and Republicans will not so easily be able to block \n     legislation supported by the next session's 53-Democrat \n     majority. But if Republicans take the Senate in 2012--and \n     especially if there's also Republican in the White House--\n     Democrats could sorely regret their loss of the ability to \n     filibuster.\n       When, in his capacity as president of the Senate, Vice \n     President Joe Biden calls for the Senate to write the rules \n     governing the next session, Harkin and others believe that \n     they will have at least 51 votes. Some of them may come from \n     Republicans. The filibuster rule has rendered the Senate \n     dysfunctional and harmed the nation's ability to deal with \n     pressing issues. Ayotte should vote to change the filibuster \n     rule, so the Senate can once again be an effective \n     legislative body worthy of respect.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Dec. 28, 2010]\n\n                            A nuclear Senate\n\n       The U.S. Senate, once proudly known as the world's greatest \n     deliberative body, has in recent years degenerated into \n     something else: The place where legislation goes to die. It \n     earned that distinction after Democrats won a majority in \n     2006 and Republicans took unprecedented advantage of long-\n     standing Senate rules allowing the minority to block \n     progress.\n       There's a good chance Democrats won't hold the majority \n     much longer, however. That's why both parties should be \n     willing to eliminate such anti-democratic practices as the \n     filibuster and the placing of secret holds on legislation. \n     And an opportunity to do so, which only comes along once \n     every two years, is about to arrive.\n       The filibuster originated in 1806, when the Senate \n     eliminated a rule that had allowed the chamber to end debate \n     by majority vote; in effect, that meant a senator or group of \n     senators could delay progress by simply talking incessantly. \n     But that hardly ever happened in the 19th century. It wasn't \n     until 1917 that the Senate decided to limit these stemwinders \n     by imposing a rule that debate could be ended by a \n     supermajority vote. Since then there have been some other \n     rule changes altering the vote threshold, along with frequent \n     arguments about whether the Senate should go back to its \n     original rule allowing debate to be ended with a simple \n     majority vote. We think it should.\n       Under the current system, senators don't even have to stand \n     up and speak until they're hoarse in order to filibuster a \n     bill; a party leader just has to refuse to allow a bill to be \n     brought up by unanimous consent, forcing supporters to find \n     60 votes in favor of a motion to end debate. Southern \n     Democrats were the first to seriously misuse this tactic \n     during the civil rights era, but Republicans have perfected \n     such abuse in the last three years. According to the good-\n     government advocacy group Common Cause, which once defended \n     the filibuster rule but now aims to eliminate it, 8% of major \n     legislation was affected by threatened or actual filibusters \n     in the 1960s, compared with 70% since 2006. The result is \n     gridlock, which will only get worse now that the balance of \n     partisan power is close to even.\n\n[[Page S23]]\n\n       Secret holds are another serious problem. They allow \n     senators to anonymously block bills or confirmations of \n     presidential nominees from reaching the floor for an \n     unlimited time span, making naked obstructionism politically \n     safe. It's largely thanks to such holds that more than one in \n     10 federal judgeships remain vacant and federal departments \n     still lack key staff two years into the Obama administration. \n     Abuse of holds has become endemic in recent years, sometimes \n     allowing a single senator to take the entire chamber hostage \n     by placing holds on important legislation until backers agree \n     to support that senator's pet project.\n       The Constitution gives each chamber the power to choose the \n     rules governing its procedures at the beginning of the two-\n     year congressional session, slated this year for Jan. 5. So \n     why doesn't the majority simply do away with the filibuster \n     rule, or amend it? Because changing a long-standing rule \n     requires a two-thirds vote, an impossibly high hurdle. Yet \n     that supermajority rule may be invalid, as argued by then-\n     Vice President Richard Nixon in 1957: ``The right of a \n     current majority of the Senate at the beginning of a new \n     Congress to adopt its own rules, stemming as it does from the \n     Constitution itself, cannot be restricted or limited by rules \n     adopted by a majority of the Senate in a previous Congress,'' \n     he wrote. This is the basis of the so-called nuclear option \n     (or as supporters prefer to call it, the ``constitutional \n     option'').\n       Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) is leading a push to reform the \n     filibuster rules on Jan. 5, a fight joined by assorted good-\n     government groups and labor unions. Last week, all the \n     returning Senate Democrats sent a letter to Majority Leader \n     Harry Reid (D-Nev.) expressing frustration with the \n     filibuster and urging a change to the rules, though they \n     weren't specific about solutions (and it's unlikely many \n     would favor eliminating the filibuster entirely--most seem to \n     support weaker reforms such as a lowering of the 60-vote \n     threshold). In order to change the rules by a simple majority \n     vote, they would also need the backing of Vice President Joe \n     Biden, because as president of the Senate, the vice president \n     has traditionally ruled when constitutional questions about \n     procedures are raised.\n       Biden hasn't taken a position, and not a single Republican \n     has joined the effort. The apparent partisan split seems odd \n     given that it was Republicans who most recently brought up \n     the nuclear option when they were in the majority in 2005 and \n     Democrats were blocking President Bush's judicial nominees, \n     but a form of amnesia often sets in when a party is in the \n     minority. For conservatives, opposition is all the more \n     shortsighted given that twice as many Democratic-held seats \n     are up for reelection in 2012 as Republican seats.\n       Partisan fears about losing a cherished power have \n     prevented the Senate from going nuclear for decades, but \n     abuses of the filibuster and anonymous holds have never been \n     so rampant. The resulting dysfunction is a big part of the \n     reason Congress' approval rating has fallen to 13%, the \n     lowest in the history of the Gallup Poll. The chamber has a \n     chance to save itself from itself on Jan. 5, and it should \n     take it.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, 275 filibusters in 4 years is not just a \ncold statistic; it represents the minority blocking measures that \nsometimes--not all the time but sometimes--enjoy broad support among \nthe American people. Just in the last Congress, the filibuster was used \nto kill many bills that enjoyed majority and often bipartisan support. \nNeed I mention the DREAM Act? It had broad bipartisan support and big \nsupport among the American people. There was the DISCLOSE Act, which \npolls showed that over 80 percent of the American people supported. We \nhad a majority vote here for it, but we didn't have a supermajority. So \nit is no surprise that Americans are fed up and angry with their \nFederal Government. In too many critical areas, people see a \nlegislature that is simply unable to respond effectively to the most \nurgent challenges of our time.\n  Make no mistake, the problem goes beyond the sheer number of \nfilibusters. This once-rare tactic is now used or threatened to be used \non virtually every measure and nominee, even those who may enjoy near \nuniversal support. In the past Congress, for nearly 8 months, the \nminority filibustered confirmation of Martha Johnson as Administrator \nof the General Services Administration--certainly a relatively \nnoncontroversial position. She was ultimately confirmed 96 to 0. So \nwhat was that filibuster all about? And for nearly 5 months, the \nminority filibustered confirmation of Barbara Keenan to the Fourth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. She was ultimately confirmed 99 to 0.\n  What was that filibuster all about?\n  Again, to quote Norm Ornstein:\n\n       The Senate has taken the term ``deliberative'' to a new \n     level, slowing not just contentious legislation but also \n     bills that have overwhelming support.\n\n  Secondly, the filibuster has increasingly been used to prevent \nconsideration of bills and nominees. Rather than to serve to ensure the \nrepresentation of minority views and to foster debate and deliberation, \nby filibustering motions to proceed, the minority has been allowed to \nprevent debate and prevent deliberation. The filibuster has been used \nto defeat bills and nominees without their ever receiving a discussion \nhere on the floor of the Senate. In other words, the Senate, which was \nformerly renowned as the world's greatest deliberative body, has now \nbecome the world's greatest nondeliberative body. We can't even debate \nimportant national issues.\n  That is why I fully support the commonsense proposals to reform the \nfilibuster and restore the Senate to a body in which issues can be \nfully debated and deliberated. I support eliminating the filibuster on \nthe motion to proceed, and I believe those who are filibustering a bill \nor a nominee should be required to come to the floor, hold the floor, \nand make their case to their colleagues and the American people. \nSenators should not be able to hide behind a curtain of secret holds. \nThe reality is, however, because of the filibuster, the minority has \nunchecked veto power in this body.\n  Now, I want to make it clear, when I say ``the minority,'' I am not \ntalking about the Republicans; I am talking about the minority. It may \nbe the Democrats or it may be the Republicans. As I said, five times it \nhas changed since I have been--since 1985. When I say ``the minority,'' \nI mean the minority; I don't mean a political party.\n  This is what James Madison noted when rejecting a supermajority \nrequirement to pass legislation:\n\n       . . . it would no longer be the majority that would rule, \n     the power would be transferred to the minority.\n\n  Unfortunately, Madison's prediction has come true. We are the only \nDemocratic body that I know of in the world where the minority, not the \nmajority, controls. In today's Senate, American democracy is turned on \nits head. The minority rules; the majority is blocked. The majority has \nresponsibility and accountability but lacks the power to govern. The \nminority has power but lacks accountability and responsibility. This \nmeans the minority can block bills that would improve the economy, \ncreate jobs, and turn around and blame the majority for not fixing the \neconomy. The minority can block popular legislation and then accuse the \nmajority of being ineffective.\n  I repeat, when I say ``the minority,'' I am not saying Republicans or \nDemocrats; I am saying the minority, whoever it may happen to be. Both \nparties have abused the filibuster in the past, and both will, absent \nreal reform, abuse the filibuster in the future. Although Republicans \nare currently in the minority, there is no question that control of \nthis body will change, as it periodically does.\n  The fact is, reform is urgently needed. That is why I am \nreintroducing my proposal which would permit a decreasing majority of \nSenators over a period of days to invoke cloture on a given matter. \nUnder my proposal, a determined minority could slow down any bill. \nSenators would have ample time to make their arguments and attempt to \npersuade the public and a majority of their colleagues. This protects \nthe rights of the minority to full and vigorous debate and \ndeliberation, maintaining the hallmark of the Senate. But at the end of \nample debate, the majority should be allowed to act. There should be an \nup-or-down vote on legislation or a nominee. As former Senator Henry \nCabot Lodge, a Republican, stated many years ago, ``To vote without \ndebating is perilous, but to debate and never vote is imbecile.''\n  My plan has another advantage. The fact is that right now, the \nminority has no incentive to compromise. Not only do they know they \nhave the power to block legislation, but they can go out and campaign \non the message that the majority can't get anything done. In contrast, \nif the minority knows that at the end of a period of time a bill or \nnominee will be subject to majority vote, they will be more willing to \ncome to the table and negotiate seriously. Likewise, the majority would \nwant to compromise because they want to save time. There is nothing \nmore valuable to the majority party in the Senate than time.\n  So under my proposal, on the first cloture vote, you would need 60 \nvotes.\n\n[[Page S24]]\n\nIf you don't get 60 votes, you would have another vote in 3 days and \nyou would need 57 votes; in 3 more days, 54 votes; 3 more days, 51 \nvotes. So the majority would finally act, but you would chew up almost \n2 weeks of time. So on the first vote, let's say 53 Senators voted for \ncloture. Well, the minority would know that in several days or maybe in \na couple weeks' time, 53 Senators will get cloture. The minority then \nwould go to the majority and say: Look, we can drag this out for a \ncouple of weeks, chew up all your time, but we have some things we \nwould like to have considered. The majority--and I say there is nothing \nmore important to the majority than time here--not wanting to spend a \ncouple weeks on a bill, on a cloture or a filibuster, would say: OK, \nmaybe we can make an agreement. We will collapse the timeframe, the \nminority gets some of the things they want, and the majority is able \nthen to have a vote. So I see my proposal as a means of encouraging \ncompromise. Right now, there is no reason to compromise for the \nminority.\n  Again, I am not talking about Republicans or Democrats; I say ``the \nminority'' because they know they can absolutely block it.\n  I have changed my resolution since I introduced it in 1995, and I \nhave changed it because Republicans have said and I heard the minority \nleader say earlier that they have done this because Democrats in the \nmajority--the majority this time--have employed procedural matters to \ndeprive the Republicans of the right to offer amendments. Well, I am \nvery sympathetic to this argument. That is why I included in this \nresolution a guaranteed right to offer germane amendments to the \nminority, filed in advance of the cloture vote so everyone would know \nwhat was coming. Again, the minority should have the right to offer \nsome amendments that are germane to the bill. No matter who the \nmajority is, both parties are concerned about amendments from the \nminority. Perhaps you have a bill dealing with housing and someone \nwants to offer an amendment dealing with abortion. Well, there may be a \ntime and place for that but not on that bill. So that is why I say it \nshould be germane to the bill. If the minority has ideas to improve the \nbill, strike something from the bill, that would be germane to that \nbill.\n\n  I have heard it said--and I heard it on the radio this morning \ndriving in--that this is something like a power grab by a Democratic \nSenator reacting to recent elections in which my party lost numerous \nseats. Well, I want to make clear that the reforms I advocate are not \nabout one party or one agenda gaining an unfair advantage; it is about \nthe Senate as an institution operating more fairly, effectively, and \ndemocratically. Again, I wish to point out that I first offered this in \n1995 when I was in the minority. So to use the legal term, I come here \nwith clean hands. The truth is, with Republicans controlling the House, \nany final legislation will need to be bipartisan with or without the \nfilibuster.\n  So I don't see reform of the filibuster as a Democratic or Republican \nissue. Indeed, it was former Republican majority leader Senator Frist \nwho, when he nearly shut this body down over the use of filibusters on \na handful of judges, said:\n\n       This filibuster is nothing less than a formula for tyranny \n     by the minority.\n\n  That was in 2004, Senator Frist, the Republican majority leader at \nthat time.\n  Well, as I said, one of the problems here was this was done in the \nmiddle of a term. See, I think the Senate ought to be able to set its \nrules at the beginning, on the first legislative day, which we are in \nnow and which will extend for some time. The Senate ought to be able to \nset its rules at the beginning of a Congress. You can't go changing the \nrules every month, but you should be able to set the rules at the \nbeginning of a Congress so that you know for 2 years what the rules are \nthat you are operating under.\n  So it is time for the arms race to end. That is what this is--it is \nan arms race. I daresay that if we don't do anything about this, if the \nRepublicans take control of the Senate, as they think they will in 2 \nyears, well, Democrats are going to do the same thing to them. \nGuarantee it. Guarantee it. The Republicans did--what did I say?--136 \nfilibusters--139? Bet your bottom dollar, if we don't change the rules, \nDemocrats will match them. You wait and see.\n  Well, a lot of people sometimes say: Well, Harkin, what you are \nadvocating is the Senate would become like the House. I ask my friends \nand any Senator on either side of the aisle, since when did the Senate \nbecome defined by rule XXII, which is the filibuster? Why does that \ndefine the Senate? I thought the Senate was defined by the fact that \nyou get two Senators from every State--two Senators from North Dakota, \ntwo Senators from California, two Senators from New York, two Senators \nfrom Iowa. I thought the Senate was defined by the fact that we have \nunlimited debate. When a Senator gets the floor, you can't take it away \nfrom him. We operate under unanimous consent. The power of one single \nSenator would remain. But in the Senate, what do we do? We do treaties, \nwe do nominations, we sit in judgment on impeachments. The Senate is \nnot like the House. And just because we don't have the filibuster as we \nhave known it for the last 94 years does not mean the Senate becomes \nlike the House. Eliminating the filibuster will not change the basic \nnature of the Senate. So I say to those who say the Senate would be \nlike the House if we did away with this filibuster, would they also \nsuggest that the Senate of Henry Clay or Daniel Webster or Lyndon \nJohnson or Everett Dirksen was the same as the House of \nRepresentatives? I don't think so.\n  The fact is, what was never intended was that a supermajority of 60 \nvotes would be needed to enact virtually any piece of legislation or \nfor any nominee. In fact, the Framers of the Constitution were very \nclear about where a supermajority is required. There were only five in \nthe original Constitution: ratification of a treaty, override of a \nveto, votes of impeachment, passage of a constitutional amendment, and \nexpulsion of a Member. If they wanted to have supermajorities, they \nwould have said so. But it is not in the Constitution. The filibuster \nis not in the Constitution.\n  The first Senate expressly included a rule permitting the majority to \nend debate and bring a measure to a vote by moving the previous \nquestion. I repeat: The first Senate--the first Senate--had a rule that \npermitted the majority to end debate. Alexander Hamilton explained that \na supermajority requirement would mean a small minority could ``destroy \nthe energy of government.''\n  Hamilton said that the government would be subject to the ``caprice \nor artifices of an insignificant, turbulent or corrupt junta.'' Those \nare Hamilton's words.\n  Moreover, reform of filibuster rules stands squarely within the \ntradition of updating Senate rules as needed to foster an effective \ngovernment that can respond to the challenges of the day. The Senate \nhas adopted rules that forbid the filibuster in certain cases, such as \nthe War Powers Act and the budget. Imagine that. What should be more \ndebatable than the budget? But our rules do not permit a filibuster of \nthe budget. So we passed rules here limiting the filibuster.\n  Since 1917, we have passed four significant reforms concerning the \nfilibuster. The fact is, as Senator Tom Udall has powerfully made \nclear, article I, section 5, clause 2 of the Constitution specifies \nthat ``each House may determine the rules of its proceedings.''\n  As Senator Robert Byrd, who was opposed to filibuster reform--he and \nI had a great debate back in 1995 on this--as he emphasized, and he \nsaid this--Senator Byrd: ``At any time that 51 Senators are determined \nto change the rule . . . that rule can be changed.''\n  I am reading here from what Senator Byrd said. He said at that time:\n\n       The Constitution in article I, section 5 says that each \n     House shall determine the rules of its proceedings. Now we \n     are at the beginning of Congress. This Congress is not \n     obliged to be bound by the dead hand of the past.\n\n  ``The dead hand.''\n  I listened to the minority leader when he said we have--the majority \nhas never changed rules except by following those rules. The rules set \ndown by a Congress a long time ago, by a Senate a long time ago, said \nthat in order to change the rules, you need a two-thirds vote of the \nSenate. I submit that is unconstitutional. I submit that this Congress, \nthis Senate, on this first legislative day, does not have to abide\n\n[[Page S25]]\n\nby that. What if, in some Senate, one party got 90 Senators one time, \nand they adopted a rule that said that from here on out, you have to \nhave 90 votes in order to change the rules, here are the rules, and \nthey set up rules that pretty much made it impossible for the minority \nto ever become the majority? Would that be constitutional? I don't \nthink so.\n  Senator Byrd said we are not obliged to be bound by the dead hand of \nthe past. The first Senate, Senator Byrd said, which met in 1789, \napproved 19 rules by majority vote. Those rules have been changed from \ntime to time. So the Members of the Senate who met in 1789 and approved \nthat first body of rules did not for one moment think or believe or \npretend that all succeeding Senates would be bound by that Senate.\n  Here is the essence of what Senator Byrd said:\n\n       It is my belief--which has been supported by rulings of \n     Vice Presidents of both parties and by votes of the Senate--\n     in essence upholding the power and right of a majority of the \n     Senate to change the rules of the Senate at the beginning of \n     a new Congress.\n\n  I would say Senator Byrd has not been alone in his views or tactics. \nThe constitutional option has been endorsed by three Vice Presidents \nand three times by the Senate itself. Why was it not used? Because \nSenators then reached a compromise, and therefore we never had the \nconstitutional option. But that does not mean we cannot use that. The \nConstitution is very clear. I think three votes of the Senate and three \nformer Vice Presidents have made clear in their rulings that at the \nbeginning of a Congress, we can set the rules.\n  Chief Justice John Marshall once said:\n\n       Any enduring Constitution must be able to respond to the \n     various crises of human affairs.\n\n  I said many times that I don't believe we can be a 21st-century \nsuperpower bound by archaic rules of the 19th century. We have to have \na responsive government, responding to the challenges of our time.\n  I am not afraid. I say to my friends on the Republican side, I am not \nafraid. What the minority leader said--he said that at some time the \nRepublicans might be in charge, and they might want to undo what the \nDemocrats did, and the Democrats better be careful. That was in his op-\ned piece in the Post this morning. I am not afraid of democracy. I am \nnot afraid of the votes of the people. If the people vote to put \ncertain conservatives in power, then they ought to have the right to \ngovern. They ought to have the right to respond to the people of this \ncountry. The minority--I would be in the minority at that time--I think \nthe minority ought to have the right to be heard, we ought to have the \nright to debate, we ought to have the right to amend, but we should not \nhave the right to totally obstruct. I am not afraid.\n  People say that the tea party in the House--they are going to do all \nthis stuff. I am sorry, I am not afraid. The people voted. There ought \nto be things that happen because people vote a certain way. No wonder \nso many people are frustrated. They vote, they think things are going \nto happen, they don't happen, and they say: A pox on both your Houses.\n  So, yes, I don't know why we should be so afraid of each other. Why \nshould I be afraid that the Republicans are going to institute \nlegislation I don't like? They have in the past, and our country has \nendured. I would say there are times when the Democrats have passed \nlegislation Republicans did not like and our country has endured. So I \njust do not like this fear, that we have to be afraid that somehow the \nmajority is going to do things.\n  What we want to make sure of is that the rights of the minority are \nguaranteed--the right to be heard, the right of the minority to offer \namendments. But I don't think it ought to be the right of the minority \nto obstruct, and I don't think it ought to be the right of the minority \nto demand that their views be implemented. That is the right of the \nmajority.\n  I close where I began, and I thank my friends for this indulgence. I \nbelieve the bedrock of the principle of our Constitution, our Founders, \nwas majority rule with respect for minority rights. But I say this, and \nI have said it many times. It is kind of the dirty little secret of the \nSenate. And here is the dirty little secret: The power of an individual \nSenator comes not by what he can do but by what he can stop. That is \nthe dirty little secret of the Senate. One Senator can stop something, \ncan block it. I say that each Senator--each of us needs to give up a \nlittle of our privilege, give up a little of our power, give up a \nlittle of our prerogatives for the greater good of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Iowa for his consistency over \nthe years with his proposal. I wonder if I can make a few remarks on \nhis proposal, and if he has time, if he is still here, maybe I will \npose a question to him. I see the Senator from Kansas is also here. He \nspent a lot of time on the Rules Committee on this subject. He is one \nof our most forceful speakers on the matter, and I would defer to him, \nand then I know there are other Senators--the Senator from Oregon, the \nSenator from New Mexico--who have some proposals to offer. There may be \nother Senators on the Republican side who come to the floor.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an \naddress I made yesterday at the Heritage Foundation entitled ``The \nFilibuster: Democracy's finest show . . . the right to talk your head \noff.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I borrowed those words from H.V. Kaltenborn and ``Mr. \nSmith Goes to Washington.''\n  I am a little amused by the suggestion the Senator from Iowa made and \nothers made that somehow the Senate has been paralyzed for the last \ncouple of years. Most of the people I know are concerned about what the \nSenate did do, not what it did not do. It is hard to say you are \nparalyzed when you pass a $1 trillion stimulus bill, health care law, \nfinancial regulation law, et cetera, et cetera.\n  As far as the claim that Republicans are holding things up goes, I \nhave a few comments. We did not have a budget last year. Most \nhouseholds have to have budgets. The Senate ought to have one. Why \ndidn't we have a budget? It wasn't the Republicans holding it up. As \nthe Senator from Iowa said, under our rules, it only takes 51 votes to \npass a budget. During the last couple of years, the Democrats had 59 or \n60 votes. So the reason we did not have a budget is because the \nDemocrats did not want to pass a budget, or at least that they did not \npass a budget. It had nothing to do with the Senate being ``broken.''\n\n  The Senator from Iowa made this Rules proposal in 1995. He has made \nsome modifications in his proposal but basically this is the same as he \noffered in 1995. I remember those days pretty well. It was right after \nthe so-called Gingrich revolution, in 1994. Republicans took control of \nthe Senate and of the House of Representatives. The Senator from Iowa \nmade his proposal to diminish the effectiveness of a filibuster. What \ndid the Republicans do? The Republicans, had the most to gain--at least \ntemporarily--from being able to get their agenda through the Senate. \nBut every single one opposed the proposal. Every single Republican \nSenator in 1995 said: No, we may love our agenda, but we do not want to \nchange the Senate. We don't want to jeopardize the Senate as a forum \nfor forcing consensus and protecting minority rights and letting the \nvoices of all of the people be heard on the Senate floor.\n  Not only the Republican Senators in 1995 had that opinion. Here are \nsome things that were said mostly in 2005 by Democratic leaders. There \nwere some Republicans who had the same idea the Senator from Iowa has \nabout diminishing the effectiveness of the filibuster. In this case, \nthey wanted to diminish the use of filibusters on judicial nominations. \nThere was great consternation because Democrats decided to filibuster \nPresident Bush's judges. I didn't like that either. This is what has \nbeen said by Democrats.\n  Senator Robert Byrd in his last testimony before the Rules Committee:\n\n       We must never, ever, ever, ever tear down the only wall, \n     the necessary fence, that this Nation has against the \n     excesses of the Executive Branch.\n\n\n[[Page S26]]\n\n\n  What is that necessary fence? That necessary fence is anchored in the \nfilibuster.\n  Senator Schumer of New York in 2005:\n\n       The checks and balances which have been at the core of this \n     Republic are about to be evaporated.\n\n  This was in response to the Republicans who were trying to diminish \nthe effectiveness of the filibuster in 2005. ``The checks and \nbalances'' Senator Schumer said, ``which say that if you get 51 percent \nof the vote, you don't get your way 100 percent of the time.''\n  Former Senator Hillary Clinton:\n\n       You've got majority rule. Then you've got the Senate over \n     here where people can slow things down, where they can \n     debate, where they have something called the filibuster. You \n     know, it seems like it's a little less than efficient. Well, \n     that's right, it is. And deliberately designed to be so.\n\n  Senator Dodd more recently:\n\n       I'm totally opposed to the idea of changing the filibuster \n     rules. I think that's foolish, in my view.\n\n  Senator Byrd:\n\n       That's why we have a Senate, to amend and debate freely.\n\n  Senator Dodd:\n\n       I can understand the temptation to change the rules that \n     make the Senate so unique and simultaneously so terribly \n     frustrating. But whether such temptation is motivated by a \n     noble desire to speed up the legislative process or by pure \n     political expediency, I believe such changes would be unwise \n     . . .\n       Therefore, to my fellow Senators who never served a day in \n     the minority, I urge you to pause in your enthusiasm to \n     change Senate rules.\n\n  Just two more.\n  Senator Reid, who was then the Democratic leader but the minority \nleader, said in 2005:\n\n       The filibuster is far from a ``procedural gimmick.'' It's \n     part of the fabric of this institution that we call the \n     Senate. For 200 years we've had the right to extend the \n     debate. It's not procedural gimmick. Some in this chamber \n     want to throw out 214 years of Senate history in the quest \n     for absolute power. They want to do away with Mr. Smith, as \n     depicted in that great movie, being able to come to \n     Washington. They want to do away with the filibuster. They \n     think they're wiser than our Founding Fathers. I doubt that's \n     true.\n\n  Then there was one other Senator who spoke and who said this, the \nSenator from Illinois, Senator Obama:\n\n       Then if the majority chooses to end the filibuster, if they \n     choose to change the rules and put an end to the Democratic \n     debate, then the fighting and the bitterness and the gridlock \n     will only get worse.\n\n  I think the last 2 years in the Senate have been an aberration. We \nhave had no incentive for the majority to take the ideas of the \nminority because the majority had these huge majorities, nearly 60 \nvotes here, and a Democratic President.\n  So when Senator Corker, my colleague from Tennessee, began to work on \nthe financial regulation bill, there came a time in the process where \nthe Democrats said: Well, you know, we like Corker, and he has got some \ngood ideas, but we do not need his vote to pass this bill. We have got \nthe votes. We won the election. We will write the bill.\n  So the Senate has had no consensus. Instead, we had a Democratic \nfinancial regulation bill. We had a Democratic health care bill. We had \na mostly Democratic stimulus bill. We might have had one or two \nRepublicans vote for it.\n  For the last 2 years, we have not had any experience in working \nacross party lines. What the filibuster does is say, you are not going \nto pass anything in the Senate unless at least some Republicans and \nsome Democrats agree. You will not pass anything unless you get a \nconsensus.\n  Then that will change behavior, and people say, okay, let's bring a \nNo Child Left Behind bill to the floor. But it has got to have the \nsupport of Senator Enzi and Senator Harkin or it is not going anywhere, \nbecause it has got to have 60 votes to move forward. What is the \nadvantage of that? The advantage of that is the comparison of the Civil \nRights bill in 1964, and the health care law of 2009.\n  In 1964, after a bitter fight led by Senator Russell of Georgia, the \nCivil Rights bill passed the Senate, overcoming a filibuster. The bill \nwas written in the Republican leader's office. It was not just sent \nover there in the middle of the night during Christmas, it was written \nin his office. You had President Johnson, a Democrat, and Senator \nDirksen saying, this is good for the country. A lot of people hated the \nbill. And some people thought it did not go far enough.\n  What did Senator Russell do, who had fought that bill for his whole \nterm here? He went home to Georgia and said, I did everything I could \nto stop it, but it is the law, and we must obey it. So not only does \nthe Senate need a consensus to get a better bill, we need a bill that \nthe country will accept.\n  Compare that to the health care law in 2009. A lot of good intentions \nwent into the health care law. I know that. Senator Harkin was in the \nmiddle of that, but the fact of the matter was that it was a Democratic \nbill. It was rammed through Christmas Eve in the middle of the night. \nWe barely had a chance to look at the bill, and it passed with a solely \npartisan vote.\n  And what happened? Instead of everybody going home and saying, it is \nthe law of the land, we support it, an instant movement was created to \nrepeal it and replace it. I hope we will not do what Senator Harkin \nsuggests. I think his proposal will create a situation where the \nmajority says: well, we are going to hang you, but we will hang you in \n3 days instead of tonight. They will narrow it down until they can pass \na measure with 51 votes.\n  So if the Republican House of Representatives passes a bill to repeal \nthe health care law, then you know Senate Republicans would pass it, \ntoo, if we have got 51 votes. Or if the Democratic House, as they did \nlast year, passes a bill to repeal the ballot in secret elections then \nthe Democrats over here will pass it, too, if they have 51 votes. But \nwhen a consensus is required, if bills such as that come from the House \nto the Senate, we in the Senate say, whoa, let's think this over. We do \nnot pass it. We do not pass it unless we have some kind of consensus.\n  That does not mean all the Republicans and all of the Democrats must \nalways agree. We had almost all of the Republicans and some of the \nDemocrats on the tax agreement that was passed in December. On the New \nSTART treaty, we had almost all of the Democrats and some of the \nRepublicans support it. But in each case, at least you had substantial \nconsensus from both parties, and I think the country respects and \nappreciates that.\n  I think the Framers knew what they were doing when they created a \nmajoritarian House, in other words, the freight train that can run \nthrough whatever the result of election is. And when they created a \ndifferent kind of Senate. A different kind of Senate that Senator Byrd \neloquently has said has been one where we can say, you are not going to \npass anything unless we do it together. That is called consensus. That \nis called cooperation. I think the American people would be greatly \nrelieved.\n  My question I wish to pose through the Chair to Senator Harkin is, \nwhat is a filibuster? Senator Sanders was on the floor for several \nhours on the tax debate last month. He spoke for 8 or 9 hours. I guess \nthat is a filibuster in the traditional sense. But I think the kind of \nfilibuster the Senator from Iowa is counting is this: let's say Senator \nReid brings a health care bill to the floor, and I rush over to offer \nan amendment to the health care bill, and Senator Reid says: Sorry, I \nam going to cut off your amendment. Then I object. Senator Reid calls \nwhat I tried to do a filibuster.\n  If we are just talking and amending and debating, that is not a \nfilibuster. It is not a filibuster until the majority leader cuts off \ndebate and amendments. So what the Democrats are counting as \nfilibusters is the number of times they have cut us off from doing what \nwe are supposed to do, which is, amend and debate.\n  It is like being invited to sing on the Grand Ole Opry, and getting \nthere and you are not allowed to sing. The people of Tennessee do not \nexpect me to come up here and sit on a log just because the \ndistinguished majority leader says he does not want my amendments. What \nwas traditional in the Senate is that Senators could offer amendments \nand debate, at almost any time, on almost any bill. In the days of \nSenator Byrd and Senator Baker, they would have 300 amendments filed. \nThey would start voting. So some Senators would say, well, it is \nThursday, don't we go home? The Leaders would say no, we are going to \nvote, unless you want to\n\n[[Page S27]]\n\ngive up your amendment. Instead of doing that, we did not vote on one \nFriday in the Senate this past year, and a lot of Senators on both \nsides of the aisle do not want to vote on controversial issues. If we \nlook for consensus, if we were willing to vote on controversial issues, \nand if we ended the 3-day work week, if the majority thinks the \nminority is abusing the filibuster, they can confront it. They can sit \nover there and they can say to us, okay, Senator Alexander, 60 of us \nare ready to cut this off. We are ready to get on to a vote. So you \nhave got 7 hours that you can speak, then you have got to get 23 other \nSenators to take the other hours. If you stop talking, we are going to \nput the question to a vote, and we have got some motions we can make \nabout your being dilatory. In other words, we can make life miserable \nfor you, because we are going to do this all night long.\n  Senator Byrd said in his last testimony: The rules exist today to \nconfront a filibuster.\n  So my question to the Senator from Iowa which I would pose through \nthe Chair is: What is a filibuster? Is a filibuster when I come down to \nthe floor to amend the health care bill, and the majority leader says, \nsorry, I am going to use my powers to cut it off? You cannot amend the \nbill. And then he files cloture.\n  That is what he calls a filibuster, I think. What I call it is \ncutting off my right to amend, right to debate, right to do my job.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\nThe Filibuster: ``Democracy's Finest Show . . . The Right To Talk Your \n                               Head Off''\n\n(Address by Senator Lamar Alexander, Heritage Foundation, Jan. 4, 2011)\n\n       Voters who turned out in November are going to be pretty \n     disappointed when they learn the first thing some Democrats \n     want to do is cut off the right of the people they elected to \n     make their voices heard on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n       In the November elections, voters showed that they remember \n     the passage of the health care law on Christmas Eve, 2009: \n     midnight sessions, voting in the midst of a snow storm, back \n     room deals, little time to read, amend or debate the bill, \n     passage by a straight party line vote.\n       It was how it was done as much as what was done that \n     angered the American people. Minority voices were silenced. \n     Those who didn't like it were told, ``You can read it after \n     you pass it.'' The majority's attitude was, ``We won the \n     election. We'll write the bill. We don't need your votes.''\n       And of course the result was a law that a majority of \n     voters consider to be an historic mistake and the beginning \n     of an immediate effort to repeal and replace it.\n       Voters remembered all this in November, but only 6 weeks \n     later Democratic senators seemed to have forgotten it. I say \n     this because on December 18, every returning Democratic \n     senator sent Senator Reid a letter asking him to ``take steps \n     to bring [Republican] abuses of our rules to an end.''\n       When the United States Senate convenes tomorrow, some have \n     threatened to try to change the rules so it would be easier \n     to do with every piece of legislation what they did with the \n     health care bill: ram it through on a partisan vote, with \n     little debate, amendment, or committee consideration, and \n     without listening to minority voices.\n       The brazenness of this proposed action is that Democrats \n     are proposing to use the very tactics that in the past almost \n     every Democratic leader has denounced, including President \n     Obama and Vice President Biden, who has said that it is ``a \n     naked power grab'' and destructive of the Senate as a \n     protector of minority rights.\n       The Democratic proposal would allow the Senate to change \n     its rules with only 51 votes, ending the historical practice \n     of allowing any senator at any time to offer any amendment \n     until sixty senators decide it is time to end debate.\n       As Investor's Business Daily wrote, ``The Senate Majority \n     Leader has a plan to deal with Republican electoral success. \n     When you lose the game, you simply change the rules. When you \n     only have 53 votes, you lower the bar to 51.'' This is called \n     election nullification.\n       Now there is no doubt the Senate has been reduced to a \n     shadow of itself as the world's greatest deliberative body, a \n     place which, as Sen. Arlen Specter said in his farewell \n     address, has been distinctive because of ``the ability of any \n     Senator to offer virtually any amendment at any time.''\n       But the demise of the Senate is not because Republicans \n     seek to filibuster. The real obstructionists have been the \n     Democratic majority which, for an unprecedented number of \n     times, used their majority advantage to limit debate, not to \n     allow amendments and to bypass the normal committee \n     consideration of legislation.\n       To be specific, according to the Congressional Research \n     Service:\n       1. the majority leader has used his power to cut off all \n     amendments and debate 44 times--more than the last six \n     majority leaders combined;\n       2. the majority leader has moved to shut down debate the \n     same day measures are considered (same-day cloture) nearly \n     three times more, on average, than the last six majority \n     leaders;\n       3. the majority leader has set the record for bypassing the \n     committee process bringing a measure directly to the floor 43 \n     times during the 110th and 111th Congresses.\n       Let's be clear what we mean when we say the word \n     ``filibuster.'' Let's say the majority leader brings up the \n     health care bill. I go down to the floor to offer an \n     amendment and speak on it. The majority leader says ``no'' \n     and cuts off my amendment. I object. He calls what I tried to \n     do a filibuster. I call what he did cutting off my right to \n     speak and amend which is what I was elected to do. So the \n     problem is not a record number of filibusters; the problem is \n     a record number of attempts to cut off amendments and debate \n     so that minority voices across America cannot be heard on the \n     floor of the Senate.\n       So the real ``party of no'' is the majority party that has \n     been saying ``no'' to debate, and ``no'' to voting on \n     amendments that minority members believe improve legislation \n     and express the voices of the people they represent. In fact, \n     the reason the majority leader can claim there have been so \n     many filibusters is because he actually is counting as \n     filibusters the number of times he filed cloture--or moved to \n     cut off debate.\n       Instead of this power grab, as the new Congress begins, the \n     goal should be to restore the Senate to its historic role \n     where the voices of the people can be heard, rather than \n     silenced, where their ideas can be offered as amendments, \n     rather than suppressed, and where those amendments can be \n     debated and voted upon rather than cut off.\n       To accomplish this, the Senate needs to change its \n     behavior, not to change its rules. The majority and minority \n     leaders have been in discussion on steps that might help \n     accomplish this. I would like to discuss this afternoon why \n     it is essential to our country that cooler heads prevail \n     tomorrow when the Senate convenes.\n       One good example Democrats might follow is the one \n     established by Republicans who gained control of both the \n     Senate and House of Representatives in 1995. On the first day \n     of the new Republican majority, Sen. Harkin proposed a rule \n     change diluting the filibuster. Every single Republican \n     senator voted against the change even though supporting it \n     clearly would have provided at least a temporary advantage to \n     the Republican agenda.\n       Here is why Republicans who were in the majority then, and \n     Democrats who are in the majority today, should reject a \n     similar rules change:\n       First, the proposal diminishes the rights of the minority. \n     In his classic Democracy in America, Alexis de Tocqueville \n     wrote that one of his two greatest fears for our young \n     democracy was the ``tyranny of the majority,'' the \n     possibility that a runaway majority might trample minority \n     voices.\n       Second, diluting the right to debate and vote on amendments \n     deprives the nation of a valuable forum for achieving \n     consensus on difficult issues. The founders knew what they \n     were doing when they created two very different houses in \n     Congress. Senators have six-year terms, one-third elected \n     every two years. The Senate operates largely by unanimous \n     consent. There is the opportunity, unparalleled in any other \n     legislative body in the world, to debate and amend until a \n     consensus finally is reached. This procedure takes longer, \n     but it usually produces a better result--and a result the \n     country is more likely to accept. For example, after the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1964 was enacted, by a bipartisan \n     majority over a filibuster led by Sen. Russell of Georgia, \n     Sen. Russell went home to Georgia and said that, though he \n     had fought the legislation with everything he had, ``As long \n     as it is there, it must be obeyed.'' Compare that to the \n     instant repeal effort that was the result of jamming the \n     health care law through in a partisan vote.\n       Third, such a brazen power grab by Democrats this year will \n     surely guarantee a similar action by Republicans in two years \n     if Republicans gain control of the Senate as many believe is \n     likely to happen. We have seen this happen with Senate \n     consideration of judges. Democrats began the practice of \n     filibustering President Bush's judges even though they were \n     well-qualified; now Democrats are unhappy because many \n     Republicans regard that as a precedent and have threatened to \n     do the same to President Obama's nominees. Those who want to \n     create a freight train running through the Senate today, as \n     it does in the House, might think about whether they will \n     want that freight train in two years if it is the Tea Party \n     Express.\n       Finally, it is hard to see what partisan advantage \n     Democrats gain from destroying the Senate as a forum for \n     consensus and protection of minority rights since any \n     legislation they jam through without bipartisan support will \n     undoubtedly die in the Republican-controlled House during the \n     next two years.\n       * * *\n       The reform the Senate needs is a change in its behavior, \n     not a change in its rules. I have talked with many senators, \n     on both sides of the aisle, and I believe most of us want the \n     same thing: a Senate where most bills are considered by \n     committee, come to the floor as a result of bipartisan \n     cooperation, are debated and amended and then voted upon.\n       It was not so long ago that this was the standard operating \n     procedure. I have seen the Senate off and on for more than \n     forty years, from the days in 1967 when I came to the Senate \n     as Sen. Howard Baker's legislative assistant. That was when \n     each senator\n\n[[Page S28]]\n\n     had only one legislative assistant. I came back to help Sen. \n     Baker set up his leadership office in 1977 and watched the \n     way that Sen. Baker and Sen. Byrd led the Senate from 1977 to \n     1985, when Democrats were in the majority for the first four \n     years and Republicans were the second four years.\n       Then, most pieces of legislation that came to the floor had \n     started in committee. Then that legislation was open for \n     amendment. There might be 300 amendments filed and, after a \n     while, the majority would ask for unanimous consent to cut \n     off amendments. Then voting would begin. And voting would \n     continue.\n       The leaders would work to persuade senators to limit their \n     amendments but that didn't always work. So the leaders kept \n     the Senate in session during the evening, during Fridays, and \n     even into the weekend. Senators got their amendments \n     considered and the legislation was fully vetted, debated and \n     finally passed or voted down.\n       Sen. Byrd knew the rules. I recall that when Republicans \n     won the majority in 1981, Sen. Baker went to see Sen. Byrd \n     and said, ``Bob I know you know the rules better than I ever \n     will. I'll make a deal with you. You don't surprise me and I \n     won't surprise you.''\n       Sen. Byrd said, ``Let me think about it.''\n       And the next day Sen. Byrd said yes and the two leaders \n     managed the Senate effectively together for eight years.\n       What would it take to restore today's Senate to the Senate \n     of the Baker-Byrd era?\n       Well, we have the answer from the master of the Senate \n     rules himself, Sen. Byrd, who in his last appearance before \n     the Rules Committee on May 19, 2010 said: ``Forceful \n     confrontation to a threat to filibuster is undoubtedly the \n     antidote to the malady [abuse of the filibuster]. Most \n     recently, Senate Majority Leader Reid announced that the \n     Senate would stay in session around-the-clock and take all \n     procedural steps necessary to bring financial reform \n     legislation before the Senate. As preparations were made and \n     cots rolled out, a deal was struck within hours and the \n     threat of filibuster was withdrawn. . . . I also know that \n     current Senate Rules provide the means to break a \n     filibuster.''\n       Sen. Byrd also went on to argue strenuously in that last \n     speech that ``our Founding Fathers intended the Senate to be \n     a continuing body that allows for open and unlimited debate \n     and the protection of minority rights. Senators,'' he said, \n     ``have understood this since the Senate first convened.''\n       Sen. Byrd then went on: ``In his notes of the \n     Constitutional Convention on June 26, 1787, James Madison \n     recorded that the ends to be served by the Senate were \n     `first, to protect the people against their rulers, secondly, \n     to protect the people against the transient impressions into \n     which they themselves might be led. . . They themselves, as \n     well as a numerous body of Representatives, were liable to \n     err also, from fickleness and passion. A necessary fence \n     against this danger would be to select a portion of \n     enlightened citizens, whose limited number, and firmness \n     might seasonably interpose against impetuous councils.' That \n     fence,'' Sen. Byrd said in that last appearance, ``was the \n     United States Senate. The right to filibuster anchors this \n     necessary fence. But it is not a right intended to be \n     abused.''\n       ``There are many suggestions as to what we should do. I \n     know what we must not do. We must never, ever, ever, ever \n     tear down the only wall--the necessary fence--this nation has \n     against the excess of the Executive Branch and the resultant \n     haste and tyranny of the majority.''\n       What would it take to restore the years of Sens. Baker and \n     Byrd, when most bills that came to the floor were first \n     considered in committee, when more amendments were \n     considered, debated and voted upon?\n       1. Recognize that there has to be bipartisan cooperation \n     and consensus on important issues. The day of ``we won the \n     election, we jam the bill through'' will have to be over. \n     Sen. Baker would not bring a bill to the floor when \n     Republicans were in the majority unless it had the support of \n     the ranking Democratic committee member.\n       2. Recognize that senators are going to have to vote. This \n     may sound ridiculous to say to an outsider, but every Senate \n     insider knows that a major reason why the majority cuts off \n     amendments and debate is because Democratic members don't \n     want to vote on controversial issues. That's like \n     volunteering to be on the Grand Ole Opry but then claiming \n     you don't want to sing. We should say, if you don't want to \n     vote, then don't run for the Senate.\n       3. Finally, according to Sen. Byrd, it will be the end of \n     the three-day work week. The Senate convenes on most Mondays \n     for a so-called bed-check vote at 5:30. The Senate during \n     2010 did not vote on one single Friday. It is not possible \n     either for the minority to have the opportunity to offer, \n     debate and vote on amendments or for the majority to \n     forcefully confront a filibuster if every senator knows there \n     will never be a vote on Friday.\n       There are some other steps that can be taken to help the \n     Senate function better without impairing minority rights.\n       One bipartisan suggestion has been to end the practice of \n     secret holds. It seems reasonable to expect a senator who \n     intends to hold up a bill or a nomination to allow his \n     colleagues and the world know who he or she is so that the \n     merits of the hold can be evaluated and debated.\n       Second, there is a crying need to make it easier for any \n     President to staff his government with key officials within a \n     reasonable period of time. One reason for the current delay \n     is the President's own fault, taking an inordinately long \n     time to vet his nominees. Another is a shared responsibility: \n     the maze of conflicting forms, FBI investigations, IRS \n     audits, ethics requirements and financial disclosures \n     required both by the Senate and the President of nominees. I \n     spoke on the Senate floor on this, titling my speech \n     ``Innocent until Nominated.'' The third obstacle is the \n     excessive number of executive branch appointments requiring \n     Senate confirmation. There have been bipartisan efforts to \n     reduce these obstacles. With the support the majority and \n     minority leaders, we might achieve some success.\n       Of course, even if all of these efforts succeed there still \n     will be delayed nominations, bills that are killed before \n     they come to the floor and amendments that never see the \n     light of day. But this is nothing new. I can well remember \n     when Sen. Metzenbaum of Ohio put a secret hold on my \n     nomination when President George H.W. Bush appointed me \n     education secretary. He held up my nomination for three \n     months, never really saying why.\n       I asked Sen. Rudman of New Hampshire what I could do about \n     Sen. Metzenbaum, and he said, ``Nothing.'' And then he told \n     me how President Ford had appointed him to the Federal \n     Communications Commission when he, Rudman, was Attorney \n     General of New Hampshire. The Democratic senator from New \n     Hampshire filibustered Rudman's appointment until Rudman \n     finally asked the president to withdraw his name.\n       ``Is that the end of the story?'' I asked Rudman.\n       ``No,'' he said. ``I ran against the [so-and-so] and won, \n     and that's how I got into the Senate.''\n       During his time here Sen. Metzenbaum would sit at a desk at \n     the front of the Senate and hold up almost every bill going \n     through until its sponsor obtained his approval. Sen. Allen \n     of Alabama did the same before Metzenbaum. And Sen. John \n     Williams of Delaware during the 1960's was on the floor \n     regularly objecting to federal spending when I first came \n     here forty years ago.\n       * * *\n       I have done my best to make the argument that the Senate \n     and the country will be served best if cooler heads prevail \n     and Democrats don't make their power grab tomorrow to make \n     the Senate like the House, to permit them to do with any \n     legislation what they did with the health care law. I have \n     said that to do so will destroy minority rights, destroy the \n     essential forum for consensus that the Senate now provides \n     for difficult issues, and surely guarantee that Republicans \n     will try to do the same to Democrats in two years. More than \n     that, it is hard to see how Democrats can gain any partisan \n     advantage from this destruction of the Senate and invitation \n     for retribution since any bill they force through the Senate \n     in a purely partisan way during the next two years will \n     surely be stopped by the Republican-controlled House of \n     Representatives.\n       But I am not the most persuasive voice against the wisdom \n     of tomorrow's proposed action. Other voices are. And I have \n     collected some of them, mostly Democratic leaders who wisely \n     argued against changing the institution of the Senate in a \n     way that would deprive minority voices in America of their \n     right to be heard:\n\n                   From Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\n\n       Jimmy Stewart: Wild horses aren't going to drag me off this \n     floor until those people have heard everything I've got to \n     say, even if it takes all winter.\n       Reporter: H.V. Kaltenborn speaking, half of official \n     Washington is here to see democracy's finest show. The \n     filibuster--the right to talk your head off.\n\n   Sen. Robert Byrd's final appearance in the Senate Rules Committee\n\n       SENATOR ROBERT BYRD: We must never, ever, ever, ever, tear \n     down the only wall, the necessary fence, that this nation has \n     against the excesses of the Executive Branch.\n       SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER: The checks and balances which have been \n     at the core of this Republic are about to be evaporated. The \n     checks and balances which say that if you get 51% of the \n     vote, you don't get your way 100% of the time.\n       FORMER SEN. CLINTON: You've got majority rule. Then you've \n     got the Senate over here where people can slow things down \n     where they can debate where they have something called the \n     filibuster. You know it seems like it's a little less than \n     efficient, well that's right, it is. And deliberately \n     designed to be so.\n       SEN. DODD: I'm totally opposed to the idea of changing the \n     filibuster rules. I think that's foolish in my view.\n       SEN. BYRD: That's why we have a Senate, is to amend and \n     debate freely.\n       SEN. ALEXANDER: The whole idea of the Senate is not to have \n     majority rule. It's to force consensus. It's to force there \n     to be a group of Senators on either side who have to respect \n     one another's views so they work together and produce 60 \n     votes on important issues.\n       SEN. DODD: I can understand the temptation to change the \n     rules that make the Senate so unique and simultaneously so \n     terribly frustrating. But whether such temptation is \n     motivated by a noble desire to speed up the legislative \n     process or by pure political expediency, I believe such \n     changes would be unwise.\n       SEN. ROBERTS: The Senate is the only place in government \n     where the rights of a\n\n[[Page S29]]\n\n     numerical minority are so protected. A minority can be right, \n     and minority views can certainly improve legislation\n       SEN. ALEXANDER: The American people know that it's not just \n     the voices of the Senator from Kansas or the Senator from \n     Iowa that are suppressed when the Majority Leader cuts off \n     the right to debate, and the right to amend. It's the voices \n     that we hear across this country, who want to be heard on the \n     Senate floor.\n       SEN. GREGG: You just can't have good governance if you \n     don't have discussion and different ideas brought forward.\n       SEN. DODD: Therefore to my fellow Senators, who have never \n     served a day in the minority, I urge you to pause in your \n     enthusiasm to change Senate rules.\n       SEN. REID: The Filibuster is far from A `Procedural \n     Gimmick.' It's part of the fabric of this institution that we \n     call the Senate. For 200 years we've had the right to extend \n     the debate. It's not procedural gimmick. Some in this chamber \n     want to throw out 214 years of Senate history in the quest \n     for absolute power. They want to do away with Mr. Smith, as \n     depicted in that great movie, being able to come to \n     Washington. They want to do away with the filibuster. They \n     think they're wiser than our Founding Fathers, I doubt that's \n     true.\n       FORMER SEN. OBAMA: Then if the Majority chooses to end the \n     filibuster, if they choose to change the rules and put an end \n     to Democratic debate, then the fighting and the bitterness \n     and the gridlock will only get worse.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will respond to my friend from Tennessee who makes \ncogent arguments, as he always does. He is a good friend of mine, and \nwe have worked together on a lot of things. I hope this is the \nbeginning of some colloquies we can have here. I do want to indulge and \nlet other Senators have their say because they were so kind to let me \nhave my say too. But I intend to be here as long as anybody wants to \nsay anything or to engage in some colloquies here on the Senate floor.\n  I say to my friend from Tennessee, that as I listened to him, and I \ndid very carefully, there are a couple of things I want to point out in \nterms of this idea of a filibuster and being able to amend things. My \nfriend referred many times to the health care bill. I do not know if my \nfriend said this, but I have heard it said that we wrote it behind \nclosed doors and all of that kind of stuff.\n  Let me point out that when it came to our committee, the HELP \nCommittee, we had 13 days of markup, 54 hours. We allowed any amendment \nto be offered. The Senator is a member of that committee. We allowed \nany Senator on our committee to offer any amendment. We adopted 161 \nRepublican amendments, either through some votes, which they won, or \nthrough just adopting the amendments. Then after that, after all of \nthat, all Republicans voted no. That is fine. There are a lot of times \nI know in the past when I have had an amendment on a bill which I \nthought improved it, but overall I did not like the bill, and I voted \nagainst it. I think that is the right of the minority. But then to \nobstruct it and to try to obstruct it to keep it from even being \nenacted I do not think is right. So I would say to my friend that I do \nnot think the health care bill is a good example.\n  I say to my friend, he quoted someone, I think maybe it may have been \nSenator Reid, saying, do people think they are wiser than our Founding \nFathers. Please show me where our Founding Fathers ever set up a system \nwhere the Senate could have unlimited debate? They never did that. It \nis not in the Constitution.\n  As I pointed out, the first Senate actually had the motion, the \nprevious question, to cut off debate. And they did not set up a \nmajoritarian House. Article I section 5, I say to my friend from \nTennessee, article I, section 5 is very clear. Each House sets up its \nrules. If the new majority in the House wanted to, they could set up \nrules to be like the Senate. They could do that. They could set up \nrules however they wanted, as long as they were constitutional. I \nsuppose someone could take it to court to see if it was constitutional. \nBut they do not have to operate under those rules. We do not have to \noperate under these rules. The Constitution gives us the right to \nchange those rules.\n  Our Founding Fathers never set up this system, by the way, never. \nThere is no mention of it anywhere in the Constitution. They did not \nset up a majoritarian House, they set up article I, section 5, which \nsaid each House can set up its own rules. But then in the Constitution, \nthey outlined certain prerogatives. The Senate has certain \nprerogatives, the House has certain prerogatives, such as, for example, \nall bills of revenue have to originate in the House, not in the Senate. \nTreaties are done by the Senate, not by the House. But they never set \nup any kind of majoritarian type of thing.\n  I say to my friend, on the filibuster, I think there is a reason for \na filibuster. I think there ought to be filibusters. I think there \nought to be times when the minority can slow down things in order to \nget their views heard, or in order for them to be able to offer \namendments, to make the bill better, in their views. That is the right \nof the minority.\n  I do not think it is the right of any minority--I say minority. When \nI say that, I am not talking about Republicans. I am saying any \nminority here. I do not think it is the right of any minority here to \nsay, if I do not get my way, I am going stop everything. That is kind \nof what I see happening around here. If I do not get my way, one \nSenator can stop things.\n  I point out one other bill, I say to my friend from Tennessee, that I \nthought was a great bipartisan bill. We worked hard on it in our \ncommittee. The Senator from Tennessee was instrumental. That was the \nfood safety bill. We reported it out of our committee a year ago in \nNovember, unanimous vote. Everyone voted for it, Republicans and \nDemocrats on our committee. We got it out. But there were some things \nin the bill that Senators not on our committee, and maybe one Senator \non our committee, did not like. So we had to work through the ensuing \nmonths to get everybody onboard and to work it out, which is fine. I \nhave no problems with that. That is the legislative process. I have \npatience. As my friend from Kansas knows, I have a lot of patience \nworking on farm bills. They take time.\n  But we worked it all out. And yet one Senator, one Senator who really \ndisagreed with it, was able to hold it up from coming on the floor. We \nfinally got it on the floor, but it took almost a year. One Senator was \nable to do that.\n  So I say, one Senator should be able to have the right to offer \namendments, to be heard, but not to stop everything. I guess that is \nwhat I come down to, I say to my friend from Tennessee, that there \nought to be a--I think there is a reason and a good reason for the \nSenate to be that saucer that cools things down, the story about \nJefferson and Washington. But it should be at some point in time where \nthe majority has not only the authority but the power to act after a \ndue consideration and a due period of time.\n  I believe, I say to my friend in all sincerity, that will promote \nmore compromise than the present system. You may disagree, but I feel \nthat would. I am not trying to take away compromise. I believe in \ncompromise. I believe in working things out. As chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee for two farm bills, we worked things out. I am \nsure there were things in the farm bill that the Senator from Kansas \ndid not like, and there were things in there that I did not like, even \nthough I was chairman. But you work these things out. You compromise \nand you get things done. So I believe in that spirit of compromise. But \nI think what we have here now--and that escalating arms race--is doing \naway with that spirit of compromise and working things out and moving \nthings. That is why I think we have to change the rules.\n  I do not know if I adequately responded to my friend from Tennessee, \nbut these were my thoughts at the end. I am looking forward to other \ncomments from other Senators and engaging in our colloquies. I promise \nI will not take so long.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their pertinent \nremarks.\n  The Senator from Iowa said in the past he had entered into a colloquy \nwith colleagues on our side of the aisle where they wandered over into \neach other's pastures. I am going to put down this microphone for a \nmoment and speak from here in a gesture of bipartisanship on how we can \nimprove the Senate.\n  I know we have heard a lot of talk about Robert C. Byrd, a beloved \nindividual. I know the Presiding Officer\n\n[[Page S30]]\n\nwas very close to the former Senator. The last time Bob Byrd spoke \npublicly was in the rules committee, when he rose to the occasion in a \nvery passionate way. The chairman, of course, Chuck Schumer, the \nSenator from New York, with great deference recognized Senator Byrd. We \nwere all on the edge of our chairs. The Senator from Tennessee has \nalready gone over what Senator Byrd said at that time and previously. \nBut I remember when I first came to the Senate, it was required that we \ngo to school, so to speak, and Senator Byrd talked to all of the \nfreshmen at that particular time.\n  The keeper of the institutional flame was the tag I put on Senator \nByrd. My wife Franki and I became very close friends of the Senator. At \nany rate, he recounted the story attributed to Jefferson and \nWashington, he would tell every incoming class about the role of the \npeople's House and perhaps what happened, when they put the coffee pot \non in regards to legislation, that the coffee was so hot it would boil \nover, and it was the Senate's duty to act as the saucer, as folks did \nback in West Virginia in the earlier days, or Kansas or Iowa or \nTennessee or Texas, that they would pour the coffee out in the saucer \nand let it cool off a little bit so they could put their biscuit in it \nand actually eat it, and then the legislation would pass.\n  The problem is, sometimes on our side maybe we want tea, maybe we \nwant to start over. I think the Senator from Tennessee basically hit \nthe nail on the head with the massive three. If we are going to talk \nabout getting things done or not getting things done, there are three \nmassive things that have happened with regard to legislation. I say \n``massive'' because they were so overreaching, so overwhelming, we are \nnow just learning what their implications are. The massive three are \nfinancial regulatory reform, the health care act, and the stimulus.\n  Now the health care act, I have a personal feeling about that in that \nI had 11 amendments, all on rationing.\n  By the way, the Senate never confirmed the nomination of Dr. Donald \nBerwick, the head of CMS, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices. We planned to ask a lot of questions to the doctor because of \nstatements he made in the past. Obviously, that confirmation did not \nhappen. He was a recess appointment. That is something I think we ought \nto deal with as well.\n  Now, the health care act, it was 12:30 in the morning in the Finance \nCommittee. I had several amendments, all on rationing. Finally, we got \nto the last two. I said: Why don't we consider them en bloc? I had \nabout a minute or two to explain each amendment. They were voted down \nautomatically on a party-line vote. By the time we got to 12:30 or 1 \no'clock and my amendments, I noticed Senator Schumer was in the room so \nI stuck on one of his amendments along with mine. It was defeated on a \nparty-line vote. Then I let Senator Schumer know that we had defeated \nhis amendment as well. He wasn't too happy with that.\n  I just showed that the process has broken down to the point that even \nin committee, if you had two amendments, if you had five, if you had \none, you were simply ignored. Then the health care act came to the \nfloor and worked its way. I think the Senator from Tennessee brought up \nthe ``Grand Ole Opry.'' I saw it as making a bill behind closed doors. \nThat is a famous country western song. We didn't like that process at \nall.\n  I finally had only one other recourse and that was to go to the \nreconciliation process, which I knew was not going to be successful, \nbut I had several amendments, all were defeated. My main concerns about \nthe health care bill were not allowed, as far as I was concerned, on \nthe floor of the Senate, and that has happened a lot.\n  Now we are seeing an effort to repeal the health care act and also an \neffort to try to fix it, if we possibly can. I am not as upset about \nthat as some people are because I think we could get the proper kind of \ndebate, but the debate must proceed in regular order and under the \nstanding rules of the Senate as a continuing body.\n  I am not going to go into the quotes by Senator Byrd. That has \nalready been done by Senator Alexander. But I would like to quote \nSenator Dodd in his valedictory speech.\n\n       The history of this young democracy, the Framers decided, \n     should not be written solely in the hand of the majority.\n\n  This isn't about the filibuster. That is the most important statement \nhe made.\n\n       What will determine whether this institution works or not \n     is whether each of the 100 Senators can work together.\n\n  How can we do that? Here is a classic example. Right before \nChristmas, there were several bills the majority wanted to pass without \nallowing the minority and the American people the right to debate or \namend them. So the tree was filled, and that is the parliamentary \nlanguage to say: I am sorry, we are going to cut off debate. In the \nfirst three years and four months of this majority, the use of filling \nthe tree went up over 300 percent compared to the average for the \nprevious 22 years. Ninety-eight times in the 110th Congress, cloture \nwas filed the moment the question was raised on the floor. A debate was \nnot even allowed to take place. So on one hand you can talk about \nfilibusters; the other hand is filling the tree, or not allowing \nMembers to offer amendments, and same day clotures.\n  The Senator from Tennessee offered the classic example. Let's go back \nto a few days ago, right before Christmas. The DREAM Act was a House \nbill. I know the Senate leadership wanted to pass it. It never had a \nlegislative hearing in the House, never had a markup in the House. The \nSenate version of the DREAM Act had not had a markup since 2003. In \nsum, the DREAM Act, a controversial measure with very passionate \nbeliefs on both sides of the aisle and within the parties as well had \nnot had an amendment offered to it in either House of Congress either \nin committees or on the floor.\n  Some may believe the DREAM Act is perfect or certainly is the best \nbill possible and would not need any amendments to improve it. But, \nobviously, our constituents don't feel that way. It is a very \ncontroversial bill. Instead of addressing their concerns, the majority \nshut down debate and amendments and in the process shut down the rights \nof Americans to be heard. As a result, the minority refused to end \ndebate and, obviously, there was a filibuster. It would be interesting \nto know, of the times that bills have been filibustered, what was being \nfilibustered.\n  Contrast this with the approach taken on the 9/11 bill which the \nmajority sought to pass just a few days later. The goal of providing \nhelp to the victims of 9/11 is one Members of both parties share, but \nSenate Republicans noted that the particular version of the bill Senate \nDemocrats supported was problematic in regards to how much money we \nwere spending and certainly would need improvement.\n  So we insisted on having our concerns addressed. Most of them were \naddressed with a revised bill on which we did provide input. That bill \npassed the Senate by unanimous consent, and even the proponents of the \noriginal legislation would admit that the final bill is a better one \nand now enjoys broader support due to the minority's input.\n  What I think the majority needs to do is involve the minority like it \ndid on the 9/11 bill, not shut us out, not shut us down as it did on \nthe DREAM Act and other acts.\n  If that happened, if we did not fill the tree, I think possibly 75 \npercent, 80 percent of the filibusters would go away. There are some \nwho would like to filibuster anything, I know. But it gets back to what \nthe Senator asked: Why are we here? It is important to pass \nlegislation. But it is equally important to prevent bad legislation \nfrom passing or, if you have an alternative you would like to offer, to \nat least have the ability to do so.\n  In the last 2 years that process has simply broken down. Why can't we \nwork together? That is what Senator Dodd said. He asked whether each of \nthe 100 Senators can work together. That was on the question of \nfilibusters.\n  We can stop this business of secret holds. It seems to me we could \nhave a timely pace on nominations. It seems to me we could certainly \nend these recess appointments where people who should be confirmed have \nto go through the confirmation process instead of all of a sudden \nparachuting somebody in who is controversial and now we have over \n100,000 regulations pouring out of the Department of HHS. Health care \nproviders throughout the Nation--in Iowa, Tennessee, Kansas--are \nwondering what on Earth is happening.\n\n[[Page S31]]\n\n  When I go home, I don't get the question of why a bill didn't pass. I \nget the question: What on Earth are you guys doing back there passing \nall the legislation with all the regulatory stuff that I have to put up \nwith, taxes I have to pay, et cetera, et cetera?\n  As a matter of fact, when they pose that question, I say: I am not a \nyou guy; I am an us guy. Then we have a debate, but it is a debate that \nshould have taken place on the floor of the Senate instead of on the \nplains of Kansas. Unfortunately, because of the majority, we were not \nable to have that debate here, on the floor.\n  The question I have for the distinguished Senator from Iowa--and I \nappreciate his reference to our work in previous farm bills. We were \nable to work it out. Sometimes it was very contentious, and sometimes \nthe farm bill would come to the floor, and it would take a week and a \nhalf. Then we would have an appropriations bill, and then the \nappropriators would think they could rewrite the farm bill and take \nanother week and a half. But we worked through it. Nobody filled the \ntree and said: I am sorry, you can't have that amendment.\n  I am making a speech instead of asking the question. I apologize for \nthat.\n  I am in agreement on secret holds. I think there should be timely \npace on nominations. I do think we should go through the regular \nconfirmation process.\n\n  But I do feel exactly as the Senator from Tennessee has put out, that \nonce you get on this business of ending the filibuster or going down on \nthe number of requisite votes, you are on a slippery slope, and then \nyou are into the tyranny of the majority, and that is not what the \nSenate is all about.\n  I will stop at this point and ask the Senator from Iowa if he has any \ncomments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I thank my friend from Kansas. I think \nhe makes some good points.\n  I would say to my friend, I think we ought to go through processes in \nour committees to have hearings on nominees to flush out things such as \nthat. So to that extent, the Senator from Kansas is right. We should \nnot have, especially if there is any controversy at all--I suppose some \nof them are noncontroversial--but if there is some controversy out \nthere, yes, I think the committees ought to have the responsibility to \nbring them forward. Let the committees question them. We did that in \nour HELP Committee, I say to my friend from Kansas. I am trying to \nremember the person we had--oh, a lot of controversy about Craig \nBecker, I think, who was going to the NLRB.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If the Senator will yield, I think the Senator is \nexactly right. I am on the HELP Committee, as the Senator may recall, \nand I was trying to get one amendment to say that we would prohibit the \nuse of rationing to achieve cost containment, and it involved several \nof the commissions that have been in the bill. I regret that bill sort \nof sat somewhere and collected dust. We never got a score. I thought it \nwas, quite frankly, a better bill than the one in the Finance \nCommittee.\n  I say to the Senator, you recognized me, and I had an opportunity to \noffer some amendments. At least there was some debate. And I think it \nwas a much more bipartisan effort. So I give the chairman----\n  Mr. HARKIN. If it was out of our committee, obviously it was a better \nbill than coming out of the Finance Committee. But I say to my friend, \nagain, that----\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Senator Cornyn wants to be heard, so I am going to be \nquiet and listen to you.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thought there were some things we should talk about. I \nsay to my friend, in listening to my friend from Kansas say this, it \noccurred to me that certain of his amendments were allowed. The Senator \nwas allowed to debate them and offer them, but they were not adopted. \nIt seems to me, as I have said before, the right of the minority ought \nto be to offer amendments, to have them considered, to have them voted \non, but it does not mean it is the right of the minority to win every \ntime on those amendments.\n  I say to my friend, on that financial services bill, I had an \namendment too and I could not get it in. I was on the majority side, \nand they would not let me offer one either. So both sides have some \nlegitimate points.\n  I also say to my friend from Kansas, and others, we can get into this \ntit for tat, who started it. I think we have to kind of quit that. I \ncould come back and say: Well, yes, in the last 2 years, the tree was \nfilled 44 times. In this last session, 44 times the tree was filled, \nbut there were 136 filibusters. Why wouldn't there be 44 filibusters? \nWhy were there 136? We can get into that tit for tat, who did what to \nwhom. I wish to forget about all that. We could go back, probably, to \nthe 18th century--tit for tat, who did what to whom at some point in \ntime.\n  I ask my friend from Kansas, who has been here a long time--we served \ntogether in the House; my friend was chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee in the House. We have done a lot of legislation together--\ndoes my friend from Kansas feel the Senate is operating today in the \nbest possible way? Does my friend from Kansas believe there could be \nsome things done to make the Senate operate a little bit more openly \nand fairly with rights for the minority to be protected but without \nletting the minority--and I do not mean Republicans when I say \n``minority,'' I mean whoever happens to be in the minority--to keep the \nminority from obstructing things? Does my friend feel there could be \nsome changes made?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I will answer the question, no. I do not think we are \ndoing the job we could do, and we should do better, and I stand ready \nto work with all concerned to see if we can do that.\n  But my time is up, and I am going to cease here and allow the Senator \nfrom Texas to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, may I inquire how much more time there \nis on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three-and-a-half minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I am going to ask unanimous consent, \nwith the indulgence of my colleagues, to allow me to speak for up to 10 \nminutes. I probably will speak about 5 minutes or so, unless I get \nparticularly wound up, which could take 10 minutes. But I ask unanimous \nconsent for an additional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I think we are playing with fire when we talk about \namending the Senate rules. All of us have been here for different \nperiods of time. I have been here for 8 years, which actually sounds \nlike a long time, but in the life of the Senate is not very long at all \nin an institution that has existed for more than 200 years.\n  I have been here when our side was in the majority. As a matter of \nfact, we had the White House, we had both Houses of Congress. And I \nhave been here when we have had President Obama in the White House and \nDemocrats controlling both Houses of Congress. I can tell you, \nunequivocally, it is a whole lot more fun to be here when you are in \nthe majority.\n  But there are certain temptations that the majority has which I think \nare exacerbated when, for example, during most of the last 2 years, one \nparty or the other has the ability in the Senate to basically pass \nlegislation by essentially a party-line vote; in other words, as I \nrecall on that morning at 7 a.m. on Christmas Eve a year ago, when the \nvote on the health care bill came up where all 60 Democrats voted for \nthe bill and no Republicans voted for the bill.\n  My point being: The temptation is, when you have such a large \nmajority--60 or more--there is a huge temptation in both parties--not \njust the Democrats; Republicans, I am sure, would be tempted as well--\nto try to go it alone. Thus, I think it detracts from what is one of \nthe great strengths of this institution, which is that this \ninstitution's rules force consensus, and unless there is consensus, \nthings do not happen. We are, thus, the saucer that cools the tea from \nthe cup, and all the various analogies we have heard.\n  But the important thing is not how this affects us as individual \nSenators. This is not just an abstract discussion about the rules. This \nis about what is in the best interests of a country of\n\n[[Page S32]]\n\nmore than 300 million people. I would submit any time one party or the \nother is not only tempted but yields to that temptation to go it alone \nto try to push legislation through without achieving that consensus, I \nthink it hurts the institution and I think it provokes a backlash, much \nas we saw on November 2. Because the American people understand that \nchecks and balances are important.\n  When we do not have checks and balances, either through the self-\nrestraint of the majority or through recognizing the rights of the \nminority to offer amendments, to have debates, to contribute to \nlegislation, then the American people are going to fix that by changing \nthe balance of power, as they did on November 2.\n  Here again, I do not want to be misunderstood as making a partisan \nargument. I think Republicans would be just as tempted as Democrats to \ndo the same thing. But I think that is where we have to show self-\nrestraint and where, if we do not show self-restraint, then the \nAmerican people will change the balance of power and establish those \nchecks and balances.\n  Here again, I think for most people who are listening--if there is \nanyone listening out there on C-SPAN or elsewhere to this debate--this \nshould not be about us. This should not be about the arcana of these \nrules. This should be about the rights of the American people to get \nlegislation that affects all 300-plus million of us debated, amended, \nin a way to try to achieve that consensus and, thus, achieves broad \nsupport by the American people. Because anytime, again, we yield to the \ntemptation to go it alone to do things on a partisan basis, it will \nultimately provoke the kind of backlash we have seen over the health \ncare bill, to mention one example.\n  This is not a small thing. I have the honor of representing 25 \nmillion people in the Senate, and this is not just about my rights as \nan individual Senator or even the minority's rights, this is about \ntheir right--their right to be heard through an adequate time for \ndebate, their right to have an opportunity to change or amend \nlegislation, and then to have a chance to have it voted on.\n  I understand the frustration of our colleagues when the majority \nleader, due to his right of prior recognition, can get the floor. He \ncan put something on the Senate calendar that has not gone through a \ncommittee markup and that sort of due process and fair opportunity for \namendment and participation; and then again, if he has 60 votes on his \nside to be able to push it through, then deny us any opportunity to \noffer amendments, much less to have a fulsome debate on these important \nissues.\n  I think our country suffers from that. I think the American people \nsuffer when we are denied on their behalf an opportunity to have a \nfulsome debate and to offer amendments.\n  I do not doubt the good faith of our colleagues who are offering some \nof these propositions. There are even some of them that I find somewhat \nattractive. The idea of secret holds, for example--if there ever was a \ntime for that, that time is long past gone. I know we are not going to \nagree on everything. But we ought to at least have an opportunity for \neveryone to be heard, and for individual Senators' rights to be \nrespected, not because they are Senators but because they represent a \nlarge segment of the American people, and it is their rights that are \nimpinged when the majority leader, for whatever reason, decides to deny \na Senator a right to offer an amendment and a right to have a fulsome \ndebate on the amendment in the interest of getting legislation passed.\n  Although Senator Reid said this morning the 111th Congress has to go \ndown in history as being one of the most productive Congresses, at the \nsame time, he complained about Republicans filibustering legislation. \nThere seems to be kind of an inherent contradiction there. But I \nsuggest the explanation for that is the fact that our friends on the \nother side have had such a large supermajority, they have been able to \nmuster the 60 votes and to go it alone. Again, I think that is yielding \nto a temptation that everyone would understand, and the American people \nhave now since corrected that as a result of the November 2 election.\n  I would suggest, in closing, to all of our friends on both sides of \nthe aisle, again, I recognize the sincerity of those who have offered \nthese proposals, but I would suggest there is not a malfunction, or \nshould I say the rules themselves are not broken, but the rules \ncontemplate that the rules will not be abused. I think the temptation \nto abuse those rules by going it alone is understandable but something \nthat needs to be avoided. I think because of the election now--since we \nare more evenly divided so nobody will be able to get to 60 votes \nunless there is a bipartisan consensus, to the extent that 60 votes are \nneeded--that the American people have sort of fixed the problem some of \nour colleagues have perceived.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend from Texas. Again, he and I have worked \ntogether on some legislation in the past too. He is a thoughtful \nSenator and a good legislator.\n  I ask my friend from Texas this: In listening to him, I almost have \nthe feeling that my friend from Texas is saying we ought to have a \nsupermajority to pass anything, that we should have 60 votes in order \nto pass anything.\n  I ask my friend, is that what my friend really means or implies, that \neverything should have 60 votes before it can go through here? Is that \nwhat my friend is suggesting?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I appreciate the question from my friend, the Senator \nfrom Iowa. That is not what I am suggesting. But I do think we need to \nhave a process which allows for an opportunity for amendments and \ndebate. And if we do not have a process requiring a threshold of 60 \nvotes, the temptation is going to be, again, for the majority leader to \ndeny the opportunity for amendments, constrict time allowed for an \namendment, for debate, by filing cloture, and we are going to see \nthings shooting through here that have not had an adequate opportunity \nfor deliberation.\n  This institution has famously been called the world's greatest \ndeliberative body, but I daresay we have not demonstrated that in \nrecent memory. And, again, I think, as the Senator from Tennessee and \nothers have observed, this is not a problem with the rules. This is the \nway the rules have actually been implemented. I think we have learned \nan important lesson from this and one I hope will help us respect the \nrights of all Senators, whether they be in the majority or the \nminority, to offer amendments and to debate these amendments not \nbecause they are about our rights but because they are about the \nrights, for example, of the 25 million people I represent. They have \nthe right to be heard. They have a right to have any suggestions or \nimprovements to legislation be considered. That is all I am saying.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, if my friend will yield further, again, \nin my resolution there is a guarantee that the minority has the right \nto offer amendments--absolute guarantee. As I said, that is something I \nhave urged since 1995. I am very sympathetic to the argument that \npeople are cut out from offering amendments. I know because that has \nhappened to me by the majority at times. So I believe there ought to be \nrights for the minority. I always hasten to add when I say ``minority'' \nI am not saying Republicans, I am saying the minority. It may be us \npretty soon. It goes back and forth, as my friends knows. There ought \nto be the right for the minority to offer amendments and to have their \nvoice heard and to, as the Senator says, represent the people of our \nStates adequately.\n  But I ask my friend again, what happens when we have one or two or \nthree or four Senators who don't want to see a bill passed in any \nform--some bill, just take any bill--that maybe has been worked on by \nboth Republicans and Democrats, has broad bipartisan support maybe to \nthe tune of even 70 or so Senators, but there is one or two or three \nSenators who don't want it to pass anyway, and they are able to \ngridlock the place under rule XXII. I know the Senator talked about \nexercising self-restraint, and I say that is fine. But what if we had \nthat situation where we have two or three Senators saying: I don't care \nhow many Senators are on it I don't want it to move. And\n\n[[Page S33]]\n\nthey invoke their rights under rule XXII. How do we get over that \nhurdle?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I would say to my friend the people who \ncame before us thought achieving consensus was good, not unanimity, \nperhaps recognizing it is impossible to get 100 Senators to agree. So I \nwould say to my friend I sometimes am as frustrated as he is when one \nor two or three or four Senators say: We are going to force this to a \ncloture vote because we are just not going to agree. I think that is \nfrustrating to all of us, depending on which foot the shoe is on.\n  But I would say that is a small price to pay, that frustration, to \ninsist on assuring the rights of the minority--again, not because of an \nindividual Senator because we aren't all that important. It is the \nrights of our constituents whom we represent that are so important, and \nit is so important we get it right because there is nobody else after \nwe get through who gets to vote. It becomes the law of the land, and \nunless it is unconstitutional not even the Supreme Court of the United \nStates can set it aside. So it is very important we get it right. I am \njust saying that we take the time necessary, and I think that is what \nthe rules are designed to provide for.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, if the Senator would indulge me for one \nmore moment, so it is not the position of my friend from Texas that \neverything needs 60 votes in which to move in the Senate; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, there are a long list of bills that pass \non a regular basis by unanimous consent, and it is like--we are almost \nfocused on the exception rather than the rule. There are many times--a \nlot of times; I can't quantify it--where legislation will pass by \nunanimous consent because it has gone through the committees, people \nhave had an opportunity to offer amendments, both sides have had an \nopportunity to contribute to it, and then it passes without objection. \nAgain, I can't quantify that, but the ones we seem to be focused on are \nthe ones that seem to be more or less the exception to the rule where \nthere are genuine disagreements, when there is a need to have a more \nfulsome debate and the opportunity for amendments.\n  So I think the current rules serve the interests of our constituents \nand the American people well.\n  I thank the Chair and I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/05/senate-section/article/S33-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S33]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, Senator Udall and Senator Merkley have \nwaited at great length to make their remarks. I wish to propound a \nunanimous consent at this time. At this point, Senator Udall would be \nthe next speaker. There would be a Republican who would speak next. I \nam very hopeful it will be Senator Grassley because he and I have been \npartners for almost 14 years in this effort to force the Senate to do \npublic business in public and get rid of these secret holds. So after \nSenator Udall, there would be Senator Grassley. After Senator Grassley, \nthere would be my friend and colleague Senator Merkley who would speak. \nAt that time there would be a Republican who would be next in the queue \nto speak.\n  So my unanimous consent request at that point is--I would like to be \nable, for up to 30 minutes, to have the bipartisan sponsors of the \neffort to get rid of secret holds once and for all, including the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer, to have up to 30 minutes for a \ncolloquy on this bipartisan effort to eliminate secret holds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any time limits on the UC motion for \nany Senators other than the 30 minutes designated for the cosponsors of \nthe secret hold legislation?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, in addition to his UC, we \nhave myself for 15 minutes, Senator Merkley for 15 minutes, and I \nbelieve Senator Wyden has asked for 30, and then to accommodate the \nRepublicans, our UC would say if there is a Republican seeking \nrecognition that we alternate between the two sides and they be under \nthe same time limitations as listed above. So Senator Alexander can see \nI would speak for 15, and then he would have a block for 15, and then \nSenator Merkley, and then it would be 30 for Senator Wyden.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Then, after Senator Merkley, there would be another \nRepublican who would be in a position to speak for 15 minutes, and at \nthat point under the unanimous consent request we would be able to \ndiscuss this bipartisan effort to eliminate secret holds for up to 30 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I wonder if the Senator would mind a \nslight modification to that. One of the things I thought we were kind \nof getting into today were colloquies wherein we could ask a question \nand have a response in a reasonable manner. I would ask to modify the \nunanimous consent request to say that any colloquies entered into--\nquestions propounded to a Senator through the Chair--not be detracted \nfrom the time allotted to that Senator.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am very open to that. I think it is an excellent \nsuggestion.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I very much agree with that. I have been \nsitting here following the debate, and I think Senator Alexander, among \nothers, has propounded some very good questions. I actually have \nanother question I was going to ask on top of his question of what is a \nfilibuster. So I am looking forward to that portion of it. Senator \nHarkin, thank you very much for that.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I think Senator Harkin has made an \nexcellent suggestion. Unless Senator Alexander or anyone on the other \nside has a problem with that, let's modify the unanimous consent \nrequest I have made to incorporate Senator Harkin's suggestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/05/senate-section/article/S33-2", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S33-S54]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         AMENDING SENATE RULES\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I submit on behalf of \nmyself and Senators Harkin, Merkley, Durbin, Klobuchar, Brown, Begich, \nBlumenthal, Gillibrand, Shaheen, Boxer, Tester, Cardin, Mikulski, \nWarner, and Manchin a resolution to amend rule VIII and rule XXII of \nthe Standing Rules of the Senate, and I ask unanimous consent to \nproceed to the immediate consideration of the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I have \nhad a number of discussions with the Senator from New Mexico and the \nSenator from Oregon. I respect their proposals and will have more to \nsay about them, but I think since they have waited such a long time to \nmake their presentations I will merely state my objection now and have \nmore to say later. So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection having been heard, the \nresolution will go over under the rule.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, let me just inquire through \nthe Parliamentarian, it is my understanding that by objecting to this \nresolution being immediately considered now, the result is the \nresolution will go over under the rule, allowing it to be available to \nbe brought up at a future time. Is that understanding correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Thank you very much.\n  Madam President, I rise today to introduce the resolution I just \nmentioned. I have worked very hard with all of my colleagues, including \nmy two colleagues from Iowa and Oregon, Senators Harkin and Merkley, to \nreform the rules of this unique and prestigious body. I do so after \ncoming to the floor last January--January 25, in fact, now almost 1 \nyear ago--to issue a warning, a warning because of partisan rancor and \nthe Senate's own incapacitating rules, that this body was failing to \nrepresent the best interests of the American people. The unprecedented \nabuse of the filibuster, of secret holds, and of other procedural \ntactics routinely prevent the Senate from getting its work done. It \nprevents us from doing the job the American people sent us here to do.\n  Since that day in January things haven't gotten better. In fact, I \nwould\n\n[[Page S34]]\n\nsay they have gotten worse--much worse. Here in the Senate open and \nhonest debate has been replaced with secret backroom deals and partisan \ngridlock. Up-or-down votes on important issues have been unreasonably \ndelayed and blocked entirely at the whim of a single Senator. Last \nyear, for example, one committee had almost every piece of legislation \nheld up by holds from one Senator.\n  The Senate is broken. In the Congress that just ended, because of \nrampant and growing obstruction, not a single appropriations bill was \npassed. There wasn't a budget bill. Only one authorization bill was \napproved, and that was only done at the very last minute. More than 400 \nbills on a variety of important issues were sent over from the House. \nNot a single one was acted upon. Key judicial nominations and executive \nappointments continue to languish.\n  The American people are fed up with it. They are fed up with us, and \nI don't blame them. We need to bring the workings of the Senate out of \nthe shadows and restore its accountability. That begins with addressing \nour own dysfunction, specifically the source of that dysfunction--the \nSenate rules.\n  Last year the Senate Rules Committee took a hard look at how our \nrules have become so abused and how this Chamber no longer functions as \nour Founders intended. I applaud Chairman Schumer and his excellent \nstaff for devoting so much time to this important issue. I thank \nSenator Alexander and Senator Roberts. We have some very good \nRepublican colleagues on the committee, and we have had some good \nexchanges. They know we had six hearings and heard from some of the \nmost respected experts in the field.\n  But these hearings demonstrated that the rules are not broken for one \nparty, or for only the majority. Today the Democrats lament the abuse \nof the filibuster and the Republicans complain they are not allowed to \noffer amendments to legislation. Five years ago, those roles were \nreversed. Rather than continue on this destructive path, we should \nadopt rules that allow a majority to act while protecting the \nminority's right to be heard. Whichever party is in the majority, they \nmust be able to do the people's business.\n  I think that is what Senator Harkin spoke so persuasively to in his \ncomments on the filibuster--that the majority has to be able to govern. \nThe way the filibuster is being used the minority thwarts the \nmajority's ability to govern.\n  At a hearing in September, I testified before the committee about my \nprocedural plan for amending the Senate's rules--the constitutional \noption. Unlike the specific changes to the rules proposed by other \nSenators and experts, my proposal is to make the Senate of each \nCongress accountable for all of our rules. This is what the \nConstitution provides for, and it is what our Founders intended.\n\n  Rule XXII is the most obvious example of the need for reform. Last \namended in 1975, rule XXII demonstrates what happens when the Members \nof the current Senate have no ability to amend the rules adopted long \nago--rules that get abused.\n  I have said this before, but it bears repeating. Of the 100 Members \nof the Senate, only two of us have had the opportunity to vote on the \ncloture requirement in rule XXII--Senators Inouye and Leahy.\n  So if 98 of us haven't voted on the rule, what is the effect? Well, \nthe effect is that we are not held accountable when the rule gets \nabused, and with a requirement of 67 votes for any rules change that is \na whole lot of power without restraint.\n  But we can change this. We can restore accountability to the Senate. \nMany of my colleagues, as well as constitutional scholars, agree with \nme that a simple majority of the Senate can end debate--that is the \nfirst step--and adopt its rules at the beginning of a new Congress.\n  Critics of my position argue that the rules can only be changed in \naccordance with the current rules, and that rule XXII requires two-\nthirds of Senators present and voting to agree to end debate on a \nchange to the Senate rules.\n  Since this rule was first adopted in 1917, members of both parties \nhave rejected this argument on many occasions.\n  In fact, advisory rulings by Vice Presidents Nixon, Humphrey, and \nRockefeller, sitting as President of the Senate, have stated that a \nSenate, at the beginning of a Congress, is not bound by the cloture \nrequirement imposed by a previous Senate. They went on to say that each \nnew Senate may end debate on a proposal to adopt or amend the standing \nrules by a majority vote. That bears repeating--by a majority vote--\ncloture and amendment, majority vote.\n  Even in today's more partisan environment I hope my colleagues will \nextend to us the same courtesy, and our constitutional rights will be \nprotected as we continue to debate the various rules reform proposals \nat the beginning of this Congress.\n  In 2005, Senator Hatch--someone who understands constitutional issues \nperhaps better than any other Member of this Chamber--wrote the \nfollowing:\n\n       The compelling conclusion is that, before the Senate \n     readopts Rule XXII by acquiescence, a simple majority can \n     invoke cloture and adopt a rules change. This is the basis \n     for Vice President Nixon's advisory opinion in 1957. As he \n     outlined, the Senate's right to determine its procedural \n     rules derives from the Constitution itself and, therefore, \n     ``cannot be restricted or limited by rules adopted by a \n     majority of the Senate in a previous Congress.'' So it is \n     clear that the Senate, at the beginning of a new Congress, \n     can invoke cloture and amend its rules by a simple majority.\n\n  That was Senator Hatch's quote. As Senator Alexander and Senator \nCorker know, he was for many years chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nand I think that is a very powerful quote.\n  This is the basis for introducing our resolution today, just as \nreformers have done at the beginning of Congresses in the 1950s, 1960s, \nand 1970s, and it is why I am here on the floor on the first day--to \nmake clear I am not acquiescing to the rule XXII adopted by the Senate \nover 35 years ago. That Senate tried to tie the hands of all future \nSenates by leaving the requirement in rule XXII for two-thirds of the \nSenate to vote to end a filibuster on a rules change. But this is not \nwhat our Founders intended.\n  Article I, section 5 of the Constitution clearly states that ``each \nHouse may determine the Rules of its Proceedings.'' There is no \nrequirement for a supermajority to adopt our rules, and the \nConstitution makes it very clear when a supermajority is required to \nact. Therefore, any rule that prevents a majority in future Senates \nfrom being able to change or amend rules adopted in the past is \nunconstitutional.\n  The fact that we are bound by a supermajority requirement that was \nfirst established 93 years ago also violates the common law principle \nthat one legislature cannot bind its successors.\n  This principle goes back hundreds of years and has been upheld by the \nSupreme Court on numerous occasions. This is not a radical concept. The \nconstitutional option has a history dating back to 1917, and it has \nbeen a catalyst for bipartisan rules reform several times since then. \nThe constitutional option is our chance to fix rules that are being \nabused--rules that have encouraged obstruction like none ever seen \nbefore in this Chamber.\n  Amending our rules will not, as some have contended, make the Senate \nno different than the House. While many conservatives claim that the \nDemocrats are trying to abolish the filibuster, our resolution \nmaintains the rule but addresses its abuse. But, more importantly, the \nfilibuster was never part of the original Senate. The Founders made \nthis body distinct from the House in many ways, but the filibuster is \nnot one of them.\n  So here we are today on the first day of a new Congress offering a \nresolution to reform the Senate's rules. We don't intend to force a \nvote today; in fact, we hope that we can return from the break and \nspend some time on the floor debating our resolution, considering \namendments to make it better, and debating other resolutions. This \nshould not be a partisan exercise. I think almost every one of us who \nhave spoken today have said that. We know both sides have abused the \nrules, and now it is time for us to work together to fix them.\n  But we believe the Senate of the 112th Congress has two paths from \nwhich to choose. There is the first path: We do nothing and just hope \nthe spirit of bipartisanship and deliberation returns--the truth is we \nhave been\n\n[[Page S35]]\n\non this path for a while now, and I think the results are pretty \nclear--or we can take a second path: We can take a good, hard look at \nour rules, how they incentivize obstructionism, how they inhibit rather \nthan promote debate, and how they prevent bipartisan cooperation, and \nthen we should implement commonsense reforms to meet these challenges, \nreforms that will restore the uniquely deliberative nature of this \nbody, while also allowing it to function more efficiently.\n  I contend that we not only should but have a duty to choose the \nsecond path. We owe it to the American people and to the future of this \ninstitution we all serve.\n  The reform resolution we introduce today is our attempt at the second \npath. It contains five reforms that should garner broad, bipartisan \nsupport--if we can act for the good of the country and not the good of \nour parties.\n  The first two provisions in our resolution address the debate on \nmotions to proceed and secret holds. These are not new issues. Making \nthe motion to proceed nondebatable or limiting debate on such a motion \nhas had bipartisan support for decades and is often mentioned as a way \nto end the abuse of holds.\n  I was privileged to be here for Senator Byrd's final Rules Committee \nhearing, where he stated:\n\n       I have proposed a variety of improvements to Senate rules \n     to achieve a more sensible balance, allowing the majority to \n     function while still protecting minority rights. For example, \n     I have supported eliminating debate on the motion to proceed \n     to a matter . . . or limiting debate to a reasonable time on \n     such motions.\n\n  In January, 1979, Senator Byrd--then-majority leader--took to the \nSenate floor and said unlimited debate on a motion to proceed ``makes \nthe majority leader and the majority party the subject of the minority, \nsubject to the control and the will of the minority.''\n  Despite the moderate change that Senator Byrd proposed--limiting \ndebate on a motion to proceed to 30 minutes--it did not have the \nnecessary 67 votes to overcome a filibuster.\n  At the time, Senator Byrd argued that a new Senate should not be \nbound by that rule, stating:\n\n       The Constitution, in Article I, Section 5, says that each \n     House shall determine the rules of its proceedings. Now we \n     are at the beginning of Congress. This Congress is not \n     obliged to be bound by the dead hand of the past.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for \nanother 2 minutes--also recognizing the Republican side has speakers--\nto wrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, efforts to reform the \nmotion to proceed have continued since. In 1984, a bipartisan Study \nGroup on Senate Practices and Procedures recommended placing a 2-hour \nlimit on debate of a motion to proceed. That recommendation was \nignored.\n  In 1993, Congress convened the Joint Committee on the Organization of \nCongress. That was a bipartisan, bicameral attempt to look at Congress \nand determine how it can be a better institution. My predecessor, \nSenator Domenici, was the co-vice chairman of that committee. He was a \nlong-time Republican here, and he supported that.\n  The third provision in the resolution is included based on the \ncomments of Republicans at last year's Rules Committee hearings. Each \ntime Democrats complained about filibusters on motions to proceed, \nRepublicans responded that it was their only recourse because the \nmajority leader fills the amendment tree and prevents them from \noffering amendments. Our resolution provides a simple solution, \nguaranteeing the minority the right to offer amendments.\n  The fourth provision in the resolution, which Senator Merkley will \ncover extensively, is regarding the talking filibuster. We want to \nreplace a silent filibuster with a talking filibuster.\n  Finally, our resolution reduces postcloture time on nominations from \n30 hours to 1. Postcloture time is meant for debating and voting on \namendments--something that is not possible on nominations.\n  Instead, the minority now requires the Senate use this time simply to \nprevent it from moving on to other business.\n  These reforms will not, as some have contended, make the Senate the \nsame as the House. We understand, and respect, the Framers intent in \nstructuring the Senate to be a uniquely deliberative body. Minority \nrights are a critical piece to its unique operations. Which is exactly \nwhy they remain protected in our reform resolution.\n  But the current rules have done away with any deliberation and we \nhave instead become a uniquely dysfunctional body.\n  Our resolution will make actual debate a more common occurrence. It \nwould bring our legislative process into the light, and hopefully, it \nwould help restore the Senate's role as the ``world's greatest \ndeliberative body.''\n  With that, I will sum up and say that reform is badly needed. We have \na responsibility to the Constitution and to the American people to come \ntogether and fix the Senate. We were sent to Washington to tackle the \nNation's problems. But we find that the biggest problem to tackle is \nWashington itself.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial on the \nfilibuster that appeared in the Washington Post, and an op-ed piece in \nthe New York Times by Walter Mondale be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 2, 2011]\n\n                       Reform and the Filibuster\n\n       The new Senate will face one of its most momentous \n     decisions in its opening hours on Wednesday: a vote on \n     whether to change its rules to prohibit the widespread abuse \n     of the filibuster. Americans are fed up with Washington \n     gridlock. The Senate should seize the opportunity.\n       A filibuster--the catchall term for delaying or blocking a \n     majority vote on a bill by lengthy debate or other \n     procedures--remains a valuable tool for ensuring that a \n     minority of senators cannot be steamrollered into silence. No \n     one is talking about ending the practice.\n       Every returning Democratic senator, though, has signed a \n     letter demanding an end to the almost automatic way the \n     filibuster has been used in recent years. By simply raising \n     an anonymous objection, senators can trigger a 60-vote \n     supermajority for virtually every piece of legislation. The \n     time has come to make senators work for their filibusters, \n     and justify them to the public.\n       Critics will say that it is self-serving for Democrats to \n     propose these reforms now, when they face a larger and more \n     restive Republican minority. The facts of the growing \n     procedural abuse are clearly on their side. In the last two \n     Congressional terms, Republicans have brought 275 filibusters \n     that Democrats have been forced to try to break. That is by \n     far the highest number in Congressional history, and more \n     than twice the amount in the previous two terms.\n       These filibusters are the reason there was no budget passed \n     this year, and why as many as 125 nominees to executive \n     branch positions and 48 judicial nominations were never \n     brought to a vote. They have produced public policy that we \n     strongly opposed, most recently preserving the tax cuts for \n     the rich, but even bipartisan measures like the food safety \n     bill are routinely filibustered and delayed.\n       The key is to find a way to ensure that any minority \n     party--and the Democrats could find themselves there again--\n     has leverage in the Senate without grinding every bill to an \n     automatic halt. The most thoughtful proposal to do so was \n     developed by Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, along with Tom \n     Udall of New Mexico and a few other freshmen. It would make \n     these major changes:\n\n\n                          NO LAZY FILIBUSTERS\n\n       At least 10 senators would have to file a filibuster \n     petition, and members would have to speak continuously on the \n     floor to keep the filibuster going. To ensure the seriousness \n     of the attempt, the requirements would grow each day: five \n     senators would have to hold the floor for the first day, 10 \n     the second day, etc. Those conducting the filibuster would \n     thus have to make their case on camera. (A cloture vote of 60 \n     senators would still be required to break the blockade.)\n\n\n                        FEWER BITES OF THE APPLE\n\n       Republicans now routinely filibuster not only the final \n     vote on a bill, but the initial motion to even debate it, as \n     well as amendments and votes on conference committees. \n     Breaking each of these filibusters adds days or weeks to \n     every bill. The plan would limit filibusters to the actual \n     passage of a bill.\n\n\n                          MINORITY AMENDMENTS\n\n       Harry Reid, the majority leader, frequently prevents \n     Republicans from offering amendments because he fears they \n     will lead to more opportunities to filibuster. Republicans \n     say they mount filibusters because they are precluded from \n     offering amendments. This situation would be resolved by \n     allowing a fixed number of amendments from each side on a \n     bill, followed by a fixed amount of debate on each one.\n\n[[Page S36]]\n\n       Changing these rules could be done by a simple majority of \n     senators, but only on the first day of the session. \n     Republicans have said that ramming through such a measure \n     would reduce what little comity remains in the chamber.\n       Nonetheless, the fear of such a vote has led Republican \n     leaders to negotiate privately with Democrats in search of a \n     compromise, possibly on amendments. Any plan that does not \n     require filibustering senators to hold the floor and make \n     their case to the public would fall short. The Senate has \n     been crippled long enough.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 1, 2011]\n\n                      Resolved: Fix the Filibuster\n\n                         (By Walter F. Mondale)\n\n       Minneapolis, MN--We all have hopes for the New Year. Here's \n     one of mine: filibuster reform. It was around this time 36 \n     years ago--during a different recession--that I was part of a \n     bipartisan effort to reform Senate Rule 22, the cloture rule. \n     At the time, 67 votes were needed to cut off debate and thus \n     end a filibuster, and nothing was getting done. After long \n     negotiations, a compromise lowered to 6o the cloture vote \n     requirement on legislation and nominations. We hoped this \n     moderate change would preserve debate and deliberation while \n     avoiding paralysis, and for a while it did.\n       But it's now clear that our reform was insufficient for \n     today's more partisan, increasingly gridlocked Senate. In \n     2011, Senators should pull back the curtain on Senate \n     obstruction and once again amend the filibuster rules.\n       Reducing the number of votes to end a filibuster, perhaps \n     to 55, is one option. Requiring a filibustering senator to \n     actually speak on the Senate floor for the duration of a \n     filibuster would also help. So, too, would reforms that bring \n     greater transparency--like eliminating the secret ``holds'' \n     that allow senators to block debate anonymously.\n       Our country faces major challenges--budget deficits, high \n     unemployment and two wars, to name just a few--and needs a \n     functioning legislative branch to address these pressing \n     issues. Certainly some significant legislation passed in the \n     last two years, but too much else fell by the wayside. The \n     Senate never even considered some appropriations and \n     authorization bills, and failed to settle on a federal budget \n     for all of next year. Votes on this sort of legislation used \n     to be routine, but with the new frequency of the filibuster, \n     a supermajority is needed to pass almost anything. As a \n     result the Senate is arguably more dysfunctional than at any \n     time in recent history.\n       People give lots of reasons for not reforming the \n     filibuster. The minority often claims that it needs the \n     filibuster to ensure that its voice is heard, even though the \n     filibuster is now used to prevent debate from ever beginning. \n     What really gets me, though, is when opponents to reform \n     point to the provision left in Rule 22 after 1975 saying that \n     the Senate cannot change any of its rules without a two-\n     thirds supermajority to end debate.\n       This requirement cannot constrain any future Senate. A \n     long-standing principle of common law holds that one \n     legislature cannot bind its successors. If changing Senate \n     rules really required a two-thirds supermajority, it would \n     effectively prevent a simple majority of any Senate from ever \n     amending its own rules, which would be unconstitutional. \n     Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution states: ``Each House \n     may determine the rules of its proceedings.'' The document is \n     very explicit about the few instances where a supermajority \n     vote is needed -- and changing the Senate's procedural rules \n     is not among them. In all other instances it must be assumed \n     that the Constitution requires only a majority vote.\n       In other words, the fact that one Senate, decades ago, \n     passed the two-thirds majority rule does not mean that all \n     future Senates are bound by it. This year's new Senate could \n     use this ``constitutional option'' to force a vote on any \n     change to Senate rules, including Rule 22, and change them \n     with a simple majority.\n       At the very opening of Congress in 1975, my colleagues and \n     I announced our proposal to amend Rule 22, and threatened to \n     force a majority vote to end a filibuster on the change if \n     the minority tried to block it. In the end, we reached the \n     60-vote compromise, and never had to use the constitutional \n     option after all. A similar strategy would likely work today.\n       Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, has said that in a few \n     days, at the beginning of the 112th Congress, he will call on \n     the Senate to exercise its constitutional right to change its \n     rules of procedure, including Rule 22, by a simple majority \n     vote. I wholeheartedly support his effort and encourage both \n     Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with him. The \n     filibuster need not be eliminated, but it must no longer be \n     so easy to use.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I know my colleague, Amy Klobuchar, is here. \nSenator Mondale was a distinguished former Vice President and leader in \nthe Senate, and he wrote the very passionate piece in the New York \nTimes that I have just had printed in the Record.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, my colleagues and any of the public \nwatching the debate today know there is a great partisan divide thus \nfar. Senator Wyden has already referred to the motion he and I are \nputting before the Senate. Senator Wyden, a Democrat, and I, a \nRepublican, are joined also by Senator McCaskill, who is the Presiding \nOfficer now, as well as Senator Collins, in this effort. It is the only \nbipartisan issue before the Senate this particular day. I emphasize \nthat because I think the public ought to know that not everything in \nthe Senate is partisan.\n  Senator Wyden and I have been chipping away at the informal, backroom \nprocess known as secret holds in the Senate. We have been working on \nthis for well over 10 years. So it should not surprise anybody that we \nare back again at the start of another Congress, joined, as I said, by \nSenator McCaskill of Missouri, who was very helpful in our pushing this \nissue to the forefront at the end of the last Congress, and, as I said, \nI am pleased that we have Senator Collins onboard again.\n  There has been a lot of talk lately about the possibility of far-\nreaching reforms to how the Senate does business that have been hastily \nconceived and could shift the traditional balance between the rights of \nthe majority and the rights of the minority parties.\n  In contrast, our resolution by Senator Wyden and this Senator is \nneither of those two things. In other words, it does not shift any \nbalance between the majority and the minority.\n  This resolution is well thought out, a bipartisan reform effort that \nhas been the subject of two committee hearings and numerous careful \nrevisions over several years. In no way does it alter the balance of \npower between the minority and majority parties, nor does it change any \nrights of any individual Senator. This is simply about transparency, \nand with transparency you get a great deal of accountability.\n  I wish to be very clear that I fully support the fundamental right of \nany individual Senator to withhold his consent when unanimous consent \nis requested. In the old days when Senators conducted much of their \ndaily business from their desks on the Senate floor and were on the \nSenate floor for most of the day, it was quite a simple matter for any \nSenator at that time to stand up and say ``I object'' when necessary, \nif they really objected to a unanimous consent request, and that was \nit. That stopped it. Now, since most Senators spend most of their time \noff the Senate floor because of the obligation of committee hearings, \nthe obligation of meeting with constituents, and a lot of other \nobligations we have, we now tend to rely upon our majority leader in \nthe case of the Democrats or the minority leader in the case of the \nRepublicans to protect our rights, privileges, and prerogatives as \nindividual Senators by asking those leaders or their substitutes to \nobject on our behalf.\n  Just as any Senator has the right to stand on the Senate floor and \npublicly say ``I object,'' it is perfectly legitimate to ask another \nSenator to object on our behalf if he cannot make it to the floor when \nunanimous consent is requested. By the same token, Senators have no \ninherent right to have others object on their behalf while at the same \ntime keeping their identity secret, thus shielding their legislative \nactions from the public, because that is not transparency and it is \nobviously not being accountable.\n  What I object to is not the use of the word ``holds'' or the process \nof holding up something in the Senate, but I object to what is called \nsecret holds. The adjective ``secret'' is what we are fighting. If a \nSenator has a legitimate reason to object to proceeding to a bill or a \nnominee, then he or she ought to have the guts to do so publicly.\n  A Senator may object because he does not agree to the substance of a \nbill and therefore cannot in good conscience grant consent or because \nthe Senator has not had adequate opportunity to review the matter at \nhand. Regardless, we should have no fear of being held accountable by \nour constituents if we are acting in their interest, as we are elected \nto do. I have practiced publicly announcing my holds for many years, \nand it has not hurt one bit. In fact, some of the Senators who are most \nconscientious about protecting their prerogatives to review legislation \nbefore granting consent to its consideration or passage are also quite \npublic about it.\n\n[[Page S37]]\n\n  In short, there is no legitimate reason for any Senator, if they \nplace a hold, to have that hold be secret.\n  How does our proposal achieve transparency and the resultant \naccountability? In our proposed standing order, for the majority or \nminority leader to recognize a hold, the Senator placing the hold must \nget a statement in the Record within 1 session day and must give \npermission to their leader at the time they place the hold to object in \ntheir name, not in the name of the leader. Since the leader will \nautomatically have permission to name the Senator on whose behalf they \nare objecting, there will no longer be any expectation or pressure on \nthe leader to keep the hold secret.\n  Further, if a Senator objects to a unanimous consent request and does \nnot name another Senator as having the objection, then the objecting \nSenator will be listed as having the hold. This will end entirely, once \nand for all, the situation where one Senator objects but is able to \nremain very coy about whether it is their own objection or some unnamed \nSenator. All objections will have to be owned up to.\n  Again, our proposal protects the rights of individual Senators to \nwithhold their consent while ensuring transparency and public \naccountability. In Congress, as well as almost anyplace in the Federal \nGovernment--except maybe national security issues--the public's \nbusiness always ought to be public and the people who are involved in \nthe public's business ought to stand behind their actions. As I have \nrepeatedly said, the Senate's business ought to be done more in the \npublic than it is, and most of it is public, but this secret hold puts \na mystery about things going on in Washington that hurts the \ncredibility of the institution.\n  This principle of accountability and transparency is a principle that \nI think the vast majority, if not all, of Senators can get behind. I \nbelieve the time has come for this simple, commonsense reform.\n  I yield the floor. Under the UC, if it is permissible to retain the \nremainder of our time, I do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, the Senate is broken. During the course \nof my first 2 years in this body, there have been only a couple serious \ndebates in this Chamber. The first one happened just a couple weeks \nago, and that was an impeachment trial of a judge. The magic began \nbecause the cameras were turned off. Senators were not speaking to the \ncamera; they were speaking to each other. Second, they were required to \nbe on the floor, so they were required to listen to each other. After \nall the evidence had been presented, Senators started to engage back \nand forth about their interpretations of the evidence, about the \nstandards that would constitute grounds for conviction. One would not \nhave been able to tell who was a Republican or who was a Democrat. We \nhad a real debate, but it took 2 years to have that first debate. Then \nwe had a debate over the START treaty. That was a pretty good debate \ntoo. That also happened just a couple weeks ago. For the balance of 2 \nyears, there has virtually never been a serious debate on this floor \nwith Senators hearing each other out, listening to each other, \nconsidering the pros and cons, addressing each other's amendments.\n  That is a tremendously different Senate from the Senate I first \nwitnessed when I came here as a young man, as an intern for Senator \nHatfield in 1976. I was up in the staff section. I would come down to \nmeet Senator Hatfield on a particular tax reform bill that had a series \nof amendments. I would brief him on the amendment that was being \ndebated. He would come in, talk it over with folks, and vote. An hour \nlater, there would be another vote, and an hour later, another vote, \nwith debate in between, back and forth, with enormous respect and \ncourtesy among the Members to the principle of the Senate being a body \nof deliberation, a body of debate. But today, that respect is gone. The \nmost visible sign of the decrease in the mutual accord has been the \nabuse of the filibuster.\n  ``Filibuster'' is a common term we use for a decision to oppose the \ntermination of debate and oppose voting with a straight majority as \nenvisioned in the Constitution. That starts from a principle of mutual \nrespect, that is, as long as any individual has an opinion that bears \non the issue at hand, that Senator should be able to express that \nopinion and we as a body should be able to hear it. Out of that would \ncome a better policymaking process. Unfortunately, over time, that \nmutual respect has been yielded more and more as an instrument of \nobstruction because each time a Senator objects to a simple majority \nvote, under the rules they create a 1-week delay and a supermajority \nhurdle. If one objects 50 times a year, they have wiped out every \nsingle week of the year.\n  This chart gives some indication of how grossly the principle of \nmutual respect and debate has been corrupted and abused.\n  From 1900 through 1970, there was an average of a single use of the \nfilibuster each year--an average of 1 per year over that 70-year \nperiod. In the 1970s, that climbed to an average of 16 per year; in the \n1980s, an average of 21 per year; in the 1990s, an average of 36 per \nyear; between 2000 and 2010, this last decade, 48 per year; and in the \nlast 2 years I have served in the Senate, 68 per year--an average of 68 \nper year or roughly 135, 136 in that 2-year period. If each one of \nthese absorbs 1 week of the Senate's time, one can see how this has \nbeen used to essentially run out the clock and obstruct the very dialog \non which the Senate would like to pride itself.\n  There is a statement about the Senate: the world's greatest \ndeliberative body. But today in the modern Senate, that incredible \ntribute to this Chamber has been turned into an exclamation of despair. \nWhere did that deliberative body go--not only not the greatest \ndeliberative body but virtually devoid of deliberation due to this \nabuse. We went from mutual respect to essentially mutual legislative \ndestruction using this filibuster.\n  In 2010, this last year past, not a single appropriations bill \npassed. We have a huge backlog of nominations. Our role of advice and \nconsent has been turned into obstruct and delay in terms of nominations \nfor the executive branch and the judiciary. We have a constitutional \nresponsibility to express our opinion, but this body, by using the \nfilibuster, has prevented Senators from advising and consenting, either \napproving or disapproving these nominations. It certainly is terrible \nto have our responsibilities as a legislature damaged, but not only \nhave we done that, we have proceeded to damage the executive branch and \nthe legislative branch--quite an intrusion on the balance of powers \nenvisioned in our Constitution. Then we have the hundreds of House \nbills that are collecting dust on the floor because they cannot get to \nthis Chamber because of this abuse.\n  All of this needs to change. When I first came here in the 1970s, \nwhen there was a challenge in 1975, there was a huge debate, and it \nresulted in changing the level required to overcome the filibuster from \n67 Senators to 60 Senators. Yet in 1973 and 1974, the 2 years that \npreceded, there was only an average of 22 filibusters a year, not 68. \nWe have more than tripled the dysfunction that led to the last rules \ndebate.\n  That is why we are here today--to find a path forward. There are so \nmany who have been so instrumental in this debate. So many Members of \nthe class of 2006, 2008, and now Members of 2010 are engaged in this \neffort. My hat goes off to Senator Schumer for leading the hearings in \nthe Rules Committee and trying to find that balance between every \nSenator's right to be heard and our collective responsibility for the \nmajority to legislate. Senator Udall has done this enormous \ninvestigation of the constitutional process for amending the rules and \nso many others.\n\n  The first key part in the package of reforms a number of us--16, I \nbelieve, now have cosponsored this resolution--is the talking \nfilibuster. The talking filibuster reform is essentially to make the \nfilibuster what all Americans believe it is; that is, if you believe so \nstrongly that this Chamber is headed in a direction that is misguided, \nyou should be willing to come and take this floor and make your case to \nthe American people.\n  Let's take a look at our image of that. Here we are: Jimmy Stewart\n\n[[Page S38]]\n\nplaying the role of Jefferson Smith, who comes to this Chamber where I \nnow stand and says: I will take this floor to oppose the abuses that \notherwise might go forward, and he held that floor until he collapsed.\n  That is what the American people believe a filibuster is all about. \nYou want to make your case before the American people. But today we \ndon't have a talking filibuster in the Senate. We have the silent \nfilibuster.\n  Let's take a look at what that looks like. This is the way it works: \nA Senator takes their phone--maybe an old or modern phone--they call \nthe cloakroom, and they say: I object to a majority vote, and then they \ngo off to dinner. They do not take the floor with principle and \nconviction to say to the American people: Here is why I am delaying the \nSenate. Here is why I am going to hold this floor. This is not a \nsituation we can allow to go forward and I am going to stand here and \nmake my case and, American citizens, please join me and help me \nconvince the other Senators in this room. That is the talking \nfilibuster. But now we have the silent filibuster.\n  My good colleague from Tennessee spoke earlier, and he said: I would \nlike to have the talk-your-head-off proposal. I am glad to hear him \nback the talking filibuster--the Jimmy Stewart filibuster. That is what \nthis reform does. It says, when folks object to concluding debate, it \nis because they have something to say, and so we are going to require \nthey come to the floor and say it. It is that simple. When nobody has \nanything left to say, then we will proceed with a majority vote. We \ndon't change the number of Senators required one bit. It is still 60, \nwhich completely honors that principle established in 1975.\n  The second main proposal is the right to amend. A number of our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle have been very concerned about \nthe fact that issues come to this floor and you can only amend if you \nget unanimous consent to put an amendment forward, and that only works, \nlargely, if there is a deal that has been worked out between the \nmajority and the minority leaders. Some of my colleagues across the \naisle say they are offended by their inability to amend.\n  I can assure my colleagues across the aisle that I am equally \noffended. I wanted desperately to be able to offer amendments to \nPresident Obama's tax package that came through here because I think we \ncould have improved it, and I think we should have seen amendments from \nthe other side. This is an issue of concern from both sides. This \nproposal addresses that and says there will be a guaranteed set of \namendments that the minority leader can pick from among the minority \nmembers and a guaranteed set of amendments the majority leader can pick \nfrom among the majority members, but we get the process of amendments \ngoing.\n  If they want to have unanimous consent to increase that number to a \nhigher level, get more for the minority or the majority side, that \nwould be terrific, but at least they can't say no amendments. No leader \ncan block the principle that each side has the opportunity to amend.\n  The third point is on nominations. Right now, we have this huge \nbacklog. This resolution makes a modest change in nominations. It says \nthe period following cloture will be reduced from 30 hours to 2 hours. \nWe have already had the debate over the individual, let's have the \nvote. That is what that says. This means Senators will be less tempted \nto use the filibuster on nominations as an instrument to delay and \nobstruct the Senate. It is not a completely pure reform but a step \nforward in the right direction.\n  Our fourth is the ban on secret holds. Senator Grassley has spoken to \nthis, and Senator Wyden will speak to it. Senator McCaskill has joined \nwith them and others, and I believe at one time point there were as \nmany as 70 Senators expressing in a letter their support to get rid of \nthe secret hold. Anyone who wants to hold up legislation should have to \nstand on this floor and present their objection to this Chamber, to \ntheir colleagues, and to the American people.\n  When folks have to take a position on this floor, whether it be \nthrough the talking filibuster or through publicly announced holds, \nthen the American public can weigh in. Then you are taking the business \nout of the back rooms and onto the floor of this Chamber and American \ncitizens can say: You are a hero for your actions or you are a bum for \nwhat you are doing.\n  The fifth point is a clear path to debate. Right now, a lot of times \nwe suffer through just getting to debate; that is, getting onto a bill \nto begin with or proceeding to a bill. There is probably no better \nexample of the abuse of the filibuster--which was supposed to be mutual \nrespect for debate--being used to prevent debate. So under this \nproposal, there would be 2 hours of debate over whether to proceed to a \nbill and then we would vote. We would either go to the bill or we would \nnot. If Senators then want to filibuster on the bill, they can do it, \nbut it would be a talking filibuster, where we are not in the back \nrooms, we are out here making our case.\n  These five concepts are not radical concepts. They are modest steps \ntoward saying that in this incredibly partisan environment we now \noperate in, where so many press outlets are attacking on each side all \nthe time and so on and so forth, we have to set ourselves on the path \nto taking ourselves out of that hyperpartisan atmosphere and start to \nrestore the Senate as a place of dialog and debate. Perhaps these are \nmodest steps but modest steps in the right direction, and that is an \nextremely important way to go. So I call on my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle--colleagues who have said there should be amendments, \ncolleagues who have spoken in favor, on both sides of the aisle, of the \nJimmy Stewart model of holding this floor and having talking \nfilibusters--to approve this. Let's use the start of this 2-year period \nto acknowledge that something is deeply wrong when, in a 2-year period, \nwe have 135 or 138 filibusters eating up all the floor time and \npreventing modest bills from moving forward and keeping us on this path \nto gridlock. The Senate is broken. Let's fix it.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I have enjoyed this extensive \nopportunity to hear my colleagues on a very important subject about \nwhat the nature of the Senate will be. I am going to have about 10 \nminutes of remarks on the comments of Senators Merkley and Udall, and \nthen I will yield to Senator Wyden, for his comments.\n  If I could say anything from deep down within me to my colleagues who \nare so exercised about this, it would be this: Before we change the \nrules, use the rules.\n  We talk about Senator Byrd a lot because he understood the rules so \nwell. I have often told the story of when Senator Baker became the \nRepublican majority leader in 1981. He went to see Senator Byrd, the \nDemocratic leader, and said: Senator Byrd, I am suddenly the majority \nleader. I will never know the rules as well as you do, so I will make a \ndeal with you. If you will not surprise me, I will not surprise you. \nSenator Byrd said: Let me think about it. The next morning he told \nSenator Baker he would do that.\n  The reason I mention those two Senators is because, before we get too \nmired down in our differences, let us think for a moment about what our \ngoal ought to be. The goal for the Senate, to me, is to return the \nSenate to the way it operated during those 8 years when Senator Byrd \nand Senator Baker were the leaders of their parties. Four years Senator \nByrd was the majority leader and 4 years Senator Baker was the majority \nleader.\n  I have talked to staff members, some of whom are still around. \nSenator Merkley's history goes back to Senator Hatfield in 1976, but I \nfirst came in 1967 as Senator Baker's legislative assistant, when there \nwas only one legislative assistant per Senator. In 1977, I came back \nand spent 3 months with Senator Baker when he became the Republican \nleader, and I followed him pretty closely during the next 8 years.\n  Here is the way it worked back then.\n  The majority leader--whether it was Senator Byrd or Senator Baker--\nwould bring a bill to the floor. He would get the bill to the floor \nbecause Senators knew they were going to get to debate and amend the \nbill. The Senator from Oregon is talking about no debates occurring \ntoday. Well, of course there are no debates, because when Republicans\n\n[[Page S39]]\n\ncome down here with amendments, the majority leader doesn't let us \noffer them. All those cloture motions he is talking about means the \nmajority leader is cutting off my right to represent my people and \noffer an amendment in a debate. They are calling a filibuster a cutoff. \nIt wouldn't be a filibuster if the majority leader weren't cutting off \nmy right, which he has done more than the last six majority leaders \ncombined.\n  But let's go back to what our goal should be. Senators Byrd or Baker \nwould say: OK. The Energy bill or the education bill is up, everybody \nget their amendments in. They might get 300 amendments filed. At some \npoint, the majority leader would say: I ask unanimous consent that the \namendments be cut off. Of course, they would get that after a while \nbecause everybody had all the amendments in that they could think of.\n  You didn't go to the majority leader down on your knees and say: Mr. \nMajority Leader, may I please offer this amendment or that amendment. \nYou just put your amendment out there, and then they started voting.\n  Then Senators Byrd and Baker did something else we don't do today, \nwhich is why I am talking about using the rules before we change the \nrules. They debated, they voted; they debated, they voted; they \ndebated; they voted. Of course, 300 amendments are a lot of amendments \nto get through. So the leaders and the staff would say to the Senator \nfrom North Carolina or the Senator from Oregon: Are you sure you want \n25 amendments? It is Wednesday night. No, 10 will be enough. On \nThursday night they might say: Are you sure you want these five \namendments? It is Thursday night. We are going to be here Friday, and \nwe are going to finish this bill. We will be here Saturday if we have \nto be, and we will be here Sunday. You are going to get your \namendments, and we are going to vote on it, but we are going to finish \nthe bill. That is what the leaders did.\n  Sometimes there would be a piece of legislation that would come up \nwhere one side or the other wanted to kill it and so they would try to \nkill it. That's just like we would do today, if Democrats were to bring \nup a bill to abolish the secret ballot in union elections. We would do \neverything we could to kill it. If the House passes a bill and brings \nit over here to repeal the health care law, the Democrats are going to \ndo everything they can to kill it. That is separate. But most of the \ntime under the leadership of Senators Byrd and Baker, the bill came to \nthe floor, there was bipartisan cooperation, and there were amendments.\n  Why was there bipartisan cooperation? Because the leaders knew that \nunless they had it, they wouldn't move an inch. Being good Senators, \nthey wanted to do their jobs. In fact, Senator Baker would often tell \nhis Republican chairmen: Don't even bring the bill to the floor unless \nthe ranking member, the Democrat, is with you. So most of the time, you \nwould have the Democrat and the Republican there together and they \nwould allow amendments, would fight other amendments off, and they \nwould get to a conclusion. There weren't so many filibusters because \nthe majority leader wasn't cutting off the right to debate and calling \nit a filibuster. This is a word trick is what this is.\n  I have talked to a lot of my friends on the Democratic side and a lot \nof Republicans and I think we basically want the same thing. I think we \nwant a Senate that works better. I think it is now a mere shadow of \nitself. I agree with Senator Merkley about that but not because of \nfilibusters. It is because the majority leader is cutting off debate \nand calling it a filibuster.\n  The majority leader and the Republican leader I commend today because \nthey have been talking about how we can do better. We all know that \nchanging our behavior will be more lasting than changing the rules. I \nam glad Senators Reid and McConnell are working on this. They have \nasked Senator Schumer and me to work on it some more, and we are going \nto do that. We have had several meetings and we have another this \nafternoon and we will keep working. We will consider carefully these \nproposals or any others that come, and we will see if we can come to \nsome agreement about how to move ahead.\n  My heartfelt plea is before we change the rules, let's use the rules. \nGoing down through the list of reform suggestions:\n  The motion to proceed--that is a difficult one for many of us because \nif you are in the minority the motion to proceed is your weapon to \nrequire the majority to give you amendments.\n  Secret holds--Senator Wyden tells me he and Senator Grassley have \nbeen working on that for 15 years. They have Republican support and \nDemocratic support for it. Maybe this is the time to deal with secret \nholds. I make my holds public. When I was nominated for the U.S. \nEducation Secretary by President Bush, the Senator from Ohio held me up \nfor 3 months and never said why. I went around to see the Senator \nRudman from New Hampshire and asked him what to do. He said when he was \nnominated by President Ford to the Federal Communications Commission, \nthe Senator from New Hampshire held him up. Finally Rudman withdrew his \nname and ran for the Senate against the Senator and beat him. That is \nhow Senator Rudman got in the Senate. Secret holds is an area that has \nhad a lot of work and bipartisan support.\n  The right to offer amendments--the problem I have with altering the \ncurrent rules is that offering amendments is what we do. I went to see \nJohnny Cash one time in the 1980s, and I asked him a dumb question, I \nsaid: Johnny, how many nights are you on the road? He said: Oh, 200. I \nsaid: Why do you do that? He said: That is what I do. If you are on the \nGrand Ole Opry, you sing. If you are in the Senate, you offer \namendments and you debate. That is what we do, that is what we are \nsupposed to do. Yet we have not been allowed to do it.\n  Talking filibusters--if we are talking about the postcloture period, \nthe problem with that is the majority has not used the rules. If I \nobject to going forward with a bill, the majority, if they think I am \nabusing the rules, can say OK, Senator Alexander, get down there on the \nfloor because we are going to be here all night. And you can only get 7 \nhours and then you have to line up 23 other Senators to take 1 hour \neach, and if you stop talking we are going to put the question to a \nvote. If you do a number of certain other things we are going to make a \ndilatory motion. In other words, the majority can make it really hard \nfor a Senator who objects.\n  Someone said one, two, three, or four Senators can hold this place \nup. They cannot hold it up. Because if you have 60 votes you can pass \nanything. If you have 60 votes you can pass anything and Senator Byrd \nsaid in his last testimony before the Rules Committee that you can \nconfront a filibuster by using the rules.\n  The last two things we could do are, No. 1, we could stop complaining \nabout voting. It happens on the Republican side and the Democratic \nside. If somebody offers an amendment that is controversial and \neverybody runs up to the leader and says we don't want to vote on that, \nthen too bad. We are here to vote. That is why we are here so we should \ndo that.\n  The third thing we can do, and Senator Byrd suggested this in his \nlast testimony, is let's get rid of the 3-day work week. There is not \nenough time for all the Senators to offer their amendments and there is \nnot enough time for the majority to confront the minority if they think \nthe filibuster is being abused if we have a 3-day work week, and we \nnever vote on Friday. We did not vote on Friday one time last year.\n  Let's use the rules. If you think we are holding something up \nimproperly, confront that Senator. Run over him. You can do it. You \nhave the power to do it if you have 60 votes. In this new Congress \nthere will be plenty of opportunities there.\n  Finally I am going to take these five suggestions and work with \nSenator Schumer and work with my friends on the other side. They are \nvery thoughtful. Senator Udall spent a lot of time on this, Senator \nWyden and Senator Grassley spent 15 years. Senator Merkley used to be a \nspeaker. We have talked a number of times. I greatly respect his work \nin his State and the fact that he has seen the Senate for a long period \nof time. I am taking very seriously everything that is said here. I am \njust worried about turning the Senate into the House.\n  We have a majoritarian organization over there. They can repeal the \nhealth\n\n[[Page S40]]\n\ncare law or they can get rid of the secret ballot in union elections \nwith a majority vote. If you turn this place into that, you just go \nbam, bam and it is done. The Senate is the place for us to say: Whoa, \nwhoa, let's see if we can get a consensus before we do anything.\n  When we get a consensus we not only get a better bill, but usually, \nthe country accepts it better. The American people like to see us \ncooperating. They like to see us coming up with a tax bill or treaty or \ncivil rights bill or a health care bill or a financial regulation bill, \nwhere we all have something in it. They feel better about that product. \nIt is the check and the balance that is the genius of our system.\n  Obviously we can do some things better around here. I am committed to \ntrying. I thank my friends for the amount of time and effort they have \ngiven. I am going to take everything they have said very seriously and \nin the spirit they have offered it. But I hope a part of our solution \nis that we use the rules before we change the rules because this is the \nforum to protect minority rights, this is the forum to force a \nconsensus, and we dare not lose that. We dare not lose that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of the bipartisan Wyden-\nGrassley-McCaskill-Collins resolution to end secret holds, which is at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, reserving the right to object, as I \nsaid earlier, Senator Wyden and Senator Grassley and Senator McCaskill \nand others have worked on this, some of them for as long as 15 years. \nThey have made significant progress in gaining bipartisan support. I am \ngoing to object but only for the reason that this is one of the items \nwe will be discussing and working on over the next few weeks with the \nhope that perhaps we can get agreement over here and agreement over \nthere. It has been mentioned by all of the speakers today. It is a very \nserious proposal. But because we do not want to resolve it today, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection having been heard, the resolution \nwill go over under the rule.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, before he leaves the floor, let me thank \nSenator Alexander for the discussions he has had with me on this issue. \nSenator McConnell has also spoken with me about this. I wish we were \ngetting this done today, largely because this would give us a chance on \nthe first day of the Senate's new session to send a message that once \nand for all we were deep-sixing secrecy, that we were saying public \nbusiness ought to be done in public. I wish it were being done today \nbut I understand completely the sentiments of the Senator from \nTennessee and the fact that he is willing to work with me is something \nI appreciate.\n  As I have indicated, there are obviously significant differences \nbetween the parties about how to reform the rules of the Senate. What I \nhope will be done--certainly the very first day that the Senate comes \nback and is in a position to formally act, which appears to be January \n24--is once and for all we would bring Democrats and Republicans \ntogether around an extraordinarily important change in the Senate \nprocedures that Senator Grassley and I have been trying to change for \nliterally 15 years. Particularly with the energy and enthusiasm Senator \nMcCaskill has brought to the cause, I think we are now on the cusp of \nbeing able to finally get this done.\n  It has been clear that if you walk up and down the Main Streets of \nthis country, people do not know what a secret hold is. Probably a lot \nof people think it is a hair spray. The fact of the matter is there are \npractically more versions of secret holds in the Senate than there are \nin pro wrestling. But what a secret hold is really all about, it is one \nof the most extraordinary powers an individual Senator has here in the \nSenate and it can be exercised without any transparency and without any \naccountability whatsoever. What a secret hold is all about is one \nSenator can block the American people, the entire country, from \nlearning about a piece of legislation that can involve billions of \ndollars, scores and scores of people, or a nomination with the ability \nto influence the lives of all Americans. One Senator can block that \nconsideration without owning up to the fact that Senator is the one who \nis defying the public's right to know about how Senate business is \nblocked.\n  That is wrong. It is not about how Republicans see it, or Democrats \nsee it, it is just common sense. Most people say, when you tell them \nthat a Senator can block an enormously important piece of legislation \nor a nomination that affects millions of people and they can do it in \nsecret, I can't believe you have those kinds of rules.\n  The fact is, that is the way the Senate operates. Suffice it to say \nit is getting worse. A few days ago, for example, Chief Justice Roberts \nsaid that the number of vacancies on our courts is creating a judicial \nemergency. Those are the words of Chief Justice Roberts.\n  At least 19 Federal judges have been approved by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee unanimously or near unanimously and never got a vote on the \nfloor of the Senate. Not one Senator has publicly taken responsibility \nfor worsening the judicial crisis that Chief Justice Roberts has been \ndecrying over the last few days. Think about that. The Chief Justice of \nthe United States during the Christmas holidays included in his annual \nreport on the Judiciary that the delay in confirming federal judges is \ncreating an emergency in the judicial system.\n  Chief Justice Roberts, in my view, is correct. I think we do have an \nemergency. We have been trying to get several judges in the State of \nOregon approved, Senator Merkley and I have been working to get this \ndone. But these nominees and others have been blocked and no Member of \nthe Senate will publicly take responsibility for worsening this crisis \nthat Chief Justice Roberts is appropriately so concerned about.\n  We have tried in the past with legislation to end secret holds. We \nactually got a law passed at one time to get rid of secret holds. We \nhave tried with pledges from the leadership of both political parties. \nIn every instance, the defenders of secrecy have found their way around \nthe requirements and, in my view, the public interest.\n  I will make two points and then I want to allow Senator McCaskill to \nhave a chance to address this issue. There are two points with respect \nto why this effort to end secret holds would be different. The first is \nthat every hold here in the Senate, after the passage of this \nbipartisan resolution, would have a public owner. Every single hold \nwould have a public owner. Second, there would be consequences. In the \npast, there have not been consequences for the individual who would \nobject anonymously. In fact, the individual who would object would \nusually send someone else out to do their objecting for them and there \nwould be complete anonymity for, essentially, all concerned because the \nperson who would be objecting would be in effect saying this is not my \ndoing, I am doing it for somebody else.\n  The heart of this bipartisan compromise is to make sure that every \nhold has a public owner and there would be consequences. There may be a \nSenator around here who becomes known as ``Senator Obstruction.'' \nSenator Obstruction is the one who is trying to block public business. \nLet him explain it to the American people.\n  I will have more to say about it in a little bit, and there is the \npossibility of other colleagues coming to speak. But Senator McCaskill \nhas brought the kind of energy and passion to this that has made it \npossible for us to, as I say, be on the cusp of finally forcing, here \nin the Senate, public business to be done in public. I thank her for \nall her help and will allow her to take the time. She said she thought \nshe might speak for around 10 minutes. Senator Klobuchar, who has also \nbeen a great and passionate advocate of open government, will also \nspeak, and for colleagues who have an interest we have 30 minutes of \ntime.\n  I say to Senator McCaskill, with appreciation for all she has done, \nthe time is hers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, when I arrived in this Chamber 4 \nyears ago at this time, I had no idea what the ways of the Senate were. \nI had an idea\n\n[[Page S41]]\n\nthat this was a place where people came to debate and to have a \ncollegial relationship with fellow Senators across the aisle. There had \nbeen a lot of problems with ethical issues in the Capitol. So one of \nthe first things that happened to the class of 2006 was S. 1, and S. 1 \nwas a far-reaching ethics bill that included things such as no more \nfree flights on corporate jets. It included new requirements in terms \nof gifts from lobbyists, and it also included a provision that I did \nnot know at the time had been worked on by Senator Wyden and Senator \nGrassley for many years.\n  That provision said we were not going to have secret holds anymore. \nSo imagine how great I felt on January 18, 2007, that we had done this \ncomprehensive ethics bill that was going to clean up our act, and that \nwe were not going to have secret holds. Well, I find it ironic that \nSenator Alexander says: Well, just use the rules. Just use them.\n  Well, so when I started figuring out that the game around here in the \nlast 18 months had developed into a game of secret holds, I asked my \nstaff: Hey, did we not have something in S. 1 about secret holds? Not \nknowing really the relationship that language had to Senator Wyden and \nSenator Grassley.\n  So my staff pulled out the legislation and we looked at it. I said: \nWell, right here it says they cannot do it. So I began coming down to \nthe floor and using the law.\n  I did exactly what Senator Alexander recommended. I came down here \nand began making motion after motion, which under the language of that \nstatute would seem to indicate all of the Senators supported--except \nfor a handful--that once you made these motions people would have to \ncome out of the shadows and claim their holds.\n  Well, that is when I discovered the people who voted for this, or a \nbunch of them, did not mean it. They did not mean it. It was window \ndressing. They were not sincere about ending secret holds because we \ndiscovered, when we started trying to use that language, some of the \nfolks who voted for it were doing the old switcheroo. When they were \ncalled upon under the law to reveal their holds, they would just hand \ntheir hold off to someone else.\n  That is when I began getting frustrated with the games that were \nbeing played. I thank Senator Wyden and Senator Grassley and others who \nhave worked on this, but I will tell you what is the most depressing \nthing I have heard today: that this is something that has been worked \non for 15 years.\n  Now, seriously, think about that. We have allowed people to secretly \nhold nominations and the people's business, and there have been Members \ntrying to clean it up for 15 years. We wonder why we are having trouble \nwith our approval ratings.\n  Nothing is more hypocritical than all of the sanctimonious stuff I am \nhearing down the hall about the new era, no more business as usual, no \nmore. We are going to have accountability and transparency. But yet we \nseem to be embroiled, down at this end of the hall, with not even being \nable to get beyond a secret hold. This should not be hard; this should \nbe easy.\n  Now, some of the other provisions that are being debated today, I \nunderstand there is concern about the power of the minority in the \nSenate. I think those concerns have been addressed in the resolution \nthat has been presented by Senator Merkley and Senator Udall and \nSenator Harkin from Iowa.\n  But if we cannot get 67 votes to end secret holds and amend the \nrules, how seriously can we take anybody who claims they want \naccountability and transparency in government? I mean, this is the hall \nof fame of hypocrisy. This is not just hypocrisy, it is the hall of \nfame. So that is why I think we have to get busy and get the secret \nhold provision done.\n  I would like to see us get all of these reforms done. I wanted to \nspend a second on what Senator Alexander's suggestion was. His \nsuggestion was to use the rules. Well, honestly, does he think the way \nto solve this problem is to force the majority to stay here all night, \nwith staff, spending the taxpayers' money to force someone over and \nover again to say, ``I object''?\n  We cannot make the minority talk. So that means the majority, whether \nit is Democrats or Republicans, has to stay all night and call the \nquestion. They do not have to have--I mean, we could do live quorum \ncalls, but that is what we need to do to make this place work? That is \nhis suggestion, to force the people who are objecting and the staff and \nthe people around here to stay here all night every night until someone \nbreaks? That is a good idea?\n  I think that means someone has probably been around here too long. It \ndoes not sound like a good idea, that it is not a commonsense idea that \nwe would be promoting on Main Street in Missouri. I think it makes more \nsense, if you are the minority and you want to block legislation that \nyou own it. Just own it. Block it. That is what the Senate is about. \nThe minority can continue to block legislation whether the Democrats \nare in the minority or the Republicans are in the minority. They can \nblock all the legislation they want. They just have to own it. They \nhave to be willing to say they are blocking this for the following \nreasons--because we think it is important--and let the people decide.\n  Same thing with holds. You want to hold something, hold it. But let \nthe people decide whether you are being reasonable or whether you are--\nreally what I was disgusted to learn is how many people were using \nsecret holds. In fact, they brag about it. They are using secret holds \nto get something else. I am going to hold this nominee in this \ndepartment because I want money for a community center in my town. If \nyou do not give me money for a community center in my town, you cannot \nget the Deputy Secretary of the Interior through. I mean, I am making \nup this example, but this was actually going on. It is like you \nsecretly hold something so that you can get them to give you something \nelse. That is the essence of the backroom dealing that people are \ndisgusted with. Own it. Be proud of it. Defend it. Debate it. But do \nnot hide it. That is what this is all about.\n  I thank all of my colleagues who have worked on this. I just want to \nclose with this comment: Bad habits have consequences, and if we do not \ntake this opportunity to fix what is going on in the Senate--this is \nnot the way the Senate has operated for hundreds of years. If we do not \nchange this path, then we are going to be on this path forever. And if \nthe minority now does not think that when the time comes they may not \nbe in the minority anymore, if we do not think we have not learned from \nthem--seriously?\n  This place is going to be dysfunctional as far as the eye can see \nbecause they will fill the tree and we will just block everything. Then \nthey will block everything and we will fill the tree. This is going to \ngo on forever until there are enough people around here who are willing \nto set aside the political maneuvering and do what is right for the \nfuture of deliberations in a body that we all want to be proud of. But \nright now we cannot be so proud of the way we operate.\n  I thank the Senator from Oregon and all of the Senators who have \nworked on this issue. I hope we can pull back from the brink because \nthat is where we are. We are about ready to institutionalize a way of \noperating around here that is not something that any of us should be \nproud of.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I thank Senator Wyden for his leadership.\n  Madam President, as we begin the 112th Congress, I first congratulate \nmy colleagues on how we ended the 111th Congress. We had an incredibly \nproductive lameduck session, ensuring that taxes were not raised on the \nmiddle class during an economic downturn, ratifying the START treaty, \namong other things. We worked together to solve problems. This was not \nalways the case during the last Congress. But we ended on a high note.\n  As our work begins today anew, we all know there is still a great \ndeal of work to be done. We have a lot of work ahead of us to ensure \nthat American workers can find jobs, to get our private sector economy \nback on track, to find long-term solutions to our mounting deficit. \nBecause of the urgent business that is in front of us, I am hopeful\n\n[[Page S42]]\n\nthat my fellow Senators and my colleagues across the aisle will agree \nthat it is time for change, that it is not time for business as usual.\n  We have heard from so many of my colleagues who have been working on \nthis issue--Senator Udall from New Mexico, Senator Merkley, Senator \nHarkin, Senator Wyden, Senator McCaskill, and also Senator Grassley, \nwhich is important work on the secret holds.\n  The elections on November 2 sent a message to every Member of \nCongress that the American people are not interested in partisan \nbickering or procedural backlogs or the gamesmanship and gridlock that \nprevents elected officials from doing their job. We were not hired by \nour constituents to hide behind outdated Senate rules as an excuse for \nnot accomplishing things or not taking tough votes. That is just what \nthe current Senate rules are allowing us to do.\n  I heard a lot from my friend from Tennessee about how we should use \nthe current rules. But the problem I have is that too many people have \nbeen abusing the current rules. First, as Senator Wyden, Senator \nMcCaskill, Senator Grassley have so eloquently stated, we have to \npermanently end the practice known as secret holds, which basically \nallows one or two Members of the Senate to prevent nominations or \nlegislation from reaching the Senate floor without identifying \nthemselves.\n  We thought we had this done, as Senator McCaskill pointed out, with \nthe ethics bill we passed when we first came into this Chamber. But, \nunfortunately, once again, those rules were abused. There are some \nSenators who are playing games with the rules. They are following the \nletter but not the spirit of the reforms we adopted.\n  Look at the kind of secret holds we have seen, secret holds \npreventing the President from assembling the team he needs to run the \nexecutive branch. This summer, for example, secret holds were placed on \ntwo members of the Marine Mammal Commission for months. The Marine \nMammal Commission--held secret in a hold while the Deepwater Horizon \noilspill was continuing to play out in the gulf region.\n  A second example of what we have to get done is filibuster reform. It \nis a long-standing tradition in the Senate that one Senator can, if he \nor she chooses, hold the floor to explain objections to a bill. We \nthink of Jimmy Stewart's character, Jefferson Smith, in ``Mr. Smith \nGoes to Washington,'' as a shining example of how individual conscience \ncan matter because an individual can stay on the Senate floor to the \npoint of exhaustion in order to stymie a corrupt piece of legislation.\n  Well, that is not how the filibuster works in practice today. Today, \nan individual Senator virtually has the power to prevent legislation \nfrom being considered by merely threatening a filibuster. At that \npoint, the majority leader must file a cloture motion in order to move \nto that piece of legislation. This adds a great deal of time to an \nalready crowded Senate calendar. This is not governing. This is not how \nwe do the people's business. This is not how we come together to find \npractical solutions to our common problems.\n  Our current system is a far cry from Jimmy Stewart. That is why a \ngroup of us have been working to get some legislation passed to change \nthe rules going forward. When you think about the history of the \nSenate--and I listened with great respect as my colleagues talked about \nthe tradition and the importance of the rules of the Senate, about \nprotecting the rules of the minority. None of these proposals will \ninterfere with the rights of the minority to filibuster any piece of \nlegislation.\n  But when you look at the history of the Senate, it is about \ntradition. As time goes forward, there have been changes to the Senate \nrules. Every few decades there are changes to the Senate rules. Look at \nmy former colleague, Vice President Mondale, a great leader who made \nsignificant changes to the Senate rules.\n  This is all about transparency and accountability. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse.) The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I do not see any of our colleagues who want \nto speak on the bipartisan efforts to end secret holds, so let me make \na couple of comments in wrapping up.\n  The first is, Senator Grassley and I and others who have been at this \nfor so long have been willing in the past to just put a statement in \nthe Congressional Record when, in the handful of instances, we thought \nit was important to block a particular piece of legislation or a \nnomination. We felt it was important to be publicly accountable.\n  All we are asking is that principle of openness, transparency, and \ngovernment in the sunshine apply to all Members of the Senate.\n  The fact is, secrecy has real consequences. I mentioned the fact that \nChief Justice Roberts has been so concerned about the judicial \nemergency he has seen develop in the court system. I saw during the \nlameduck session, on a bipartisan bill Senator Cornyn and I spent many \nmonths on to combat sex trafficking, the consequences of a secret hold. \nWhen our bill passed the Senate, it went over to the House of \nRepresentatives, was passed in the House, and then came back to the \nSenate and was blocked secretly. And this was a bipartisan bill to \nallow us to strengthen the tools law enforcement would have in order to \nfight sex trafficking, to provide urgently needed shelters to sex \ntrafficking victims. A bipartisan bill Senator Cornyn and I spent many \nmonths on did not become law during the lameduck session because of a \nsecret hold.\n  A lot of Senators have seen exactly these kinds of problems with \njudges and U.S. attorney candidates. We had both from my home State, \ntwo judges who couldn't be considered because of a hold and we could \nnot identify who was objecting, the same with the U.S. attorney \nnominee. These are the real consequences of secret holds.\n  The big winners in these secret holds are the lobbyists. The \nlobbyists benefit tremendously from secret holds. Practically every \nSenator has received requests from a lobbyist asking if the Senator \nwould put a secret hold on a bill or a nomination in order to kill it \nwithout getting any public debate and without the lobbyist's \nfingerprints appearing anywhere. If you can get a Senator to go out and \nput an anonymous hold on a bill, you have then hit the lobbyist \njackpot. No lobbyist can win more significantly than by getting a \nSenator to secretly object because the Senator is protected by the \ncloak of anonymity, but so is the lobbyist. With a secret hold, \nSenators can play both sides of the street. They can give a lobbyist a \nvictory for their clients without alienating potential or future \nclients.\n  Given the number of instances where I have heard of lobbyists asking \nfor secret holds, I wish to say that those who oppose our efforts to \nend secret holds are basically saying we ought to give lobbyists an \nextra tool, an extension of the tools they already have in order to \nadvocate for their clients and defy public accountability.\n  We passed stricter ethics requirements with respect to lobbyists. But \nit looks to me to be the height of hypocrisy if the Senate adopts a \nvariety of changes to curtail lobbying, as has been done in the past, \nand at the same time allows lobbyists to continue to benefit, as so \nmany special interests have, from secret holds.\n  This is the opportunity, after a decade and a half, for the public to \nget a fair shake and for the public interest to come first. We have \ntried this in the past. We have tried this in the past with pledges and \nby passing a law and each time the supporters of secrecy found ways \naround it. But I think the public has caught on.\n  Suffice to say, there are going to be plenty of differences between \nDemocrats and Republicans with respect to how to reform the rules of \nthe Senate. What I think has come to light is, it doesn't pass the \nsmell test to keep arguing that Senate business ought to be done in \nsecret. The American people don't buy that anymore. They think this \nought to be an open institution, a place where every Senator is held \naccountable.\n  This time it is going to be different. There are going to be public \nowners of any hold. There are going to be consequences for any Senator \nwho tries to block a bill or a nomination in secret. This is going to \nbe an important vote when we come back, a very important vote, and \nfinally one that will require\n\n[[Page S43]]\n\nthat public business in the Senate be done in public.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Murray and Mrs. Hagan are printed in today's \nRecord under ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, with the process we are in \nright now--and we have had questions back and forth on this whole issue \nof Senate rules reform--I want to respond to Senator Alexander because \nSenator Alexander raised some questions, and some of those questions \nwere not answered on our side. So I want to put in a couple responses \nhere.\n  Senator Alexander asked the question: What is a filibuster? He was \nasking our side. He was asking in this debate, what is a filibuster? \nWell, all of us know and we have heard in this debate what a true \nfilibuster is. We saw a hero here on our side in terms of a true \nfilibuster when it came to Bernie Sanders just a week or so ago, where \nhe stood up for 8 hours to oppose a tax package on principle. He took \nthe floor and he spoke and spoke passionately.\n  I say to Senator Harkin, another example of a true filibuster is from \na movie the American public knows the best, a Jimmy Stewart movie, \n``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.'' Senator Merkley earlier had some \ncharts on that, and he showed Mr. Smith on the floor, surrounded by \nother Senators, where he spoke until he collapsed.\n  Then you have the old-time tales of the Southern Democrats when civil \nrights legislation was being pushed in the 1950s and 1960s, when a \nnumber of what you would say were Northern Senators were pushing an \nanti-lynching law because lynching was going on in the South. So they \nwere trying to say you cannot do that, and Southern Senators would \nstand up--I think sometimes the record was in the range of 20 hours or \n25 hours where they were completely exhausted from speaking on the \nfloor.\n  So that is what the American public thinks about a filibuster.\n  Well, we know that is not what is happening here. I have been here \nfor 2 years, and the only real filibuster I saw was the Bernie Sanders \nfilibuster. I asked one of the historians, I think: When was the last \none? And they said: Well, you would go back to 1992 and Alfonse \nD'Amato, where he took 12 hours to talk about an issue in New York that \nhe was passionate about.\n  So when Senator Alexander asked us, What is a filibuster, that is my \ndescription of what a filibuster is.\n  But what I think the real question is--and I would like Senator \nAlexander, when he returns, to answer this--is, What impact has the \nthreat of a filibuster had? What impact has the threat of a filibuster \nhad? So people are probably asking: What are we talking about when we \nsay ``the threat of a filibuster''? Well, actually we have been talking \nabout it all day.\n  First of all, it is the secret holds. As our Presiding Officer, who \nsits on the Judiciary Committee, knows, they work very hard in the \nJudiciary Committee. They produce a bipartisan result on these judicial \nnominations. These judicial nominations come out. They are put on the \ncalendar. Then months and months and months later some of them get up \nfor a vote.\n  I do not know about the exact number, but my understanding is that we \nhad to send back to the President a number of judicial nominations that \nhad received bipartisan support from the committee. We finished our \nbusiness in December, and we sent those nominations back, only to have \nto have the President send them back down again because it is a new \nCongress. We are going to have to have hearings all over. This is the \nkind of situation we are in. So that is one specific case of the threat \nof a filibuster. And we have these all the time.\n  One of the ones that is the most remarkable to me--and I am not going \nto pick out the Senator or the exact committee--but a number of us, as \nSenators, saw a stack of bills, a stack of legislation that had come \nout, on a bipartisan basis, from one of our committees that was very \nthick, and it was legislation from 2 years--2 years--of that committee \nlegislating in a bipartisan way, and those Democrats and Republicans \nworking together and doing the hard work, and one Senator--one \nSenator--held up all of that legislation this last Congress, held it up \ncompletely.\n  That is the threat of a filibuster. You may say: Well, how did that \nhappen? What happens is, the legislation comes out of committee, and a \nSenator--whom we do not even know; a lot of us suspect after various \nthings that have happened over time, but the Senator comes down and \nsays, in a secret way to his leader: Well, if you bring any of those \nbills to the floor, I am going to filibuster.\n  That is what the threat of a filibuster is. But that is an agreement \nthat none of us knows about. So the threat of a filibuster has had an \nenormous impact on this institution.\n  Let me describe a couple of other things.\n  I talked about judicial nominations. As to executive nominations, I \ncome from the era when my father was Secretary of the Interior. I was a \nkid. I remember when he went into office. In visiting with him about \nthat later, I said: We can't get executive people in place. They don't \nhave their team. He said: Tom, I had my whole team in place the first 2 \nweeks. So you are talking about the whole team for the Department of \nthe Interior in the first 2 weeks.\n  I remember the Washington Post did an extensive study of the first \nyear of the Obama administration. So imagine: President Obama takes \noffice. He goes through a year, and he only had 55 percent of his \nexecutive nominations in place. So he only had 55 percent of his team.\n  Those of us who believe in government, believe that government does \ngood things out there, find that appalling because we believe if you \nput people in place, they will be responsive to citizens on the \nparticular issues of those departments. So that is very important, I \nbelieve, getting executive nominations in place. So that is what the \nthreat of a filibuster ends up doing.\n  I see my colleague from Mississippi, and I do not know whether he is \ngoing to step in for Mr. Alexander and ask questions. We are in this \nquestioning back and forth period. Senator Harkin may want to say \nsomething on the question issue here too. What impact has the threat of \na filibuster had?\n  We can hear the argument--Senator Alexander has made this a number of \ntimes--look at all the great things you accomplished in the lameduck \nand look at all the great things you feel you accomplished in terms of \nhealth care, the stimulus package, and financial reform. But the \nreality is, in order to accomplish those in the constant filibuster we \nwere in, we have basically destroyed our institution. As some of the \nmore senior Senators here have told me, the Senate is kind of a shadow \nof itself.\n  What I do mean: ``We have destroyed the institution''? Well, it used \nto be that our big oversight function was to look over the money bills \nfor the government, the appropriations bills. Guess what. Last year we \ndid not do a single appropriations bill on the floor of the Senate. You \ndo not have to go back very far when we used to bring all 12 of those \nbills to the floor, and we would have 2 or 3 days of lively debate. \nEvery Senator could put in amendments.\n  Senator Harkin knows because he is one of the cardinals, he is the \nchairman of one of these committees. It is a very helpful process, one \nfor the agency to know that all Senators are overlooking that agency, \nand for a person in Senator Harkin's position, as the chair of the \ncommittee, to know what the concern of the entire body is. But we have \ngiven that up. We do not do that anymore, and it is because of the \nconstant filibuster and the threat of filibuster. So you have that \nsituation.\n  I would think my friend from Mississippi, the Senator from \nMississippi,\n\n[[Page S44]]\n\nwould be very concerned about this one: We did not do a budget last \nyear. The one way we can impact--if you talk about fiscal \nresponsibility, and you talk about keeping the government under \ncontrol, and guiding it in the right direction, the one thing you want \nto do is a budget. You want to pass a budget and set some outlines \nthere.\n  Well, we did not do a budget last year because we were in a constant \nfilibuster, the threat of a filibuster. And the story goes on and on.\n  So I say to Senator Harkin, we are in the question phase right now. I \nam going to yield the floor. I am sure there is time still on the other \nside. But I think the question is not, as Senator Alexander raised it, \nWhat is a filibuster? The real question out there--for when Senator \nAlexander returns--is, What impact has the threat of a filibuster had \non this institution we love of the Senate?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I hope the Senator from New Mexico will \nstay on the floor. I wish to engage in a colloquy with the Senator from \nNew Mexico on the topic on which he just spoke.\n  I say to my friend from New Mexico, the Senator from Tennessee, as I \nunderstand, had propounded the question, what is a filibuster? The \nSenator from New Mexico has been very eloquent in responding to that, \ntalking about the filibuster. But I think the better question is, what \nhas a filibuster become, because as the Senator pointed out and as \nSenator Merkley pointed out, this whole image of someone standing on \nthe floor and speaking until they drop such as Senator D'Amato or \nSenator Thurman back in the old days on the civil rights bills or even \nSenator Sanders a few weeks ago, that is not really a filibuster any \nlonger. So what has a filibuster become?\n  Let me go back again a little bit in history. In the 19th century, in \nthe 1800s, the filibuster was used, if I am not mistaken, about 20 \ntimes during that whole 100 years. But it was used under a different \nset of circumstances. In the 1800s, a Senator or a Congressman was \nelected in November, but the session of Congress lasted until March. \nThe Senators or Congressmen elected in November actually did not take \ntheir seats here until a year and a month later, in December of the \nfollowing year. So sometimes, in this ``lameduck'' session that ended \nin March, people in the majority party--especially if they had lost the \nelection--would try to ram through a lot of stuff. The minority party \nwould speak until the session ended in March so that nothing would get \ndone, and then they would pick it up in December when the new Senate \nand House would meet. So it was a means of stopping onerous legislation \nfor a short period of time.\n  That was in the 19th century. We have a different situation now. So \nthe filibuster is not used to speak now and to slow up one piece of \nlegislation or to stop one piece of legislation; it is used to slow \ndown everything. One case in point: We had before my committee last \nyear a nominee by the name of Patricia Smith to be Solicitor General of \nthe Department of Labor. We had our hearings, I say to my friend from \nKansas who is not here right now. We had our hearings in committee. She \nanswered questions, answered written questions. We reported her out of \ncommittee. We came here to the floor. We had to file cloture on \nPatricia Smith to be Solicitor of Labor, so we filed cloture. We got \nthe 60 votes. But as we know, under postcloture you get 30 hours. Well, \nthe minority forced us to use the 30 hours. Senator Enzi, our ranking \nmember, came and spoke for 15 minutes and left, and I sat here for 30 \nhours and no one spoke. So for 29 hours and 45 minutes we sat here \ndoing nothing, unable to do anything, on a nominee who had over 60 \nvotes. At that time, the record will show, I kept asking: Why are we \nhere?\n  Why are we using 30 hours of the Senate's time, when nobody is even \nspeaking and we already have the 60 votes for Patricia Smith? That is \nan example of what the filibuster has become. It has become a tool in \norder to slow everything down.\n  For example, nominees. We had nominees who got through here on a 99-\nto-0 vote after being held up for 6 months. Well, what if, I ask, we \nhave to file cloture on every nominee and then every nominee has a vote \non cloture and then you have 30 more hours. If you did that on every \nnominee, I believe the majority leader said we would be here from \nJanuary through August doing nothing every day of the week except \nnominations. How would we ever get anything else done?\n  The question is, What has the filibuster become? It has become a \nmeans whereby a few--this, I guess, would be the question I might \npropound to my friend from New Mexico or at least suggest that he might \nrespond. Has not the filibuster or the threat of a filibuster become a \ntool by which one or two or three or four Senators can absolutely slow \ndown or stop things from coming to the Senate? Has not the filibuster \nbecome a tool by which one Senator who publicly announces that his goal \nis total gridlock of the Senate--total gridlock--has not the filibuster \nthen become the tool by which one Senator can impose gridlock on the \nSenate? Is that not what the filibuster has become?\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. The Senator from Iowa makes an excellent \npoint. I was here for his talk earlier, where the Senator led with the \nfilibuster and laid it out and Senator Alexander came back and asked \nthese questions. I think the key question is the one the Senator just \nasked, which is: What has a filibuster become? The Senator seemed to be \ndefending the old-fashioned filibuster that no longer exists. That is \nthe situation we have.\n  Some of our friends on the other side--I hear them talk about this--\nare saying this is the filibuster of the past; it is a very pure thing \nand a wonderful thing. But it has been distorted, manipulated. The \nfilibuster has been twisted in a way that it does exactly what the \nSenator is talking about--slowing everything down. It is an attempt, in \na way, to defeat the majority from governing.\n  I think the Senator cited the Federalist Papers. One of the biggest \ndangers in a democracy is if you give the power to the minority to shut \ndown the ability of the majority to govern. If you do that, you have \nrendered your democracy useless because then you get yourself into a \nsituation, as the Senator from Iowa knows, where they can prevent the \nmajority from doing anything and then run in a campaign and say: Well, \nthey didn't do anything, which is kind of a hypocritical way to \napproach legislating.\n  One of the things that is remarkable to me--and I served over in the \nHouse of Representatives for 10 years and I know we don't have to take \nup every House bill the way it is written and we don't have to respond \nto every bill, but when you hear the fact that 400 House of \nRepresentatives bills in 2 years--the last session of Congress--were \nsent over here and we ended up--the younger Members of the Senate were \ninterested in some of these bills. We looked into them. We found out \nthat these were on veterans issues and many were good bills. We found \nout they had to do with small business, and they were good bills. We \nfound out they had to do with building the economy and economic growth \nand those kinds of things and that they were good bills. But we didn't \nhave the time to act upon them because the way the filibuster is being \nutilized is to defeat our ability to move forward.\n  The one other area I wish to mention--and I know this is something \nthat concerns our friends on the other side--if you are talking about \nmaking government responsible, fiscally responsible, doing oversight \nover government--and they say they are going to do all this oversight \nin the House--one of the best ways to do oversight is in an \nauthorization bill. As everybody knows, we have an authorization \nprocess, and we have an appropriations process. Well, apparently now, \nwith the studies being done at the Center for American Research--and \nSenator Harkin would know this more than others because he serves on \nthe Appropriations Committee--a major part of our appropriations are \nunauthorized now. I think the figure I saw was close to 40 percent. So \nthat means if these are unauthorized appropriations, it means the side \nof our Senate and the side of our Congress that deals with \nauthorization, that is an oversight. You go in there in the \nauthorization process and look at an agency and you say: How is this \nprogram functioning? Is this program effective, a good program, \nsomething that is working?\n\n[[Page S45]]\n\n  If the answers come back and you have evidence it is not working, you \nwrite in the authorization we are getting rid of that. If you don't do \nany authorizations at all and the authorization doesn't come to the \nSenate floor and all Senators don't have an opportunity to participate, \nthen you are giving up that kind of essential oversight. I would think \nthey would be for that. Guess how many authorizations we did last year. \nHow many? We did one. We did it at the very last minute as we went out \nof town, and that was the Defense Department authorization. That was \nheld up with a filibuster because it had don't ask, don't tell in the \nbill.\n  So here we are at war--we have two wars going on. As Chairman Levin \nsaid, a lot of the things in that bill were to help the military do a \nbetter job and help the fighters on the ground in these two wars and we \nweren't able to get them done at the start of the fiscal year and move \nforward. So we were able to get it done before we left. I was happy \nabout that. How about intelligence and the huge agencies that run the \nhealth care programs and all those? We have not done that oversight.\n  To the Senator's question what has the filibuster become, it has \nbecome something pretty horrible in the history of the Senate. If we \ndon't fix this, we are going to be in a bad way. The way to fix it is \nthe constitutional option. That is the wonderful thing about where we \nare today.\n  Today, we are in the first legislative day of the beginning of the \n112th Congress. What everybody has told us on that first legislative \nday is that we can have all these rules proposals. The Senator from \nIowa has one and Senator Merkley and myself have one and Senator Wyden. \nGuess what. If we round up 51 Senators--and they don't have to be only \nDemocrats--who say, No. 1, here are rules changes we want to make with \n51 Senators, we can cut off debate on those changes and 51 Senators--a \nmajority--can vote those rules in, and we can fix the situation we have \nall been talking about here.\n  I think the Senator's question is the right one. The filibuster has \nbecome a procedural morass.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend from New Mexico. I also thank him for \nhis great leadership on the constitutional option. I am a cosponsor of \nhis resolution, which he sent to the desk earlier today. He is right on \ntarget. The dead hand of the past cannot bind us. Every Congress, on \nthe first legislative day--as Senator Byrd said himself in the past--\nhas the authority, with 51 Senators, to set our rules--not two-thirds, \njust 51. We are on that first legislative day today.\n  I understand the leader will put us into recess so we will stay in \nthe first legislative day when we come back. So we will be on this \nissue when we come back on January 25.\n  I wonder if I might explore a little bit with my friends who are \nhere--and the Senator from Oregon has been a great leader in this \neffort. As a former speaker of the legislature in Oregon, he has lent a \ngreat deal of expertise to our thinking and in evolving how we modify \nour rules to make this place function a little better. I thank Senator \nMerkley for his leadership. A lot of what was in the measure that \nSenator Udall sent to the desk earlier today is what Senator Merkley \nhas devised. These are things we need to do.\n  I ask again to bring this up here for maybe a brief discussion, if I \nmight. This is something Senator Cornyn and I got into a little bit \nearlier. He went on at length about building consensus; that we want to \nbuild consensus and have bills over here with a consensus. Well, I \nagree with that. You try to get as much consensus as possible. \nObviously, if you can get 100 Senators, that is nice--or 80 or 70. It \nis always nice to get as many as possible. I ask my friends, isn't it \nsometimes true that legislation comes up that can be contentious, and \nyou can open it--I think it ought to be opened in the committee process \nfor amendments. I pointed to the health care bill that we had in our \nHELP Committee, and the occupant of the chair was so vitally involved \nwith that. We had 54 hours and 13 days of open markup and open session. \nNo Senator was denied the opportunity to offer any amendment on that \nbill--Republicans or Democrats. Senator Dodd was chairing at the time. \nWe adopted 161 Republican amendments. Imagine that, over 13 days, 161 \nRepublican amendments. As I said, nobody was cut off.\n\n  Yet at end of that, when we finally brought it up for a vote, not one \nRepublican voted for it, even though they had a big hand in shaping it. \nSo whenever I hear comments that ``we didn't have a hand in shaping the \nhealth care bill,'' I don't understand that. I know in the Finance \nCommittee Senator Baucus bent over backward to make sure Senators on \nboth sides could offer amendments and be a part of the process. I say, \nif they don't want to vote for it in the end, fine; that is their right \nand privilege. People can vote their conscience and on behalf of their \nconstituents. But we weren't able to get a consensus on it.\n  So if you have a bill on which you can't get a consensus, does that \nmean we should stop? As I asked the Senator from Texas, does that mean \nevery bill has to have 60 votes? Is that what we have become--no bill \nwill pass here unless it has 60 votes or more? The Senator from Texas \npointed out, correctly, that some bills pass here by unanimous consent. \nFine. That is 100 votes. So do they mean we have to have a minimum of \n60 to 100 votes in order for anything to pass? What happened to \nmajority rules? What happened to the idea that you only need 51 \npercent? Isn't that sort of the basis of a democratic government?\n  Again, I ask my friends about this idea of consensus. Yes, we all \nwant to get that. We all want as many Senators as possible on \nlegislation, and we try hard to do that. But if that is not possible, \ndoes that mean that 53 or 54 or 55 or 56 Senators cannot then vote to \npass a piece of legislation or an amendment?\n  I ask my friends, what about this idea of consensus? Have we come to \nwhere we have to have a supermajority? Is that the situation we are in \nnow?\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. The Senator from Iowa and my good friend, \nthe Senator from Oregon, want to speak. The Senator mentioned--and I \nwant to put this quote in the Record--the Senator from Texas, Mr. \nCornyn, who came to the floor and talked today. One of the reasons I \nhave a real belief that we might have some common ground is he was a \njudge before he came to the Senate. I think he was on the supreme court \nin the State of Texas. On this issue of the constitutional option, he \nwrote a law review article in the Harvard Journal of Law and Public \nPolicy. The name of the article was ``Our Broken Judicial Confirmation \nProcess and the Need for Filibuster Reform.''\n  Listen to this. This is Senator John Cornyn of Texas:\n\n       Just as one Congress cannot enact a law that a subsequent \n     Congress could not amend by majority vote, one Senate cannot \n     enact a rule that a subsequent Senate could not amend by \n     majority vote. Such power, after all, would violate the \n     general common law principle that one parliament cannot bind \n     another.\n\n  He is basically driving home the point that we have the authority \ntoday, on the first day of the 112th Congress, the first legislative \nday, to pull together and take a hard look at the rules. The Senator \nfrom Iowa raised a very important issue on consensus. I am going to \npass this off to Senator Merkley in this colloquy and let him answer \nthat point. Maybe he may have another question.\n  I wish our friends on the other side of the aisle were here for this \ndiscussion. Senator Alexander was here earlier. We had Senator Wicker. \nBut nobody is here to answer the questions we are putting that way, but \nwe are answering the ones this way.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, hopefully, I say to my friend from New \nMexico, when we come back on the 25th we will engage in more of this \ndiscussion.\n  I should yield the floor. I wanted to raise that question about \nconsensus because it sounds so good, and we all love consensus. Of \ncourse we do. But sometimes we cannot get it. Does that mean then that \nthe majority cannot act if they do not get consensus of over 60? Does \nthat mean the majority simply cannot act?\n  Mr. President, I leave the question hanging and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, continuing the conversation, my colleague \nfrom New Mexico pointed out the challenge with authorization bills. We\n\n[[Page S46]]\n\nshould add to that, during 2010, the Senate did not manage to pass a \nsingle appropriations bill. It is dysfunction on top of dysfunction. \nThat is why we are here today.\n  I put back up the chart of Jimmy Stewart in the well because I think \nat the heart of this conversation is a notion that, yes, every Senator \nshould be able to hold forth, to share their idea, to advocate that in \nwhich they believe, to persuade their colleagues, but not to simply \nlodge an objection and walk away and never present their case before \nthe American people.\n  Our good colleague from Tennessee said he wanted to see--how did he \nput it?--something to the effect of a ``talking your heads off'' form \nof filibuster, and he referred to Jimmy Stewart.\n  There is a sense of commonality in our views that if one is going to \nvote to continue debate, then the debate should continue--it is that \nsimple--so the citizens can see if you have a case to make that makes \nsense, and they can weigh in and help turn the tide in the direction of \nthe Senator, or that you have no case to make and they want you to sit \ndown and have the Senate get on with its business. That is simple.\n  There are many ideas for much more radical steps--steps in which we \nwould proceed to say, yes, we will do something different. We will \neliminate the filibuster. But that is not the proposal I am speaking to \ntoday. It is not the proposal to which many of us are speaking. We are \nsaying, yes, you can keep speaking, but you have to speak. You cannot \ngo on vacation. You cannot hide from the American people. You cannot \nobject and hide. That is not in the tradition of the Senate.\n  There is a Wall Street Journal article that came out yesterday. I am \nnot sure if it was an editorial or an op-ed, so I will not attribute it \nto anyone specifically. But it said there is no chance for filibuster \nreform to address the filibusters on legislation because the Democrats \nwill not want to imperil their ability to obstruct the Republicans when \nthe Republicans are in power someday.\n  Here we are, we are Democrats, and we are saying we are talking about \nrules that we have placed against the test of whether we can support \nthese rules, whether in the majority or in the minority. The proposal \nwe signed onto today--the five reforms we have laid out--we have run \nthrough the test of saying: Will this meet a fairness standard? Would \nthis be fair if we were in the minority?\n  One of the proposals is to make sure the minority and the majority \nget to have amendments. That is a valuable protection for whichever \nparty is in the minority.\n  Another piece of it is to say, yes, the filibuster can still be used. \nBut you have to invest time and energy and make your case before the \nAmerican people.\n  We have believed we can live with that in the minority. If we are \ngoing to obstruct the Senate, we are willing to take this floor. We are \nwilling to make our case. But we are saying a Senator should not be \nable to obstruct and hide. They should not be able to engage in the \nsilent, the secret filibuster but should have to have the talking \nfilibuster.\n  I applaud my colleague from Iowa, my colleague from New Mexico, and \nmy colleagues who are about to speak--Senator Mark Udall from \nColorado--and say we have a couple weeks now in America to have a \ndebate on the dysfunction and brokenness of the Senate. We are asking \nthe American public to engage, to call your Senators, to share your \nconcerns about a Senate that cannot do authorizations, that has not \ndone appropriations, that leaves hundreds of House bills on the floor, \nand that cannot fulfill its constitutional responsibility to advise and \nconsent on nominations, thereby undermining our other two branches of \ngovernment.\n  This has to be addressed. That is why we are here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for his \nleadership. I want to rephrase my question that I left hanging when I \nyielded the floor the last time. I see our great friend from New York \nis here to speak. I will not take more than a minute or two. I want to \nrephrase the question.\n  I asked the question: What has the filibuster become? And I further \nasked a question about consensus. If you do not get a consensus--that \nis, over 60 people--to agree on something, should then the majority not \nhave the right to act? I want to rephrase that question and put it this \nway: If consensus--meaning over 60 Senators--if over 60 Senators cannot \nagree on something, then should the minority have the absolute total \nveto power over what the majority is proposing? That is the essence of \nit. If you cannot get a consensus, should the minority have the total, \nabsolute power to determine the outcome?\n  That is what has happened in the Senate. That is what has become of \nthis filibuster. The end result has become the fact that 41 Senators--\nif you do not have 60 Senators or more--41 Senators decide what we do, \nwhat we vote on, what comes before this body. How does that square with \nthe principle of democratic government and majority rule?\n  I leave that out there: Should we have and continue to have, if we \ncannot reach a consensus, should we continue to have veto power by the \nminority?\n  I also see the Senator from Colorado here to speak.\n  I also want to publicly thank the Senator from New York who I see is \nabout ready to speak, the chairman of our Rules Committee. Senator \nSchumer has spent so many hours and so many days this past year on this \nissue of reforming the Senate rules. He was kind enough to let me \ntestify before his committee and kind enough to actually let me sit \nwith his committee to listen to others.\n  Senator Schumer has been in harness on this issue trying to get us to \nthe point where we can have meaningful changes in the rules so that \nthis place can function a little bit better and a little bit more \ndemocratically--with a small ``d,'' not democratically in terms of \npolitical affiliation.\n  I know in the next few weeks Senator Schumer is going to be very much \ninvolved as one on our leadership team, along with Senator Reid and \nothers, seeing what we can do to work things out so we can have a \nmeaningful change in the rules.\n  Again, I am all for getting rid of secret holds, but that seems to be \nkind of a no-brainer. That would probably get close to 100 votes. But \nif that is all we are going to do, that is not a very meaningful change \nin the rules.\n  I submit that what Senator Udall, Senator Merkley, and others have \nintroduced, or I submitted myself going on for 15 years now, that is \nmeaningful change in the rules. I know Senator Schumer is going to be \nvery much involved in that discussion. I applaud him for his efforts \nand leadership. We will be back on January 25 to take up this cause \nagain. I know I speak for my friend from Oregon that he is going to be \nhere on the 25th, and my friend from New Mexico and everyone else. We \nare going to be here because we cannot let this go. We cannot permit \nthe Senate to be so dysfunctional that we cannot respond to the urgent \nneeds of America and our place in the world today. We cannot continue \nto go downhill as a country and cannot continue to let the Senate be a \ndumping ground and nothing ever gets done.\n  These rules need to be changed. We will be back on the 25th to do so. \nI thank my friend from Colorado for his indulgence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Schumer be recognized after me for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, before I speak on the matter \ntoday, which the group of Senators today so eloquently and powerfully \noutlined for all of us, I want to acknowledge that the 111th Congress \nwas one of the most productive in history. Legislation we passed will \nmake real changes for American families who are struggling through a \ntough economy, as the Presiding Officer knows, and with rising health \ncare costs. What we did also will make our military and Nation safe and \nstronger. We should be proud of the work we accomplished in the \nprevious Congress.\n  But I have to also say that the last 2 years was a time of \nunprecedented obstruction and partisanship. If you do\n\n[[Page S47]]\n\nnot want to take my word for it, you do not have to go very far to \nlisten to many impartial observers of the Congress who will tell you \nthat it was exactly the case.\n  I rise today to add my voice to the growing number of Coloradans and \nMembers of the Senate who are deeply concerned about the gridlock that \nat times has paralyzed our Chamber and prevented meaningful debate.\n  Many of us read with dismay an article by George Packer in the New \nYorker magazine several months ago, which detailed examples of Senate \ndysfunction.\n  Americans from both political parties--and Independents as well--have \nasked whether the rules of the Senate are working to help solve these \nproblems that face us. Some of my colleagues have understandably sought \nto change or eliminate the filibuster to make it easier to pass \nimportant legislation supported by a majority of Senators.\n  I come to this debate from a somewhat different perspective than my \ncolleagues. I come to this debate with this guiding principle; that is, \nany attempt to limit the power of the minority by eliminating or \nweakening the ability to filibuster will simply lead to a further \nbreakdown in what is already a fractured partisan relationship.\n  While I share much of the frustration expressed by many of our \ncolleagues, I believe we must be thoughtful about how we approach \nchanges to the Senate rules.\n  Several years ago, Minister Robert Fulghum had everyone using the \nphrase, ``everything I need to know I learned in kindergarten.'' His \nessays made the point that the simple rules we teach children about \ngetting along, about being kind to one another, about cleaning up after \nourselves apply throughout life.\n  On one level, you could boil down the debate we are engaging in this \nweek and say what we need are rules that will help us get along better \nin the Senate's sandbox, and we need to talk with each other more and \nwe need to listen even more than we talk. Why? Because the \nconsequences, if we cannot find a way to work together, are extremely \nserious.\n  No problem we face is more troubling or urgent than our economic \nfuture. Our unemployment rate is still above 9 percent, and it is much \nhigher in some regions of the country. Home foreclosures are still \nexpected to rise. Even more troubling is this fact: Americans are less \noptimistic about their economic prospects than they were during the \nGreat Depression. That is a very serious situation.\n  On top of those grim statistics, we face a massive budget deficit and \na crippling debt that not only threaten our long-term economic \nstability but darken the horizon in a way that discourages investment \nand innovation that we need to spur American job creation today.\n  Moreover, our apparent inability to squarely address the problem in a \npartisan way is a signal to the American people--as if they need \nfurther proof--that their institutions of government are not working. \nAnd that, in my opinion, is as dangerous as any attack on our country.\n  Many have remarked that it is past time to have a serious discussion \nabout how to turn our economic situation around. I have faith we can do \nthat, but only if we are able to set aside the ideological differences \nthat have sidetracked our politics, and frankly our policymaking, up to \nnow.\n  We can't reach the level of bipartisan cooperation we need in this \nbody if we prevent substantive debate and cut off the rights of the \nminority. But neither can we make necessary progress if Members of the \nSenate continue to be able to use technical loopholes and procedural \ngymnastics to hijack the Senate--literally--for days and, in some cases \nweeks at a time.\n  That is why today's debate--so ably led by colleagues from across the \ncountry--is more than just an esoteric debate about the Senate's rules. \nIt is a critical turning point, and it is why today I am again \nintroducing a resolution which I believe can help reduce the \nopportunity for gridlock while also encouraging both sides to work \ntogether on the most important issues we face in our Nation.\n  I developed this proposal after listening to and talking with experts \non Senate procedure from both sides of the aisle, including the noted \ncongressional scholar Norm Ornstein of the Conservative American \nEnterprise Institute.\n  In a nutshell, I propose that by eliminating unnecessary \nopportunities for delay--without making changes that would jam through \nlegislation at the expense of the minority party--we can improve the \nway the Senate works and make it more effective and fairer for the \nAmerican people.\n  If I might, I want to make a couple of comments on some of the \nspecifics of what I am proposing, similar to what the Senators from \nOregon, New Mexico, Iowa, and others have put on the table.\n  I would first level the playing fields between the majority and the \nminority on cloture votes and require Senators actually vote in \nopposition to the bill they are filibustering. Currently, cloture is \ninvoked when three-fifths of the Chamber votes yes, so staying home is \nthe same as voting no, and Members can simply threaten to filibuster \nand skip town with no recourse.\n  My proposal would require that Senators show up, debate, and actually \nvote against a bill if they are conducting a filibuster, by changing \nthe rules to invoke cloture not on three-fifths of the Chamber but \ninvoking cloture when three-fifths of those voting to end debate create \nan incentive to actually have a meaningful discussion. If Members don't \nshow, the threshold is lowered accordingly--three-fifths of 90 is 54 \nvotes to end debate, three-fifths of 80 is 48 votes to cut off a \nfilibuster, and so on.\n  Second, I would reduce the number of votes required in debate on a \nsingle bill. The Senate rules now allow for a filibuster on a motion to \nproceed to a bill, a substitute amendment to a bill, final passage \nafter we have already overcome a filibuster on the exact same text--and \nthe list continues. There are three separate opportunities to \nfilibuster before sending a bill to a conference committee. My proposal \nwould eliminate all these opportunities to filibuster except for final \npassage.\n  Third, I would shorten the timeframe required to invoke cloture. I \nwould propose we vote 24 hours after cloture is filed, instead of \nwaiting 2 days, as is required today. I would also allow the 30 hours \nof postcloture debate to be split between the parties, to avoid \nneedless delays. In total, we could shorten the time required for \ncloture by nearly 40 hours for a single cloture motion.\n  Fourth, I would end the requirement that amendments be read in their \nentirety if they have been made available on line at least 24 hours in \nadvance.\n  Fifth, I would end the requirement that Senate committees seek \nconsent to meet.\n  Sixth, after I propose that we change the rules to move more quickly \non judicial nominations--allowing a final vote immediately after \ncloture is invoked on a nomination.\n  Finally, I would provide a way to call up an amendment when a \nmajority leader has filled the amendment tree.\n  The Senate is famous for great debates and a free amendment process. \nBut in recent years the process of presenting amendments has frequently \nbeen shut off by the majority party. So my proposal would, on a limited \nbasis, give Senators the opportunity to present their amendments when \nthey are otherwise being blocked from doing so.\n  The Senate has been called the world's greatest deliberative body. \nBut what happens if we don't deliberate? I am afraid we risk turning \nthe Senate into an extension of the 24-hour political spin cycle, which \nseeks to separate us rather than allowing us to work out solutions to \nthe problems we face.\n  Every day, proud Americans come to our Capitol hoping to watch \ndebates such as those of years past. Many are increasingly dismayed to \nsee a small number of Senators, such as those here today, debating \namong themselves in an empty Chamber. We don't even require Senators to \nattend their own filibusters--no ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' no \nactual debate.\n  I want the Senate to work the way Americans envision it does--where \nMembers discuss their differences, cooperate, vote on amendments, and \nimprove legislation for the good of the country.\n  With that in mind, I hope our colleagues will join me to seize the \nopportunity we have before us. Let's work\n\n[[Page S48]]\n\ntogether to improve the way the Senate operates. I want to extend my \nhand to the Republicans to ask for ideas in how we can improve the way \nthe Senate operates. I want to work with anybody, as I think all my \ncolleagues do, to solve these problems in front of us. We have a \nresponsibility to work together to bring about the cooperation and the \nproblem solving Americans expect and deserve.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate your attention, I appreciate the \nimportant work all my colleagues have undertaken, and I look forward to \nworking with the 99 other Members of the Senate to make the Senate a \nSenate we know and love and believe is the greatest deliberative body \nin the world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I wish to talk a little about the issue \nwe have been discussing, and first let me congratulate my colleagues \nwho have been on the floor on this issue, particularly the Senator from \nNew Mexico, Senator Udall; the Senator from Oregon, Senator Merkley; \nthe Senator from Colorado, also named Udall; and the Senator from Iowa, \nSenator Harkin; and many others who have participated in this debate. \nThey have done a great job today.\n  The other thing I think I appreciated--and Senator Harkin helped do \nthis--is there was not just debate, there was actual discussion, even \nwhen we didn't agree. I thought it was pretty interesting watching on \nthe TV in my office when Senator Roberts came and stood by a desk here \non the Democratic side, a desk away from Senator Harkin, and they \ndidn't agree on the issues but they debated the issues. What a great \nfirst-step metaphor for the kind of debates we want to have here on the \nSenate floor. So this has been a very positive and hopefully prescient \nopening of the debate to change the rules because we all know that in \nthe last Congress the Senate didn't function effectively and the time \nfor change has come. I want to salute the leaders, as well as Senator \nKlobuchar, Senator Franken, Senator Lautenberg, and so many others, who \nhave been so involved in our discussion and for the work they have \ndone.\n  I also want to say to my colleagues this is not something that has \njust happened recently. This idea that all of a sudden this has popped \nup in the Senate is wrong. Last year, the Rules Committee--and I was \nurged by Senator Udall to do this among the first days of the session 2 \nyears ago, and I think we did a pretty extensive and good job--held six \nhearings that examined the history of the filibuster, trends in the use \nof the filibuster, secret holds, stalled nominations, and proposals for \nchange. In those hearings, we heard from Senators from both parties who \nhave valuable ideas about the need to reform the filibuster. Senators \nHarkin, Lautenberg, Wyden, Grassley, Udall, Udall, McCaskill, Gregg, \nand Bennet all testified at the hearings. We also brought former \nSenators of both parties, scholars, and former Senate staff of both \nparties to come and testify.\n  In the first half of the 20th century, filibusters and filibuster \nthreats were relatively rare events. That has been documented already, \nand our hearings documented it extensively. But since that time, the \nnumber has continued to dramatically increase. When you face an average \nof two cloture motions per week--which is what has happened currently--\nthen we know there is a problem, and it is no mystery that the Senate \nhas been labeled as ``dysfunctional.''\n  Between 1917 and 1971, there was an average of one cloture motion \nfiled per year. In the 110th and 111th, we had more than 70 cloture \nmotions. These cloture motion counts are a response to the filibuster, \nand it is distorting the way the Senate does business.\n  For the legislative branch, hundreds of bills passed by the House in \nthe 111th Congress were not considered, even though they had passed the \nHouse by voice vote or with a majority of House Republicans voting yes. \nThe Senate is supposed to be a cooling saucer, not an ice box.\n  In the executive branch and the judiciary, dozens of judicial \nappointments were delayed or blocked from floor consideration for \nmonths and months in the last Congress. Many of these were approved \nunanimously by both Democrats and Republicans in committee, yet sat on \nthe Executive Calendar for months because of secret holds. This is \ndangerous at a time when we need a Federal Government using all its \nresources to fight terrorism, protect our country, and address our \neconomic needs.\n  I salute Senators Wyden, McCaskill, and Grassley for focusing our \nattention on this issue. It is important to end anonymous or secret \nholds and shine some light on the kinds of long-term delays that can \nhold up a nomination or a bill for weeks or months or even longer.\n  Also, during the fiscal year 2010, half of all nondefense spending--\n$290 billion--was appropriated without legal authority because Congress \nhadn't reauthorized the programs. The unprecedented threat of a \nfilibuster--not even the actual use of the filibuster--has prevented \ndebate with such frequency that extended deliberation is a dying \ncommodity. Make no mistake about it, the everyday threat of the \nfilibuster does not ensure debate, it restricts it.\n\n  Reforming the rules in a thoughtful way would clear the way for more \nlegislating, not less. Filibusters provide a minority of Senators a way \nto make their voices heard, but they should not provide a way for a \nminority of Senators or even a single Senator to grind the Senate to a \nhalt regardless of whether they are Democrats, Republicans, or \nIndependents.\n  Reform will engage the American people and reenergize this \ninstitution. This will not end the filibuster or cut off debate. On the \ncontrary, it will pull back the curtain and show the American people \nwhat we actually believe and what our deliberations are really about.\n  There have been many ideas for reform presented by my colleagues that \nare worthy of discussion. The Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, \ntestified before the Rules Committee about his plan, which he called \nthe ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' proposal. Senator Merkley, Senator \nUdall, and others have developed their own versions of this important \nconcept, which I call the talking filibuster. This talking filibuster \nidea would require filibustering Senators to keep speaking on the floor \nafter cloture fails, to show clearly their wish to continue debate and \nto allow them to talk for as long as they wish.\n  Currently, the only evidence that a Senator is facing a filibuster is \nthe vote on cloture. The Senate floor has evolved into a place where \nthe majority assumes that each bill will be opposed and that little \nactual debate will occur on legislation. The rules require a vote of \nthree-fifths of the Senators chosen and sworn to end debate on a matter \nor measure. The very question that is posed to the Senate in a cloture \nvote is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate should be brought to \na close? Those are the words. If it turns out that enough Senators \nanswer that question: No, we want more debate, then those Senators \nshould actually be required to debate. It is difficult to explain to \nthe American people that the Senators who voted for additional debate \nare silent when then given that opportunity. If they want to debate, \nwell, then let's debate.\n  One way we can guarantee fair and meaningful debate after Senators \nvote on cloture to continue debate--and cloture fails--the Senate \nremains on that measure and Senators must actually debate the bill. \nSenators may be recognized one after the other, as long as debate is \ncontinuous. If no more Senators seek to debate the issue, then the \nmajority leader can move to close debate.\n  Obviously, there are technical things that have to be worked out--and \nwe are working hard to do that--to make sure this proposal works and is \nviable. In the past, attempts at debate have been frustrated by quorum \ncalls or unnecessary motions, all aimed at avoiding actual debate. If \nwe change the rules to encourage extended debate after cloture fails, \nthen the priority during this period will be to either debate the \nmatter or move forward and not play parliamentary games. The American \npeople deserve better of their elected officials than what the Senate \nhas been giving them. Governing is not a game of charades.\n  The majority will not choose to waste floor time on a matter the \nminority is committed to stop. But will\n\n[[Page S49]]\n\nthe minority choose to filibuster every single piece of legislation if \nactual debate is required? I don't think so.\n  That would apply whether Republicans are in the majority or Democrats \nare in the majority.\n  In addition to the other worthy options proposed for reform, I think \nthis proposal is strong because it allows the minority the same ability \nto debate and block legislation--so long as they actually debate. If \nthere is no actual debate, there can be no filibuster, and the Senate \ncan proceed to do its business for the American people.\n  I believe this modest proposal is one on which both Democrats and \nRepublicans should agree. It could be a point of bipartisan agreement, \nand I will present it in the bipartisan negotiations happening over the \nnext few weeks.\n  Of course there are other good-faith proposals that my colleagues \nhave put forward. Many of them are thoughtful. Most all of them would \nrepresent meaningful change without altering in a too jarring way the \nrules of this institution. Nobody wants us to become the House of \nRepresentatives. Everyone understands that we should not rule simply by \nmajority vote on every issue. However, we can pull the curtain back and \nmake sure that when people say they want more debate, they debate.\n  In the next 2 weeks, we should look at these proposals--all of them. \nDuring the recess, we need to talk to each other, Democrats and \nRepublicans, about genuine ways to reform this body, to restore the \nSenate to its traditional role as the world's greatest deliberative \nbody, and to do so in a way that encourages full and open debate--both \nfor the majority which proposes and for the minority which wishes to \nmodify what the majority proposes.\n  I believe we owe it to the American people to reform the Senate so it \nfunctions in a way that best represents their interests.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, first, let me thank the Senator from \nNew York for his very distinguished leadership of the Rules Committee \nand for the very open and thorough way in which he engaged that \ncommittee on these issues of addressing the filibuster and problems \nthat have been caused by its current abuse on the Senate floor. Let me \nalso thank Senators Udall and Merkley, who worked so hard to organize \nthis and who have put together what I think is a very good proposal.\n  At the outset of my remarks, I ask unanimous consent that I be added \nas a cosponsor to the rules resolution that is here, at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The distinguished Senator from Oregon, Mr. Merkley, \nshowed a photograph a little while ago of Jimmy Stewart in ``Mr. Smith \nGoes to Washington.'' That has become the sort of emblematic, signature \ndemonstration of the American Senate filibuster.\n  There is a scene in that movie that I am sure the Senator is familiar \nwith where a reporter is up in the galleries and is describing the \naction down here on the Senate floor, is describing Jimmy Stewart--the \nSenator he represents engaging in the filibuster. The reporter \ndescribes the filibuster as ``democracy's finest show . . . the right \nto talk your head off . . . the American privilege of free speech in \nits most dramatic form . . . one lone and single American holding the \ngreatest floor in the land . . . bleary-eyed, voice gone.'' That is \nwhat we think of when we think of the traditional Senate filibuster. In \nthose days, you stood up and you filibustered against a bill because \nyou were opposed to it, because you hated it, because on principle you \nwanted to stand and fight against it. That was the old filibuster.\n  Now when this Chamber is engaged in a filibuster, how does the \nAmerican public know? When they are watching this floor on C-SPAN and \nthey are looking for a filibuster, they don't see democracy's finest \nshow, they don't see anybody talking their head off, they don't see the \nAmerican privilege of free speech in its most dramatic form. What they \nsee is a droning, tedious quorum call as the parliamentary staff read \noff, one by one, the names of Senators who are not present, and this \nChamber stands useless during that period. Why is that? Partly it is \nbecause when Jimmy Stewart was undertaking his filibuster, he was \nexercising the right of an individual Senator to take this floor and to \nhold it and to speak. What is different is that when it is filibuster \nby party rather than filibuster by one individual Senator, then there \nis a whole array of procedural mechanisms the minority party has to \nprovoke the majority leader to file for cloture.\n  Cloture is the filing that allows the majority leader to bring debate \nto a conclusion and to limit amendments. When cloture is filed, then \nthere is 30 hours mandatory for debate. What has happened here is that \nthe 30 hours mandatory for debate has become the prize, has become the \ngoal of the modern filibuster. That explains why we are no longer \nfilibustering bills we are opposed to when we are in the minority. The \nminority actually filibusters bills their Members support. They \nfilibuster nominees who get voted through unanimously when the vote is \nfinally held.\n  What is the filibuster about? It is about forcing cloture and forcing \nthose 30-hour increments of time to be burned up. If you are \nfilibustering the bill itself and you are filibustering the motion to \nproceed, you have a dual filibuster, and if you are filibustering \namendments, you can load on an awful lot of 30-hour periods to the \nSenate floor and you can prevent anything from being done in those 30-\nhour periods just by sitting back and doing nothing and objecting when \nthe majority party tries to move to the vote. All it takes is one \nperson waiting in the cloakroom for the minority to force that 30-hour \nperiod to run. If you stacked up dozens and dozens of 30-hour periods, \nwhat you do is you take up the entire time available to the Senate and \nyou impede this institution in its ability to get its work done.\n  That is what we are doing right now. That is why I think it is so \nimportant that the changes we are recommending restore the Senate to \nthe traditional filibuster. We do it in two ways. First of all, if \nthese rule changes pass, you will not get to filibuster the motion to \nproceed to the bill and then get to filibuster all over again on the \nbill and double the filibuster. If you really care about the bill, if \nyou are really opposed to the bill, if you really hate the bill, you \ncan come and talk your head off, but you don't get to do it twice--once \non a pure parliamentary measure. That will cut down some of the wasted \ntime, some of these droning hours that you watch on C-SPAN with nothing \nhappening in the Senate and the time being wasted, locked in the \nfilibuster.\n  There is another rules change that I believe is important. The 30-\nhour period is called the period for debate. What this rule change \nwould do is, when the debate stops, the 30-hour period stops. Whoever \nis presiding would simply note that there is no longer debate and would \ncall the vote. You can still debate the whole 30 hours if you want to \ncome here and debate, but when the talking stops, you vote. You are not \nin a position where you can commandeer 30 hours of Senate time, force \nthe Senate into quorum calls, and defend against going to the vote with \none lone Senator back in the cloakroom, able to come out and object \nwhenever the majority tries to move the Senate to a vote and get the \nSenate back in its business again.\n  These are two simple repairs to the cloture rule that will make it \nless of a prize for the minority, that will prevent us from spending \nall these 30-hour increments droning away in 30-hour filibuster quorum \ncalls, and put the Senate back to where it should be--the great chamber \nof debate where people actually have to come to the floor, say their \npiece, and when they are done, we go on to the next piece of work.\n  I commend everybody who has worked on this. I think it is a very \nvaluable step we are taking. I don't think it is a change away from the \ntraditions of the Senate; I see it as returning to the real traditions \nof the Senate, of real debate, not just wasting time for wasting time's \nsake but allowing the Senate to be productive while also allowing \nMembers who have opposition to a bill to state it as forthrightly as \nthey wish, to engage in, as the reporter said in ``Mr. Smith Goes to \nWashington,'' democracy's finest show, the right to talk your head off, \nthe American privilege of free speech in its most dramatic form.\n\n[[Page S50]]\n\n  I thank all Senators present for entertaining my thoughts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. First, I wish to say I am so pleased to be with \ncolleagues who are standing up for activity on behalf of the citizens, \nthe constituents we represent, to get things done.\n  I doubt many of us would be happy with a report card we got in either \nhigh school or college or whatever education we got beyond that--I \ndoubt we would be proud of any report card that resembles that which we \nhave obtained in this facility, in this great house of debate, in this \ndistinguished body of legislators, one of the most prominent--the most \nprominent--let me qualify that--legislative body across the world and \nthe envy of so many who think the United States is still one great \ncountry.\n  We want to do the right thing. But here what has happened, we find \nourselves in a morass of dilatory activities, things that do nothing \nbut stop progress, and that is the mission we see. I congratulate my \ncolleagues who have taken hold here to make sure we do whatever we can \nto change the facility.\n  I have here my picture of Jimmy Stewart, ``Mr. Smith.'' While I am \nnot anxious to admit it, I do, I remember seeing the picture. We need \nnot discuss the precise date, but it was some time ago when I saw this, \nand it left a vivid impression in my mind. But I cannot tell you what \nit was about, except that he was one trouper, that he stood on his \nfeet, so many hours it is hard to understand how the body responded to \nthe opportunity, trying to clean things up.\n  The date of the film was somewhere around the end of the 1930s, 1939, \nmost likely. That was not the exact date, but in that vicinity. Even \nthen, they were discussing what could be done to move things along and \nhow the kind of effort he gave as Mr. Smith was required to honor the \npeople, the responsibility he had to the people.\n  So we know what kind of report card the legislators here and in the \nHouse have gotten from the American people because they are sick and \ntired of seeing all this empty space, listening to words I could \ndescribe more in the vernacular as gobbledygook-gook, not understanding \nwhat is going on but knowing very well that nothing is happening that \nis benefiting them.\n  So when we see this low public opinion from Americans all across the \ncountry, it is because they do not believe we are getting things done \nthat they sent us here for. Each one of us who has been elected, I do \nnot care how popular or how remote, the fact is, you had to work hard \nto get elected and so proud--and I look today, as I saw person after \nperson hold up their hand to take the oath. I have done it five times \nhere and each time was a thrill. Even as I watched colleagues walk up \nthere and heard their names called and saw them raise their hand, and \nto feel the pride they felt, I do not care Republican or Democrat, to \nfeel the pride they felt, to be able to take this job on their hands, \nto get the support of the public in their States, enough to win an \nelection, and then we show the public a lack of activity.\n  We have been through discussions, speeches made earlier, good ones, \ndescribing the number of times the filibuster has been used. If I might \nask the majority whip, is it the record number of filibusters ever in \nthe history of the Senate? The Senator from Illinois confirms that. \nHere we are, and the need has never been greater to get something done \nto let the American people know their government is there to help them \nthrough a crisis, to help them regain their jobs and regain their pride \nin themselves.\n  Make no mistake about it; the absence of progress in the Senate \npromotes bitterness and anger among the American people. Make no \nmistake; an empty Senate Chamber is no way to respond to the public's \nneeds. All too often this is what happened because the minority now has \nsimply been abusing Senate rules. They can do it. But it is an abuse of \nthe process.\n  Last year we were locked in a constant struggle to help jobless \nAmericans. Several times we attempted to bring legislation to the floor \nto extend unemployment benefits for millions of people who had no other \nsource of income, who were in jeopardy of losing their homes and losing \ntheir opportunity to care for their families and being personally \nhumiliated and disgraced about that and we could not get an agreement \nto pass an unemployment benefits bill until it was included with other \nlegislation that had to pass.\n  Back in June, 59 Senators wanted to restore aid for those workers who \nhad gone without income for weeks. Our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle objected and delayed the vote, then left town for a week-long \nbreak. By the way, I keep on reminding those hearing me that this is \nunder the disguise of a filibuster, a legal process that is permitted \nby the Senate rules to be engaged in when there is a disagreement about \na piece of legislation or a process that has to take place.\n  We left more than 1 million Americans in limbo for several agonizing \nweeks. Our opponents said they were simply filibustering the bill. In \nother words, they wanted to talk more about the substance. But they did \nnot want to talk about the substance. They did not want the public to \nhear the truth about their views. But they did not even want to talk on \nthe floor. They just left the Senate empty and silent.\n  That is why I reintroduced my ``Mr. Smith'' bill. I brought this up \ninitially last March. It is almost a year now since I brought Mr. Smith \nback to this Chamber. As we know, the legislation is named for Jimmy \nStewart's character in the classic movie, ``Mr. Smith Goes to \nWashington.'' Frankly, we now look, the names are different, the \nmission is the same. There are those who want to make progress and \nthose who want to do nothing more than delay progress.\n  As I said earlier, Mr. Smith wanted to make a point, spoke for 23 \nhours. These days, Senators simply object to the proceeding, walk away, \nand leave an empty Chamber behind. How are we supposed to create jobs \nin an empty Chamber? How are we supposed to increase educational \nopportunities in an empty Chamber? How are we supposed to help keep \npeople in their homes in an empty Chamber?\n  The ``Mr. Smith'' Act will bring deliberations back to purportedly \nthe world's greatest deliberative body. It will make lawmaking more \ntransparent and Senators more accountable. Members of this body will no \nlonger be able, if we pass this rule change, to be able to launch a \nfilibuster and then skip town, leaving the Senate in a stalemate.\n  If you have the courage, stand and explain to the American people why \nyou are objecting to things that can help the average family. This is \nstill a recession. Yes, there are a lot of people at the top making \nlots and lots of money. We have seen it in the newspapers. We have seen \nthe list of billionaires who make that much money in a single year. But \nwe do not see the same pictures of people who are forlorn because they \ncannot help themselves, and they look to the government to be there \nwith them.\n  I know from personal experience that my life changed radically when I \ngot out of the Army and was afforded the GI bill. My father died after \nI enlisted. My mother was a 37-year-old widow. My father was sick for \n13 months with cancer. At the time, there were not the products that \nmake pain less acute or that provide more help for recovery. It was not \nthere.\n  So we had not only the loss of a father--I had joined the Army. When \nI was 18 years old, I enlisted--we had bills and bankruptcy and life \nwas miserable. The GI bill made the difference in my life. I was able \nto join two other people in my home city, friends of mine, in creating \na company, three of us.\n  Now it employes 45,000 people. The company is called Automatic Data \nProcessing, better known as ADP, because I got help when we desperately \nneeded it, when my family and I could never think about my going to \ncollege. I wound up going to Columbia University, something so far out \nof sight I never dreamed it was possible. But it was there. There are \ntimes when people across the country say to our leadership: Please, \ngive us a chance. Give us a chance to stay in our home. Give us a \nchance to educate my son and my daughter. They can learn. We do not \nhave the money.\n\n[[Page S51]]\n\n  Make sure health care is available, that no matter what your \ncondition of being is, you cannot be precluded from getting insurance. \nThat is what is proposed in the health care bill that right now is in \ndanger of being repealed, if the House takes the action as purported.\n  So what we are talking about, to summarize, is that we have to get \nbusy and show the people across the country that this is not just a \nring for showing how clever a speech can be or cute an idea might be, \nwhen all that is being done is stopping progress. Progress. They object \nto bills being even moved along so they can be considered--anything \nthey can do to obstruct movement.\n  So we may be unable to bring Mr. Smith back, but we can write real \naccountability for filibusters and for the sake of a functioning \ndemocracy--more than a functioning democracy, a degree of dignity and \nhope for people who have been hurt by an unemployment record never \nbefore seen in the country, with the number of people out of work in \nthe multiple millions, and they say: Mr. Senator, help us. Be there to \nhelp us now. We are not looking for charity. We are looking for a hand \nthat will get us started, get this economy going. We owe it to them.\n  I say to those who want to obstruct it, be brave enough to stand and \ntell the people here or the people on television or those who read \nabout what we are doing, tell them why it is you are objecting, and \nthen we will restore a degree of confidence in those who serve here, \nthose who work so hard to be elected, and those who can represent the \npeople well.\n  But we cannot sit in silence, just wasting time. I hope we will come \nto our senses, make the changes in the rules that will stop the \nfilibuster from being a disguise for inaction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley.) The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the issue which has \nbeen considered on the floor today by my colleagues. I thank, \nespecially, the Senators from Utah, Oregon, and Colorado, as well as \nmany others, for their leadership in discussing the procedures of the \nSenate.\n  When I went home over the break, I spent my time back in Illinois \nwith my wife in my hometown of Springfield and a lot of time around the \nhouse and a lot of things had to be considered. I left the decisions of \nwar and peace behind in Washington, DC, and went home to face the real \ndecisions: Are we going to change our cable TV service? Are we paying \ntoo much for the Internet? Things that my wife finally put in front of \nme and said: We need some decisions here.\n  As I considered those weighty decisions, particularly when it came to \ncable television and what we would receive in Springfield, I could not \nhelp but reflect on the fact that, similar to many Americans, we like \nto have C-SPAN so we can follow the House and Senate.\n  You may know in West Virginia, as I know in Illinois, there are \npeople who are obviously suffering from insomnia who watch C-SPAN all \nthe time and find it very restful and sleep inducing.\n  If they watch the Senate, it is something else. It is not only sleep \ninducing because of so little activity on the floor of the Senate, it \nis, in fact, an unfair economic situation that someone is paying a \ncable TV bill for C-SPAN covering the Senate when we do so little. They \nought to get a refund. Families across America are entitled to a refund \nif they tune in to C-SPAN, Senate version, and watch us day after weary \nday, with our delightful and talented staff people slowly reading the \nquorum call and names of the Senators. That is it. If you have watched \nC-SPAN in the Senate for the last several years, you will see that more \noften than not, a lot of people say to me: Senator, why is not anything \ngoing on in the Senate? When you talk in the Senate, why isn't anybody \nthere? Basic questions an average person might ask. They reflect on \nwhat has happened to the Senate, and that is why we are here with this \ndiscussion this evening. I thank the Senators who have been involved, \nincluding Senator Lautenberg.\n\n  One of the things that surprised me when I first came to the Senate, \nI heard this was the world's most deliberative body. This was the place \nto come to debate the big issues. Today when there was a swearing in of \nthe Senator from North Carolina, one of his predecessors was here, \nSenator Lauch Faircloth. He was the first Senator I faced off with on \nthe floor over an issue when I was elected 14 years ago. It was an \nissue involving tobacco which I had been following pretty closely in my \ncongressional career, and he was from the State of North Carolina where \ntobacco is a big issue. He didn't like my amendment, and he came to the \nfloor. I was offering my first amendment. There was a lady who worked \nin the Senate named Lula Davis. I had served in the House for 14 years, \nbut I didn't quite know the Senate procedures as well.\n  I said to her: How much time do I have?\n  She said: You have 1 hour.\n  I said: Is that equally divided?\n  She said: No, Senator, you have 1 hour.\n  House Members don't get an hour for anything. Five minutes is the \nusual course, 15 minutes if it is a great deal or if they want to stick \naround until midnight, they might get a special order for an hour.\n  Here I was with an hour on the Senate floor to debate my amendment. \nSenator Faircloth sat on the other side. I stumbled through it. I asked \nunanimous consent to allow the time to be equally divided between \nmyself and Senator Faircloth so we could debate the amendment. I \nthought that was fairly reasonable. Senator Faircloth said: I object.\n  I was stunned. Clearly, here I am with my amendment being as fair as \ncan be, and he is not interested in the debate.\n  I am not going to pick on him because he reflected the feelings of \nmany Senators here: that they are here on the floor to give speeches, \nmany of them written by very talented staff people, and then leave the \nfloor and go off and do something else. There is very little debate on \nthe floor of the Senate, real debate. I could count on one hand the \ntimes I have in 14 years engaged another colleague in an actual debate \nthat went back and forth over the merits of an issue.\n  One of the things we are discussing tonight is what to do with the \nrules of the Senate so we engage in more debate--we need it--so that we \nhave less time that is being wasted in the Senate, fewer hours that are \nbeing ticked off a clock to reach 30 hours or whatever it happens to be \non a cloture motion, and more actual debate so Senators with differing \npoints of view can state their points of view and debate them back and \nforth and other Senators can then listen, certainly the public can \nlisten and those in the gallery and can decide who has the merits of \nthe debate.\n  Debate isn't something we should shy away from. It is an important \npart of the Senate that we should value and that we should honor to \nmake sure the rules create that opportunity.\n  The Presiding Officer from the State of Oregon has suggested, along \nwith others, that we have more debate and more votes. I think we \nshould. For a time there was this feeling that we had to protect \nMembers of the Senate from controversial votes. That is behind a lot of \nthe decisionmaking that has taken place and brought us to this moment \nin the history of the Senate.\n  Perhaps I have a different view of it. But having been on Capitol \nHill for a long time in the House and the Senate, I have stacked up \nmany controversial votes, tens of thousands of them. It will be fair \ngame. For any political opponent ever running against me in the future, \nthere is plenty to work with. I don't need to give them something new \nto beat me over the head with. I have plenty of votes in my past. I \nthink I can defend them for the most part, and I am prepared to do so. \nI am not afraid of tomorrow's controversial vote. In fact, I think it \nis part of why we are here.\n  There was a man who served here many years ago from Oklahoma, Mike \nSynar of Muskogee. He was one of my closest friends. Synar was an \nunusual character in the House. He was one who, faced with the choice \nbetween taking an easy, noncontroversial way out or a controversial, \nconfrontational approach, would always choose the confrontational \napproach. He would walk right into the wall of fire and welcome it \nbecause he thought it was part\n\n[[Page S52]]\n\nof what he was elected to the House to do. He used to stand up in the \ncaucuses of House Democrats when they would be whining and crying over \nthe thought of facing a controversial vote and say to them: What is \nwrong with you people? If you don't want to fight fires, don't become a \nfirefighter. If you don't want to cast controversial votes, don't run \nfor the House of Representatives or, in this case, the Senate.\n  I think the same is true today. Although some of my colleagues face \ntough election campaigns in tougher States than my home State of \nIllinois, the fact is, coming here and casting tough and even \ncontroversial votes is part of why we were elected and why the people \nexpect us to come and face the music on difficult issues.\n  Bringing debate back to the floor, bringing more votes to the floor \ncertainly is a move in the right direction.\n  I say to the Senators from New Mexico, Oregon, and others that their \nproposal that would allow germane amendments as part of the regular \norder of the Senate is a move in the right direction. That way the \nminority and majority get an opportunity to amend a bill. Can it be \nabused? It can. But making these germane and relevant amendments makes \na difference. I can recall one colleague on the other side of the aisle \nwho kept coming to the floor repeatedly, day after day and week after \nweek, to offer the same amendment over and over, even when he was \npassing the amendment. Sometimes he would pass it; sometimes he \nwouldn't. But he couldn't help himself. He just had to keep offering it \nover and over. As he offered this amendment, it didn't enhance the \nbill. It didn't enhance the debate. It gave him a chance to put out a \npress release.\n  One can abuse that process. So making sure the amendments are limited \nto those that are relevant certainly is a reasonable thing to do.\n  Let me say a word about the 60-vote margin. The 60-vote margin, as \nformer Vice President Mondale wrote in his guest column recently--I \nbelieve, in the Washington Post--was a compromise. In days gone by it \ntook 67 votes to end a filibuster, to bring cloture. Then in the 1970s, \nVice President Mondale, then a Senator, joined with others on a \nbipartisan basis and lowered that to 60 votes. But it was still a rare \nand unusual thing to do, to filibuster and need a cloture vote of 60 \nvotes. Unfortunately, that 60-vote standard has been corrupted into a \nnew standard for passage of legislation.\n  Allow me to give two examples. We considered a Wall Street reform \nbill. There were dozens of amendments offered. The Senator from Oregon \nhad a controversial amendment and waited for days, maybe weeks, for a \nchance for his day on the floor of the Senate. After about 25 \namendments had been offered and considered to the Wall Street reform \nbill with a standard of a majority vote, I had an amendment relative to \ninterchange fees on debit cards, a controversial amendment. Credit card \ncompanies and big banks hated it.\n  At that point the announcement was made unilaterally, incidentally, \nthe Durbin amendment will require 60 votes. Everything else had been a \nmajority vote to that point. There was no way for me to challenge that. \nIf I wanted my amendment to come to the floor, I had to accept a higher \nmargin to pass it than all the other amendments that had preceded it.\n  Why? Because the threat of a filibuster was there, a filibuster \nagainst my amendment. That threat alone raised the margin and standard \nfor that vote to 60. From the other side's point of view, many of whom \nopposed my amendment, it is a pretty easy thing to start a filibuster \nif you don't have to engage personally or make a personal commitment to \nit. They tossed it out as a standard. Sixty votes became the \nrequirement. Fortunately for me, I had 64 votes and passed it.\n  The same is not true of another provision which means an awful lot to \nme, the DREAM Act. The DREAM Act is a reform of our immigration laws \nthat is long overdue for children brought to the United States who are \nasking for a chance to become legal. They can do it through military \nservice or by education, achieving at least 2 years of college. I have \ntried for 10 years to pass this measure and repeatedly have had \nmajority support on the floor of the Senate. It has been ruled not \nenough. You need 60 if you are going to pass the DREAM Act. Just in the \nlast 3 weeks, we had it considered again. It failed by not reaching 60 \nvotes but had 55 votes. So the fact is, establishing this new 60-vote \nmargin has become too commonplace for anything that anyone wants to \nbrand as controversial that might require a filibuster. That has to \nchange. Sixty-vote requirements should be rare in this body. They \nshould be used sparingly, and they should not be applied on a daily \nbasis to any amendment or bill that I or any other Senator at any given \nmoment objects to.\n  Let me also say when it came to unemployment insurance, I had a \nlittle debate with the former Senator from Kentucky, Jim Bunning, now \nretired, and insisted that he stay on the floor as I repeatedly asked \nfor unanimous consent to extend unemployment benefits. Some Republicans \ncame to the floor and charged that was unfair to ask the Senator from \nKentucky to stay on the floor so that he could object to my unanimous \nconsent requests. I am sorry. There were millions of Americans who were \nnot receiving unemployment benefits, and I think it is not unfair to \nsay to the Senator who is objecting to those benefits: Stick around, \nmiss that basketball game you want to see tonight, which he had \nannounced on the floor. Stick around and suffer a little bit because \nyou happen to believe that is the right thing to do.\n  Eventually, after a matter of days, unemployment benefits were \nextended. But the point I am getting to is that we have reached a point \nhere that is way beyond the protection of the minority. It is the \nprotection of what I consider to be an indolent approach to the Senate \nwhere we want the easiest way around things. We don't want to debate \nthem. We don't want to vote on them. We don't want to face a majority \nvote that we might lose. So we have contrived a new set of standards, \nprocedures, and rules that we are addressing today as part of this \nreform conversation.\n  Many times when Senators file a cloture motion or an objection that \nis noted by their side of the aisle and then the clock starts to run, \nthe 30 hours, before there is a vote, many times those Senators leave. \nBefore the Senator from Oregon arrived in this body there was one \nSenator who objected to our moving to a measure, forcing the Senate to \nstay in session until Saturday, when in the afternoon the time expired \nand a vote was called. The Senator who objected didn't show up. He \nwasn't there. We asked where he was. He had to go to a wedding. Really? \nThe rest of us stayed here and waited for the vote that he demanded \nwhile he went off to a family social obligation. That is not right.\n  The good part of the rules changes that are being discussed now would \nrequire Senators like that Senator, if they believe the business of the \nSenate should stop or be delayed, to invest themselves personally in \nthe conversation--to be here. Is that too much to ask? As the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania once said: Earn it and own it. If you believe the \nbusiness of the Senate should come to a halt for 30 hours, then for \ngoodness' sake have at least the decency and the personal commitment to \npark yourself at your desk and argue your point of view. If you are too \ntired to do it or too distracted or can think of something better to do \nwith your time, be my guest and walk through the doors and let the \nSenate proceed with its business. But if it is important enough for you \nto stop the business of the Senate, I happen to agree with those who \nare calling for rules reforms; we should have that change.\n  We should make those who are invested in it stay and invest their \ntime, their personal commitment to that undertaking.\n  Finally, the nomination process has been corrupted to a point I don't \neven recognize. When Chief Justice Roberts chastises the Senate for all \nof the judicial vacancies in America, I know what he is talking about. \nIn my home district of Illinois, the central district, in normal times \nthere are four district court judges. Currently, we have three \nvacancies. One judge, Mike McCuskey, is running all over downstate \nIllinois from courthouse to courthouse to try to keep the criminal \ncalendar going. I am afraid he has little or no time for the civil \ncalendar because of three vacancies.\n  Two of those vacancies the President nominated judges to fill. The \njudges\n\n[[Page S53]]\n\nwere considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee, reported unanimously \nby the Senate Judiciary Committee to the Executive Calendar, and I \nliterally begged the Republican side of the aisle and leadership to \nallow these two to come up for a voice vote since there was no \ncontroversy attached with them and a judicial emergency existed in that \ncentral Illinois district. They refused. They refused, despite repeated \nefforts.\n  I then went to the other side and said: All right, you must have \nRepublican Senators facing the same thing in their States. I found \nSenator Cornyn of Texas, with exactly the same circumstance. I said: \nJohn, you have a noncontroversial nominee. Let's team up together, make \nit bipartisan so there is no question that we are trying to do anything \nfor a partisan advantage. He said: I am with you. It was not enough. \nThe Republican leadership still objected to filling these vacancies \nwhen a judicial emergency existed, though I asked for it repeatedly. \nThat to me is an abuse of the process. If either of those nominees had \nbeen controversial, if this was a situation where it was a new, extra \njudge, some question of whether it was needed, that is another story \ncompletely. But we need a nomination process where those who are not \ncontroversial are brought up and considered in a timely fashion.\n  I commend my colleagues because I think each and every one of them \nhas added to this conversation--Senators Wyden, Grassley, and \nMcCaskill, on a bipartisan basis, to do away with Senate holds. Senator \nUdall of New Mexico, Senator Harkin of Iowa, and Senator Merkley of \nOregon, who is now presiding, I think have had an excellent proposal \nhere of five different changes that would make this a more effective \nSenate. Senator Lautenberg, who spoke just moments ago, had his own \nproposal. Senator Udall of Colorado and Senator Harkin each have a \nproposal.\n  It is time for us to sit down on a bipartisan basis to protect the \nrights of the minority within the Senate, but to bring the Senate \nprocedure into a more efficient and more effective way, not just so C-\nSPAN viewers are not shortchanged when they sign up for C-SPAN Senate \nand all they get is an occasional ``Akaka'' or some other name being \nlisted in the quorum call, but actually hear the Senate working for its \nmoney.\n  We can do better. I know what is going to happen now. We are likely \nto recess for some period of time, and an opportunity presents itself \nfor the leaders on both sides to come together. There is room for us to \nreach agreement. We can say to the minority: You are going to get your \nchance for amendments. You always want that. You are going to get it. \nAnd we can say to our side: You are going to face some votes on \namendments, like it or not. That is part of why we are here. We can \nhave some real debate. We can have an investment in the cloture process \nthat means it is real and personal, and that those who believe in it \nare taking the time to make sure the Senate continues to function as a \nresponsible part of our government.\n  Mr. President, at this point I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, let me first say to our \nmajority whip, Mr. Durbin of Illinois, that I very much appreciate his \nlong-term effort in looking at rules. I know he signed on to several \nproposals today. I know he is on the one Senator Merkley and I are on, \nand he is also on the Harkin proposal.\n  The Senator was here back in those days, and he has seen how much the \nSenate has changed. So we really appreciate the Senator's contribution \nto this effort and the remarkable job he has done trying to lead us in \nthese difficult times we are in. It must be tough for somebody like \nhim, who came to a Senate and saw it change over time, and change in \nthe wrong way and get hyperpartisan. I want to say that to the Senator.\n  I also want to say several of our speakers mentioned things, and I \nthink it is very appropriate to put them in the Record because I think \nwhen people read the Congressional Record, and things are mentioned, it \nis important they be able to find them quickly.\n  So the first one is from George Packer, who is a writer with the New \nYorker magazine. He wrote a piece called ``The Empty Chamber'' dated \nAugust 9, 2010. I commend to my colleagues that article. It was \nmentioned in the course of the debate and it is an excellent article. \nHe is a very good writer.\n  Secondly, one of the big scholars on Congress--there are a couple of \npeople out there who study Congress over and over and write books and \narticles and monitor what we are doing, and one of them is a gentleman \nby the name of Norm Ornstein. Norm wrote--this was also mentioned in \nthe course of the debate by one of the Senators--and Norm wrote a piece \nin the New York Times called ``A Filibuster Fix.'' That was on August \n27, 2010. I ask unanimous consent that article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Aug. 27, 2010]\n\n                            A Filibuster Fix\n\n                          (By Norman Ornstein)\n\n       Washington.--After months of debate, Senate Democrats this \n     summer broke a Republican filibuster against a bill to extend \n     unemployment benefits. But the Republicans insisted on \n     applying a technicality in the Senate rules that allowed for \n     30 more hours of floor time after a successful vote to end \n     debate. As a result, the bill--with its desperately needed \n     and overdue benefits for more than 2 million unemployed \n     Americans--was pointlessly delayed a few days more.\n       The Senate, once the place for slow and careful \n     deliberation, has been overtaken by a culture of \n     obstructionism. The filibuster, once rare, is now so common \n     that it has inverted majority rule, allowing the minority \n     party to block, or at least delay, whatever legislation it \n     wants to oppose. Without reform, the filibuster threatens to \n     bring the Senate to a halt.\n       It is easy to forget that the widespread use of the \n     filibuster is a recent development. From the 1920s to the \n     1950s, the average was about one vote to end debate, also \n     known as a cloture motion, a year; even in the 1960s, at the \n     height of the civil rights debates, there were only about \n     three a year.\n       The number of cloture motions jumped to three a month \n     during the partisan battles of the 1990s. But it is the last \n     decade that has seen the filibuster become a regular part of \n     Senate life: there was about one cloture motion a week \n     between 2000 and 2008, and in the current Congress there have \n     been 117--more than two a week.\n       Even though there might be several motions for cloture for \n     each filibuster, there clearly has been a remarkable increase \n     in the use of what is meant to be the Congressional \n     equivalent of a nuclear weapon.\n       Filibusters aren't just more numerous; they're more \n     mundane, too. Consider an earlier bill to extend unemployment \n     benefits, passed in late 2009. It faced two filibusters--\n     despite bipartisan backing and its eventual passage by a 98-0 \n     margin. A bill that should have zipped through in a few days \n     took four weeks, including seven days of floor debate. Or \n     take the nomination of Judge Barbara Milano Keenan to the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit: she, \n     too, faced a filibuster, even though she was later confirmed \n     99 to 0.\n       Part of the problem lies with today's partisan culture, in \n     which blocking the other party takes priority over passing \n     legislation or confirming candidates to key positions. And \n     part of the problem lies with changes in Senate practices \n     during the 1970s, which allowed the minority to filibuster a \n     piece of legislation without holding up other items of \n     business.\n       But the biggest factor is the nature of the filibuster \n     itself. Senate rules put the onus on the majority for ending \n     a debate, regardless of how frivolous the filibuster might \n     be.\n       If the majority leader wants to end a debate, he or she \n     firsi calls for unanimous consent for cloture, basically a \n     voice vote from all the senators present in the chamber. But \n     if even one member of the filibustering minority is present \n     to object to the motion, the majority leader has to hold a \n     roll call vote. If the majority leader can't round up the \n     necessary 60 votes, the debate continues.\n       Getting at least 60 senators on the floor several times a \n     week is no mean feat given travel schedules, illnesses and \n     campaign obligations. The most recent debate over extending \n     unemployment benefits, for example, took so long in part \n     because the death of Senator Robert Byrd, a Democrat from \n     West Virginia, left the majority with only 59 votes for \n     cloture. The filibuster was brought to an end only after West \n     Virginia's governor appointed a replacement.\n       True, the filibuster has its benefits: it gives the \n     minority party the power to block hasty legislation and force \n     a debate on what it considers matters of national \n     significance. So how can the Senate reform the filibuster to \n     preserve its usefulness but prevent its abuse?\n       For starters, the Senate could replace the majority's \n     responsibility to end debate with the minority's \n     responsibility to keep it going. It would work like this: for \n     the first four weeks of debate, the Senate would operate \n     under the old rules, in which the majority has to find enough \n     senators to vote for\n\n[[Page S54]]\n\n     cloture. Once that time has elapsed, the debate would \n     automatically end unless the minority could assemble 40 \n     senators to continue it.\n       An even better step would be to return to the old ``Mr. \n     Smith Goes to Washington'' model--in which a filibuster means \n     that the Senate has to stop everything and debate around the \n     clock--by allowing a motion requiring 40 votes to continue \n     debate every three hours while the chamber is in continuous \n     session. That way it is the minority that has to grab cots \n     and mattresses and be prepared to take to the floor night and \n     day to keep their filibuster alive.\n       Under such a rule, a sufficiently passionate minority could \n     still preserve the Senate's traditions and force an extended \n     debate on legislation. But frivolous and obstructionist \n     misuse of the filibuster would be a thing of the past.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Let me finally say to the Senator from \nOregon, the Presiding Officer, that I very much appreciate his support \nboth in working with me on the constitutional option and sorting out \nthe details and making sure we have things right and also for his \nincredible work in terms of pulling together the talking filibuster \npart of this. I was here today when he showed his charts, and he took \nour five ideas and, in the most simple form so the American people \ncould understand it, capsulized those in those five charts.\n  I have been telling my staff--and you need to do this by the end of \nthe debate--we need to find a way to shrink those and put those in the \nRecord also because here we are sitting on the floor and we have these \ncharts and we need to somehow have those be a representation also.\n  So with that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/05/senate-section/article/S54-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S54]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              RULES REFORM\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise today in support of reasonable \nefforts to reform the Senate Rules. The American people expect us to \nwork together to find solutions to the problems of the day. Yet anyone \nwatching this body can plainly see that a few Senate rules no longer \nwork.\n  I believe we should all be cautious and fair about respecting Senate \ntradition. But blindly adhering to tradition when the American people \nneed us to take a fresh look helps no one. The rules have been changed \nbefore, when they needed to be.\n  Anyone watching this place over the last 2 years will tell you that a \nfew of the rules no longer serve us. They need to be reformed.\n  We have seen consensus bills, supported by 80 or 90 Senators, get \nheld up for many months because of a single Senator's secret \nobjections.\n  And we have moved well beyond the intended use of the filibuster for \nexceptional circumstances and to provide for extended debate. In fact, \nthe filibuster has been so corrosive to this body that we rarely ever \neven have debate during filibusters. The average American turns on \ntheir TV and only sees endless live quorum calls.\n  The American people are counting on us to get past the tired partisan \nbickering. This is not about Democrats and Republicans. It has to be \nabout the American people, what is in their interests. Whether one \nSenator secretly holding up a nominee's career for a year is in their \ninterests. Whether promoting filibusters that stifle, rather than \npromote debate, is in their interests. Whether we have to waste \nvaluable Senate calendar days watching time run in silence, on bills \neveryone knows are going to pass, because the rules require it, is in \nthe American people's interests.\n  In my short time in the Senate, I have offered a number of reforms \nwhich would improve the ability of this body to function and help fix \nour broken politics.\n  I introduced a rules reform proposal and have testified before our \nRules Committee to explain it to colleagues on the Committee. My \nproposal would eliminate the filibuster on motions to proceed, that are \nused to stifle, rather than promote debate. I am all for extended \ndebate, yet filibustering motions to even proceed to measures has the \nresult of actually preventing the Senate from even addressing the \nimportant issues of the day.\n  My resolution would also eliminate secret holds and place a time \nlimit on all holds by individual Senators.\n  And it would require filibustering Senators to actually show up and \nvote in order to continue to block legislation. As it is now, if you \nwant to obstruct Senate business, you can just go home. How does this \npromote debate? My commonsense proposal only requires you to stand up \nand be counted if you want to filibuster a bill or a nomination.\n  I don't have a monopoly on good ideas for reform. We have colleagues \nwho have been here for many years with a lot to add to this discussion. \nAnd it is also healthy that so many new Members are introducing their \nown ideas. I am hopeful that we can achieve some consensus for the good \nof the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/05/senate-section/article/S54-2", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S54-S55]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RUSSIA\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I am speaking today on a very important \ninternational foreign policy issue. That will be the subject of my \naddress today. I wanted to come down here the first day of this \nlegislative session, this 112th Congress, and talk about the \ndeteriorating situation with regard to oppression and the rule of law \nin Russia. I have come to this floor a number of times to share my \nconcern on this subject. I wish to begin this Congress by once again \nexpressing my deep concern for what we see happening just in the recent \ndays in Russia.\n\n  I remember looking back in 1990 and 1991 at the hope we had, the \noptimism we in the West had as we watched the Iron Curtain fall, as we \nwatched the wall tumble in Berlin, and we watched with hope that this \nwould be a new day for people behind the Iron Curtain and a new \nopportunity for freedom and openness in that society. Unfortunately, \nyear after year, month after month, we have seen since the fall of the \nSoviet Union a very regrettable and disturbing deterioration in the \nrule of law in Russia and a move back to the authoritarian rule of old \nwe all remember so well. Recent events in Russia once again cause us to \nbelieve this problem is escalating and have caused me to come to the \nfloor today on this subject.\n  Last month, the leadership of this Senate pushed through, I think in \nhaste, the New START treaty with Russia. I had concerns over the \ntreaty, and I ultimately voted against it. We had a lot more debate \nthat needed to take place. We had dozens of amendments that went \nundebated and unconsidered and not voted upon by this body, and I \nregret that. I always thought nuclear arms policy and treaties with \nregard to our nuclear stockpile should be based on the security of the \nAmerican people and that the primary issue should be what is in the \nbest interests of the United States. What we saw a lot of in the debate \nlast month was instead an emphasis on New START as the centerpiece of \nthis administration's effort to reset relations with Russia. I \ncertainly support the resetting of our relations with Russia, but I do \nnot believe the New START treaty was the best way to advance this.\n  But it should concern all of us, it should concern everyone within \nthe sound of my voice, regardless of how we voted on New START that \nwithin 2 weeks' time of this body approving the New START treaty, a \nRussian court issued a second spurious guilty verdict against Mikhail \nKhodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev. Almost simultaneously, authorities in \nRussia arrested prominent Russian opposition figure, former Deputy \nPrime Minister Boris Nemtsov. These events took place within days of \neach other.\n  What do these recent events mean? To me, they are two other examples \nof the way the current Russian leadership does not respect universal \nvalues such as the rule of law or freedom of expression and assembly. \nThe Russian Government does not share our commitment to international \nnorms or fostering modernization. Resetting U.S.-Russian relations will \nbe exceedingly difficult while these differences persist.\n  During the last Congress, I spoke several times on the trial of \nMikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev. I concluded my most recent \nremarks by saying that I hoped Russia would choose the right path and \nsomehow justice would prevail in that case. Sadly, it did not. A \nRussian court issued another politically motivated guilty verdict \nagainst these two Russian dissidents. This disturbing verdict reveals \nthat the Russian judiciary lacks independence and that Russian \nauthorities\n\n[[Page S55]]\n\ncan act above the law at will. This latest verdict was not only sad for \nMikhail Khodorkovsky, Platon Lebedev, and their families, but also for \nall people, for all of us who seek a more open Russia based on the rule \nof law.\n  Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's comments on the case before the \nverdict was even issued were very troubling indeed. According to the \nAssociated Press, Russia's Prime Minister said that the crimes of the \nformer oil tycoon have been proven--he said this before the verdict was \neven issued--and that a ``thief should sit in jail.'' Mr. Putin said \nKhodorkovsky's present punishment is more liberal than the 150-year \nprison sentence handed down in the United States to financier Bernard \nMadoff.\n  Citing the years of advocacy and statements from global leaders, the \nvery respected publication The Economist explained that Putin's \ncomments were ``a humiliating slap in the face of all those foreign \ndignitaries . . . who had lobbied Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's president, \nto stop persecuting Mr. Khodorkovsky.'' I agree with the comments \ncontained in the publication The Economist.\n  In a democracy, courts are independent and the executive branch acts \nas a separate branch of government with no say in final court \ndecisions. Prime Minister Putin's statement demonstrates that this \nseparation does not exist in Russia.\n  As if the Khodorkovsky verdict did not make it clear enough that \nopposition will not be tolerated in Russia, Russian authorities \narrested opposition leader and former Deputy Prime Minister Boris \nNemtsov on New Year's Eve. This took place during a reportedly peaceful \nantigovernment rally in Moscow. Approximately 70 others were also \narrested. A Moscow court sentenced former Deputy Prime Minister Nemtsov \nto 50 days in jail for allegedly disobeying police. This arrest was a \ntremendous disappointment, but it certainly was not a surprise. The \nRussian Government had recently begun granting permission for \nsemiregular protests. I use the term ``semiregular'' because it was \ngranted only for the last day of months with 31 days.\n  I met with Mr. Nemtsov last March when he was here in Washington. He \ncame to my office, and we had a very enlightening discussion about the \nfuture of Russia. I admired his dedication and commitment to promoting \ndemocracy in Russia, and I hope and pray for his safety during the \nremaining days in a Moscow jail cell.\n  Sadly, we have learned that not all those who opposed the Russian \nGovernment do, in fact, return from Russian jails. Sergei Magnitsky, \nwho was a young Russian anticorruption lawyer employed by an American \nlaw firm in Moscow who blew the whistle on the largest tax rebate fraud \nin Russian history perpetrated by high-level Russian officials, is an \nexample. Magnitsky was arrested shortly after he testified to \nauthorities. He was held in detention for nearly a year without trial, \nunder torturous conditions, and he died in an isolation cell on \nNovember 16, 2009, in Russia.\n  During the 111th Congress, I joined Senators Cardin and McCain in \ncosponsoring the Justice for Sergei Magnitsky Act, which would freeze \nassets and block visas to Russian individuals responsible for Mr. \nMagnitsky's unfortunate death. In this, the 112th Congress, I will \ncontinue to highlight the treatment of opposition figures in Russia and \nthe regrettable erosion of the rule of law.\n  I urge President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton to make the \ntreatment of opposition figures a central part of our efforts to reset \nrelations with Russia. In order to make progress on other issues, \nRussia needs to prove it is truly committed to the rule of law and the \nhuman rights of all of its citizens, including those who disagree with \nthe government. Without this, our efforts to find common ground on \nother issues of mutual concern will continue to be undermined.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/05/senate-section/article/S55-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S55]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING ELIZABETH RIDGWAY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about Elizabeth \nRidgway, an Illinoisan, educator, and hard-working employee of the \nLibrary of Congress who recently passed away. Elizabeth died on \nDecember 23, 2010, at the young age of 41.\n  In her role leading the Library's Educational Outreach Division, \nElizabeth advocated for America's teachers and worked to provide them \nwith better and expanded resources. In this capacity, she was \nresponsible for administering the Teaching with Primary Sources \nprogram. In 2005, I secured authorization language to establish \nTeaching with Primary Sources to share with students and teachers the \neducational treasures of the Library of Congress. Many Illinois \neducators and educational facilities have participated in this program \nsince its inception and, under Elizabeth's guidance, have been \ninstrumental in the expansion of the program.\n  The numerous programs she directed now reach tens of thousands of \nteachers nationwide, providing them with important classroom materials, \nworkshops, online and graduate courses, mentoring and grants. Countless \nstudents across our nation are benefitting from the Library's \ncollections as a result of Elizabeth's work.\n  Librarian of Congress James H. Billington said Elizabeth ``was a \npioneering humanistic educator of the Internet Age.'' He continued, \n``she was admired and beloved by colleagues at all levels of the \nLibrary--and by many local librarians and K-12 teachers all over \nAmerica. . . . We will deeply miss her infectious enthusiasm and \nselfless dedication.''\n  I offer my deepest condolences to Elizabeth's family, colleagues, and \nfriends. My thoughts are with all of you. Established by her family \nsince her untimely passing, the Elizabeth Ridgway Education Fund at the \nLibrary will help continue her legacy. The lives that she has touched, \nand the teachers and students who her work has empowered, will be a \nlasting tribute to her life and her love of education. She inspired \nmany with her dedication and leadership, and I have every confidence \nthat others will continue the work Elizabeth loved so much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/05/senate-section/article/S55-2", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S55-S56]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in the closing days of the 111th Congress, \na brief flurry of activity led to the confirmation of 19 long-pending \njudicial nominations. Regrettably, the stalemate that had prevented the \nSenate from confirming a single nomination between September 13 and \nDecember 16 resumed when Senate Republicans denied action on 19 other \nwell-qualified, consensus judicial nominations reported by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. Ultimately, these nominations were returned to the \nPresident, including 15 nominations that received unanimous or near \nunanimous support in the committee. I suspect that when the President \nrenominates these qualified individuals, they will be confirmed with \noverwhelming bipartisan support. The only question will be why we were \nunable to take action on them sooner.\n  In his ``Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary,'' Chief Justice \nRoberts rightly called attention to the problem facing many \noverburdened district and circuit courts across the country. The rise \nin judicial vacancies, which topped 110 in 2010, and an increasing \nnumber of judicial emergencies is of great concern to all Americans who \nseek justice from our courts.\n  Unfortunately, the unprecedented obstruction of judicial nominations \nseen in the last Congress, and the dramatic departure from the Senate's \nlong-standing tradition of regularly considering consensus, \nnoncontroversial nominations, marked a new chapter in what Chief \nJustice Roberts calls the ``persistent problem'' of filling judicial \nvacancies. A New York Times editorial from January 4, 2011, refers to \nSenate Republicans' ``refusal to give prompt consideration to \nnoncontroversial nominees'' a ``terrible precedent.'' I agree, and I \nwill ask that the Times' editorial be printed in the Record.\n  Nearly all of the mere 60 district and circuit court nominations the \nSenate was allowed to consider last year were confirmed with the \noverwhelming, bipartisan support of the Senate. Yet nearly a third of \nthese nominations--19--were held up for more than 100 days, only to be \nconfirmed unanimously. As the Times editorializes, ``apart from \npartisan gamesmanship, there was no reason that Republicans\n\n[[Page S56]]\n\nheld up these nominations for months only to unanimously approve nearly \nall of them in the waning days of the lame duck session.'' Among these \nnominations was that of Kimberly Mueller, nominated to fill a vacancy \nin the Eastern District of California. Chief Justice Roberts cited this \nconfirmation as one of the most sorely needed. Yet for more than 7 \nmonths, the Senate was prevented from considering the nomination to \nfill this vacancy. Judge Mueller's nomination was unanimously reported \nby the Judiciary Committee in May; her nomination was unanimously \nconfirmed on December 16. No Senator objected to her qualifications, \nher record, or her fitness to serve. This sort of delay is the real \ncrisis facing the Federal judiciary.\n  Lifetime appointments to the Federal bench should not be granted \nwithout due consideration. No Senator, Democrat or Republican, should \nsimply rubberstamp the nominations of any President. In the first \nCongress of the Bush administration, the Democratic majority worked to \nconfirm 100 judicial nominations, turning the page on the Republicans' \npocket-filibusters of the 1990s. We proceeded with regular \nconsideration of noncontroversial, consensus nominations, most of which \nreceived unanimous support in the Senate. We confirmed 20 nominations \nduring the lameduck session in 2002, including two controversial \ncircuit court nominations which were favorably reported by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee in the lameduck session. Senate Republicans' \ndecision in December to object to consideration of 19 judicial \nnominations favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee--including 15 \nnominations with overwhelming bipartisan support--has established a new \nlow with regard to judicial nominations. They set back the progress we \nhave tried to make in confirming judges.\n  I suspect that President Obama will renominate these qualified \nindividuals. I hope to work with the Judiciary Committee's new ranking \nRepublican, Senator Grassley, to promptly consider and report these \nnominations to the full Senate. I hope that Senator Grassley will work \nwith me to ensure the timely confirmation of these and other \nnoncontroversial, consensus nominations, which will help reduce \nvacancies and address the judicial crisis.\n  The American people turn to our courts for justice. Likewise, the \nSenate must return to the time-honored traditions of the Senate, and \nwork together to secure the confirmation of the President's judicial \nnominations. Judicial vacancies hinder the Federal judiciary's ability \nto fulfill its constitutional role. Working together, we can restore \nthe judicial confirmation process.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe New York Times Article to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 3, 2011]\n\n                           The Missing Judges\n\n       The annual report on the federal judiciary by the chief \n     justice of the United States is not a place you would \n     normally go for political agitation. But that is just what \n     Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. offered by using a portion of \n     his year-end review to deplore the ``acute difficulties'' \n     created for the justice system by the Senate's slowness in \n     approving President Obama's nominees for federal judgeships.\n       Justice Roberts is right to be concerned that mounting \n     federal court vacancies are creating crushing caseloads in \n     some jurisdictions and hampering courts' ability to fulfill \n     their vital role. Given his office, we understand why he did \n     not point a partisan finger in his report. But he diluted his \n     message a bit by suggesting that blame for this undermining \n     of the judicial branch rests evenly with both parties. The \n     main culprit is an unprecedented level of Republican \n     obstructionism.\n       Democrats sought to block a handful of President George W. \n     Bush's controversial nominees for circuit court seats, but \n     were open about stating their objections, and promptly \n     allowed up or down votes on other nominees once approved by \n     the Judiciary Committee.\n       In the last Congress, Republicans typically refused to \n     publicly explain their opposition to individual nominees and \n     their prolonged blockade of candidates who had cleared the \n     committee either unanimously or with just a couple of \n     negative votes. Between Congress's return from its August \n     recess and the start of the lame duck session, Senate \n     Republicans consented to vote on just a single judicial \n     nomination.\n       Before adjourning, Senate Republicans allowed action on 19 \n     well-qualified nominees--some of whom had been left in limbo \n     for nearly a year after clearing the Judiciary Committee. \n     That was welcome progress. But apart from partisan \n     gamesmanship, there was no reason that Republicans held up \n     these nominations for months only to unanimously approve \n     nearly all of them in the waning days of the lame duck \n     session.\n       Partisan obstruction was also the only plausible reason \n     that Republicans declined to allow confirmation of 15 other \n     nominees who were considered noncontroversial and were \n     cleared by the committee after the November election. Those \n     nominations have been returned to the president, ensuring \n     further delays in filling seats when those individuals are \n     renominated and a newly reconstituted Judiciary Committee \n     must hold new hearings.\n       Four other nominees approved by the committee by a party-\n     line vote were also denied Senate consideration. That list \n     includes Goodwin Liu, a well-qualified law professor and \n     legal scholar whose main problem for Republicans, it seems, \n     is his potential to fill a future Supreme Court vacancy.\n       The dismal net result, laments Senator Patrick Leahy, the \n     Judiciary Committee chairman, is that the Senate confirmed \n     just 60 district and circuit court judges--the smallest \n     number of judges for the first two years of a presidency in \n     more than three decades.\n       The Republicans' refusal to give prompt consideration to \n     noncontroversial nominees sets a terrible precedent. It gives \n     Democrats something to consider as they weigh possible rules \n     changes in the Senate to curb the auto-pilot filibusters and \n     secret holds that mindlessly delay essential business, like \n     the confirmation of federal judicial nominees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/05/senate-section/article/S56-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S56-S59]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as we begin the 112th Congress I want to \ndiscuss one of my continuing concerns with the Medicare Program. For \nthe last 10 years, I have served most recently as ranking member and \npreviously as the chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, which \nhas jurisdiction over Medicare. During this time I have led efforts to \nreform the Medicare payment system and realign incentives in Medicare \nto promote higher quality and more efficient care. Today, I would like \nto address one of the flaws in the Medicare payment system: the \ninaccuracy of the Medicare geographic adjustment factors used for \nphysician practice expense and the adverse impact they have on rural \nMedicare beneficiaries' access to care. This flaw has for many years \nresulted in unfairly low payments to high quality areas like my own \nhome State of Iowa and many other rural States.\n  Medicare payment varies from one area to another based on the \ngeographic adjustments known as the geographic practice cost indices or \nGPCIs. These geographic adjustments are intended to equalize physician \npayment by reflecting differences in physician's practice costs. But \nthey do not accurately represent those costs in Iowa or other rural \nStates. They have failed to do the job. They penalize rather than \nequalize Medicare reimbursement in rural States and discourage \nphysicians from practicing in areas like New Mexico, Arkansas, \nMissouri, and Iowa because of their unfairly low Medicare rates. Iowa \nis widely recognized as providing some of the highest quality care in \nthe country yet Iowa physicians receive some of the lowest Medicare \nreimbursement in the country due to these inequitable geographic \ndisparities.\n  I introduced legislation to correct these unwarranted geographic \npayment disparities in the 110th Congress, the Medicare Physician \nPayment Equity Act of 2008. In the 111th Congress, I introduced the \nMedicare Rural Health Access Improvement Act of 2009. And when the \nSenate Finance Committee conducted its markup of health reform \nlegislation in the fall of 2009, I offered an amendment to reform the \npractice expense geographic adjustment, PE GPCI, that has caused unduly \nlow payments in rural areas due to the inaccurate data and methodology \nthat is used. My amendment provided more equity and accuracy in \ncalculating this adjustment, and it provided a national solution to the \nproblem. It was accepted unanimously by the Senate Finance Committee, \nand it was included in the Senate health reform bill, the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act, PPACA, that was enacted last year.\n  The goal of my amendment was to assure that the statutory mandate of \nthe Social Security Act is met and that the most recent and relevant \ndata is used for these geographic adjusters. The language of section \n3102(b) is very\n\n[[Page S57]]\n\nspecific. It requires a transitional 2-year period of limited relief to \nreduce the impact of the current, inequitable practice expense formula \nin rural areas while a broader analysis of the methodology and \nevaluation of the data is conducted by the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, HHS. The Secretary is mandated to limit the impact of \nthe existing adjustments by reflecting only one-half of the geographic \ndifferences in employee wages and rents in the PE GPCI adjustment for \n2010 and 2011 and to hold harmless those localities that would \notherwise see a reduction as a result of this adjustment. Most \nimportantly, the provision requires that a longer term solution be \nimplemented in 2012, at which time the Secretary must make appropriate \nadjustments to the formula to ensure accurate geographic practice \nexpense adjustments.\n  This 2-year transition in 2010 and 2011 was provided to allow time \nfor a focused, in-depth study by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, CMS, on the data and methodology used to support a revised PE \nGPCI formula that would be implemented by January 1, 2012. However, to \ndate CMS has failed to make any significant changes in the sources of \nthe data or the methodology used in calculation of the practice expense \nadjustment. Although CMS has acknowledged its obligations for an \nadditional study as called for by section 3102(b), they continue to \nclaim that their ``analysis of the current methods of establishing PE \nGPCIs and [their] evaluation of data that fairly and reliably establish \ndistinctions in the cost of operating a medical practice in the \ndifferent fee schedule areas meet the statutory requirements'' of \nsection 3102(b), Federal Register, November 29, 2010, Page 73254. I \nstrongly disagree.\n  When the current Medicare payment system was established, Congress \ndecided that geographic adjustments would be appropriate to equalize \nphysician payment by reflecting differences in physicians' practice \ncosts, and it established the geographic practice cost indices, GPCIs, \nfor physician work, practice expenses, and malpractice premiums. \nCongress also mandated that HHS use the most recent data available \nrelating to practice expenses in calculating the geographic adjustments \nfor physician practice costs.\n  However, CMS has long relied upon proxy data sources that bear little \nto no relevance to actual practice costs, such as using Housing and \nUrban Development, HUD, apartment rental data to calculate physician \noffice rent. This doesn't have any connection with the cost of office \nspace, let alone a physician's office. Also, the current formula only \ncounts employee wages in four occupations: nurses, clerical personnel \nand medical technicians but it should reflect employee wages more \naccurately by also taking into account physician assistants, office \nadministrators, and other more highly compensated specialists commonly \nemployed in practices today. The third category, of ``other'' expense, \nis considered to be a national market and not adjusted. It should \ninclude expenses like office furniture and information technology that \ncost the same, no matter where you live, but it doesn't. And the \nweights used by CMS in their methodology are outdated and fail to \nrepresent physician practice expenses accurately.\n  Unfortunately, the more accurate calculation of practice expense \ncosts that was intended to be achieved by my amendment also has been \njeopardized by a special interest provision that was added to PPACA \nbehind the closed doors of the majority leader during the Senate floor \nconsideration of health reform. It addresses geographic disparities in \nMedicare payment but it helps just 5 States at the expense of the other \n45 States. It is what I call the ``Frontier Freeloader'' provision. It \nimproves Medicare reimbursement in these frontier States by \nestablishing floors for the hospital wage index and the physician \npractice expense GPCI. A frontier State is defined as one with 50 \npercent or more frontier counties, defined as counties with a \npopulation per square mile of less than six.\n  This special deal will ensure that higher payments go to just five \nrural States in 2011--North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming and \nNevada--at the expense of every other State. But the Frontier \nFreeloader is even more egregious because Iowa and other States like \nArkansas and New Mexico that don't benefit from this provision are \npaying for it! So, taxpayers in your State and mine all the other 45 \nStates--will kick in to pay for this unfair $2 billion Frontier \nFreeloader carve-out for five States that ends up harming all the other \nrural States. And that is just the cost for the next few years. The \nfrontier States deal does not sunset, and it is not time-limited. It \nwill continue to benefit so-called ``frontier States'' forever while \ntaxpayers in your State and mine continue to pay the bills. It's \nanother example of how the lack of transparency and the deals made \nbehind closed doors to garner votes last year led to bad policies. And \nit became law when the President signed the health care reform bill.\n  I introduced legislation to eliminate the inequitable frontier \nfreeloader provision in the last Congress and to improve Medicare \nbeneficiaries' access to care in all rural States. The Medicare Rural \nHealth Care Equity Act of 2010 would have eliminated this special \nMedicare reimbursement rate for frontier States and provided additional \nfunds from its repeal to improve reimbursement in all rural States. \nIowa provides some of the highest quality care in the country but it \ndoes not meet the definition of a frontier State. Certainly Iowa should \nhave been helped since Medicare reimbursement for hospitals and \nphysicians is lower in Iowa than in most of these so-called \n``frontier'' States. Medicare also pays much lower rates in other rural \nStates, like Arkansas and New Mexico, but they don't benefit from the \nFrontier Freeloader because they don't meet the definition of a \nfrontier State. We should improve physician payments for all rural \nStates, not just a select few. And it's unfair to improve hospital \npayments for just a few States. My legislation would have eliminated \nthose special payments for just five States, and I will be \nreintroducing that legislation again soon.\n  The Institute of Medicine, IOM, has been asked by HHS to evaluate the \naccuracy of the existing geographic adjustment factors and whether the \ncurrent measures and data are representative of the costs. I have \nprepared a statement for consideration by the IOM committee charged \nwith this review, the Committee on Geographic Adjustment Factors in the \nMedicare Program. I urge the IOM to address the inaccuracy of the \ncurrent geographic adjusters used for physician practice expense, the \nmethodology and data used in their calculation, and the adverse effect \nof the existing practice expense geographic adjustment factor on rural \naccess to care. I also urge IOM to review the frontier States provision \nand provide HHS and Congress with recommendations on specific factors \nthat could be used to determine physician practice costs in those \nStates in lieu of the inequitable frontier States floor.\n  It is my hope that the IOM will carefully consider these comments as \nit proceeds with its review and develops recommendations and a report \nto be submitted to HHS and the Congress later this year. I ask \nunanimous consent that my statement to the IOM be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Statement of Senator Chuck Grassley\n\n (Institute of Medicine, Committee on Geographic Adjustment Factors in \n                   the Medicare Program, Jan 5, 2011)\n\n       As the senior senator from Iowa and the Ranking Member of \n     the United States Senate Committee on Finance in recent \n     years, I appreciate the opportunity to provide this statement \n     to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) on a study that the IOM \n     has undertaken at the request of the Secretary of the \n     Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regarding the \n     accuracy of the geographic adjustment factors used for \n     Medicare payment.\n       For the last ten years, I served either as Ranking Member \n     or as the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, which \n     has jurisdiction over Medicare. During this time, I led \n     congressional efforts to establish more accurate geographic \n     adjusters for Medicare physician payment and to realign \n     incentives in Medicare to promote higher quality and more \n     efficient care. This IOM committee has been asked to evaluate \n     the accuracy of the geographic adjustment factors and to \n     provide their recommendations as to whether the current \n     measures and data are representative of the costs. I would \n     like to address the inaccuracy of the current Medicare \n     geographic adjustment factors used for physician practice \n     expense, the methodology and\n\n[[Page S58]]\n\n     data used in their calculation, and the adverse effect of the \n     existing practice expense geographic adjustment factors on \n     rural access to care. I offer these comments for \n     consideration by the committee as it proceeds with its review \n     and develops its recommendations and report to HHS and \n     Congress later this year.\n\n\n            Medicare's Flawed Geographic Adjustment Factors\n\n       Medicare's payment system for physicians is flawed in many \n     ways. One of those flaws is the unjustified geographic \n     disparities in payment that has for many years given unfairly \n     low payments to high quality areas like my home state of Iowa \n     and other rural states. Geographic equity in Medicare payment \n     has been a longstanding issue of major concern to me. The new \n     health care reform law, the Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act (PPACA), includes a provision I authored that makes \n     some much needed changes in the calculation of the geographic \n     adjustment factors that is intended to provide more equitable \n     payments to physicians in rural areas and to improve access \n     to health care for Medicare beneficiaries in rural states.\n       Medicare payment differences from one area to another based \n     on the geographic adjustments known as the Geographic \n     Practice Cost Indices (GPCIs) are intended to equalize \n     physician payment by reflecting differences in physician's \n     practice costs but they do not accurately represent those \n     costs in Iowa or other rural states. They have been a dismal \n     failure, in fact. They discourage physicians from practicing \n     in rural areas because they create unfairly low Medicare \n     reimbursement rates.\n       I introduced legislation to correct these unwarranted \n     geographic payment disparities in the 110th Congress, the \n     Medicare Physician Payment Equity Act of 2008, as well as the \n     Medicare Rural Health Access Improvement Act of 2009 in the \n     111th Congress. In the fall of 2009, I also offered an \n     amendment in the Senate Finance Committee markup of health \n     reform legislation to reform the practice expense geographic \n     adjustment that has caused unduly low payments to physicians \n     in rural areas due to the inaccurate data and methodology \n     that is used.\n       My amendment was intended to provide more equity and \n     accuracy in calculating this adjustment as well as to provide \n     a national solution to the problems that have arisen from the \n     current unwarranted disparities in Medicare payment due to \n     these geographic adjustments. The amendment was accepted \n     unanimously by the Senate Finance Committee during markup of \n     Senate health reform legislation in September 2009. Section \n     3102(b) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \n     (PPACA) that passed the Senate and became law is based on \n     this amendment. It requires HHS to improve the accuracy of \n     the Practice Expense Geographic Practice Cost Index (PE GPCI) \n     data and methodology and to examine the feasibility of using \n     actual data or reliable survey data on office rents and non-\n     physician staff wages. These two PE GPCI inputs, which are \n     the only inputs adjusted to reflect local costs, currently do \n     not measure physician costs. Instead, they rely upon proxies. \n     The current input adjustments are not credible because of \n     their reliance on proxy data sources rather than actual \n     physician practice costs. As a result, some physicians are \n     paid more and others are paid significantly less for the very \n     same service with the same time, effort, and expertise needed \n     to furnish that service to a Medicare beneficiary.\n       I urge the committee to note the wide differences in \n     physician payment under the GPCIs as currently constructed. \n     At the beginning of calendar year 2010, before the \n     transitional adjustments required by PPACA, a 38.894% \n     difference in Medicare physician payment on average existed \n     between the highest paid and the lowest-paid Medicare Part B \n     payment locality (Alaska and Puerto Rico) for the same \n     Medicare service. The PE GPCI disparity for this same period \n     was even greater, ranging from 1.441 (San Francisco) for the \n     highest to 0.694 for the lowest (Puerto Rico) and 0.821 for \n     the second lowest (the rest of Missouri), with 1.0 being the \n     average. The PE GPCI for Iowa was 0.870. This means that \n     physicians in San Francisco received a PE GPCI adjustment \n     that was 144 percent of the average, while Iowa physicians \n     received an adjustment of just 87 percent.\n       Survey findings of the American Medical Association (AMA) \n     and others challenge this significant range in payment \n     disparity by showing little measurable distinction in \n     physician practice expenses throughout the country. The AMA \n     PPIS is based on actual physician data, rather than the proxy \n     data upon which CMS relies. Geographic distinctions in \n     physician practice expense payment in rural areas should be \n     supported by accurate and reliable data and calculations. I \n     urge the committee to address this discrepancy between \n     credible surveys, based on real physician cost data, and the \n     PE GPCI range established by CMS.\n       Section 3102(b) requires a transitional two-year period of \n     limited relief to reduce the impact of the current, \n     inequitable practice expense formula in rural areas while a \n     broader analysis of the methodology and evaluation of the \n     data is conducted by HHS. The Secretary is mandated to limit \n     the impact of the existing adjustments by reflecting only one \n     half of the geographic differences in employee wages and \n     rents in the PE GPCI adjustment for 2010 and 2011 and to hold \n     harmless those localities that would otherwise see a \n     reduction as a result of this adjustment. The provision \n     requires that a longer-term solution be implemented in 2012, \n     at which time the Secretary must make appropriate adjustments \n     to the formula to ensure accurate geographic practice expense \n     adjustments. These statutory adjustments were intended to \n     moderate the negative effects of the existing inaccurate GPCI \n     disparities on low-paid Medicare regions while allowing time \n     for a focused, in-depth study by the Centers for Medicare and \n     Medicaid Services (CMS) on the inputs, weights, and data used \n     in the PE GPCI to support a revised formula that would be \n     implemented as of January 1, 2012.\n       Congress agreed at the inception of the current Medicare \n     payment system that, to the extent physicians practicing in \n     the various Medicare payment localities face higher or lower \n     practice expense burdens, reasonable distinctions in Medicare \n     payment would be appropriate, and it established the \n     Geographic Practice Cost Indices (GPCIs) for physician work, \n     practice expenses, and malpractice premiums to do so. To \n     support the PE GPCI, Congress directed the Department of \n     Health and Human Services to ``use the most recent data \n     available relating to practice expenses . . . in different \n     fee schedule areas.'' (Social Security Act, Section \n     1848(e)(1)(D)). The statutory requirement makes it clear that \n     there must be a nexus between data sources and actual \n     physician practice expenses as represented by the inputs of \n     the PE GPCI.\n       However, CMS has long relied upon proxy data sources that \n     bear little to no relevance to actual practice costs. \n     Furthermore, the weights used by CMS are outdated and fail to \n     represent accurately the relativity in expenses in this \n     dynamic and ever-changing field. It is my understanding that \n     the PE GPCI, in particular, is currently supported by data \n     that is neither relevant to physician practices nor credible \n     to physicians. Physicians who serve the Medicare population \n     must bear the burden of their true practice costs while the \n     Medicare payment system upon which they rely fails to reflect \n     those same practice expense costs fairly and accurately.\n       The goal of Section 3102(b) is to assure that the statutory \n     mandate of the Social Security Act is met and that the most \n     recent and relevant data is used for these geographic \n     adjusters. The language of Section 3102(b) is very specific \n     in its directions but so far CMS has failed to make \n     significant changes in the methodology or data used in \n     calculation of the PE GPCI. The final CMS CY 2011 Medicare \n     physician payment rule sets forth the results of CMS' sixth \n     3-year GPCI review. Although CMS acknowledged its obligations \n     for an additional PE GPCI study under Section 3102(b) of \n     PPACA, they stated that their ``analysis of the current \n     methods of establishing PE GPCIs and [their] evaluation of \n     data that fairly and reliably establish distinctions in the \n     cost of operating a medical practice in the different fee \n     schedule areas meet the statutory requirements'' of Section \n     3102(b) (Federal Register, November 29, 2010, Page 73254).\n       The most recent CMS review and analysis does not provide a \n     new analysis and evaluation of data but merely treads old \n     ground, looking at the PE GPCI underlying data and its \n     weights along the lines of what other studies have already \n     examined. For example, CMS continues to rely, with little \n     justification, on Housing and Urban Development (HUD) section \n     8 apartment rent data as a proxy for physician rent even \n     though Section 3102(b) directs CMS to evaluate ``the \n     feasibility of using actual data or reliable survey data \n     developed by medical organizations on the costs of operating \n     a medical practice, including office rents and non-physician \n     staff wages in different fee schedule areas.'' If no suitable \n     nationwide data on rental rates for physician office space \n     currently exist, the IOM should recommend other approaches \n     for CMS to use in studying this issue to come up with more \n     reliable data than HUD apartment rents.\n       CMS acknowledged in the final physician payment rule for CY \n     2011 that there is much ongoing analysis of the PE GPCI data \n     that could form the basis of future GPCI changes. They stated \n     that they would ``review the complete findings and \n     recommendations from the Institute of Medicine's study of \n     geographic adjustment factors for physician payment'' along \n     with other HHS activities and continue to study the issues as \n     required by Section 3102(b) (Federal Register, November 29, \n     2010, Page 73256). CMS will consider the GPCIs for CY 2012 \n     again in the context of their annual physician fee schedule \n     rulemaking beginning in CY 2011 based on information that is \n     available then.\n       A significantly more comprehensive analysis and detailed \n     evaluation should be conducted for the PE GPCI study mandated \n     by Section 3102(b) than what has been detailed by CMS in its \n     final CY 2011 Medicare physician payment rule. New studies, \n     data, and other approaches must exist or be developed to \n     facilitate reliability and accuracy in identifying actual \n     physician practice expenses and setting weights among those \n     expenses. That is why a two-year transition was provided: to \n     ensure that CMS would have sufficient time to do additional \n     studies, if needed, and come up with more meaningful data \n     than, for example, continuing to use apartment rental data \n     which bears no relation to the cost of a physician's office. \n     I urge the committee to provide CMS with specific \n     recommendations for more accurate methodology that could be \n     used to determine the PE GPCIs and obtain more reliable \n     actual or\n\n[[Page S59]]\n\n     survey data sources to be used in these calculations.\n\n\n               The Inequitable Frontier States Provision\n\n       Unfortunately, the more accurate calculation of practice \n     expense costs that was intended to be achieved by Section \n     3102(b) has been jeopardized by a special interest provision \n     that was added to PPACA behind closed doors during the Senate \n     floor consideration of health reform. The ``frontier states'' \n     provision addresses geographic disparities but helps just \n     five states at the expense of the other 45. It improves \n     Medicare reimbursement in the so-called frontier states by \n     establishing a permanent 1.0 floor for the PE GPCI as well as \n     for the hospital wage index, effective January 1, 2011. A \n     frontier state is defined as one with 50 percent or more \n     frontier counties, defined as counties with a population per \n     square mile of less than six. The frontier states provision \n     ensures that higher Medicare physician payments resulting \n     from a higher PE GPCI adjustment go to just five states in \n     2011--Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, and \n     Nevada.\n       Iowa provides some of the highest quality care in the \n     country but it does not meet the definition of a frontier \n     state. Yet Medicare reimbursement for hospitals and \n     physicians is lower in Iowa than in most of these so-called \n     frontier states. Medicare also pays much lower rates in other \n     rural states that do not meet the definition of a frontier \n     state.\n       The frontier states provision is even more egregious \n     because taxpayers in all 50 states will help pay the \n     estimated $2 billion cost for a provision that benefits just \n     five states. That amount is the Congressional Budget Office \n     cost estimate of the frontier states provision for the next \n     ten years. A practice expense floor for rural states may be \n     warranted but it should not be an adjustment for just a few \n     select states. This automatic pay increase for frontier state \n     physicians could result in reduced access for Medicare \n     beneficiaries in nearby rural states that do not have the 1.0 \n     PE floor if physicians migrate to those rural areas where \n     Medicare payment has been significantly increased.\n       Last spring I introduced legislation, the Medicare Rural \n     Health Care Equity Act of 2010, to eliminate the special \n     Medicare reimbursement rates for frontier states. It is \n     imperative to reduce unwarranted geographic disparities and \n     base physician practice expense costs on actual or reliable \n     survey data, not by legislative fiat that improves physician \n     payments for just a few states. Although legislative action \n     would be required to make changes in this regard, I urge the \n     IOM to review this situation and provide recommendations to \n     HHS on whether specific factors should be considered to \n     determine physician practice costs in frontier states if such \n     a floor did not exist.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       The practice expense geographic adjustment factor has a \n     significant impact on the health care workforce in rural \n     areas, because it plays a major role in the ability to \n     recruit and retain physicians in rural areas who see more \n     patients and work longer hours for correspondingly lower pay. \n     This in turn can result in Medicare beneficiaries in rural \n     areas having reduced access to physicians and other health \n     care practitioners. Twenty percent of the population lives in \n     rural America yet only nine percent of physicians practice \n     there. Shortages of primary care and specialty physicians \n     currently exist in many rural areas yet unwarranted \n     geographic payment disparities make it difficult to improve \n     access for rural Medicare beneficiaries and other patient \n     populations.\n       The existing inaccurate geographic adjustments by CMS \n     result in unwarranted and unduly low rural reimbursement \n     rates. More current, relevant, and accurate data sources \n     exist and should be used by CMS to make geographic \n     adjustments to Medicare payments, especially in the area of \n     physician practice expense. The current geographic \n     disparities in payment are not based on actual or reliable \n     data, and they put rural Medicare beneficiaries at risk. I \n     urge the committee to recommend that CMS use actual practice \n     cost data rather than the current inaccurate proxies to \n     ensure that Medicare payment reflects true geographic \n     differences in physician practice costs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/05/senate-section/article/S59-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S59]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              START TREATY\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the Constitution of the United States is \nan amazing document. Every day I appreciate the foresight of our \nFounding Fathers who knew that future Presidents, of any political \nphilosophy, would seek to expand their power and try to impose their \nwill over the legislative branch, the branch closest to the citizens of \nthe United States.\n  For this reason they added an important clause in article 2, section \n2 that says ``He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent \nof the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators \npresent concur;''\n  Negotiators for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty on both sides \nknow the terms of our Constitution, which predates both the Russian \nFederation and the Soviet Union it replaced.\n  However, as the Senate considered the Strategic Arms Reduction \nTreaty, or the START treaty, supporters of the treaty seemed to say \nthat the Senate should abandon its role of advice and just focus on \nconsent. It was repeated many times that any change, no matter how \nminor or no matter how much it improved the treaty, would be considered \na treaty-killer as further negotiation with Russia was inexplicably \ntaken off the table as an option.\n  The reasonable amendments offered by Republican Senators were all \nrebuffed. The supporters of the treaty repeated many times how \nreasonable the amendments were but that the treaty was not the \nappropriate time to be debating such matters. Authors of amendments \ninvolving ensuring a robust missile defense, improving verification to \nprevent Russia from cheating, and merely mentioning the existence of \ntactical nuclear weapons were all told that another day is the best \ntime to discuss those matters. However, one of the greatest threats to \nUnited States national security is the acquisition of a tactical \nnuclear weapon by a terrorist organization. Since Russia has a \npreponderance of the world's tactical nuclear weapons, how can it be \nthat a treaty dealing with nuclear weapons control is not the time to \ndiscuss this issue?\n  Supporters of the START treaty say that after it is ratified the \nPresident will be able to go and negotiate further agreements with the \nRussians on matters important to the United States' interest such as \nthe tactical nuclear weapons. However, both opponents and supporters of \nthe treaty know that there is no intention of this administration to \npursue follow-on nuclear agreements with the Russian Federation. There \nare several reasons for this. We now have no leverage with the Russian \nFederation since they have already gotten a treaty favorable to their \ninterests. Further, we will be pressing the Russians on other issues \nimpacting our national security such as sanctions on Iran. Supporters \nof the treaty believe that Russia will be more amenable to our requests \nwhen history shows that Russia will act in their interest and are not \nconcerned with existential threats to our national security.\n  Finally, one of the purposes of any arms treaty is to clarify and \ninform signatories to the treaty about capabilities and intentions of \neach side. However, the new START treaty neither clarifies nor informs \nanyone about the United States' capability and intentions with regards \nto a national missile defense program. It is clear that the negotiators \nwanted to avoid this difficult topic knowing that Russia opposes the \nconcept of the United States being able to defend itself from a rogue \nmissile attack. However, by avoiding the topic completely, Russia is \nforced to consider the mixed messages of the Obama administration \nwithdrawing missile defense capability from Poland and statements by \nadministration officials and Congress calling for a robust four-phase \nmissile defense program. The treaty as written can only cause further \ninstability and confusion on the critical issue of missile defense \nbetween the United States and the Russian Federation. Clarifying \namendments from Republican Senators regarding missile defense and the \nUnited States' intention to deploy technologies against all four phases \nof ballistic missile flight would have helped the treaty, not killed \nit. Instead, the lone statement on missile defense in the preamble of \nthe treaty clearly implies that the United States should limit its \nmissile defense in an attempt to limit the need for offensive missiles. \nThe United States has no intention of doing so as it is a national \nsecurity threat for us to ignore the dangers posed by North Korea and \nIran in this area.\n  Because of these many reasons, I voted against the new Start treaty. \nWhile it did pass over my objections, I hope that future Senators will \nnot use the debate we just held in this lameduck session of Congress as \nprecedent to abdicate their constitutional role for international \nagreements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/05/senate-section/article/S59-2", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S59-S60]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING SENATOR CHARLES SUMNER\n\n Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts.

According to \nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow, Sumner delivered remarks ``like a cannoneer \nramming down cartridges.'' The target of Sumner's verbal fusillade was \nalmost always injustice, especially slavery and the men and \ninstitutions that sought to expand or perpetuate it. Yet, even among \nfellow mid-19th century abolitionists, Charles Sumner's views on racial \nequality were considered utopian. Years before the Emancipation \nProclamation, Sumner called for the abolition of slavery. Decades \nbefore the 15th amendment declared that the ``right of citizens of the \nUnited States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United \nStates or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition \nof servitude'' and nearly a century before the Voting Rights Act, \nSumner insisted that all Black men should have the rights of \ncitizenship.\n  Charles Sumner was not born into a powerful or wealthy Massachusetts \nfamily; his upbringing in Boston was at best modest. Yet his parents \ninsisted that Charles receive the best education available, and he was \nfortunate enough to attend the acclaimed Boston Latin School, where he \nexcelled and went on to receive degrees from Harvard College and \nHarvard Law School. Sumner spent his late twenties travelling through \nEurope and England, where his intellect and education impressed leading \nofficials with whom he formed lasting relationships that proved \ninvaluable to the Union years later when Sumner served on the Foreign \nRelations Committee.\n  In May of 1856, Sumner became the victim of one of the most \nunfortunate incidents in Senate history. Days after Sumner delivered a \nvitriolic speech against Kansas-Nebraska Act coauthor Andrew Pickens \nButler, the South Carolina Senator's nephew, a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, approached Sumner while he was sitting at his Senate \ndesk and beat him unconscious with a metal tipped cane. The attack left \nSumner gravely injured, and he did not return to the Senate for 3 \nyears. Sumner's ``Crime Against Kansas'' speech, and the violent \nretribution for it, further eroded the already strained relations \nbetween representatives of free and slave States. In his day, Senator \nCharles Sumner was considered an extreme, a wild-eyed dreamer whose \nvision of a society free of institutional racism seemed as unachievable \nas it was radical. Today, 200 years after his birth, we are the heirs \nof Charles Sumner's vision. Dozens of streets, schools, and towns \nacross our country bear the name of this outspoken Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Today, the issue of education reform looms large in our Nation's \nconsciousness. Too many of our public school systems are failing our \nchildren. We would be wise to look at the legacy of Senator Sumner. He \nwas one of his era's most vocal advocates for high-quality public \nschools and argued in the Massachusetts courts for the integration of \nthe Commonwealth's schools. He based his argument on the--at the time--\nnovel concept that the inferior schools to which many children were \nrelegated had lasting effects on their development. In fact, a century \nlater this very argument would underpin our Nation's most famous civil \nrights case. In 1954, a young Black girl named Linda Brown was \nprevented from enrolling in an all-White public school that was much \ncloser to her home than the all-Black school she was forced to attend. \nHer father joined a class action suit against the city's school board, \nand the resulting case would forever transform American society. The \ncity was Topeka, KS. The case was Brown v. Board of Education. \nIronically, the school where she had been denied was known as the \nSumner Elementary School. Peering down from somewhere on high, Senator \nSumner must have been pleased that injustice was not allowed to stand \nin his name.\n  At the time of his death in 1874, Sumner was still agitating for \nschool reform and Federal legislation to repeal all discriminatory laws \nagainst Blacks and the tens of thousands of Asians who had immigrated \nto America and helped build our transcontinental railroad system. The \nlate Senator Robert C. Byrd, a noted historian of the Senate, once \nwrote, ``After Clay, Calhoun and Webster, no nineteenth-century senator \nstood higher on the political horizon than did Charles Sumner, nor did \nany garner more praise, condemnation and controversy than that eloquent \nMassachusetts senator.'' Today, I am proud to celebrate the \nbicentennial of Sumner's birth and his incredible service in the U.S. \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/05/senate-section/article/S60-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S60]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DARRELL BELL\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I congratulate Darrell Bell \nfor his recent appointment as the U.S. Marshal for the District of \nMontana. I was pleased to see my colleagues unanimously support the \nnomination of such an outstanding public servant, and I am confident he \nwill serve the State of Montana admirably. As the former Deputy Chief \nof Police for the City of Billings--Montana's largest community--\nDarrell possesses the qualities necessary to successfully lead \nMontana's U.S Marshal's Office.\n  For the last three and a half decades, Darrell has served Montana's \nlaw enforcement community with passion and expertise. Since 2006, \nDarrell has served as a criminal investigator for the Montana \nDepartment of Justice, Gambling Control Division. Darrell served over \n30 years with the Billings Police Department, including 5 years as the \nDeputy Chief of Police. Originally from Joliet, Darrell graduated from \nthe Montana Law Enforcement Academy and began his career with the \nBillings Police Department as a patrolman in 1974. Working his way up \nthe ranks, Darrell has served as a sergeant and then lieutenant of the \nOperations Division as well as captain for the Investigations, \nTraining, and Support Services Division. Upon the request of the \nBillings city administrator in 2005, then-Deputy Chief of Police Bell \nstepped in to become the Interim Chief of Police. Darrell has served \nMontana and his community on the executive boards for High-Intensity \nDrug Trafficking Areas and the Montana Chiefs of Police.\n  I received an outpouring of support for Darrell when he was \nnominated. After reading just a couple of these outstanding letters, I \nknew that we had the right man for the job. Darrell's peers described \nhim as the ``consummate professional,'' a ``first-class leader,'' and \nas a person who ``is not afraid to sit down face to face and debate an \nissue to find a resolution.'' One letter stated that he ``leads by \nexample and many people find his enthusiasm and dedication both \ninspiring and motivating.'' Montana law enforcement is clearly in good \nhands.\n  Darrell has a proven track record of bringing folks together, and \nworking with local, State, and Federal law enforcement officials to \nprovide a safe environment for Montana's communities. Darrell's \nexperience and leadership in law enforcement will truly be an asset for \nMontana's U.S. Marshal's Office. I again congratulate Darrell and his \nfamily, wife Dawn, son Brent, and daughter Lindsay on his appointment, \nand I applaud his continued service to the State of Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/05/senate-section/article/S60-2", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S60-S61]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO GENERAL CARROL H. CHANDLER\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and pay \ntribute to GEN Carrol H. Chandler for over 36 years of exceptional \nservice and dedication to the U.S. Air Force. He will be retiring from \nActive Duty on March 1, 2011.\n  He currently serves as the Vice Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force, \nWashington, DC. As Vice Chief, he presides over the Air Staff and \nserves as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Requirements Oversight \nCouncil and Deputy Advisory Working Group. He assists the Chief of \nStaff with organizing, training, and equipping 680,000 Active-Duty, \nGuard, Reserve and civilian forces serving in the United States and \noverseas.\n  A command pilot with more than 3,900 flying hours in the F-15, F-16, \nand\n\n[[Page S61]]\n\nT-38, GEN ``Howie'' Chandler has commanded a major command, a numbered \nair force, two fighter wings, a support group and a fighter squadron--a \ntrue testament to his exceptional airmanship, leadership, and judgment. \nHis staff assignments include tours at Headquarters Pacific Air Forces, \nthe Pentagon, Headquarters U.S. Pacific Command, Headquarters U.S. \nMilitary Training Mission in Saudi Arabia, and Headquarters Allied Air \nForces Southern Europe.\n  General Chandler grew up in Carthage, MS. He entered the Air Force in \n1974 after graduating from the U.S. Air Force Academy. Following \ngraduation, he attended undergraduate pilot training at Laughlin AFB, \nTX. He excelled throughout his training and after earning his wings was \nselected to remain at Laughlin AFB to teach future pilots as a T-38 \ninstructor pilot and flight examiner. He continued as an instructor \npilot and assistant operations officers at Randolph Air Force Base, TX. \nThen, as a testament to Captain Chandler's achievements as a T-38 \ninstructor pilot, he was selected to fly the Air Force's premier air \nsuperiority fighter, the F-15 Eagle. Stationed at Kadena Air Base, \nJapan with the 67th Tactical Fighter Squadron, he continued to shine in \nthe air and on the ground as a squadron standardization officer, flight \ncommander, and wing flight examiner. His prowess in the air earned him \na selection to become the chief of Air-to-Air Tactics Branch at \nHeadquarters Pacific Air Forces, Hickam Air Force Base, HI. His talents \nwere quickly realized, and he was selected to become the aide-de-camp \nto the commander-in-chief of U.C. Pacific Command at Camp H.M. Smith, \nHI, and then the Air Force aide to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, the Pentagon, Washington, DC, positions for which only the elite \nare selected. Following his assignment at the Pentagon, he was once \nagain stationed at Kadena, where he flourished at every position he \nheld: assistant operations officer of the 44th Tactical Fighter \nSquadron, chief of standardization and evaluation, operations officer \nof the 67th Tactical Fighter Squadron, and commander of the 44th \nFighter Squadron. Having demonstrated his impeccable leadership, he was \nselected to be the chief of the Operations Inspection Division at \nHeadquarters Pacific Air Forces at Hickam Air Force Base, HI, and then \nhe deployed to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, as the chief of Air Force \nDivision, U.S. Central Command Forward, from 1992 to 1994.\n  In 1994, Colonel Chandler was selected for back-to-back-to-back \ncommands, commanding the 554th Support Group at Nellis Air Force Base, \nNV, the 33rd Fighter Wing at Eglin Air Force Base, FL, and the 56th \nFighter Wing at Luke Air Force Base, AZ. Now, Brigadier General \nChandler was selected to become the chief of headquarters staff \nfollowed by assistant chief of staff for operations, A-3 Division, of \nHeadquarters Allied Air Forces Southern Europe, Naples, Italy. After \nbeing promoted, Major General Chandler returned to Washington, DC to \nbecome the director for expeditionary aerospace force implementation, \nfollowed by the director of operational plans, deputy chief of staff \nfor air and space operations. Moving from the Pentagon to Langley Air \nForce Base, VA, he became the director of aerospace operations. General \nChandler continued to demonstrate excellence and was selected for \npromotion to lieutenant general and selected to command Alaskan \nCommand, Alaskan North American Aerospace Defense Command Region, 11th \nAir Force and Joint Task Force, Elmendorf Air Force Base, AK. Following \nthis assignment, he returned to Washington, DC, to lead as the deputy \nchief of staff for operations, plans and requirements, Headquarters \nU.S. Air Force. general Chandler was selected for the rank of general \nand asked to return once again to the Pacific theater to command the \nPacific Air Forces at Hickam Air Force Base, HI. Finally, he was \nselected to become the second highest ranking officer in the Air Force \nas the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force, where he has served for \nover a year.\n  Under General Chandler's leadership, the Air Force handled some of \nour most challenging issues, including the $40 billion KC-X acquisition \nprogram, creation of Air Force Cyber Command, force structure \nrealignment, and creation of Air Force Global Strike Command. Finally, \nGeneral Chandler led the drive for what I consider the Air Force's most \npressing issue: recapitalization. Through General Chandler's \nleadership, the Air Force secured a budget of $1.7 billion for bomber \nand air-to-ground weapons, acquired $8.2 billion for fighter and \nmunitions programs, and laid the foundation for $200 million in \nsupplemental munitions funding. The leadership, insight, and dedication \nof General Chandler have been instrumental in building lasting and \ntrusting relationships with the U.S. Congress, resulting in an overall \nincrease in U.S. national security.\n  The breadth and depth of General Chandler's assignments and the \nprofessionalism with which he has carried them out reflect a keen \nintellect, an unwavering dedication to the Air Force mission, and an \nunrivaled grasp of national security policies developed through both \npersonal experience and academic instruction. General Chandler earned a \nmaster's degree in management, attended the Executive Program for \nGeneral Officers at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at \nHarvard, and the Navy Senior Leader Business Course at the University \nof North Carolina at Chapel Hill. While he has received many \ndistinguished awards and decorations, it is General Chandler's \ncommitment and sacrifice to this Nation that make him stand out among \nhis peers.\n  I have the utmost trust in and respect for General Chandler, gained \nover the past several years through our personal interaction during \nnumerous meetings and hearings, including the annual Altus Quail \nBreakfast and meetings of the U.S. Air Force Academy's board of \nvisitors, which I have been honored to attend. I will miss his honesty \nand frankness, a trait that has served him, the Air Force, and this \nNation well during his time as a senior Air Force leader.\n  On behalf of Congress and the United States of America, I thank \nGeneral Chandler, his wife Eva-Marie, and their three children, Carl, \nRose-Marie, and Thomas, for their commitment, sacrifice, and \ncontribution to this great Nation. I congratulate General Chandler on \nthe completion of an exemplary Active-Duty career and wish him and his \nfamily Godspeed in the next phase of his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/05/senate-section/article/S61-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S61]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/05/senate-section/article/S61-2", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S61]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/05/senate-section/article/S61-3", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S61]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT OF THE APPORTIONMENT POPULATION FOR EACH STATE AS OF APRIL 1, \n 2010, AND THE NUMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES TO WHICH EACH STATE WOULD BE \n                             ENTITLED--PM 1\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to title 2, United States Code, section 2a(a), I transmit \nherewith the statement showing the apportionment population for each \nState as of April 1, 2010, and the number of Representatives to which \neach State would be entitled.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, January 5, 2011.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/05/senate-section/article/S61-4", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S61-S62]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE SUBSEQUENT TO SINE DIE ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  Under authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, 2009, the \nSecretary of the Senate, on December 23, 2010, subsequent to the sine \ndie adjournment of the Senate, received a\n\n[[Page S62]]\n\nmessage from the House of Representatives announcing that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 3903.

And if that question \n     shall be decided in the affirmative by three-fifths of the \n     Senators duly chosen and sworn--except on a measure or motion \n     to amend the Senate rules, in which case the necessary \n     affirmative vote shall be two-thirds of the Senators present \n     and voting--then said measure, motion, or other matter \n     pending before the Senate, or the unfinished business, shall \n     be the unfinished business.\n       ``Thereafter no Senator shall be entitled to speak in all \n     more than one hour on the measure, motion, or other matter \n     pending before the Senate, or the unfinished business, the \n     amendments thereto, and motions affecting the same, and it \n     shall be the duty of the Presiding Officer to keep the time \n     of each Senator who speaks. Except by unanimous consent, no \n     amendment shall be proposed after the vote to bring the \n     debate to a close, unless it had been submitted in writing to \n     the Journal Clerk by 1 o'clock p.m. on the day following the \n     filing of the cloture motion if an amendment in the first \n     degree, and unless it had been so submitted at least one hour \n     prior to the beginning of the cloture vote if an amendment in \n     the second degree.

The thirty hours may be \n     increased by the adoption of a motion, decided without \n     debate, by a three-fifths affirmative vote of the Senators \n     duly chosen and sworn, and any such time thus agreed upon \n     shall be equally divided between and controlled by the \n     majority and minority leaders or their designees. However, \n     only one motion to extend time, specified above, may be made \n     in any one calendar day.\n       ``If, for any reason, a measure or matter is reprinted \n     after cloture has been invoked, amendments which were in \n     order prior to the reprinting of the measure or matter will \n     continue to be in order and may be conformed and reprinted at \n     the request of the amendment's sponsor.

It shall not be in order to file \n     subsequent cloture motions on any measure, motion, or other \n     matter pending before the Senate, except by unanimous \n     consent, until the previous motion has been disposed of.\n       ``(2) Such subsequent motions shall be made in the manner \n     provided by, and subject to the provisions of, subparagraph \n     (a), except that the affirmative vote required to bring to a \n     close debate upon that measure, motion, or other matter, or \n     unfinished business (other than a measure or motion to amend \n     Senate rules) shall be reduced by three votes on the second \n     such motion, and by three additional votes on each succeeding \n     motion, until the affirmative vote is reduced to a number \n     equal to or less than an affirmative vote of a majority of \n     the Senators duly chosen and sworn.

Mr. President, we run through these resolutions, and \nsometimes don't understand the importance of what we do to individuals. \nI just read about a half an hour ago one of the nicest letters I have \never received from Caroline Kennedy regarding this. When I think of Ted \nKennedy, when I came to the Senate he was somebody I could never \nbelieve I would be working with. As you come into my Capitol office, as \nyou walk in the door, I have a letter that was sent to me by President \nKennedy between the time he was elected and before he was inaugurated. \nTed used to come in to my office and many times he would look at that \nletter from his brother. He said, ``And that's his real signature.'' It \nwas a letter to me congratulating me on establishing the first Young \nDemocrat Club at Utah State University. And then to have this wonderful \nletter from Caroline.\n  These things we do affect people and there is no better example than \nthat nice letter I got from Caroline today regarding her father and \nsaying thanks for doing this for my father.\n  I further ask that the concurrent resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements related \nto this measure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con.
