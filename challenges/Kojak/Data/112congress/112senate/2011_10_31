Mr. President, today, I join millions of Nevadans in \ncommemorating the day, 147 years ago, that Nevada joined the Union. \nGranted statehood during the bitter years of the Civil War, in 1864, \nour mettle was tested from the very beginning.\n  Today, our State is once again tested. All over the State of Nevada, \ntoo many Nevadans are still out of work or underwater in their home \nmortgages during these tough economic times. But I know by facing our \nchallenges together, we will once again demonstrate the collective \nstrength that comes from being literally ``battle born.''\n  What is on this chart appeared in last week's New Yorker magazine. \n``I've got mine.'' ``Change, Smange.'' ``Leave Well Enough Alone.'' \n``Keep Things Precisely as they are.'' ``I'm good, thanks.''\n  The pictures portrayed are obviously caricatures of very rich \npeople--top hats, vests, cigars. For me, this did not portray people \nwho were rich as much as what is going on with our Republican \ncolleagues. We know all that has been said about the 1 percent--how \nwell they are doing. It was reported last week that during the last 25 \nyears, their percentage of wealth in America has gone up almost 300 \npercent. So there will be a lot of attention focused on the rich, as it \nshould be.\n  But also I think it should be directed to the Republicans in the \nSenate--not to Republicans around the country but those in the Senate--\nbecause Republicans around the country don't agree. They don't agree \nthings are just fine. They don't agree we should leave well enough \nalone. They don't agree that just because the rich are doing so well, \nthings are OK precisely the way they are. The vast majority of \nAmericans disagree with that.\n  It is true that for a few lucky Americans, things in this country are \ngoing just fine. The haves have never had more. My colleagues in the \nRepublican Party in the Senate are singularly focused on making sure it \nstays that way. Everything on this chart applies to what has happened \nin the Senate in the last 10, 11 months. The gap between the haves and \nthe have nots has never been bigger. The middle class is falling \nfurther and further behind.\n  That is why, while Republicans advocate for millionaires and \nbillionaires, Democrats are looking out for working Americans.\n  We have not forgotten that 14 million people are still out of work or \nmillions more are struggling to make ends meet. We have not stopped \nfighting to get good-paying American jobs.\n  That is why Democrats will introduce the Rebuild America's Jobs Act \ntonight, legislation that will create hundreds of thousands of jobs by \ninvesting in our Nation's crumbling infrastructure. It would put men \nand\n\n[[Page S6898]]\n\nwomen across this country to work, for example, upgrading 150,000 miles \nof highways and roads, laying 4,000 miles of train tracks, restoring \n150 miles of airport runways and installing a modern air traffic \ncontrol system that no longer relies on World War II-era technology and \nwill reduce travel time and delays.\n  Since the economic downturn began, more than 2 million construction \nworkers have lost their jobs. That has happened all over the country. \nThis legislation will send hundreds of thousands of those workers back \nto job sites to build $27 billion worth of roads, bridges, and other \nimportant aspects of our infrastructure.\n\n  The plan would fund $250 million worth of projects in my State and \nmillions of dollars in the State of Delaware and other States. It would \nsupport about 3,300 badly needed jobs.\n  Overall, the Rebuild America Jobs Act would invest $50 billion, \ntaking our citizens off the unemployment rolls and putting them back to \nwork, ensuring our Nation has top-notch infrastructure once again.\n  It will also invest $10 billion to create an infrastructure bank that \nwould leverage public and private capital to fund a wide range of long-\ndelayed projects.\n  It will do all this without adding one penny to the deficit. Instead, \nit would require millionaires and billionaires to contribute their fair \nshare--those whose incomes are netting over $1 million. They would be \nasked to pay a surcharge of less than 1 percent--seven-tenths of 1 \npercent, to be exact--to get this Nation's economy back on track.\n  Americans overwhelmingly support the Democrats' plan to invest in \nroadways, runways, and railways. Seventy-two percent of the American \npeople support the Rebuild America Jobs Act.\n  I don't know if I have been to Jonesboro, AR. I had a case that took \nme all over that State on one occasion. But a man in Jonesboro, AR, is \nquoted in last week's Time magazine. ``The Return of the Silent \nMajority.'' I believe Drew Ramey qualifies for that. This is what he \ntold Time magazine:\n\n       I used to think I was a libertarian. . . . But I like my \n     roads now. I like my public services.\n\n  That was Drew Ramey from Jonesboro, AR. He speaks for millions and \nmillions of Americans, Americans of all political persuasions. Even 54 \npercent of Republicans believe a world-class economy should have world-\nclass roads and bridges. They agree with what we are trying to do.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and labor union AFL-CIO rarely agree on \nanything, but they agree on this. They agree we should pass the Rebuild \nAmerican Jobs Act to improve the woeful state of America's \ninfrastructure. It is not only labor and business groups but transit \nofficials, mayors, and three-quarters of the American people support \nour plan--76 percent.\n  I could quote one dozen of my Senate Republican colleagues who have \nsupported aspects of this in the past. Why aren't they lining up to \nsupport our proposal? Two basic reasons. One, Republicans are \ndetermined to see President Obama fail, even if it means Americans fail \nwith him--sad but true.\n  My colleague, the Republican leader, said his No. 1 goal in this \nCongress is to defeat President Obama. They would rather see Americans \ncontinue to struggle, as I have outlined, to find work than work \ntogether with the President and with us.\n  Second, Republicans are more concerned with protecting millionaires \nand billionaires than they are willing to work with us to put 14 \nmillion people back to work.\n  I heard on the radio this morning, on National Public Radio, that \nduring the Bush years, we lost 8.6 million jobs. We have only gotten a \nlittle over 2 million of those back--2\\1/2\\ million, frankly. It wasn't \nlong ago that a President who was in office for 8 years could boast, if \nhe wanted to, about creating 23 million jobs.\n  That is what Republicans have given us. They refuse to ask the rich \nto contribute a tiny fraction more to secure our economic future, even \nif it costs more jobs.\n  In recent days, Republicans have shown new interest in the gulf \nbetween rich and poor that has motivated thousands to occupy parks \nacross the country and make their voices heard. Apparently, they \nbelieve America's staggering income inequality makes a good talking \npoint.\n  Yet while Democrats fight for jobs for the middle class, Republicans \nfight for tax breaks for the 1 percent of Americans who don't need our \nhelp.\n  I will bet if we could ask these very rich people would they be \nwilling to give seven-tenths of 1 percent more to create millions of \njobs, most of them would say yes. Why aren't my Republican colleagues \nsupporting this simple, commonsense legislation?\n  I say to my Republican colleagues that I hope they will work with us. \nWe want to work with them. If we can do something good, there is a lot \nof good will to go around. But we have to make sure the speeches we \nhave heard from some of our colleagues about creating jobs amount to \ndoing something about it. We have not seen it yet.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/31/senate-section/article/S6898-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is no secret that Congress isn't \nwinning any popularity contest these days. Americans are fed up with \nlawmakers who are either focused on the wrong thing or determined to \nblock any serious reforms that would actually get at the root of the \nproblems we face. That is why Republicans have been focused not only on \nlegislation which we think has a good chance of jump-starting private \nsector job creation in this country but which also has a good shot at \nactually becoming law. Put another way, since taking back the majority \nthis year, Republicans in the House of Representatives have focused not \nonly on legislation which avoids the economic missteps of the previous \n2\\1/2\\ years of Democratic control but legislation which also has a \ngood shot of making it through a Democratic-led Senate.\n  You would never know it from listening to the President, but there \nhas actually been a significant amount of bipartisan work that has been \ngoing on on Capitol Hill these days. House Republicans have passed bill \nafter bill--many of them with solid bipartisan support--that would help \nspur private sector job creation and would help get this economy moving \nagain, but the Democrats who have run the Senate for the past 5 years \nhave ignored virtually all of it. Senate Democrats have decided it \nisn't in the interest of their party for Congress to get anything done \nright now. They have adopted a strict strategy of inaction. They simply \nwon't take ``yes'' for an answer.\n  The contrast between Republicans who run the House and Democrats who \nrun the Senate couldn't be starker. Since taking over the House this \nyear, House Republicans have searched for areas of common ground and \nthen invited Democrats who run the Senate to take them up and pass them \nand send them on down to the President for a signature. Almost every \nsingle time, Senate Democrats have said no.\n  House Republicans now count more than 15 pieces of legislation that \nwould help us chart a very different path from the one the President \nand his Democratic-controlled Congress have charted over the past few \nyears. This is legislation that would unlock America's energy \nresources, cut back on excessive regulations that are holding back job \ncreation, and enable businesses, such as Boeing, to make their\n\n[[Page S6899]]\n\nown decisions about how and where to expand.\n  Just last week, the House passed a bill to get rid of an IRS \nwithholding tax on businesses that do work for the government. More \nthan 400 Members of the House voted for this bill, including 170 \nDemocrats. Here is how one prominent Democrat described this bill:\n\n       The repeal of this requirement will free up small \n     businesses' cash flow, increasing their ability to add jobs \n     and to bid on new projects.\n\n  Republicans support this legislation. Democrats support this \nlegislation. The President included this legislation in his own jobs \nbill, and he supports the bill that passed the House last week. There \nis no reason the Senate shouldn't take it up right now. This is one \nsmall thing we can do right now to reduce the burden on employers \nacross the country. We came together to help them earlier this month by \npassing free-trade bills. Let's build on that success and pass this \nbill the job creators are telling us will help protect and create jobs.\n  Like Senate Democrats, the President may think he benefits from the \nappearance of inaction in Congress. That is why he is running around \nthe country reminding people how bad the economy is instead of urging \nDemocrats who run the Senate to work with Republicans who run the \nHouse. But with all due respect to the President, the American people \nalready know the economy is in bad shape. That is not news to anybody. \nThey do not need the President to tell them that. They live it. What \nthey need is for the President to get his party to agree to something \nthat helps.\n  I know Democrats will argue that our proposals for job creation \nwouldn't be their first choice. My response is that the Democrats had 3 \nyears to do something about jobs and the economy. The President's \nsignature jobs bill cost nearly $1 trillion, and 2\\1/2\\ years later \nthere are 1\\1/2\\ million fewer jobs in this country than on the day \nthat legislation was signed. So why don't we try a different approach? \nLet's try an approach that actually takes into account the concerns of \nstruggling business owners who are ultimately going to lift us out of \nthis jobs crisis. They have told us what they want. It is not a mystery \nwhat we need to do to help these folks create jobs. Temporary fixes and \nmore stimulus bills isn't it.\n  So our message is this: The Democrats in Washington need to start \ntaking ``yes'' for an answer. Republicans have put forward more than a \ndozen concrete proposals to spur job creation in this country that \navoid the economic mistakes Democrats made over the past few years. We \nhave done the hard work of legislating and looking for areas where the \nparties overlap on the issues. It is time for the President to signal \nto Democrats in Congress that it is OK to work with us.\n  Everyone knows the economy is in bad shape. What Republicans are \nsaying is that higher taxes and more government spending isn't the way \nto help it. Everyone knows the Federal Government in Washington is \nspending way too much money, money it doesn't have. What Republicans \nare saying is that the solution isn't to spend even more. Everyone \nknows that if the two parties are going to come together and act, we \nneed to design legislation that appeals to both sides, and that is \nexactly what Republicans are doing.\n  It is time to put the political playbook aside and actually take \naction. Republicans in the House are doing their job. It is time for \nthe President and Senate Democrats to do theirs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/31/senate-section/article/S6899-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6899-S6901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MINIBUS APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Republican leader for his \ncomments and would just say that the time we can borrow from the future \nto spend today in order to create some sort of sugar high that creates \njobs is past. We have tried that. The debt has now reached a level \nwhere the debt itself is a threat to our economy. It is a cloud over \nour economy. It is slowing growth and job creation. I truly believe \nthat. We need to move out of these difficult financial times we are in, \nbut I think the debt itself now is a threat to us.\n  I wish to speak about the minibus appropriations bill that is before \nthe body and its effect on the budget we have. As the ranking \nRepublican on the Budget Committee, I do believe it is my \nresponsibility to present, as I am able, a straightforward, honest \nfigure about the spending bills that come before our Senate.\n  H.R. 2112 is the first of several minibus bills that apparently will \nbe used in lieu of the normal appropriations process. This minibus is \nso named because it contains three appropriation bills put in one--not \none as we normally see before the Senate: the Agriculture bill, \nCommerce-Justice-Science, and the Transportation and Housing bill, all \ncobbled together in one.\n  The Democratic majority contends this package will save taxpayers \nmoney, but this is just more Washington accounting. We have crunched \nthe numbers and discovered that these bills will not cut spending but \nwill actually increase spending by $10 billion over last year. So I \nwish to take a moment to explain because this is very important. We had \nan agreement that we would begin the smallest of reductions this year \nin spending--not nearly enough, but we reached that agreement, and we \nshould honor that at least. So this is the first appropriations bill \nthe Senate has considered after the discretionary spending caps were \nestablished as part of the recent debt limit negotiations.\n  The Budget Control Act, as you remember, was passed to raise the debt \nceiling. As an exchange for agreeing to raise the debt ceiling, as \nPresident Obama asked, Congress insisted that there be some curtailment \nof spending so we wouldn't hit the debt ceiling again so soon. So the \nBudget Control Act, as the bill was pretentiously named in August, \nrequires that discretionary spending be brought down this year from \n$1,050 billion to $1,043 billion in fiscal year 2012, an alleged total \nspending reduction of a paltry $7 billion throughout the entire year. \nPresumably, the other $6 billion that was required to be saved under \nthis agreement will be saved in other bills to come before the \nCongress. We haven't seen them yet.\n  Does the bill that is before us move us toward even this minor goal? \nThat is the question. The majority party says it does. They contend \nthat the bill, the minibus, spends $128 billion--which is $1 billion \nless than last year when it was $129 billion--a reduction of less than \n10 percent, and they are very proud of this. But, remember, as an \naside, nondefense discretionary spending alone in the first 2 years of \nPresident Obama's Presidency went up 24 percent. So to take a $1 \nbillion reduction is basically to hold in place this surge in spending \nat a time when this Nation has never, ever faced such a severe debt \nthreat to its future.\n  Going through the bill and thinking it through, the Budget Control \nAct also created a new category of spending. The Budget Control Act, if \nyou remember, was cobbled together in the dead of night and brought up \non the floor on the eve of a financial crisis and it was demanded that \nit be passed, and hardly anyone had a chance to read it. Unknown to \nmost of us, it allowed spending above the $1,043 billion limit for \ndisaster assistance. The debt limit deal provided an allowance for \ndisaster spending equal to the average of the 10 prior years of \ndisaster spending, which can be assessed or spent simply by providing \nthe proper words in the appropriations bills that come forward across \nthe floor, as these three do. But the majority contends this money \nshould magically not be counted when you decide how much is spent by \nthe bill. Why? Well, it is a disaster, and disaster spending doesn't \ncount. Don't you know?\n  As amended on the Senate floor 2 weeks ago, the bill now contains \n$3.2 billion in new spending above the caps for disaster relief, a \nfurther increase of 20 percent to the disaster assistance. Two \nadditional amendments were adopted last week adding to the amount that \nthe committees had produced as disaster assistance.\n  While there are arguments that the $3.2 billion should not be counted \nas an expenditure, the CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, our \nofficial scorekeeper, includes it as an expenditure. It is included as \nan expenditure in the CBO score, $3.2 billion. No one has challenged \nthem because it appears they are plainly correct to count the\n\n[[Page S6900]]\n\n$3.2 billion as spending. Only in Washington can it be asserted that \nthe government can spend $3.2 billion and it not count. The bill's \nsponsors contend that the discretionary spending portion of the bill, \nas I indicated, has gone down from $129 billion to $128 billion, but \nCBO says it went up to $131 billion. The disaster funding represents a \n2-percent discretionary increase, at a time when spending is supposed \nto be going down.\n  Further, the bill's sponsors say you should not count the mandatory \nspending programs that are contained in the bill. They insist that \nmandatory spending is not under the control of the appropriators. \nAgain, this is logic that only exists in Washington. In truth, it is \nnot unusual for the Appropriations Committee to take actions that \nimpact mandatory programs, and it can be done. But, of course, it was \nnot in this bill.\n  For example, food stamps, the largest mandatory program by far in \nthis bill--actually larger than any other program in the bill--amounts \nto 75 percent of total Agriculture appropriations spending. Seventy-\nfive percent. Most people think agriculture programs are bailing out \nfarmers. Those benefits to farmers have been reduced steadily over the \nyears. Now 75 percent of the Agriculture bill is the mandatory \nprograms, food stamps being the largest. And this program, under the \nlegislation before us today, is set to increase by 14 percent next \nyear, $10 billion more than last year, a $10 billion increase in the \nFood Stamp Program. But that doesn't count, it is contended.\n  This spending increase results in a doubling of the food stamp budget \nover the past 3 years--doubling the budget in 3 years--and then \nquadrupling it four times over the last 10 years. We have got to look \nunder the hood of this program and find out what is happening to it. \nBut nothing is seriously being done. Like welfare reform, responsible \nchanges to the way government operates this program will improve \noutcomes, help more needy people achieve the goal of financial \nindependence, not dependence, and stop fraud, which most Americans know \nis pretty common in the Food Stamp Program.\n  When I offered an amendment to save a modest $10 billion over the \nnext 10 years, a reform that would not have reduced eligibility for any \nof the needy but only require that the recipients meet the minimum \nlegal requirements of the program--actually be needy and qualify for \nthe program by reducing fraud and abuse--the amendment was defeated \nright here on the floor of the Senate. It would have saved $10 billion, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, by making sure that \npeople make actual, formal applications for their food stamps and sign \na document saying they actually qualify for it. Is that too much to \nask?\n\n  Senator Stabenow, the agriculture authorizing committee chair, rose \nto explain that we are not to worry because, while we are increasing \nfood stamp funding now, at some other time her committee will recommend \nand produce a bill perhaps that will reduce it by $23 billion over 10 \nyears. But if that promise were to be fulfilled, the effect on the \nfiscal year 2012 budget would be that food stamp spending would \nincrease this year approximately $8 billion--or a 10-percent increase--\nrather than $10 billion, a 14-percent increase. The program has indeed \ndoubled since 2008.\n  But now we are hearing in reports that this $23 billion in savings is \nnot even in the Food Stamp Program, or most of it is not. We are \nhearing that 19 percent of it is a further reduction of aid to farmers, \nand only $4 billion of the reduction in savings would be from food \nstamps.\n  Here is the bottom line. When discretionary and mandatory spending \nare scored in this bill, the overall spending compared to last year \nwent up by $10 billion, or a 4-percent increase, not a cut. Relative to \nthe amount Senators approved for these three bills last year, we are \nbeing asked to increase spending, not decrease spending. I believe that \nis a fair and honest analysis of the bill that is before us. If you \nwere to exclude the mandatory spending, ignore that huge increase in \nthe Food Stamp Program, the SNAP program, and even say disaster \nassistance should be ignored, the so-called reduction in spending would \nbe only a paltry $1 billion on these three bills combined.\n  It is time to get serious. Denial in this Congress must end. You \ncan't borrow your way out of debt. We are spending money we do not \nhave. Forty cents of every dollar we spend is borrowed, on which we pay \ninterest every year. It is digging us deeper in a hole. It cannot be \ncontended that this is serious work toward reducing our deficit. It \njust cannot be.\n  Our deficit in fiscal year 2011, which ended September 30, was just \nshy of $1,300 billion. A spending cut of $7 billion for this year is a \nmere pittance in comparison. In no way is it even close to a \nsignificant reduction of the projected deficit we are going to have in \nthis fiscal year, which began October 1. We are now at Halloween. We \nstill haven't passed the appropriations bill for the year we are in. \nCongress is not performing responsibly. It is not.\n  We haven't had a budget in over 900 days. The majority leader, \nSenator Reid, said it would be foolish to have a budget. No wonder the \nAmerican people are unhappy with us. How can this be? We are \nresponsible people. We are proposing to spend next year $1,043 billion, \nand act as though we are proud to have reduced the spending by $7 \nbillion when we will have over $1,000 billion in debt, $1 trillion \nplus, next year?\n  But it gets worse. The bill also contains a number of Washington \naccounting tricks to sweep new spending under the rug. It is full of \nthe typical gimmicks used to shove more spending into a bill that has \nalready reached its spending limit. We have reached our limit. I remain \namazed at the creativity used by spenders to defeat budget limits. Were \nthey to use such creativity to control spending, would we not be so \nmuch better off?\n  I have already talked about the new authority granted by the Budget \nControl Act to designate an item as a disaster outside and above the \nbudget--it doesn't count if you call it a disaster--and to spend the \nmoney without a formal vote by the Senate to declare it a disaster. \nIndeed, until the Budget Control Act passed, you had to have 60 votes \nto declare something a disaster to go above the budget. That has been \neliminated. That was changed in this Budget Control Act that reduced \ncontrol of the budget. It reduced the power of the budget to contain \nspending by eliminating this end run. At least you used to have 60 \nvotes to spend above the budget by calling it a disaster. Now you do \nnot.\n\n  When they first floated this idea that they were going to put \ndisaster spending in the budget and it was going to be averaged out \nwith what we normally spend, I thought that was a good idea. We know on \naverage we have been spending this much for disasters. Let's put it in \nthe budget and only spend above that if it meets that standard we have \ntraditionally had. The idea was to arrange the amount of disaster \nspending and put it in the budget, but in the shell game that is \nWashington, that is not what the fine print did. The Budget Control Act \nestablishes in effect now a slush fund to spend money above the budget \nlimits, eliminating the 60-vote requirement for emergency designation. \nThere is $3.2 billion in spending under this new authority that is in \nthis bill, the first of multiple minibuses we will see. At the rate we \nare going, the ceiling of $11.3 billion for disaster established under \nthe Budget Control Act will be exhausted and more emergency spending \nwill be needed to further address legitimate disaster needs, but there \nwill be no need for 60 votes to do so. That vote has been eliminated.\n  In addition, the bill uses another gimmick to rescind discretionary \nappropriations provided in prior years that, for one reason or another, \ncan no longer be spent for their intended purposes. That is, the bill \nrescinds budget authority that CBO estimates will not result in any \ncash savings over the next 10 years. Rather than letting the \nappropriations lapse and saving this money and being thankful we got \nthe project done at less than normal, less than the projected cost, \nthis bill, as has been done before, pretends to be responsible and \nrescinds that money which is then used to pay for the spending that \nwill in fact result in cash expenditures from the Treasury. This one \ngimmick in this bill would add $131 million in off-the-books spending.\n  Finally, the bill finds savings in mandatory programs that game the \ngovernment's cashflow and score as savings\n\n[[Page S6901]]\n\nfor this bill, but does not actually reduce the cost to the taxpayers. \nThese so-called CHIMPS--we have a name for it now, changes in mandatory \nprogram spending--total $8.5 billion in this bill. Of that amount, an \nastonishing 88 percent, or $7.5 billion, results in no net spending \nreduction over 10 years.\n  Some of these CHIMPS have been going on year after year. One example \nis the Crime Victims Fund. Every year Congress says that the crime \nvictims will get the funds they are due under the law next year which, \nunfortunately for the Crime Victims Fund, has not yet arrived since the \nannual deferral began in fiscal year 2000. In other words, it is done \nevery year and there seems to be no prospect that this will not \ncontinue. Meanwhile, the appropriators get the amount deferred over and \nover again, enabling ever higher amounts of discretionary spending. It \nwould be like a family delaying a single $500 home repair for 10 years, \nand then counting it as $5,000 in savings, $500 for every year the \nrepair did not take place. In this case, over the past 3 years the \ngimmick used in this bill has enabled $14 billion in higher spending.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I thank the Chair and ask for 1 additional minute to \nclose.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am unable to support this bill. By its own standards \nit fails. It represents everything that is wrong with Washington today. \nIt crams three bills, which should have been considered individually, \ninto one, creating a process that curtails debate on spending at a time \nwhen we need more debate, not less. Further, it does virtually nothing \nto address the fiscal crisis threatening this country. It treats \nspending caps established earlier this summer as the most that can be \nsaved, not as the starting point for savings, and then uses gimmicks to \nspend over and above that advertised limit. It is not a serious \nresponse to the explosive growth in Federal spending and falls short of \nthe commitment we must make to handle taxpayer dollars honestly and \nresponsibly. It is business as usual. The American people deserve \nbetter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a serious \npublic health crisis facing our Nation and to highlight some of the \nimportant progress we have made to date. We are currently confronting \nunprecedented shortages of critical medications. These drug shortages \nhave impacted people across our country, forcing some patients to delay \ntheir lifesaving treatments, or use unproven, less effective, \nalternatives. In some cases, drug shortages have resulted in patients \nnot getting the kind of treatment they had gotten or being slow in \ngetting their treatment and being left behind. I have been working to \naddress this problem for over a year since I first heard from \nhospitals, pharmacists, and patients in Minnesota that they were facing \nshortages of essential medications, particularly chemotherapy drugs. \nTheir urgency led me to send a letter to FDA Commissioner Hamburg, \nurging the FDA to take action to address this public health crisis.\n  Over the next few months, I continued to receive calls and visits \nfrom constituents, asking help to find medications in short supply. I \nworked with manufacturers, stakeholders, and the FDA to try to find an \nappropriate solution to ensure that patients continue to receive the \ncare they deserve and they need.\n  I would add, while in several cases the crisis was averted, this took \nhours and hours of individual pharmacists' time, individual doctors' \ntime. At a time when we are trying to be as efficient as possible in \nour health care system, the last thing we need is to have a doctor or \nnurse or pharmacist spend half a day to look for medication because \nthere is a shortage.\n  In February I introduced the Preserving Access to Life-Saving \nMedications Act with Senator Casey. This legislation, which has \nbipartisan support and a total of 17 cosponsors, would give the Food \nand Drug Administration the ability to require early notification from \npharmaceutical companies when a factor arises that may result in a \nshortage. Today the President issued an Executive order that adopts \nthis framework for an early notification system. The Executive order \nwill do this: It will push drug companies to notify the FDA of any \nimpending shortage of certain prescription drugs; it will expand the \nFDA's current efforts to expedite review of new manufacturing sites, \ndrug suppliers, and manufacturing changes; and it will direct the FDA \nto work with the Department of Justice to examine whether drug \ncompanies have responded to potential drug shortages by illegally \nhoarding medications or raising prices to gouge consumers.\n  This action will help further reduce and prevent drug shortages, \nprotect consumers, and prevent price gouging. This step enhances \nactions that have already been taken by the FDA and it puts in place \nadditional tools to address drug shortages.\n  This is something we probably didn't hear about a few years ago, but \nthis year we have learned that drug shortages are having a direct toll \non families across America. A couple of months ago I met a young boy \nnamed Axel Zirbes. Axel Zirbes is a cute 4-year-old boy from the Twin \nCities, with bright eyes and a big smile. He also happens to have no \nhair on his head. That is because Axel is being treated for leukemia. \nWhen he was scheduled to start chemotherapy earlier this year, Axel's \nparents learned that an essential drug, cytarabine, was in short supply \nand might not be available for their son. Understandably they were \nthrown into a panic and desperately looked into any available \nalternatives. They even prepared to take Axel to Canada, where \ncytarabine is still readily available.\n\n  Imagine this. You are parents of a 4-year-old, you find out he has \nlife-threatening leukemia, and you cannot get medication which is \nactually quite commonplace in the treatment of this disease, and you \nare starting to fly to Canada because our own country somehow has not \nkept up with the supply of this drug.\n  Fortunately he never had to go to Canada. At the last minute the \nhospital was able to secure the medication from a pharmacy that still \nhad a supply. But Axel and his parents, sadly, are not alone. There \nwere 178 drug shortages reported in 2010. Keep in mind, these are not \nindividual stories such as Axel's. These are actually drugs, 178 \ndifferent drugs across the country, basically affecting millions of \npatients, that had drug shortages in 2010. That is a dramatic increase \nfrom 5 years ago. There were 55 shortages 5 years ago. Think of that \nincrease. For some of these drugs, no substitute drugs are available \nor, if they are, they are less effective and they may involve greater \nrisks of adverse side effects.\n  The chance of medical errors also rises as providers are forced to \nuse drugs they are not familiar with. A survey conducted by the \nAmerican Hospital Association showed that nearly 100 percent of their \nhospitals experienced a shortage in the past year. Another survey, \nconducted by Premier Health System, showed that 89 percent of its \nhospitals and pharmacists experienced shortages that have caused a \nmedication safety issue or an error in patient care.\n  We want to be doing the opposite. We want to be reducing errors. We \nwant to be giving patients the help they need. It is clear there are a \nlarge number of overlapping factors resulting in unprecedented \nshortages. Experts cite a number of factors that are responsible for \nthe shortages. These include market consolidation, poor business \nincentives, manufacturing problems, production delays, unexpected \nincreases in demand for a drug, inability to procure raw materials, and \neven the influence of the gray markets, where people are basically \nhoarding these drugs when they find out there could be a shortage and \nthen upping the prices, as if things were not bad enough.\n  Financial decisions in the pharmaceutical industry are also a major \nfactor. Many of these medications are in short supply because companies \nhave\n\n[[Page S6902]]\n\nsimply stopped production. They decided it was not profitable enough to \nkeep producing them.\n  Instead of low price, and lower profit, generic drugs, companies are \nlooking at more expensive brandname drugs. Mergers in the drug industry \nhave narrowed the focus of product lines. As a result, some products \nare discontinued or production is moved to different sites, leading to \ndelays. When drugs are made by only a few companies, a decision by one \ndrug company can have a huge impact on the market.\n  To help correct a poor market environment or to prevent gray market \ndrugs from contaminating our medication supply chain, we must address \nthe drug shortage problem at its root. The early notification system \nthat would be established under the Preserving Access to Life-Saving \nMedications Act and the President's Executive order that is advanced \ntoday will help the FDA take the lead in working with pharmacy groups, \ndrug manufacturers, and health care providers to better prepare for \nimpending shortages, more effectively manage shortages when they occur, \nand minimize their impact on patient care.\n  Just so you know, the FDA already does this with orphan drugs. When \nthere is only one drug and the drug manufacturer thinks they are going \nto run out of the drug they do tell the FDA so the FDA can step in and \nmaybe look internationally for another drug. You saw that happen with \nthe H1N1 virus. When we had a short supply they went to other \ncountries. They are allowed to do that now, but manufacturers are not \nrequired to do it in some of the situations we are encountering now \nwith those 178 drug shortages. That is what our bill does. It basically \nsays if you see a drug shortage coming down the pipe because one or a \nnumber of these factors is present, you have to let the FDA now know. \nYou have to work with the FDA because they have successfully averted \ndozens of drug shortages this year.\n  We do not pretend this is going to solve everything, but at least it \nis something we can do right now which will give the FDA the power to \ngo in there and work with the drug manufacturers and try to find other \nsources so the person who is doing that is not the parent of a 4-year-\nold kid with leukemia or a pharmacist who is trying to serve customers \nat his pharmacy, or a doctor trying to treat patients and she has to \nget on the phone and call a bunch of hospitals to try to find a drug. \nIt simply does not make any sense at all. This is a national problem, \nnot a problem for a 4-year-old boy.\n  Our legislation would also direct the FDA to provide up-to-date \npublic notification of any actual shortage situation and the actions \nthe agency would take to address them.\n  Additionally, the bill requires the FDA to develop an evidence-based \nlist of drugs vulnerable to shortages and to work with the \nmanufacturers to come up with a continuity of operations plan to \naddress potential problems that may result in a shortage.\n  The bill would also direct the FDA to establish an expedited \nreinspection process for manufacturers of a product in shortage. This \nwould allow them to get inspected sooner so we can get the drugs to \nmarket. With manufacturers providing early notification, the FDA's \ndrug-shortage team, which already exists, can then appropriately use \ntheir tools to prevent shortages from happening. As I mentioned, in the \nlast 2 years the FDA, with early notification and more information, has \nsuccessfully prevented 137 drug shortages. So this is something that \nactually works.\n  While the President's Executive order takes steps toward advancing \nthese goals, he has made it clear we must pass this bill in order to \nprotect patients and ensure consumers they have access to the \nlifesaving medications they need and deserve. So the Executive order \nhelps, but we still need to pass this bill.\n  I understand this may be a short-term solution to a long-term \nproblem. That is why I have also been working with several of my \ncolleagues on a bipartisan basis to come up with a broad, permanent \nsolution, one that includes methods to address the root causes of drug \nshortages. This includes Senator McCain, Senator Corker, and Senator \nBurr. I also see Senator Blumenthal here, who has been working on this \nissue. We have Senators--including Senator Casey and others--working \nwith the HELP Committee who have been working to get this done. At the \nurging of this bipartisan working group, the FDA held a public workshop \nin September that brought together patient advocates, consumer groups, \nhealth care professionals, and researchers to discuss the causes and \nthe impact of drug shortages and possible strategies for preventing or \nmitigating future shortages.\n  In addition to the working group, I have been speaking with a broad \nrange of stakeholders to try to discover why we have seen such a large \nnumber of drug shortages that we have not seen in the past. The facts \ndon't lie, and the numbers don't lie. There has been an enormous \nincrease in the number of drug shortages. This current explosion of \nshortages appears to be a consequence of a lack of supply of certain \nproducts to keep up with a substantial expansion in the scope and \ndemand for these products.\n  Due to the complex nature of these drug shortages, there is no single \nor simple solution that would solve all problems. A solution will \nrequire everyone involved to play a role in mitigating future drug \nshortages. We must ensure we have the manufacturing capabilities to \nkeep up with demand. One solution may be to provide tax incentives to \nmanufacturers to continue to make drugs that are on the shortage list \nor to provide other market incentives, such as including exclusivity \npricing similar to that which we give to manufacturers that make orphan \ndrugs. In addition, I have urged the FDA to improve its communication \nwith patients and providers. This will ensure patients and doctors are \nnot the last to know when there is a shortage. I also favor permanent \nreimportation of drugs from safe countries, such as Canada. Not \neveryone involved in this issue thinks that is a good idea, but I can \ntell you, if we were to allow that, that little 4-year-old boy would \nnot have to look at flights to Canada.\n  One thing is clear: This is a national public health crisis that must \nbe addressed. The President's actions today will provide additional \ntools to address drug shortages, but more must be done. I will continue \nto work with my colleagues in the bipartisan working group for a broad \npermanent solution. I will also continue to work with Senator Casey, \nwith the Presiding Officer, and with all of the other Senators involved \nin this, including Senator Susan Collins, to get our legislation \npassed. It is common sense. It is not over the top. It simply takes a \ntool that is used now to avert drug shortages for orphan drugs and \nexpands it so that other drug manufacturers, when they have drugs that \nare going to experience a shortage, are required to notify the FDA. It \ngives the FDA that little extra time, whether it is 1 month, 6 months, \nor 1 year, to look for the drug in other locations. I think it would \ngive us some insight into what is actually going on here so we can fix \nthis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal).

Mr. President, I rise today to honor a fallen hero, \nPetty Officer First Class Caleb Nelson of Omaha, Nebraska. Petty \nOfficer Nelson died on October 1, 2011, when his vehicle was struck by \nan explosive device in Afghanistan. He was on combat patrol with fellow \nSEAL team members when the attack occurred. His desire to succeed and \nhelp others led him to military service.\n  For Caleb, it had to be the best. For him, that was the Navy SEALs. \nMilitary commanders trusted Petty Officer Nelson's judgment and his \ncommitment. He was typically assigned a leading role on search \nmissions, placing the lives of many SEALs in his capable hands. Caleb \nwas in the lead position when he was killed.\n  The decorations and badges earned during his distinguished service \nspeak to his dedication and to his skill--The Bronze Star with Valor, \nthe Purple Heart, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, the \nCombat Action Ribbon, the Good Conduct Ribbon, the National Defense \nMedal, the Iraq Campaign Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the \nGlobal War on\n\n[[Page S6903]]\n\nTerrorism Medal, the Sea Service Ribbon (2 awards), the NATO Service \nMedal, the Expert Rifle Ribbon, and the Expert Pistol Ribbon.\n  Although Caleb's life was cut short, he had a wide circle of friends \nand touched the lives and hearts of many. His dynamic and energetic \npersonality caused people to look to him as a motivator and as a \nmentor. Those who knew him recall his deep faith in Christ, his strong \ninterest in physical fitness, and a focus on getting things done. \nThroughout his life, Caleb grew in his Christian faith and quickly \nbecame a rock of support for others. No problem was too small to lay \nbefore Caleb.\n  There was also an unrelenting love for family dwelling inside this \ntough, physically fit SEAL. His wife Anna and his sons, David and Kyle, \nmeant everything to him. When Caleb wasn't training or on assignment, \nhe was with them. Caleb also benefited from a strong relationship with \nhis loving parents, Larry and Barb, his nine siblings, and a faithful \ncommunity of fellow believers who admired his strength, his compassion, \nand his leadership.\n  Today, I ask that God be with the family and friends of Caleb Nelson \nand bring them comfort during this very difficult time. Their faith is \nstrong, so I know they will join me in seeking God's blessings on those \ncurrently serving in uniform, especially those involved in combat \noperations.\n  May God bless our servicemembers and their families and bring them \nhome safely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are at a significant moment in the \nrelationship between the banking industry on Wall Street and businesses \nand consumers on Main Street all across America. This could be, in the \nwords of Malcolm Gladwell, a ``tipping point,'' and it could lead to a \nmuch more balanced relationship in the future.\n  It is interesting how we reached this point. There was a time not \nthat long ago when Wall Street and Main Street both played by the same \nrules. Banks and businesses sold goods and services to consumers in a \ncompetitive market environment with transparent prices. Banks performed \nand still perform a valuable function in our economy, providing capital \nand liquidity. Businesses, of course, in the sale of goods and services \nare generating the activity that fuels our economy. They were \ncomplementary. They worked with one another.\n  The successful banks and businesses were the ones that were more \nefficient than their competitors. They offered better products, better \nprices. This system, characterized by transparency, competition, and \nchoice worked well for everyone: consumers, banks, businesses, all \ntheir customers. It was the basis for a free market economy and a great \nnation.\n  In recent years, and particularly after the repeal of Glass-Steagall, \nthough, things changed. Banks started moving to a new role beyond \ncapital and liquidity. The level of profitability and the activities of \nthe banks started moving in many different directions. Instead of \npracticing transparency and competition, many banks started cutting \ncorners, imposing fees, raising interest rates, and basically creating \npolicies that were very difficult for even their most loyal customers \nto follow. That was a situation which had gotten out of hand.\n  We saw hidden fees pop up left and right, such as overdraft fees on \nchecking accounts that went completely beyond any reasonable penalty \nfor a person who is guilty of that conduct, and sudden interest rate \nchanges on credit cards. Consumers many times did not even know they \nwere being charged the fees until it was too late, and the banks \nfigured if all the banks did it consumers would have no choice. They \nhad to live with it.\n  Perhaps no fee better characterized the absence of transparency and \ncompetition than the interchange fee, or the swipe fee. This is a fee \nthat banks receive from merchants and retailers each time a person uses \na debit card or a credit card. It is a fee unlike any other. With most \nfees we see one fee rate charged by one bank, such as Bank of America, \nanother rate by another bank, Wells Fargo or Chase or whatever it \nhappens to be. But with interchange fees, all banks receive the same \nfee rate. There is no competition.\n  The banks realized that competition holds fee rates down. So they \nwent to Visa and MasterCard--and on debit cards Visa has around 80 \npercent of the debit card business--and said to them: You can set, you \ncan dictate the interchange fees the banks will collect. And they did.\n  This duopoly, these two major credit card giants, Visa and \nMasterCard, set fees for all of the banks issuing their cards across \nAmerica. This has been a huge moneymaker for the banks. Banks make an \nestimated $50 billion a year in debit and credit card interchange fees, \nand because there is no competition and no negotiation with the \nretailers Visa and MasterCard reward their big bank allies with higher \nfee rates every single year, even as the cost of processing these \ntransactions continues to go down.\n  Swipe fees have become a huge and growing burden for Main Street \nbusinesses and customers, and American families ultimately pay the \nprice in the form of higher costs for groceries and gasoline.\n  I think of Potash Supermarket. I have talked about it on the Senate \nfloor many times. Art Potash has become a buddy of mine, second or \nthird generation owning this supermarket near North Chicago. He is not \nas big as the big boys, Dominicks, Jewel, and the others, but, boy, \nwhat a nice store he has.\n  Art came to me years ago and said: They are killing me. The debit \ncard sweep fees are killing me. It is the second or third most \nexpensive item when I put together the cost of my business, and it is \nout of control. I have no control over it.\n  Art was one of the people, he and Rich Neimann down at Quincy, IL, \nretailers, businessmen who got me started on this. Well, it is \ninteresting. Something is happening out there in America. It could be \nthat the era of some of these banking practices is coming to an end. \nMaybe we are reaching a tipping point.\n  In 2009, Congress passed credit card reform that reined in sudden \ninterest rate changes, and regulators placed curbs on abusive overdraft \nfees. Of course, the credit card companies and the banks screamed \nbloody murder: Too much government. Too much regulation.\n  We did not listen to them. We listened to American families and \nconsumers. Last year, Congress passed a Wall Street reform bill, and we \ncreated a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and placed \nreasonable limits on Visa and MasterCard swipe fee price fixing. No \nsurprise. The banks cried bloody murder. They do not want to make a \npenny less than they made in the last quarter, even if their past \nprofits were inflated by hidden fees and anticompetitive practices.\n  So now big banks are looking for new ways to squeeze their customers \nin order to maintain their record profits and ten-figure executive \nbonuses. But in the past week, something interesting has happened in \nAmerica. After years of raising fees on the customers without much \nresistance, several of the biggest banks tried to stick it to their \ncustomers again with a new monthly debit card fee. The consumers of \nAmerica noticed, stood up, and said: No way.\n  After Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and several other big banks \nannounced these new debit fees, their customers began voting with their \nfeet. New account openings at credit unions and community banks surged \nin many cases by 20 to 50 percent.\n  I am sure that is good news to my colleague from Iowa to know that \nthere is more business at the community banks and credit unions of \nIowa, leaving the Wall Street banks and coming home to Iowa. It is good \nnews in Illinois.\n  Consumers have been emboldened. They are now saying they will only do \nbusiness with banks that care about serving them instead of squeezing \nthem. This has been a great development for consumers. It has also been \ngreat for those small banks and credit unions which we value so much in \nthe Midwest who have never stopped playing by the rules and have always \nvalued their customers and their communities.\n  Now, November 5 is coming. It turns out to be a day I was not \npreviously\n\n[[Page S6904]]\n\naware of but I have read about now. They are calling it the National \nBank Transfer Day. We are seeing many big banks actually reversing \nthemselves and abandoning their recently announced debit fees in light \nof the possibility that even more people are going to shift away from \nthe big banks with the monthly debit card fees to community banks and \ncredit unions and other banks that are not imposing the fees.\n  Big banks are starting to see it just is not good business to nickel \nand dime their customers and charge them five bucks a month for access \nto their own checking account. That is what they were doing. At least \nthat is what they were proposing.\n  Can you imagine the big banks ever changing course like this a few \nyears ago? Not a chance. But through reasonable regulation and \nconsumers standing up and being alert, we are restoring transparency \nand competition to financial services.\n  Transparency and competition are part of a good, functioning, free \nmarket economy. It is not over by a long shot. The big banks still have \nenormous power and resources. They are going to continue to try to find \nways to make money at the expense of their customers, and that is why \nwe need to do several things.\n  First, we need to confirm once and for all a Director for the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. I know Wall Street banks and \nfinancial institutions and many on the other side of the aisle hate \nthis new Bureau, as Dale Bumpers used to say, like the Devil hates holy \nwater. But the fact is, this is an agency solely dedicated to ensuring \nthat consumers have good information so they can make good choices. \nSenate Republicans should lift their hold on Richard Cordray so he can \nbe confirmed to run this important agency. They should stop doing the \nbidding of the financial institutions who are afraid of oversight and \nstand on the side of families and small businesses across America.\n\n  Second, we need to ensure transparency of all bank fees so consumers \ncannot be tricked and trapped. This is the role the CFPB will \neventually play. But there is no need for banks to wait to provide this \ntransparency. For example, the Pew Charitable Trusts has developed an \neasy-to-read, one-page model disclosure for banks to list all of the \nfees they can charge on checking accounts. Banks should immediately \nadopt this Pew Trust disclosure box so their Web sites are clear to \nconsumers and consumers can actually comparison shop and choose the \nbank that best serves their needs. This type of standardized fee \ntransparency will help drive consumer business to the good banks, those \nthat play by the rules and offer a good value at a reasonable price.\n  Third, we have more work to do to bring transparency and competition \nto the swipe fee system. For example, credit card swipe fees are still \nentirely unregulated, and they can cost a merchant up to 3 to 4 percent \nof the transaction amount. Every American should be aware of what it \ncosts a merchant to accept a credit card because ultimately the \nconsumers pay for it.\n  Consumers should particularly be aware of how much their local small \nbusinesses pay in credit card interchange. They should also know how \nmuch more rewards cards cost merchants than nonrewards cards. This will \nhelp consumers make more informed choices.\n  If we are for competition and for transparency and for choice, we \nhave to move to a level where consumers have more information. So I \ncall on the Nation's biggest 1 percent of banks, those with over $10 \nbillion in assets, to disclose in their monthly statements of their \ncardholders the interchange fees the banks received on each credit card \ntransaction.\n  While it would be ideal for this interchange disclosure to be made \nknown to customers directly at the cash register or on receipts, I \nrecognize that might be difficult. So let's do it on the monthly \nstatement. Big banks can easily modify these monthly statements to show \nhow much the bank received in interchange fees on each transaction. \nThis can happen almost immediately.\n  This type of transparency is particularly important because we are \nseeing big banks trying to steer their customers away from paying with \ndebit and toward credit. Have you noticed the ads that are offering \nrebates on credit cards now; 1 percent, 2 percent, even 3 percent on \ngasoline? What customers may not realize is that the fee being charged \nby the credit card company and the bank to the gas station may be far \nin excess of 3 percent. So they have already taken the money away from \nconsumers as they pay for their gas, and then they toss three pennies \nback to them.\n  It is time for a little more disclosure about the actual relationship \nbetween those banks, credit card companies, and the consumers and \nretailers that deal with them.\n  In closing, I do believe we are at a tipping point when it comes to \nthe balance between Wall Street and Main Street. For too long Main \nStreet businesses and consumers have been playing by the rules, and \nWall Street has been rigging the game. Now transparency and competition \nare being restored to the banking industry.\n  A member of my staff was down in Georgia over the weekend. He drove \nby and saw a little bank called Bank of the Ozarks. I do not know what \nit was doing in Georgia, but it said Bank of the Ozarks. It had a sign \noutside that said: We agree. Debit cards should be free.\n  The word is spreading across America. It is an important word to \nwhich consumers are paying attention. We are seeing dramatic increases \nin the Web sites of credit unions and community banks, people \ntransferring their money to where they think they will get better \ntreatment and a better deal. It is called competition. Transparency and \ncompetition are coming to the banking industry. Consumers are getting \nbetter information, and many of them are making important choices for \ntheir families and businesses.\n  This is going to strengthen small banks and credit unions in Iowa, in \nIllinois and Connecticut, and many places all around America. It will \nhelp small businesses in Iowa, too, as well as Illinois, who are being \ncrushed by hidden swipe fees today. It is going to help the economy \nmove forward in a fair way with real disclosure.\n  Let's keep this progress moving. I salute those who stood with me on \na bipartisan vote on both occasions on the Senate floor to move forward \non this important matter. Just a few weeks ago, major publications such \nas the Wall Street Journal and the Chicago Tribune were jumping all \nover the ``Durbin fee,'' and they were standing by the big banks that \nsaid they were going to put this monthly fee on because of Durbin.\n  Guess what. Those banks are backing off now. They realize their \ncustomers are leaving if they are not treated properly and fairly. \nLet's continue that. It is healthy for America and the growth of our \neconomy.\n  I yield the floor. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/31/senate-section/article/S6904-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Higginson, of \nLouisiana, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 1 hour \nof debate, equally divided and controlled in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate will finally vote on the \nnomination of Stephen Higginson of Louisiana to fill a vacancy on the \nFifth Circuit\n\n[[Page S6905]]\n\nwhich has been a judicial emergency for more than a year. I anticipate \nhis nomination, which was reported unanimously by the Judiciary \nCommittee more than 3\\1/2\\ months ago on July 14, will be confirmed \noverwhelmingly. It would have been confirmed had it been considered \nbefore the August recess, rather than subjected to an extensive and \nunexplained delay. I hope that the Senate will can build on today's \nvote by soon having up or down votes on the other 22 superbly qualified \njudicial nominations pending on the Senate calendar. At a time when \njudicial vacancies have remained at historically high levels for well \nover 2\\1/2\\ years, we owe it to the American people to work together to \nensure that the Federal courts are functioning.\n  Stephen Higginson is a well-respected consensus nominee who has \nserved as a Federal prosecutor for 23 years. He served as a law clerk \nto Justice Byron White of the United States Supreme Court and to Chief \nJudge Patricia Wald of the DC Circuit. He currently teaches law at the \nNew Orleans College of Law. The American Bar Association's Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Professor \nHigginson ``well qualified'' to serve on the Fifth Circuit, its highest \npossible rating. The two Senators from Louisiana, Democratic Senator \nMary Landrieu and Republican Senator David Vitter, support his \nnomination. When Senator Vitter introduced Mr. Higginson to the \nJudiciary Committee in early June, he joined with Senator Landrieu ``in \nbeing extremely enthusiastic'' about the nomination and said that he \n``wholeheartedly support[s]'' the nomination, saying of the nominee:\n\n       He has unbelievable academic and intellectual credentials \n     that are unquestioned . . . He [has] won the respect of \n     everyone in the community based on his work ethic, and his \n     honesty, and his integrity, and his dedication to the job.\n\n  In the past, such a nominee would go sailing through and not have to \nwait week after week, month after month after month. Yet despite the \nstrong endorsement by both his Democratic and Republican home State \nSenators and the support of every Democrat and every Republican on the \nCommittee, Mr. Higginson's nomination has been stalled for months by \nRepublican leadership. The people of Louisiana and the other States of \nthe Fifth Circuit--Mississippi and Texas--deserve an explanation for \nthese unnecessary delays. So do the 161 million Americans who live in \ndistricts or circuits who have judicial vacancies that could be filled \ntoday if the Senate Republicans agreed to vote on the other 22 \nnominations that were reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee and \nare ready for a Senate vote. We have done our work in the Judiciary \nCommittee. We have held hearings on these nominees. We have vetted \nthem. We have gone through FBI reports and Bar Association reports. We \nhave debated the nominations, and we have voted on them. We have sent \nthe nominations to the Senate floor, and they have been languishing \never since.\n  The needless delays in our confirmation process are affecting \nmillions of Americans around the country. As shown in this chart I have \nin the Senate Chamber, more than half of all Americans--161 million--\nlive in districts or circuits with a judicial vacancy that could be \nfilled today if the Senate Republicans agreed to vote on the \nnominations currently pending on the Executive Calendar. Twenty-four \nStates are served by Federal courts with vacancies that could be filled \nimmediately if Republicans would agree to vote on the judicial \nnominations already reported by the Judiciary Committee. Judicial \nvacancies in the Second Circuit, which includes Vermont, New York, and \nConnecticut, the Fifth Circuit, which includes Louisiana, Texas, and \nMississippi, the Ninth Circuit, which includes California, Alaska, \nNevada, Arizona, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Washington, and Hawaii, and \nthe Eleventh Circuit, which includes Florida, Georgia, and Alabama, \nhave been designated ``judicial emergencies'' by the Administrative \nOffice of the United States Courts. So have vacancies on district \ncourts in New York, Texas, and Utah.\n  I would hope my friends on the other side of the aisle would explain \nto the millions of Americans in these States why the Senate is not \nbeing allowed to vote on these vacancies, especially for the consensus \nnominees who have been vetted and approved by a bipartisan majority--\nusually unanimously--in the Judiciary Committee.\n  The American people need functioning Federal courts with judges, not \nvacancies. Despite the damaging number of vacancies that have persisted \nthroughout President Obama's term, some Republican Senators have tried \nto excuse their delay in taking up nominations by suggesting that the \nSenate is doing better than we did during the first 3 years of \nPresident Bush's administration. It is true that President Obama is \ndoing better in that he has worked more closely with home State \nSenators of both parties. As I have noted, all of the judicial nominees \npending and being stalled on the Senate Executive Calendar have the \nsupport of both home State Senators. That was not true of President \nBush's nominees and led to many problems.\n  There is no good reason or explanation for the Republican \nleadership's continued refusal to vote on these stalled nominations. \nSenator Grassley and I have worked together to ensure that each of the \n23 nominations now on the Senate calendar was fully considered by the \nJudiciary Committee after a thorough and fair process, including \ncompleting our extensive questionnaire and questioning at a hearing. \nLike Mr. Higginson, the other 22 nominees who are awaiting final Senate \naction are qualified nominees, and 19 were reported unanimously by the \ncommittee. Yet despite their qualifications and broad bipartisan \nsupport, many have languished needlessly on the Executive Calendar for \nweeks.\n  These delays are not only unnecessary, they are damaging. The number \nof judicial vacancies remains at historic levels, having risen above 90 \nin August 2009, and staying near or above that level ever since. The \nnumber of vacancies is twice as high as it was at this point in \nPresident Bush's first term, when the Senate was expeditiously voting \non consensus judicial nominations. With 1 in 10 Federal judgeships \ncurrently vacant, the Senate must come together to address the serious \njudicial vacancies crisis on Federal courts throughout the country. \nBill Robinson, the president of the American Bar Association, recently \nhighlighted the serious problems for businesses and individuals \naffected by these excessive vacancies in a letter to the Senate \nleaders, joining Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and Chief Justice \nRoberts in warning of the serious problems created by persistent \njudicial vacancies.\n  The only way to make progress is to fulfill our constitutional duty \nand confirm qualified judicial nominations to the Federal bench. We \nremain well behind the pace we set in dramatically reducing vacancies \nby regularly scheduling votes during President George W. Bush's first \nterm. At this point in President Bush's first term, the Senate had \nconfirmed 166 of his nominees for the Federal circuit and district \ncourts, including 100 during the 17 months that I was chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee. In contrast, after today's vote, we will have \nconfirmed only 113 of President Obama's nominees to Federal circuit and \ndistrict courts. Three years into President Bush's first term, the \nSenate had confirmed 29 circuit judges. After today's vote, we will \nhave confirmed only 22 of President Obama's circuit court nominees. We \ncould make significant progress toward matching that pace if we voted \non consensus nominees. Yet President Obama's judicial nominees \nunanimously reported by the Judiciary Committee--by any measure \nconsensus nominees--have waited an average of 80 days--nearly 3 \nmonths--on the Executive Calendar before coming to a vote. President \nBush's nominees waited an average of just 28 days. We must bring an end \nto the needless delays that have obstructed President Obama's \nnominations to the Federal bench.\n\n  During the last work period, the Senate started to make some progress \nin voting on some of President Obama's longest pending judicial \nnominees. I thank Majority Leader Reid for working hard to schedule \nthese votes. I hope we can build on this progress by continuing to have \nvotes during this work period on consensus nominations. There is no \nreason we could not vote today on the nominations of Chris Droney of \nConnecticut to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the Second Circuit, \nMorgan Christen of Alaska to fill\n\n[[Page S6906]]\n\na judicial emergency vacancy on the Ninth Circuit, and Adalberto Jordan \nof Florida to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the Eleventh \nCircuit. Like Mr. Higginson, these nominations were all reported \nunanimously. The circuits to which they are nominated desperately need \njudges: the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals alone has four vacancies, \nworsening what the Los Angeles Times has recently called ``an already \ncritical case backlog'' on that court, which is the largest circuit \ncourt in the country, covering California and all of the Western \nStates. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the LA Times \narticle be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. I hope the 22 judicial nominations pending after today \nwill get a vote soon. We have a long way to go to match the 205 \ndistrict and circuit court nominations confirmed during President \nBush's first term.\n  With millions of Americans currently affected by judicial vacancies \nthat the Senate could fill today, now is the time for Republicans and \nDemocrats to work together so that our courts can better serve the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Oct. 15, 2011]\n\n               Judges' Deaths Add to 9th Circuit Backlog\n\n                         (By Carol J. Williams)\n\n       Five judges from the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals have \n     died this year, worsening an already critical case backlog \n     and spotlighting President Obama's inability to put his \n     judicial choices and stamp on the powerful court.\n       The deaths of four semi-retired senior jurists and full-\n     time Circuit Judge Pamela Ann Rymer have intensified concerns \n     on the aging bench and among judicial scholars that the 9th \n     Circuit will fall farther behind in what is already the \n     slowest pace of dispensing justice in the federal courts.\n       Judges of the 9th Circuit currently sit on twice the number \n     of cases each year as those of the other 12 federal appeals \n     courts, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. \n     Courts. And it takes an average of 16.3 months for the \n     court's panels to issue opinions after an appeal is filed, \n     compared with 11.7 months on average for all circuits. The \n     9th Circuit has jurisdiction over California and eight other \n     Western states and is authorized to have 29 full-time \n     jurists.\n       ``While we mourn the loss of our colleagues, whom we will \n     miss as friends, we are alarmed by the loss of judicial \n     manpower,'' said 9th Circuit Chief Judge Alex Kozinski, who \n     was appointed to the court by President Reagan. ``A very \n     difficult situation has been seriously exacerbated, and we \n     fear that the public will suffer unless our vacancies are \n     filled very promptly.''\n       The 9th Circuit is an especially important court because it \n     helps to define many of the nation's laws on immigration, \n     sentencing, intellectual property and civil rights, experts \n     say.\n       Obama inherited two 9th Circuit vacancies with his \n     inauguration. Two jurists retired last year. Rymer's Sept. 21 \n     death from cancer created another vacancy. Another vacancy \n     looms at the end of the year, when former Chief Judge Mary M. \n     Schroeder plans to take senior status.\n       Obama has managed to get only one of his picks for the 9th \n     Circuit confirmed by the Senate. He elevated U.S. District \n     Judge Mary H. Murguia in 2010 from the Arizona federal court, \n     leaving that bench with its own manpower crisis after its \n     chief judge, John M. Roll, was killed in the Jan. 8 shooting \n     rampage in Tucson.\n       Obama's other appeals court nominations, Alaska Supreme \n     Court Justice Morgan Christen and U.S. District Judge \n     Jacqueline H. Nguyen of Los Angeles, are still making their \n     way through the contentious confirmation process. Christen \n     was nominated in May and Nguyen was nominated last month. \n     Obama has yet to name anyone for the other three 9th Circuit \n     vacancies, including one that has been open for seven years \n     because of a dispute between California and Idaho senators \n     over which state gets to propose candidates to the White \n     House. Nationally, Obama nominations are pending in 51 of 92 \n     vacancies.\n       Some judicial scholars speculate that Obama may be having \n     trouble convincing those he would like to appoint to accept \n     nominations for fear of derailing their legal careers only to \n     be rejected by partisan fights in the Senate. Goodwin Liu, a \n     UC Berkeley law professor twice nominated by Obama, was \n     forced to withdraw earlier this year when Senate Republicans \n     again blocked a confirmation vote.\n       ``What we know is that the nominations haven't been coming \n     through with the speed we would expect. What we don't know is \n     whether that is because the president is not asking people or \n     whether he is being turned down,'' said Arthur Hellman, a \n     University of Pittsburgh law professor and 9th Circuit \n     historian. Citing the relatively low pay compared with what a \n     lawyer can make in private practice and the often withering \n     interrogations in the confirmation process, he said, ``some \n     may be saying it's just not worth it.''\n       Hellman worries that the overwhelmed 9th Circuit judges \n     will have to cut corners to prevent their case backlog from \n     further increasing. That could mean less time spent reviewing \n     each case, holding fewer oral arguments before issuing \n     decisions or bringing in judges from other circuits who might \n     be unfamiliar with 9th Circuit law.\n       A call to the White House press office asking why Obama has \n     not nominated more judges wasn't answered Thursday. Earlier \n     in the day, at a session of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \n     its Democratic chairman blamed Republicans for stalling \n     judicial appointments by refusing to give consent for \n     confirmation votes even on candidates voted out of committee \n     with unanimous support.\n       ``Millions of Americans across the country are harmed by \n     delays in overburdened courts,'' said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy \n     (D-Vt.). ``The Republican leadership should explain to the \n     American people why they will not consent to vote on the \n     qualified, consensus candidates nominated to fill these \n     extended judicial vacancies.''\n       The committee's ranking member, Sen. Charles E. Grassley \n     (R-Iowa), countered with a claim that the Senate is ``ahead \n     of the pace'' compared with the confirmation rate of the \n     Democratic-controlled Congress during the Bush \n     administration. His comment followed Thursday's confirmation \n     vote on three of 30 Obama judicial nominations that \n     Republicans agreed to bring to a vote.\n       Even if Obama acts quickly to nominate three more 9th \n     Circuit judges, the impending 2012 campaign could thwart \n     Senate approval of those choices, said Michael McConnell, a \n     Stanford law professor and former judge on the 10th Circuit.\n       Russell Wheeler, a Brookings Institution fellow and veteran \n     analyst of the federal courts, said Obama is entering \n     ``uncharted territory'' with the 9th Circuit vacancies \n     occurring so late in his term.\n       Noting that Bush got Senate confirmation of 35 federal \n     judges in the last 15 months before his 2004 reelection bid, \n     Wheeler said, ``I doubt Obama will do as well, but \n     confirmations are not going to stop altogether.''\n       Some judicial analysts also lament that the administration \n     hasn't pushed Congress to expand the federal judiciary, as \n     recommended for more than a decade by the Judicial Conference \n     of the United States. That policymaking body of the federal \n     courts has said the 9th Circuit needs at least five more \n     judges added to its authorized 29 to alleviate its annual \n     caseload of 12,000-plus filings.\n       The announcement Tuesday that senior Circuit Judge Robert \n     Boochever died at his Pasadena home on Sunday was a sharp \n     reminder of the advancing age of the 9th Circuit bench that \n     relies on its purportedly retired seniors to shoulder much of \n     the case overload. Fifteen of the court's judges are over 80, \n     including two of the 25 active judges and 13 of its 18 \n     seniors. Last year, a third of the court's caseload was \n     carried by senior judges.\n       Since criminal appeals can't be delayed because of federal \n     laws protecting defendants' rights, the burden of delays will \n     fall on civil cases, said Kozinski.\n       ``We can ameliorate some of that by relying more heavily on \n     visiting judges, but we're already doing that quite a bit,'' \n     he said, adding that the help available from outside is \n     finite. ``Essentially, it's a zero-sum game, so that when you \n     decrease the number of judges available in the federal \n     system, you necessarily add more delay somewhere. Shifting \n     judges around can help even out the burden, but it can't make \n     up for judges that just aren't there.''\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on the \nnomination of Stephen A. Higginson to serve as U.S. circuit judge for \nthe Fifth Circuit. This is a seat that has been deemed by our \nstatistics as a ``judicial emergency.'' This is the 15th judicial \nnomination we will confirm this month. With this vote today we have \nconfirmed 51 article III judicial nominees during this Congress, and 30 \nof those confirmations have been for judicial emergencies.\n  Despite this brisk level of activity, we continue to hear \ncomplaints--too many complaints, unjustified complaints--about the lack \nof real progress by the Senate.\n  Let me set the record straight regarding the real progress the Senate \nhas made, and this is in regard to President Obama's judicial nominees. \nWe have taken positive action on 87 percent of the judicial nominations \nsubmitted before this Congress. The Senate has confirmed 71 percent of \nPresident Obama's nominees since the beginning of his Presidency, \nincluding two of the most important--Supreme Court Justices.\n  We continue to remain ahead of the pace set forth in the 108th \nCongress under President Bush. So far, we have held hearings on 85 \npercent of President Obama's judicial nominees. That is compared to \nonly 79 percent at this point in President Bush's Presidency. I\n\n[[Page S6907]]\n\nnote that we have another nomination hearing scheduled in the Judiciary \nCommittee on Wednesday of this week. We have also reported 76 percent \nof the judicial nominees received so far this Congress, with five more \nscheduled for consideration on Thursday of this week. A comparable 75 \npercent were reported at this time in the 108th Congress.\n  Critics may dismiss the activity we have accomplished in committee as \nnot making real progress. But everyone knows that no votes can take \nplace on the Senate floor until committee action is complete, and that \ncompletion must include hearings as well as markups.\n  Furthermore, when it comes to floor action, we are making real \nprogress as well. We are well ahead in this session of the confirmation \npace of previous sessions of Congress. As I mentioned, after this vote, \nwe will have confirmed 51 judicial nominees during this session of \nCongress. I point out that this exceeds the average number of judicial \nconfirmations going back to the 1st session of the 97th Congress. That \nsession was the beginning of President Reagan's first term in 1981. The \naverage since then is 44 judicial confirmations per session. This puts \nthe current session of Congress in the top 10 over the past 30 years. \nThis means that during this session, President Obama has had better \nresults with his judicial nominees than President Reagan had in seven \nsessions of Congress. It is more confirmed in five of the eight \nsessions of Congress during President Clinton's administration. \nPresident George W. Bush had six sessions of Congress with fewer \nnominees confirmed.\n  So I hope these statistics--as boring as they are--will put to rest \ninsinuations that there is something that is somehow different about \nthis President or that he is being treated unfairly because those sorts \nof comments do not hold up to analysis.\n  To support the ``lack of real progress''--those are the words we keep \nhearing--some would argue that the only valid measure of progress is \nhow quickly a nominee is confirmed after being reported out of \ncommittee. That is only one piece of the confirmation process. Hearings \nand markups in committee are also necessary components. To ignore those \nelements distorts the picture.\n  I want to give you an example involving today's nominee, the one we \nwill be voting on in less than half an hour. Mr. Higginson was \nnominated May 9 of this year. He had his hearing 30 days later. The \ntotal time from nomination to confirmation was 175 days. Compare this \nto the record of the nomination of Edith Brown Clement. She was the \nnominee of President Bush to be U.S. circuit judge for the Fifth \nCircuit. Like Mr. Higginson, she, too, was from Louisiana. May 9, 2001, \nwas the first day of her nomination, and because it wasn't handled \nright away, it had to be returned to the President during the August \nrecess of that year. And, of course, a month later, on September 4, \n2001, she was renominated. Compare this length of time involving Judge \nClement with the nominee today. As I said, she was renominated on \nSeptember 4. She had to wait 148 days for her hearing. The total time \nfrom initial nomination to confirmation was 188 days. That is nearly 2 \nweeks longer than Mr. Higginson's confirmation wait.\n  This is just one example of how cherry-picking one piece of the \nconfirmation process over another can lead to unfounded conclusions. If \none argues that Mr. Higginson has been treated unfairly because of how \nlong he waited for confirmation, then certainly Judge Clement was \ntreated even worse. I note that Judge Clement was approved by the \ncommittee on a unanimous vote and confirmed on the floor of the Senate \non a 99-to-0 vote.\n  Let's get to the present nominee. I support the nomination of Mr. \nHigginson. He received his bachelor of arts degree from Harvard \nCollege, summa cum laude, in 1983 and juris doctorate from Yale Law \nSchool in 1987. Upon graduating from law school, he served as a law \nclerk for Chief Judge Patricia Wald, U.S. Court of Appeals, DC Circuit. \nHe then clerked at the Supreme Court for Associate Justice Byron White.\n  Since these clerkships, Mr. Higginson has served as an assistant U.S. \nattorney. From 1989 to 1993, he served in the U.S. Attorney's Office in \nthe District of Massachusetts. In 1993, he transferred to the Eastern \nDistrict of Louisiana, continuing with criminal trial work, and became \nchief of appeals in 1995. From 1997 through 1998, he was detailed by \nthe Department of Justice to work for the U.S. Department of State as \nDeputy Director of the Presidential Rule of Law Initiative. In 2004, he \nbecame a part-time assistant attorney general while serving as a full-\ntime associate professor of law at Loyola University New Orleans \nCollege of Law.\n  The American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary has rated Mr. Higginson with a unanimous ``well qualified.''\n  I intend to vote for his nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I understand we have about 4 minutes on \nour side. I thank my colleague, Senator Grassley, for his kind words of \nsupport.\n  I have strong words of support for the nomination before the Senate \ntoday. I rise to support the confirmation of Stephen Higginson to the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. I was pleased to recommend \nMr. Higginson to President Obama to be considered for this nomination \nto this important post. I am pleased to be joined by my colleague from \nLouisiana, who also supports this nomination and supports this \nconfirmation.\n  I want to take just a moment to share with my colleagues a few \nhighlights of Mr. Higginson's background and resume.\n  He has been well prepared for this position. He has resided in New \nOrleans with his wife Colette and their three children, Christopher, \nKaty, and Noelle. Prior to that, he began with a degree from Harvard, \ngraduating summa cum laude. After graduating there, he earned a \nmaster's in philosophy--which is unusual but very welcomed in this \nfield--from Cambridge University. He went as a Harvard Scholar. With \ndegrees from two very prestigious institutions, he decided to pursue \nhis J.D. from Yale Law School, where he graduated 3 years later. He \nearned the extraordinary distinction of being both editor-in-chief of \nthe Yale Law Review and the winner of the Israel H. Perez prize for the \nbest written contribution to the Law Review. After graduating from \nanother prestigious school--Yale--he served as law clerk to the \nHonorable Patricia M. Wald of the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District \nof Columbia. He also served as law clerk to the Honorable Byron White \nof the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n  Clearly, his academic and professional accomplishments have prepared \nhim to handle the legal complexities of Federal appellate cases.\n  All of these things have been put into context beautifully by \ncomments from the judges with whom he will serve should he be confirmed \ntoday by the Senate. Other justices on the court, including Judge James \nDennis of the Fifth Circuit, described him this way:\n\n       Stephen has all the qualities one needs to become a great \n     judge and great colleague. He will be a great addition to our \n     court, and I look forward to serving with him.\n\n  Another Fifth Circuit judge, Judge Edith Clement Brown, called Mr. \nHigginson ``the best criminal lawyer that has ever practiced before me \nin all of my 20 years serving on the Federal bench.''\n  Finally, from the man he will succeed should he be confirmed, Judge \nJack Weiner, who took senior status last year, said this:\n\n       I have long admired Stephen Higginson's advocacy here in \n     the Eastern District, his scholarship as a law professor, his \n     outstanding academic record at Harvard and Yale Law School, \n     and as an exemplary citizen here in New Orleans. I am \n     distinctly honored to have him succeed to my seat on this \n     court, and I'm confident that he will discharge the duties of \n     the U.S. Circuit Court Judge fairly, conscientiously, and \n     honorably.\n\n  With my strongest recommendation, I ask my colleagues in the Senate \nto vote with me in approving this nominee today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise and am honored to join my colleague \nfrom Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, as well as others, including Senators \nLeahy and Grassley, in strongly supporting this nomination. It is a \nvery strong nomination.\n\n[[Page S6908]]\n\n  First of all, let me say that I am very happy to work in a very close \nfashion with Senator Landrieu on all of the judicial nominations in \nLouisiana under President Obama. I have to say that work and that \ncooperation has gone more smoothly, with better results, than I could \never have imagined. So I am very pleased with that entire process.\n  This nomination of Stephen Higginson is perhaps the strongest, most \nshining example of that. Senator Landrieu and I worked very closely \ntogether. We were very focused on this important Fifth Circuit \nnomination. Quite frankly, we were both concerned about someone whom \nthe White House was looking closely at for the nomination. We both, \ntogether, expressed that concern. And then we both very much supported \nthis nomination of Stephen Higginson.\n  Senator Landrieu, through a process she set up independently, \nsuggested Steve Higginson as a nominee, and I very immediately and \npassionately and strongly chimed in. We did this because this is a \nhighly qualified individual who will make nothing less than a great \njudge.\n  As has been mentioned, Steve has a sterling record in many different \nfacets. He is an associate law professor at Loyola Law School, where he \nhas received great admiration from both his fellow professors, \ncolleagues, and his students. He has served for about two decades as a \nFederal prosecutor in various offices of the U.S. Attorney, mostly the \nU.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana, since 1993.\n\n  During this time in Louisiana, Steve has handled multiple \ninvestigations and criminal trials--first at the trial level, then at \nthe appellate level--and he has supervised both criminal and civil \nappeals. In this role, he has authored over 100 Federal appellate \nbriefs and he has reviewed more than 300 appellate briefs authored by \nothers. Of course, that is very directly relevant to this job on the \nU.S. Fifth Circuit.\n  This work, and the entire work of this U.S. Attorney's Office, has \nbeen extremely important for the citizens of Louisiana in at least two \nrespects. First of all, this U.S. Attorney's Office--led by current \nU.S. Attorney Jim Letten, a career prosecutor, initially appointed by \nPresident Bush and kept on by President Obama--has made enormously \nimportant strides in cleaning up political corruption in Louisiana with \nseveral landmark prosecutions, and Steve Higginson has been an \nimportant part of many of those landmark prosecutions.\n  Second, in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, this U.S. \nAttorney's Office, headed by Jim Letten and aided very much by Steve \nHigginson, was extremely instrumental in helping local prosecutors and \nlocal law enforcement recover from the blows of Hurricane Katrina, get \nback on their feet and move forward with important criminal \nprosecutions.\n  A U.S. attorney's office is always important to a community, but I \npoint out these two ways in which Steve Higginson's work under U.S. \nAttorney Jim Letten has been particularly significant for the citizens \nof the Greater New Orleans area.\n  Steve came very well prepared for all of this work. As was mentioned, \nhe has an exemplary academic career, including editor-in-chief of the \nYale Law Journal, which is no small feat. He also served as law clerk \nto Supreme Court Justice Byron White. His work in the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice has also been recognized in a myriad of ways.\n  He has gotten many awards, so I will just mention one or two--for \ninstance, the Excellence in Law Enforcement Award from the New Orleans \nMetropolitan Crime Commission, again focusing on that very important \nanticorruption work and post-Katrina work. At Loyola Law School, as I \nmentioned before, Steve has been recognized and lauded by his \ncolleagues on the faculty, his peers, and by his students. In fact, \nfrom his students he has won Loyola's Professor of the Year Award three \ntimes in just a few years.\n  Steve will bring a wealth of public experience to the Federal bench \nand is exceptionally qualified to serve there.\n  I believe the Constitution is very clear that judges must interpret \nthe law and not legislate from the bench, and I think our most solemn \nresponsibility in terms of confirming Federal judges is to make sure we \nconfirm judges who respect that rule of law and who live by that rule \nof judicial restraint. I am confident Steve Higginson will be such a \njudge. So, again, I am very pleased to join my colleague from \nLouisiana, Senator Landrieu, and to join many others in a very \nbipartisan way, including the chair of the committee, Senator Leahy, \nand the ranking member, Senator Grassley, in strongly endorsing and \nsupporting the nomination of Steve Higginson to join the Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             The CLASS Act\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on Friday a week ago, the Secretary of \nHHS made a very important announcement regarding one specific provision \nof the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Secretary Sebelius \nannounced the administration would no longer be implementing the \nCommunity Living Assistance Services and Support Act. The acronym CLASS \napplies to that part of the health care bill. She said:\n\n       When it became clear that the most basic benefit plans \n     wouldn't work, we looked at other possibilities. Recognizing \n     the enormous need in this country for better long-term care \n     insurance options, we cast as wide a net as possible in \n     searching for a model that could succeed. But as a report our \n     department is releasing today shows, we have not identified a \n     way to make CLASS work at this time.\n\n  This is not an ``I told you so'' speech, although it certainly could \nbe. It isn't as though folks weren't raising significant concerns about \nthe CLASS Act a long time before it ever passed. Two years ago, during \nthe debate, Member after Member of the Senate came to the floor to \nargue the CLASS Act was destined to fail. Senator Thune led the fight \nto raise awareness about the fiscal disaster the CLASS Act has now \nturned out to be. The Democratic chairman of the Budget Committee \ncalled it a ``Ponzi scheme.'' The Democratic chairman of the Finance \nCommittee stated on the floor that he was ``no friend of the CLASS \nAct.''\n  When the Senate took a vote on the CLASS Act, 51 Senators, including \n12 Democrats, voted to strip it from the legislation. The majority \ndidn't rule that day because an agreement required 60 votes to strip it \nout.\n  I think special recognition should go to former Senator Judd Gregg of \nNew Hampshire. As ranking member of the Budget Committee while in the \nSenate, and a senior member of the HELP Committee, he was deeply \nconcerned about the ultimate cost of the CLASS Act on future \ngenerations. He led an amendment to require the CLASS Act be \nactuarially sound. He did so not because he wanted to improve the CLASS \nAct but because he wanted to make clear the CLASS Act could not work \nfrom a fiscal standpoint.\n  His amendment showed that, once implemented, the CLASS Act would take \nin revenues in early years and then begin to lose revenues in the \noutyears, ultimately either failing or requiring a massive bailout with \ntaxpayer money to salvage the program. In a strange twist of budget \nscoring rules, his amendment, once accepted, led the Congressional \nBudget Office to score the CLASS Act as producing savings on paper in \nthe short term.\n  The score made clear the CLASS Act was doomed to failure, but as only \nhappens here in Washington, a score showing the obvious failure of the \nCLASS Act then became an asset, particularly an asset because the \nDemocratic leadership wanted to show this bill was revenue neutral or \neven revenue positive. It was used by the Democratic leadership not for \nwhat it provided beneficiaries but what it did for the overall health \ncare reform bill.\n\n  With the CLASS Act and some imaginary savings in the bill, it made \nthe overall bill look as if it actually saved money. Those savings, of \ncourse, were a gimmick. Everyone in Congress knew\n\n[[Page S6909]]\n\nit, but some chose to ignore it or, worse still, to celebrate it.\n  The very first action on the floor for the Affordable Care Act was \nfor the majority leader to ask unanimous consent to prevent amendments \nfrom spending the imaginary savings--and I emphasize imaginary \nsavings--generated by the CLASS Act. It wasn't a motion to protect the \nCLASS Act itself but a cynical motion to protect its precious \n``savings'' and the political value it had. Only in Washington, with \noverwhelming evidence on the table making clear a program would fail, \nwould defense of the doomed CLASS Act become a virtue.\n  The Chief Actuary at CMS stated:\n\n       There is a very serious risk that the problem of adverse \n     selection would make the CLASS program unsustainable.\n\n  The risks were known then, yet Democrats in Congress plowed ahead \nanyway. Why, you may ask. Well, Megan McArdle noted in the Atlantic on \nMonday:\n\n       The problems with CLASS were known from day one, but no one \n     listened, because it gave them good numbers to sell their \n     program politically.\n\n  And it wasn't just political cover. The imaginary savings gave them \nprotection against potential budget points of order. Would the Senate-\npassed bill have been subject to a budget point of order without the \nimaginary CLASS Act savings in the bill? That is a very legitimate \nquestion.\n  The announcement by the Secretary of HHS provides an overdue \nvindication for Senator Gregg. His amendment made the announcement \ninevitable. Health and Human Services could not make a viable case for \nimplementing the CLASS Act because of Senator Gregg's amendment \nrequiring the CLASS Act to be actuarially sustainable.\n  Our next action is clear. Congress should repeal the CLASS Act. It \nwas not in the House health care reform bill. A majority of the Senate \nvoted to strip the CLASS Act from the Senate bill. It was passed under \nlaughably false pretenses. The responsible action for Congress is to \nrepeal it in the first relevant piece of legislation.\n  I take a back seat to no one on issues associated with improving the \nlives of seniors and the disabled. As ranking member of the Aging \nCommittee, I oversaw critical hearings into deep and persistent \nproblems in our Nation's nursing homes. I was the principal author of \nthe Medicare Part D prescription drug bill, which is currently \nproviding our seniors and people with disabilities with affordable \nprescription medications.\n  On the disability front, one of my proudest achievements is the \nenactment of legislation I sponsored, along with the late Senator Ted \nKennedy--the Family Opportunity Act--which extends Medicaid coverage to \ndisabled children. In large part through my efforts, the Money Follows \nthe Person Rebalancing Act and the option for States to implement a \nhome- and community-based services program were included in the Deficit \nReduction Act of 2005.\n  Along with Senator Kerry, I introduced the Empowered at Home Act \nwhich, among other things, revised the income eligibility level for \nhome- and community-based services for elderly and disabled \nindividuals.\n  This is what I said about the CLASS Act on December 4, 2009:\n\n       If I thought that the CLASS Act would add to this list of \n     improvements to the lives of seniors or the disabled, I would \n     be first in line as a proud cosponsor of the CLASS Act. But \n     the CLASS Act does not strengthen the safety net for seniors \n     and the disabled. The CLASS Act compounds the long-term \n     entitlement spending problems we already have by creating yet \n     another new unsustainable entitlement program. The CLASS Act \n     is just simply not viable in its current form.\n\n  That is the end of the quote I made on December 4, 2009, when that \nprovision of the health care reform bill was up.\n  But this is not an ``I told you so'' speech. No, Mr. President, I am \nhere because I am offended by the way this administration and \nproponents of health care reform have used the disability community \nthroughout the debate over the CLASS Act.\n  Congress and the administration knew the CLASS Act would fail when it \nwas being considered. The administration now somehow manages to treat \nthis as a shocking discovery, and the fact that they are doing that is \nbeyond me. But the way the administration has tried to soften the blow \nfor the disability community rubs me the wrong way, because in the \nSecretary's statement on the CLASS Act I referred to, the Secretary \nsaid this:\n\n       In fact, one of the main reasons we decided not to go ahead \n     with CLASS at this point is that we know no one would be hurt \n     more if CLASS started and failed than the people who had paid \n     into it and were counting on it the most. We can't let that \n     happen.\n\n  Of course, they could have opposed the inclusion of the legislation \nand told the disability community the exact same thing back in 2009. \nApparently, the administration is trying to tell the disability \ncommunity that even though HHS can't implement the statute, they don't \nwant to repeal it. Nicholas Pappas, a White House spokesman, said:\n\n       We do not support repeal. Repealing the CLASS Act isn't \n     necessary or productive. What we should be doing is working \n     together to address the long-term care challenges we face in \n     this country.\n\n  After putting the political value of the savings ahead of the doomed \npolicy, the administration finally admitted the CLASS Act was a \nfailure. They apologized to the disability community. They said they \ndon't support repeal of the CLASS Act.\n  After years of dodging reality, it is time for the President and the \nmajority party to treat the disability community respectfully and \nhonestly. If the President believes the CLASS Act can and should be \nsaved, he should put revisions on the table much as he threatened to in \nearly 2010 but never managed to.\n  Congress should weigh repeal of the CLASS Act against revisions that \ncould be proposed to make it a legitimate program. We should do so with \na full score--meaning from CBO--and in the context of our current \nfiscal climate with all our cards on the table, not the stealthy way it \nwas handled in 2009. We should have a healthy and open debate.\n  The insipid strategy of passing something into law with a wink and a \nnod toward making it all better in the future is unacceptable and \ndisrespectful to the disability community purported to be served by the \nlegislation.\n  Our course is clear. For those of us who care about the disability \npolicies, the days of ignoring reality must come to an end. We should \nrepeal the CLASS Act and move on to other legislation that gets the job \ndone in a fiscally responsible way.\n  I yield the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, I spoke on the Senate floor \nabout some of my concerns with the pending legislation that we have \nbeen talking about now--a number of appropriations bills--including the \ncommittee report on agriculture. The last time we visited about this, I \ntalked about the GIPSA rules. I wish to focus on one more area of \nconcern in this appropriations bill; that is, that the Department of \nAgriculture has proposed a rule to revise the nutrition requirements \nfor the National School Lunch and Breakfast Program.\n  In its current form, the rule contains some impractical nutrition \nstandards and goals. I don't think there is any question that all of us \nin the Senate, and certainly every parent I know, would want--we all \nwant our children to have nutritious food and we want them to have \nnutritious food at home and at school. That is not the point. It is not \nthe question. What I question is whether the Department of \nAgriculture's rule is realistic for schools, and for those who provide \nfood to the schools, whether they are able to comply with this new \nrule.\n  For example, as written, the rule would exclude many nutritious \nvegetables in school meal programs. Appropriately, the Senate adopted \nan amendment offered by Senator Collins of Maine, which I supported, \nthat allows school nutritionists to continue to make their own \nrecommendations based upon the most recent dietary guidelines for \nAmericans, rather than having to follow the mandates issued in this \nlatest USDA rule. In my view, that is exactly where these decisions \nshould be made: in schools around our country by nutritionists--not \nmandated by our government in Washington, DC.\n  Furthermore, we must keep in mind the impact this rule will have on \nschool budgets and food suppliers. Unfunded mandates such as this one \nwill make it even harder for schools to provide healthy lunches for \nstudents.\n  The Department of Agriculture estimates that the cost of compliance \nover a 5-year period will reach $6.8 billion. The Federal reimbursement \nalready does not cover the full cost of preparing a meal in many \nschools across our country. This new USDA rule will further drive up \nthe costs of providing lunches and school districts will have to make \nup the difference. This doesn't seem like a reasonable approach when \nmany school districts are already struggling to make ends meet.\n  Let me give an example of what is in this rule. Once finalized, \nschools would be required to reduce sodium content in breakfasts by up \nto 27 percent and school lunches by up to 54 percent. There are a \ncouple problems with this requirement. There is no suitable replacement \nfor sodium that can maintain the same functions of flavor and texture. \nAlso, reducing sodium is not just a function of limiting raw salt \ncontent. Many ingredients have sodium in them that occurs naturally.\n  School food suppliers have been working for years to reduce the \namount of sodium in their food products. However, they need additional \ntime to come up with a solution that balances nutritional value with \ntaste so kids will eat the school lunch.\n  This rule would also change how nutritional content is measured--\nrather than measure nutrition based on density, the Department of \nAgriculture rule proposes to measure nutritional content based on \nvolume. For example, tomato paste is nutritionally dense, but the \nDepartment of Agriculture says it must meet the same volume as a fresh \ntomato. That doesn't make much sense. Why would we take a metric to be \nthe arbitrary volume requirement instead of just measuring the \nnutritional value?\n  The bottom line is, kids can still get the right nutrients from food \nproducts if they are measured by nutritional content.\n  A more sensible approach to making sure children have healthy options \nfor breakfast and lunch would be to work together with scientists, \nnutritionists, and industry representatives toward a set of \nintermediate goals. Food costs, service operations, and student \nparticipation rates could then be more closely evaluated before moving \non to the next goal. This would give school districts and food \nsuppliers the chance to make changes in a more reasonable timeframe.\n  Our colleagues in the House included a provision in their version of \nthis legislation that directed the Department of Agriculture to issue a \nnew proposed rule that would not add unnecessary and costly regulations \nto the school lunch and breakfast programs. Unfortunately, this \nlanguage was not included in the Senate version of the bill. In \nconference, I will continue to work with my colleagues to make sure the \nDepartment of Agriculture is not making it harder for schools to \nprovide healthy lunches but instead is working alongside local schools \nand their officials to develop better nutritional goals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/31/senate-section/article/S6910-4", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6910-S6911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO MR. EMMETTE THOMPSON AND MISSION OF HOPE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nthe finest charitable organizations serving the people of Kentucky, \nMission of Hope, and its executive director, Mr. Emmette Thompson. \nMission of Hope, located in Knoxville, TN, has been providing the \nimpoverished children and families in the rural Appalachian communities \nof southeastern Kentucky and elsewhere with food, clothing, and other \nnecessities for over 15 years.\n  Mission of Hope was founded in 1966 in response to a television \nbroadcast entitled ``Hunger for Hope,'' in which anchor Bill Williams \ninformed viewers of the destitution and poverty that affected families \nin the mountains and hills of southeastern Kentucky. The ``Hunger for \nHope'' broadcast inspired founder Julie Holland to enlist the help of \nher church, Central Baptist of Bearden, to aid in handing out \nchildren's coats that had been donated by a local department store.\n  Since that first donation, Mission of Hope has grown to serve more \nthan 17,000 people throughout more than 80 schools and organizations in \nKentucky, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. Over 85 percent of the \npopulation in this region suffers from hunger and joblessness due to a \ndepleted coal mining economy.\n  Mission of Hope's objective is to provide, every year, the hunger-\nstricken families of Appalachia with hope and the chance at a better \nlife through evangelical Christian charitable ministries. By partnering \nwith school family-resource centers and small community ministries, \nMission of Hope is able to provide assistance to those children and \nfamilies most severely impoverished, and donates new clothes, food, \ntoys, and school supplies through organized programs and events.\n  In addition, Mission of Hope assists in the repairing of homes, and \nprovides a $2,500 scholarship to 11 qualified students from schools in \nthe region. They\n\n[[Page S6911]]\n\noperate basic health-care clinics thanks to the volunteer efforts of \nlocal medical professionals, and assist in the development of literacy \nand other skills in order to create new jobs.\n  Most importantly, however, the countless volunteers who work \ntirelessly to provide Mission of Hope's services receive the greatest \npossible reward for their efforts. The sense of gratitude that is \nvisible in thankful children's eyes is what motivates the volunteers \neach and every day, and it is the satisfaction from this ``personal \ntouch'' that drives the people of Mission of Hope and their cause.\n  ``What we do wouldn't work in today's business world,'' says Mr. \nEmmette Thompson, who is fundamental to the organization's success. \n``Our business model and the way we distribute our harvest wouldn't \nwork in corporate America because it defies logic . . . I'd love to \ntell people that I speak to that we're working ourselves out of a job, \nbut that would be a bold-faced lie.''\n  Mr. President, the charitable work that Mr. Emmette Thompson and \nMission of Hope provide to the impoverished families of Kentucky and \nthe Appalachia region is extremely honorable. I commend Emmette and the \norganization for their selfless devotion to this important cause. \nOrganizations and people such as these embrace the spirit of Kentucky \nand continue to provide hope to the people of our great Commonwealth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/31/senate-section/article/S6911-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BUDGETARY ADJUSTMENTS\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nproposed rules issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, \nregarding tomato product crediting. I believe we must provide our \nchildren with healthy meals and ensure they have access to nutritious \nfoods not only for their own well-being, but for the well-being of our \nNation.\n  Given that a significant number of children rely on school lunch \nprograms for meals every day, I am concerned that provisions in the \nrule regarding tomato paste crediting could have unintended \nconsequences.\n  Tomato paste contributes dietary fiber, potassium--a nutrient of \nconcern for children--as well as Vitamins A and C. It is delivered to \nkids in popular school menu items they enjoy eating and drives National \nSchool Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program participation. The \nproposed rule changes a technical crediting issue, effectively \nmandating the use of three times as much tomato paste or other tomato \nproduct. For example, under the proposed rules, the crediting of tomato \npaste would be based on the volume served as opposed to ``single-\nstrength reconstituted basis'' as outlined in the Food Buying Guide for \nChild Nutrition Programs. To achieve one vegetable serving, an \nestimated three times the current quarter cup volume of tomato \nproduct--like tomato paste, tomato sauce, or salsa--would be required. \nThis increased amount is unrealistic for many single foods and \ncombination foods and would make the weekly vegetable serving \nrequirement more difficult for schools to achieve.\n  Under this rule, a plate of spaghetti with three times the normal \namount of sauce becomes more of a soup than a pasta dish, and a slice \nof whole grain pizza with three times the amount of sauce could be \nequally excessive. This becomes a problem for schools hoping to feed \ntheir students healthy meals that kids like.\n  The Institute of School Meals report does not recommend a change in \nthe way tomato products are calculated. This change does not bring a \nnutritional benefit, and it was not called for by schools, \nnutritionists, or the Institute of Medicine. Constituents in Minnesota \nhave said that this would result in increased volumes of foods \nconsumed, increased costs to schools, and the virtual elimination of \nmany foods served in school lunch, because of altered formulas and \nproper ratios that no longer allows for proper preparation or \nconsumption.\n  I am not suggesting that USDA stop action on the rule--but, I believe \nwe must focus on increasing fruits and vegetables rather than \ndecreasing specific foods that provide an important source of essential \nnutrients. And because of that, I suggest that USDA refrain from \nchanging the current tomato paste crediting levels. We need to make \nsure that we promote nutritious meals and recognize that the quality of \nthe meals our kids eat in school plays a major role in their health and \nwell-being.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 810\n\n  Mr. President, I also wish to speak on Senator Sessions' amendment \nNo. 810. While I support Senator Sessions' efforts to eliminate waste, \nfraud, and abuse in the government, I have concerns that this amendment \nwill take food away from children and families with the greatest needs. \nThis amendment prohibits the use of any funds from being used to \nsupport categorical eligibility in the Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program, SNAP. Categorical eligibility reduces \nadministrative costs, simplifies enrollment, and helps eligible low-\nincome households receive food assistance. I have heard from a number \nof groups in my State who stressed the importance of categorical \neligibility in giving states the option to enroll beneficiaries in \nSNAP, and I know how important it is to reach out to citizens that are \neligible for benefits.\n  While I opposed this amendment, I will work in the farm bill to \nstrengthen and improve the program to ensure that taxpayer resources \nare spent wisely.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 739\n\n  Mr. President, I also wish to discuss amendment No. 739 offered by \nSenator McCain to the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development \nappropriations bill. I share Senator McCain's concern that \ntransportation funds need to be spent carefully to address our most \ncritical infrastructure priorities. However, I voted to table the \nMcCain amendment because I believe it needed\n\n[[Page S6912]]\n\nto be changed to allow States to continue to maintain existing \ninfrastructure projects. The Minnesota Department of Transportation \nnoted that the McCain amendment could have negatively impacted proposed \nprojects to rehabilitate historic bridges that remain in use today as a \ncritical part of Minnesota's road network. Specifically, bridges in \nWinona and Oslo, Minnesota may have been impacted and possibly \nBaudette, Minnesota's project as well. The chairman of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee which has jurisdiction over transportation \npolicy also assured me that no funding in this bill would be used to \nfund transportation museums.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 792\n\n  Mr. President, I also wish to discuss amendment No. 792 offered by \nSenator Coburn to the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development \nappropriations bill. While I agree with Senator Coburn that Federal \ndollars should not end up in the hands of property owners that put \ntheir tenants at risk, I ultimately could not support this amendment \nbecause it could have harmed the very families it sought to help.\n  Before the vote, I was contacted by several affordable housing groups \nfrom my home State of Minnesota asking that I oppose this amendment. \nThey were concerned that because of the way this amendment was drafted \nit could end up forcing the tenants it sought to protect into worse \nhousing conditions, or even onto the street. By suspending payments to \nproperties identified as deficient, it could also have prevented new \nowners from taking over deficient properties in order to rehabilitate \nthem as they wouldn't have any way of financing the rehabilitation.\n  The Department of Housing and Urban Development already has the \nability to enforce physical standards by suspending payments, seeking \nappointment of a receiver, and pursuing civil money penalties. I will \ncontinue to insist that they use these tools to develop responsive \nstrategies for every troubled property while putting the safety of the \ntenants first.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/31/senate-section/article/S6912-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6912-S6913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   WITHHOLDING TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2011\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to express support for the \nRepublican leader's legislation on a critical issue that addresses the \nburdensome cost of compliance with the Tax Code. Senator McConnell's \nbill is modeled after bipartisan legislation Senator Brown and I \nintroduced earlier this year which would repeal the 3 percent \nwithholding on government contractors that was enacted in 2005 and \nwhich mandates that Federal, State, and local governments withhold 3 \npercent of their payments to private contractors, including Medicare \nprovider payments, farm payments, defense contracts and certain grants.\n  I am deeply disappointed by the fact that the bill received 57 votes \non the floor on October 20 but failed to pass the 60-vote threshold. \nThe onerous withholding mandate on government contracts therefore \nremains before us and must be repealed. The House of Representatives \nhas spoken quite clearly by passing repeal legislation last week by a \nvote of 405-16 and it is time for the Senate to do the same!\n  This issue originated as a result of very legitimate efforts to \naddress the tax gap--the difference between what is owed in taxes and \nthe amount that the IRS is able to collect. I believe everyone agrees \nthat Americans should pay their taxes in full and none of us supports \ntax cheats, yet the issue that Senator McConnell's legislation \naddresses arises from the means of mandating compliance with the Tax \nCode, the cost of that compliance compared to the revenue collected, \nand impact on hiring. The unfortunate fact is that the 3 percent \nwithholding provision will cost far more to implement than will be \ncollected in tax revenue. More importantly, our economy will suffer as \nthis provision would take a significant toll on jobs and growth.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average annual \nunemployment rate for 2010 was 9.6 percent. For 27 out of the past 32 \nmonths the unemployment rate has been at 9 percent or above. About 45 \npercent of the unemployed have been out of work for at least 6 months--\na level previously unseen in the six decades since World War II. At a \ntime when 14 million Americans are still unemployed, and have been so \nfor the longest period since record keeping begun in 1948, our \ngovernment should be taking every possible step to ease the burden on \njob creators. We need to offer the American people solutions that help \nto grow jobs, not provisions that prevent it!\n  Compliance with this law will impose billions of dollars of cost on \nboth the public and private sectors, with a disproportionate impact on \nsmall businesses. These compliance costs will far exceed projected tax \ncollections. For instance, just one Federal agency, the Department of \nDefense, estimated that it would cost over $17 billion in the first 5 \nyears to comply, and the revenue estimate in 2005 projected that only \n$6.977 billion would be collected over a 10-year window. Even if that \nDOD estimate is inflated, as some charge, the Congressional Budget \nOffice projects costs of $12 billion just to implement this provision \nat the Federal level. There are similar costs imposed across all of the \nNation's State and local governments, making this provision simply an \nunfunded mandate on State and local governments. This is a case of \nspending a dollar to collect a dime, which is counterproductive for \naddressing the Nation's deficits.\n  What is worse is that this provision is not going to impact only \nthose who have skirted tax laws--this provision will fall most heavily \non innocent parties who have done nothing wrong at all, jeopardizing \ntheir cash flow and ability to grow. As ranking member of the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business, I have heard from many businesses across \nthe country that the 3 percent withholding amount will exceed their \nprofit on a given contract and will prevent them from being able to \nmake payroll, forcing them to borrow from banks just to pay their \nemployees. This is not the way to encourage jobs and business growth \nbut rather way to stifle it.\n  This 3 percent withholding provision would increase the tax and \nregulatory burdens on our businesses, precisely the wrong policy potion \nfor these troubled times. We have the opportunity now to repeal this \nprovision and we need to take that step to help the jobs picture. It is \nvital to note that it is not just workers who would suffer under this \nprovision but Medicare recipients as well. Maine has the oldest \npopulation in the Nation and I know all too well how fragile are the \nfinances of our seniors who depend on this vital program. This \nprovision would deduct 3 percent from payments to Medicare providers \nand instead send the cash to the IRS. Why would we want to give these \nprecious dollars to the tax man rather than doctors? This new problem \nwould give doctors one more reason to turn away Medicare patients. And \nthat is to say nothing of the cost to CMS of setting up the accounting \nsystems that would implement this withholding scheme.\n  In the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, ARRA, Congress delayed \nfor 1 year the implementation of this mandate in recognition of the \nexorbitant expenditures that will be necessary to implement accounting \nsystems and hire new compliance employees at a time when the those \nresources were desperately needed for productive uses. The IRS itself \nrecently recognized the enormous burdens that this provision will put \non government agencies and as a result issued an administrative delay, \nmeaning the 3 percent withholding provision now becomes effective after \n2012. And even the President, in his recent Jobs Act proposal, called \nfor further delay of any implementation of this provision. If the \nCongress, the IRS, and this administration all recognize that the costs \nof this provision outweigh the benefits, then it is time to act to \nrepeal it.\n  As a result of the IRS regulatory delay, this provision goes into \neffect at the end of 2012, but people and businesses already are \nexpending valuable resources in anticipation of having to comply with \nthis pernicious provision. At a time when the American people are \nextremely frustrated with the partisan gridlock and Congress inability \nto pass meaningful legislation, we had an opportunity to pass a \nbipartisan bill that would provide small businesses with much needed \ncertainty and relief. The Senate failed to grasp that opportunity on \nOctober 20 but we cannot stop fighting to defend small businesses from \nits implementation. We\n\n[[Page S6913]]\n\nmust act soon, and we must act completely, to end the three percent \nwithholding provision entirely. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/31/senate-section/article/S6913-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIONAL BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL.

This disease affects people \neverywhere of all walks of life, taking the lives of approximately \n40,000 women in our country each year. In Connecticut, over 3,000 new \ncases of breast cancer will be diagnosed this year.\n  The epidemic incidence of breast cancer reminds us of the need for \nvigilance and vigor in fighting it. I applaud the various advocacy and \nfundraising organizations that have fought on behalf of the millions of \nindividuals affected by breast cancer. These organizations have been \ninstrumental in raising awareness of breast cancer throughout the \nhealth community, public, and Congress. Their work in promoting vital \nprevention activities and critical funding within government agencies \nfor breast cancer has saved millions of lives, and I thank them for all \nthey have done in the fight against breast cancer.\n  It is important to remember this month, and always, how critical \npreventive care is in the fight against breast cancer. I strongly \nencourage individuals to speak with their doctors about breast cancer \nto determine what steps they should take to protect themselves. Early \ndetection can significantly lower the risk of death from breast cancer, \nand I hope women will be reminded this month to seek the preventive \ncare they may need.\n  While progress has been made on this issue, we must continue to fight \nagainst breast cancer. I know my colleagues and I can agree that this \nthis fight is a national priority, and I look forward to working with \nthem on this issue in the coming years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/31/senate-section/article/S6913-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6913-S6914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE APPOINTMENT OF JUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Back then, even after the \n     scurrilous efforts to derail the confirmation failed, there \n     was a sustained effort to belittle the unbelievable \n     accomplishments of this truly great man. Instead of taking \n     American pride in the Justice's phenomenal rise from the \n     depths of poverty to one of the highest offices in the land, \n     a true Horatio Alger story if ever there was one, some of our \n     fellow citizens continued their efforts to discredit. Justice \n     Thomas was merely the ``puppet'' of Justice Antonin Scalia, \n     we were told, because the two voted together roughly ninety \n     percent of the time. (I never saw a similar claim that \n     Justice Ginsburg was merely the ``puppet'' of Justice Stevens \n     because of similarly high vote agreement, and I'm still \n     waiting for the ``puppet'' charge to be applied to Justice \n     Kagan, who this past year agreed with Justices Sotomayor and \n     Ginsburg 94% and 90% of the time, respectively). The New York \n     Times called him the ``cruelest'' Justice early in his tenure \n     on the bench because of an opinion he authored faithfully \n     adhering to the Constitution's text in a case involving an \n     assault on a prisoner. One federal appellate judge even went \n     so far as to claim that no Supreme Court decision decided by \n     a 5-4 vote with Justice Thomas in the majority should be \n     deemed binding precedent!\n       And yet, despite all this, the Justice persevered, building \n     over the years such a coherent and profound body of law that \n     even some of his most vocal critics from the early years have \n     had to concede that they were wrong. This past summer, the \n     New Yorker Magazine acknowledged that in ``several of the \n     most important areas of constitutional law, Thomas has \n     emerged as an intellectual leader of the Supreme Court.'' His \n     concurring opinion in the 1997 decision of Printz v. United \n     States invited a long-overdue consideration of whether the \n     Second Amendment conferred ``a personal right to `keep and \n     bear arms,' '' an invitation that the Court accepted and \n     vindicated a decade later in the landmark case of Heller v. \n     District of Columbia. His concurring opinion in Simmons v. \n     Zelman-Harris, the 2002 Ohio school vouchers case, has \n     created a virtual cottage industry in legal scholarship \n     assessing his contention that the Establishment Clause was \n     primarily a federalism provision, and thereby not as \n     susceptible to being incorporated and made applicable to the \n     States via the Fourteenth Amendment as the other clauses of \n     the First Amendment, certainly without a more thorough \n     analysis than had previously been provided by the Court.\n       But the Justice's most profound intellectual leadership on \n     the Court has involved his commitment to our nation's \n     founding principles. He has been at the forefront of the \n     effort to revive the idea that the federal government is one \n     of only limited, enumerated powers, and that it is the solemn \n     duty of the Court to serve as a check against a Congress bent \n     on ignoring the limits on its own power, in order to protect \n     the cause of liberty. Even more important than his dedication \n     to limited government, though, has been his devotion to the \n     natural rights political theory of the Founders on which the \n     idea of limited government is grounded, particularly as \n     espoused in the Declaration of Independence. The Justice has \n     famously disagreed with Justice Scalia about the role of the \n     Declaration in constitutional interpretation, finding that \n     the principles espoused there are not only relevant but \n     binding. In the 1995 case of Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. \n     Pena, for example, Justice Thomas objected to the federal \n     government's use of racial preferences in government \n     contracting, stating that there ``can be no doubt that the \n     paternalism that appears to lie at the heart of this program \n     is at war with the principle of inherent equality that \n     underlies and infuses our Constitution.'' The citation he \n     provided for that simple but important proposition--paragraph \n     two of the Declaration of Independence (``We hold these \n     truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal, \n     that they are endowed by their Creator with certain \n     unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and \n     the pursuit of Happiness'').\n       When he nominated Justice Thomas to the Supreme Court, \n     President Bush asserted that he was the most qualified person \n     in the country for the job. Many disparaged the President's \n     statement at the time, as so patently false that even the \n     President himself could not possibly have believed it. \n     Instead, it was said, the President was merely claiming that \n     Thomas was the most qualified conservative African-American \n     with judicial experience who could be nominated to fill the \n     seat from which the first African-American to serve on the \n     high Court, Thurgood Marshall, had just retired. And in that \n     category of one, Thomas was the most qualified. Quite apart \n     from the fact that the very idea of race-based allotments of \n     seats on the Supreme Court runs counter to Justice Thomas's \n     deep devotion to a color-blind constitution, the derogatory \n     interpretation of the President's claim has, happily, been \n     thoroughly debunked by the Justice's own jurisprudence. At a \n     time when our understanding of the Law has been infected with \n     a morally relativistic legal positivism, Justice Thomas's \n     revival of the Declaration's recognition that there is a \n     higher law that governs the affairs of man, that our \n     inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of \n     happiness come not from any government but by our Creator, \n     and that the sole legitimate purpose of government is to \n     secure those rights, has proved beyond measure that the \n     President was correct.\n       And increasingly, the Court is following his lead. As the \n     New Yorker magazine recognized, ``the majority has followed \n     where Thomas has been leading for a decade or more. Rarely \n     has a Supreme Court Justice enjoyed such broad or significant \n     vindication.''\n       The American founding was one of the great episodes in all \n     of human history. The United States of America became a \n     beacon of hope to the world, a shining city on a hill \n     lighting the path of freedom for all. We had lost that \n     wonderful legacy for a time, but we have begun to reclaim it, \n     in no small part because of the efforts of Justice Clarence \n     Thomas, of those who taught him, and of those who learned and \n     continue to learn from him. Please join me in thanking \n     Justice Thomas for his dedication to our nation's founding \n     principles, congratulating him on this 20-year milestone, and \n     wishing him Godspeed for the next twenty years as he \n     continues his efforts on and off the bench on behalf of the \n     principles of liberty.\n           With utmost respect and admiration,\n\n                                              John C. Eastman,\n\n                                         Henry Salvatori Professor\n                                       of Law & Community Service.\n\n[[Page S6914]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                                 October 13, 2011.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: Thank you for honoring Justice Thomas \n     on the twentieth anniversary of his confirmation to the \n     Supreme Court of the United States. Thank you also for \n     inviting me to offer my own thoughts on this important \n     anniversary.\n       In their letters, many of my fellow law clerks to Justice \n     Thomas describe his contributions to the development of the \n     law. As they observe, he has articulated a clear, consistent \n     approach to judging that focuses on the text and history of \n     the Constitution and federal statutes. It would be a mistake \n     then to pigeonhole the Justice's views as either results-\n     oriented or outdated. On the one hand, it would not explain \n     many of his opinions--for instance, his view that the Eighth \n     Amendment does not place limits on the amount of punitive \n     damages that plaintiffs may recover against defendants, or \n     his view that the Sixth Amendment places limits on the \n     government's ability to introduce evidence from absent \n     witnesses at criminal trials. On the other hand, it would not \n     explain the areas in which Justice Thomas's attention to \n     history has foreshadowed the later direction of the Court--\n     for instance, his discussion of the Second Amendment in \n     Printz v. United States, eleven years before the Court \n     recognized an individual right to bear arms in District of \n     Columbia v. Heller. Justice Thomas's contributions to the law \n     have been principled and important, and their influence over \n     the past two decades merits serious consideration.\n       I would like to focus, though, on something that receives \n     less public attention: his decency, both as a judge and as a \n     human being. Because Justice Thomas seldom asks questions at \n     oral argument, it would be easy to assume that he is a quiet, \n     reserved individual, detached from the life of the Court and \n     the lives of those around him. Nothing could be further from \n     the truth. Before the Supreme Court hears cases, it is common \n     for the Justices to discuss those cases with their law \n     clerks. I still remember the first of those conferences when \n     I clerked for Justice Thomas: it lasted nearly two days. He \n     discussed our views on the cases for hours--challenging us to \n     clarify our thoughts, defend our positions, and explain our \n     differences. In the end, of course, the Justice reached his \n     own views, but no litigant should ever walk away from the \n     Court thinking that his arguments fell on deaf ears. Indeed, \n     Justice Thomas's reluctance to participate in oral argument \n     is driven in large part by his desire to hear from the \n     advocates. Many of them have worked for years to bring the \n     country's most important cases before its highest Court, and \n     he believes that they should have the opportunity to be \n     heard. Whatever one thinks of that approach, it is'born of a \n     respect for other people and what matters to them.\n       Our conferences and conversations with the Justice also \n     ranged far beyond the law. He wanted to get to know us as \n     people--to understand where we grew up, what we enjoy, and \n     what we hope for our futures. It is not an exaggeration to \n     say that Justice Thomas treats his clerks, his staff, and his \n     colleagues like a family. And like any family, he takes on \n     our cares and concerns, our highs and lows. Several years \n     ago, a member of my family was having an issue with her \n     health, and I happened to mention it in passing to the \n     Justice as something that had been weighing on my mind. The \n     next day, without any indication to me, the Justice contacted \n     her to see whether there was anything that he could do. \n     Perhaps the most remarkable thing is, that story will not \n     surprise anyone who knows him: all of us can recall a time \n     when he reached out to offer encouragement in an hour of \n     need. He does not provide that support publicly, where he \n     could receive recognition, which reminds me of Matthew's \n     admonition to give alms in private and not for the glory of \n     others. I suspect that if Justice Thomas ever reads this \n     letter, he will be upset with me for bringing his humanity \n     into the spotlight.\n       Several years ago, Justice Thomas gave a talk to students \n     at the University of Alabama Law School. During the flight, \n     he struck up conversation with a lawyer returning home to \n     Birmingham. They talked about legal practice, their families, \n     and Alabama football--all without the attorney's having any \n     idea that he was conversing with a Supreme Court Justice. At \n     the law school, Justice Thomas spoke before a packed house of \n     hundreds of students, and afterward he stood for hours, \n     meeting and taking pictures with every last student who had \n     waited in line. At a similar visit to the University of \n     Tennessee, he literally closed down the law school, waiting \n     until everyone had left and then thanking the janitorial \n     staff who were cleaning up from the event. From a lawyer in \n     Birmingham, to students in Tuscaloosa, to employees in \n     Knoxville, there are countless people across America who can \n     testify to Justice Thomas's warmth and his deep, booming \n     laugh. Wherever he goes, he connects with strangers from all \n     walks of life, because he is sincerely interested in their \n     backgrounds and genuinely grateful for their contributions. \n     He reminds all of us that we are never too busy or important \n     to be considerate to others, and he deserves the highest of \n     compliments that I can pay to a fellow Georgian: he has never \n     forgotten who he is or where he came from.\n       Finally, any recognition of Justice Thomas's time on the \n     Court would be incomplete without also recognizing his wife, \n     Mrs. Ginni Thomas. She has been there every step of the way, \n     sharing in the substantial burdens that serving as a Justice \n     can impose. Justice Thomas often says that he could not do \n     his job without her support, and I am sure that he would want \n     any commemoration of his service to extend to her as well. \n     Thank you for recognizing them on the twentieth anniversary \n     of Justice Thomas's confirmation to the Supreme Court.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Jeffrey B. Wall,\n     Law Clerk to Justice Thomas, 2004-2005.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                 October 17, 2011.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch, Thank you so much for inviting me to \n     participate in your tribute to Justice Thomas on his \n     twentieth anniversary on the Supreme Court.\n       Justice Thomas didn't want to be Justice Thomas. I know \n     this for a fact, because I was with him on June 27, 1991, \n     when he received word that Justice Thurgood Marshall had \n     announced his retirement and that the White House was calling \n     for an interview. Time stood still for a moment as then-Judge \n     Thomas absorbed this information and its obvious \n     implications. It wasn't a moment of excitement or \n     exhilaration; rather, he accepted a stack of pink phone slips \n     as if each one were an iron weight. He had just turned forty-\n     three, and had been a judge on the D.C. Circuit for little \n     over a year.\n       Ironically, one of the best qualifications for serving on \n     the Supreme Court may be the lack of a craving to do so. For \n     Justice Thomas, service on the Court is a job, not a calling. \n     He gets up in the morning, goes into the office, decides \n     cases, and then goes home again. He isn't impressed by \n     important people, and doesn't try to impress anyone. He \n     enjoys his job, but it doesn't define him.\n       The job may come easier to him than to others because of \n     his firm views about the limited role of federal judges. He \n     doesn't believe it's his business to make tough policy \n     choices, but to enforce the policy choices made by others. \n     He's often voted for results that I'm quite sure he would \n     oppose as a legislator. His concern is deciding cases \n     correctly, not garnering either votes or accolades.\n       I vividly recall a case argued during Justice Thomas' very \n     first sitting on the Supreme Court in November 1991. The \n     Justice returned to Chambers after Conference and sheepishly \n     admitted that he'd switched his intended vote because every \n     one of his colleagues had voted the other way. The next \n     morning, however, he summoned his law clerks into his office \n     to tell us that he'd had trouble sleeping because he still \n     couldn't justify that vote, and had just informed the Chief \n     Justice that he would try his hand at a dissent. That dissent \n     ultimately picked up a number of other votes, and the result \n     in the case nearly flipped. When a similar issue reached the \n     Court a few years later, Justice Thomas wrote the majority \n     opinion.\n       I don't think that Justice Thomas has spent many sleepless \n     nights since then. He knows who he is as a person and a \n     judge, and is comfortable on both scores. His judicial voice \n     is confident, original, and compelling. There can be little \n     doubt that he has brought true diversity to the Supreme \n     Court.\n       Finally, no tribute to Justice Thomas would be complete \n     without acknowledging his warm personality, perfectly \n     captured by his booming laugh. From a parochial perspective, \n     he takes a real interest in his law clerks, both before and \n     after the clerkship. He enjoys having lunch on a regular \n     basis with those of us who live in the Washington area, not \n     only so that he can keep up with us, but also so that we can \n     keep up with each other. And, through it all, he derives \n     great strength and comfort from his wife Ginni. Without her, \n     he never would have found his beloved Cornhuskers!\n       I appreciate the opportunity to share these thoughts.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Christopher Landau,\n       Law clerk to Judge Thomas, D.C. Circuit, 1990,\n       Law clerk to Justice Thomas, Supreme Court, 1991-92.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/31/senate-section/article/S6914-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6914-S6915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REMEMBERING REVEREND FRED SHUTTLESWORTH\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the late civil \nrights leader, Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth, who passed away earlier \nthis month. From his humble beginnings in Mount Meigs, AL, he grew to \nbecome one of the most influential leaders in the battle for civil \nrights. Reverend Shuttlesworth was best known as cofounder of the \nSouthern Christian Leadership Conference, which was formed in response \nto the Montgomery bus boycott, and for the role he played in the sit-\nins of lunch counters in 1960 and the Freedom Rides of 1961.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. considered Reverend Shuttlesworth one of \nthe Nation's most courageous freedom fighters. Reverend Shuttlesworth \nwas beaten, assaulted, jailed, and had his\n\n[[Page S6915]]\n\nhome bombed because of his outspoken views and his fight for racial \nequality.\n  In 1953, he became the presiding pastor of Bethel Baptist Church in \nBirmingham, AL. He continued his call to preach in Cincinnati, OH, from \n1961-1966 where he pastored the Revelation Baptist Church. Reverend \nShuttlesworth remained in Cincinnati during his latter years and \nreturned to Birmingham after his retirement in 2007. During that time, \nhe continued his fight for racial equality and became a strong advocate \nfor the homeless.\n  Although Reverend Shuttlesworth is no longer with us, his \ncontributions to our Nation will not be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/31/senate-section/article/S6915-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     REMEMBERING SALOMON E. RAMIREZ\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, Salomon E. Ramirez, New Mexico \nState executive director of USDA's Farm Service Agency, died October 22 \nat his family's ranch in Rociada, NM. He was 56 years old. Salomon came \nfrom a ranching family in San Miguel County and devoted his life to \nserving agriculture in New Mexico and the Nation.\n  He was born in Las Vegas, NM, attended Robertson High School, and \ngraduated with a degree in agriculture from New Mexico State \nUniversity. His passion for agriculture and a desire to help farmers \nand ranchers in New Mexico led him to a career at the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture, including positions at both the Farm Service Agency and \nthe U.S. Forest Service. Because of his knowledge and experience, he \nspent time at USDA's headquarters in Washington helping to write a new \nfarm bill and implement national farm policy.\n  Salomon Ramirez was a model public servant. He worked at USDA for \nover 30 years and was a tireless advocate for my State's farmers and \nranchers. No one knew more about farm programs or understood how they \ncould best be implemented to support the producers in my State. My \nstaff and I frequently sought his counsel and valued his always astute \nadvice. I was honored to recommend him to be the State executive \ndirector of the New Mexico Farm Service Agency and was pleased when \nPresident Obama appointed him to the position in 2009.\n  No State had a more capable or caring manager for its farm programs \nthan New Mexico. He was a true friend of agriculture and everyone who \ndepends on agriculture from producers to consumers--in fact, all of us. \nHe will be greatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/31/senate-section/article/S6915-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ZERO LANDFILL WASTE CELEBRATION\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, it is with the greatest pleasure \nthat today I recognize the achievements of the McKee Foods Corporation \nplant in Gentry, AR. This plant reached the milestone of having zero \nlandfill waste, a first for a McKee Foods production facility.\n  In 1934, under the shadow of the Great Depression, the late O.D. and \nRuth McKee converted a cookie shop into a 5-cent bakery in Chattanooga, \nTN. With O.D.'s aptitude for sales and Ruth's management abilities, the \nduo took their small mom-and-pop bakery and expanded into what is now \nknown as McKee Foods Corporation. The expansion into Gentry came in \n1982 when the company needed a larger facility to serve the western \nUnited States and Mexico. Among other things, the Gentry plant produces \na variety of ``Little Debbie'' snack cakes, a favorite treat among my \nfamily and staff.\n  It was 2 years ago that the Gentry plant management team challenged \nthemselves and the more than 1,500 Gentry employees to reach a goal of \nzero landfill waste. Although seen as challenging, the entire plant \nknew this was achievable. Many recycling efforts were already under \nway, and the plant partnered with several local recycling companies to \nput processes in place to bring their landfill waste down to zero. For \nthe Gentry plant, there will be no going back to the landfill.\n  With responsibility as a guiding value, McKee Foods has been and will \ncontinue to be a strong advocate for environmentally conscious business \npractices. On average, McKee Foods recycles 3,750 tons of cardboard, \n10,000 gallons of used petroleum oil, over 100,000 wooden pallets, and \n200 tons of scrap steel and other metals. While the Gentry plant is \nsetting the bar high for other McKee facilities, the entire McKee Foods \nCorporation is to be commended for its environmental stewardship.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me today in congratulating the McKee \nFoods Corporation's Gentry plant on attaining zero landfill waste. As \nthe company motto adopted by O.D. McKee makes clear, McKee Foods is \ncommitted to ``finding a better way'' of doing business, and the Gentry \nplant is leading the way. I am proud of all they have accomplished and \nlook forward to their future successes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/31/senate-section/article/S6915-3", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO NEIL BOWES\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Neil Bowes for 50 \noutstanding years at WNAX Radio. When Mr. Bowes first arrived at WNAX \nRadio, he was a new graduate of the University of South Dakota. He \nbegan his career on the business side of WNAX operations in 1961 and \nremained there for seven years before he decided to venture into sales \nin 1968. Ever since this transition, businesses that advertise on WNAX \nhave had the privilege of dealing with Neil.

Mr. President, on November 4, one of the Oregon \nNational Guard's most remarkable military leaders will retire: BG \nCharles Yriarte.\n  General Yriarte has served the citizens of Oregon, and the United \nStates, in the Oregon National Guard for over 40 years. He joined as a \nprivate and has held numerous positions, including troop commander, \nbattalion commander, brigade commander, and is ending his service as an \nassistant adjutant general.\n  Oregonians hold the men and women of our National Guard in high \nregard, and General Yriarte is one example of why. While serving as a \nmodel citizen soldier, he has raised his children, maintained a \ncivilian career as a U.S. Forest Service civil servant and also \nassisted his family with their cattle ranch in Burns, OR. His \ndedication to his family runs deep. When General Yriarte was promoted \nto the rank of Brigadier General, the ceremony was held at St. Charles \nHospital in Bend, Oregon, so his father, who was undergoing treatment, \ncould be present. But, when duty has called, General Yriarte has always \nanswered, many times at great sacrifice to himself. Joining the Forest \nService in 1974 was his dream job, but after the attacks of September \n11, 2001, he took on a number of critical full-time assignments in the \nOregon National Guard.\n  General Yriarte deployed to Iraq shortly after the war commenced and \nwas placed in charge of Joint Base Ballad, in an extremely hazardous \nenvironment, with the duty of making the base functional for U.S. and \nallied soldiers. General Yriarte worked to improve relations with local \nleaders to lessen the daily mortar attacks and reduce the threat to his \nsoldiers and the base in the early stages of the war. This outreach was \na tremendous success and led to a strong relationship and enduring \nfriendship with many of the local community leaders. His tireless \neffort to secure the base ensured the safety of several thousand \nservicemembers on base and reduced the attacks and violence outside the \nperimeter. General Yriarte accomplished this\n\n[[Page S6916]]\n\nmission in spectacular fashion and he successfully returned his unit to \nOregon with no casualties.\n  In each command, the units under him excelled in every way. His \nmentorship of young officers and noncommissioned officers has been \ntruly exceptional. The soldiers that he has taught are now serving in \nthe most important positions in the Oregon National Guard. These \nsoldiers will have positive impacts on the institution for decades to \ncome. General Yriarte's legacy will be lasting and profound within the \nOregon National Guard.\n  To understand General Yriarte's ability to inspire, here is what he \nsaid during his unit's homecoming event:\n\n       Every person in this room has sacrificed. I wouldn't be \n     here today without your sacrifices. You did this country \n     great, and I applaud you. This room is filled with heroes \n     both past and present. I went to Iraq because I love my \n     country. I found out that the Iraqis are good people and like \n     everyone are looking for safety for themselves and their \n     families. I already knew, but it was proven that American \n     soldiers never quit. They do their job. You are this nation's \n     greatest generation, and you became leaders when you came \n     home. Our soldiers are doing that now. Our nation is great, \n     we remain great. . . .\n\n  These words also say an enormous amount about him.\n  So, if I can use the general's own words, let me say that general, \nyou have sacrificed. Your country is better because of your many \nsacrifices. You have done your State and Nation proud. You are a giant \nto all you have touched and your love of home and country are an \ninspiration. You have protected everyone in your charge. You have \nalways given your best. Our Nation will remain great because we have \nmen and women like you in every generation. Like the great military \nleaders before you, your words and action will positively influence our \nNation far into the future.\n  Therefore, it is my honor and great privilege to commend BG Charles \nYriarte, assistant adjutant general, Oregon National Guard, for his \nmore than 40 years of service to our country. Mr. President, today, I \njoin my fellow Oregonians in recognition and celebration of the great \nachievements of Brigadier General Yriarte, as he begins this new \nchapter in his life with his beloved wife Christine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/31/senate-section/article/S6916-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/31/senate-section/article/S6916-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/31/senate-section/article/S6916-3", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARED IN \nEXECUTIVE ORDER 13413 WITH RESPECT TO BLOCKING THE PROPERTY OF PERSONS \nCONTRIBUTING TO THE CONFLICT TAKING PLACE IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF \n  THE CONGO, RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE ON OCTOBER 25, \n                              2011--PM 30\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to decrease the incidence of violent crimes against \nIndian women, to strengthen the capacity of Indian tribes to exercise \nthe sovereign authority of Indian tribes to respond to violent crimes \ncommitted against Indian women, and to ensure that perpetrators of \nviolent crimes committed against Indian women are held accountable for \nthat criminal behavior, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nIndian Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Stand Against \nViolence and Empower Native Women--SAVE Native Women--Act. I would like \nto thank the cosponsors of my bill, my good friends Senators Inouye, \nMurray, Udall of New Mexico, Begich, Franken, Johnson of South Dakota, \nBaucus, Tester, and Bingaman.\n  Native women across the country suffer from severe threats to their \nsafety. According to a safety study by the Department of Justice, two \nin five girls and women in Native communities will suffer domestic \nviolence and one in three will be sexually assaulted in their lifetime. \nCan you imagine looking through the loving eyes of your daughter, \nsister, or mother and knowing one of them will probably be abused in \nher lifetime? This is a terrible reality of life for Native women and \ntheir families across the country. It is an epidemic, it is \nunacceptable, and we must stand against it. This is why I am \nintroducing the SAVE Native Women Act.\n  Most of those who commit these terrible crimes against Native women \nare not Native themselves. Yet, currently, tribes have no ability to \nprosecute non-Natives for domestic violence and sexual assault in their \nown communities. This has resulted in a sense of lawlessness and leaves \nNative women with few places to turn. My bill strengthens tribal \njurisdiction over domestic violence and sexual assault so that all \noffenders, Native and non-Native, can be brought to justice.\n  My bill strengthens existing programs that support Native victims of \ndomestic violence and sexual assault. In many communities, these \nprograms offer the only safety and support available for Native women. \nYet these programs are greatly strained. This bill provides programs \nwith more flexibility and tools to address their most critical needs.\n  Finally, my bill addresses the disturbing trend of sex trafficking in \nmany Native communities. I have included provisions that improve data \ngathering and strengthen programs that better understand and respond to \nsex trafficking of Native women.\n  I have worked closely with tribes, tribal organizations, and Federal \nagencies to develop this bill. We should not let the next generation of \nyoung Native\n\n[[Page S6920]]\n\nwomen grow up, as their mothers have, in unbearable situations that \nthreaten their security, stability, and even their lives. I urge you to \njoin me and my cosponsors and stand against violence and support \npassage of the SAVE Native Women Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1763\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \ngrants to strengthen the healthcare system's response to domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Violence \nAgainst Women Health Initiative. October is Domestic Violence Awareness \nmonth, and this bill will raise awareness of domestic violence among \nhealth care providers and allow them to better assess and treat \nsurvivors of domestic violence.\n  The rates of violence and abuse in this country are astounding. \nNearly one in four women in the U.S. has reported experiencing domestic \nviolence at some point in her life. In 2007, there were 248,300 \nreported incidents of sexual assault in the U.S. Young women experience \nthe highest rates of sexual assault and stalking. Sadly, 15.5 million \nchildren in the U.S. live in families in which partner violence has \noccurred in the past year, and 7 million children live in families in \nwhich severe partner violence has occurred.\n  Domestic violence has a significant impact on our country's health. \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, \nintimate partner violence costs the health care system over $8.3 \nbillion annually.\n  In addition to injuries sustained during violent episodes, survivors \nsuffer lifelong health complications. Research published in the journal \nof Women's Health in 2007 found that women who are victimized by \nviolence have 17 percent more primary care doctor visits, 14 percent \nmore specialist visits, and 27 percent more prescription refills than \nnon-abused women.\n  Physical and psychological abuse are linked to a number of adverse \nphysical health effects. A study released in 2010 that compared victims \nwith never-abused women found abuse victims had an approximately six-\nfold increase in clinically-identified substance abuse, a more than \nthree-fold increase in depression diagnoses, a three-fold increase in \nsexually transmitted diseases, and a two-fold increase in lacerations.\n  But it is not just the spouse who suffers these lifelong \nconsequences. It is their children, too. Children who witness domestic \nviolence are more likely to exhibit behavioral and physical health \nproblems, including depression, anxiety, and violence towards peers. \nThey are also more likely to attempt suicide, abuse drugs and alcohol, \nrun away from home, engage in teenage prostitution, and commit sexual \nassault crimes. Fifty percent of men who frequently assault their wives \nalso frequently assault their children, and the U.S. Advisory Board on \nChild Abuse and Neglect suggests that domestic violence may be the \nsingle major precursor to child abuse and neglect fatalities in this \ncountry.\n  Without question, we must tackle the underlying causes of domestic \nviolence and abuse in this country. At the same time, we must \nstrengthen our health care response to this abuse.\n  Despite the commitment of health care providers to help domestic \nviolence victims, a critical gap remains in the delivery of health care \nto victims. Health care providers often only address immediate \ninjuries, without tackling the underlying cause of those injuries. For \nexample, each year, about 324,000 pregnant women in this country are \nbattered by their intimate partners. However, few physicians screen \npregnant patients for abuse. This highlights the need to ensure that \nhealth care providers have the necessary training and support in order \nto assess, refer, and support victims of domestic and sexual violence.\n\n[[Page S6923]]\n\n  Victims know and trust their health care providers. Almost 3/4 of \nsurvivors say that they would like their health care providers to ask \nthem about violence and abuse.\n  Multiple clinical studies have shown that short interventions in the \nmedical environment protect the health and safety of women. These \ninterventions are short between 2 and 10 minutes, and effective. In \nrepeated clinical trials, violence decreased and health status improved \nfollowing simple assessment and referral protocols. Integrating these \neffective protocols into our health care system will save lives.\n  This is why routine assessments for intimate partner violence have \nbeen recommended for health care settings by the American Medical \nAssociation, American Psychological Association, American Nurses \nAssociation, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, and the Joint Commission on the \nAccreditation of Health Care Organizations.\n  Since its passage in 1994, the Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, has \ntransformed our criminal justice system and social service system, \nhelping to prevent and respond to domestic violence. The last \nreauthorization of VAWA, set to expire this year, included a new title \nauthorizing three programs that support the health system's efforts to \nhelp victims, preventing further abuse and improving the health status \nof women. The bill I am introducing today will continue those important \nefforts.\n  This bill would consolidate the three existing health programs into \none program, while increasing evaluation and accountability. \nSpecifically, this bill would foster public health responses to \nintimate partner violence and sexual violence; provide training and \neducation of health professionals to respond to violence and abuse; and \nsupport research on effective public health approaches to end violence \nagainst women.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BEGICH (for himself, Mr. Casey, Mr. Graham, Mr. Grassley, \n        Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Leahy, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Pryor, Ms. Snowe \n        and Mr. Tester):\n  S. 1768. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to authorize \nspace-available travel on military aircraft for members of the reserve \ncomponents, a member or former member of a reserve component who is \neligible for retired pay but for age, widows and widowers of retired \nmembers, and dependents; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce an amended \nversion of S. 542, the National Guard, Reserve, ``Gray Area'' Retiree, \nand Surviving Spouse Space-available Travel Equity Act.\n  The original legislation, S. 542, has been modified slightly. The \nmodification will ensure the Department of Defense retains the \nauthority to issue regulations to implement the bill.\n  The underlying intent of the legislation has not changed. The bill \nwill provide reserve component members and retired reserve component \nmembers the ability to travel overseas and travel with their dependents \nwhen there is space-available on a military aircraft. Additionally, the \nbill will ensure surviving spouses of retired members or members killed \nin the line of duty to retain space-available travel privileges after \nthe death of their loved one.\n  Members and retirees of the National Guard and Reserve, their \nfamilies, and surviving military spouses make great sacrifices for our \nNation. However, too often these individuals do not receive the \nbenefits they have earned for their service.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in giving parity to our reserve \ncomponent members, reserve component retirees and surviving military \nspouses. The no-cost legislation is endorsed by the National Guard \nAssociation of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1768\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
