The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Senators are encouraged to come to the \nfloor to offer their amendments this morning. We are going to be here \ndoing business. Senators who have remarks, speeches, proponents of the \namendments, opponents of amendments are given an opportunity here today \nwhich may be one of the relatively few opportunities that are going to \nbe available.\n  We will be here the Monday after we return as well before the vote at \n5:30 on Monday, November 28, on a judicial nomination, but we will also \nbe here before that time to hear from proponents and opponents of \namendments and to have people offer amendments. We are not going to \nhave the whole week, we have been told by the leader, when we come back \nfor this bill, so we are going to have to make additional progress \ntoday. We made some progress last night. We cleared some amendments \nlast night. We are going to try to clear some additional amendments \nthis morning and adopt some amendments that can be cleared. We have 155 \nfiled amendments, and we have 31 pending amendments. Again, we are \ngoing to try to clear some of those today and adopt some of those \ntoday, and we are going to try to do the same on Monday when we return.\n  Again, I urge that Senators who want to speak on pending or filed \namendments, proponents of those amendments, opponents of those \namendments, let us know immediately, if you would, whether you wish to \nspeak in support of or in opposition to pending or filed amendments. \nObviously, if people want to oppose amendments, then we are not going \nto clear them if we know about that, but we have to know about that. \nThese are on file. The clerk has the amendments. We know which \namendments are pending. The list is available.\n  The staff is going to be here for the first couple days, at least, \nnext week prior to Thanksgiving. Our staffs will be here to work with \nstaffs of Senators to try to revise amendments that may be open to \nrevision. So that work is going to go on, and we have to use these time \nperiods--today and next Monday and Tuesday--for work on amendments and \nthe Monday we get back for work on amendments because we need to get \nthis bill passed.\n  This is a critically important bill, and with 155 filed amendments, \n31 of which are already pending, we have a lot of work to do. We are \ngoing to try to do the very best we can, but we have to get a bill \npassed and we have to debate some of the very significant amendments \nwhich have already been filed and are pending.\n  So I want to thank my friend from Arizona and see whether he might \nwant to comment on my comments or otherwise.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Levin and his staff for \ntheir hard work on this very important piece of legislation. I am glad \nto see the chairman announced that the staff will be in working next \nweek. For a change, the taxpayers will get a return on their \ninvestment. I am very glad to know that. But in all seriousness, they \ndid a lot of work late last night and will be working hard all this \nweek.\n  I think that maybe our colleagues should plan on some late nights \nwhen we get back because we do need to get this done. There is a lot of \nimportant business before the Senate.\n  I would also like to point out that we spent the better part of \nyesterday on the detainee issue, and I appreciate that the detainee \nissue is one that is of transcendent importance. It certainly goes \nbeyond just national security. It is a very controversial issue with \nthe American people and Members on both sides of the aisle. On one side \nof the aisle, they would like to see much more restrictive policies, \nand on the other side of the aisle there is a very serious concern--and \na legitimate concern, although I don't share it--about erosion of the \nconstitutional rights and liberties of American citizens.\n  Hopefully, we can get a vote on that amendment so we can move forward \nto other very important amendments that Members obviously, by the large \nnumber of amendments, are very interested in in this process. I also \nhope we are able to get a unanimous consent agreement to limit, to cut \noff the number of pending amendments so that we can make progress on \nthose that have been filed and those that are pending.\n  I thank the chairman again and our respective staffs and our \ncolleagues. I thought it was a very beneficial debate we had yesterday \nthat a lot of Members participated in, and I think it served not only \nto educate our colleagues and the American people who observed it, but \nI also think it was a healthy discussion that was held on both sides of \nthe aisle and on both sides of this issue, and it very well informed \nSenators on this issue.\n  Again, I understand, for example, that the Senator from Illinois, Mr. \nDurbin, came to the floor and said we need a very in-depth discussion \non this issue. I think we had that. I also think this is a very \nimportant issue and one that deserved the attention of the Senate, but \nnow I think it is time to move on.\n  I also congratulate all Members who took part in sort of a colloquy \nand discussion we had amongst Members on both sides of this issue \nyesterday. I have found that those colloquies add a great deal to the \ndebate as we get the input and ideas and sometimes spirited discussion \non these issues.\n  So I thank the chairman, and we look forward to getting this \nimportant piece of legislation done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first of all, I thank my friend and \ncolleague from Arizona, the ranking member, for his comments and for \nall of his work on the committee. All of our colleagues on the \ncommittee have put in a lot of time.\n  I want to emphasize something he said about the opportunity here for \ndebate--that we have a number of pending amendments, including the \namendments on detainees. We are here to hear debate on those or any \nother amendments today and on Monday. We were here yesterday and had a \nlong debate. As the Senator from Arizona said, we had a lengthy debate, \nand we were prepared to vote. The supporters were not. That is fair \nenough. If they want additional time to debate it, we should welcome \nthat. But there is time, there is time today and there is time on \nMonday when we get back to debate that amendment and those amendments \nnot only on the detainees but on many other issues that are important \nthat are in this bill.\n  I agree with my friend from Arizona that we should ask the majority \nleader to make Monday night available for votes after the scheduled \nvote at 5:30. We need to have votes on amendments. I would hope that \namendments that can't be agreed to will be voted on on Monday night \nafter the vote on the judge, which is scheduled for 5:30.\n  I also agree with the Senator from Arizona about trying to get a \nlimit on the number of amendments. We will try again today to see if we \ncan get a\n\n[[Page S7787]]\n\nunanimous consent agreement. I haven't had a chance to talk this \nmorning with the Senator from Arizona, but we will try--and he just has \ngiven me an indication that this is fine with him--to see if we can't \nset a time later on today, maybe at noon or 1:00, for the filing of \namendments and to limit amendments to those that are filed by that \ntime.\n  We are going to try to get that done with a safety valve, which I \nsuggested last night and I think is acceptable to the Republican \nmanager, my friend from Arizona, which is that, in addition to whatever \namendments are filed by whatever time we put in the unanimous consent \nproposal, there be an additional two amendments on each side that would \nbe available to the managers that would need to be relevant--just \nrelevant amendments--to an amendment that is filed or relevant to the \nbill. I think you would need a safety valve, and people would \nunderstand that. Those two amendments would be allocable--two \namendments each by the Republican manager and myself, if that is \nagreeable. It would take unanimous consent, but I think everyone \nrealizes we have to have a universe here that we can work with during \nthe next week.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I don't want to talk too much longer. I \nsee our dear friend from New Mexico, who has been serious enough to \ncome in this morning and debate and discuss his concerns about the bill \nand amendments.\n  But I would ask the chairman, we have, as the Senator mentioned, a \nlarge number of pending amendments--not just filed but pending--and one \nof them, of course, is for the detainee issue, there is another Paul \namendment, and there are several others that perhaps we could vote on \non Monday, as the chairman mentioned.\n  If any of our colleagues feel they haven't the time to amend it, they \nare welcome to come now and they are welcome to come on Monday. I \nunderstand that may cause them some small inconvenience in their \nschedule, but if they filed a pending amendment, then there is an \namendment pending and they ought to be able to adjust their schedules \nto come and debate it. If they aren't able to do that, we should still \nbe able to dispose of those amendments, I say with great respect and \ncourtesy to all of my colleagues.\n  So I hope that Chairman Levin and I and others would say: Look, we \nare going to notify everybody that we are going to have votes on the \nfollowing amendments on Monday afternoon after we vote on the judge. If \nyou are interested in debating it, we will be here to debate it and \ndiscuss it with you.\n  We have to get this legislation passed for the good of the men and \nwomen who are serving this Nation with far greater inconvenience than, \nfrankly, our colleagues might experience by having to come back on \nMonday or by coming over here today.\n  I yield.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will be done in one moment so that our \nfriend from New Mexico can schedule his presentation.\n  I just wanted to add one additional thing to what the Senator from \nArizona said, in addition to agreeing with him. We will be here today \nand we will be here a week from Monday so that there will be plenty of \nopportunity to debate these pending amendments or other amendments, and \npeople need to know we are going to be seeking votes on these pending \namendments if we can't clear them or work them out. There will be an \nopportunity for debate before the vote.\n\n  One other comment; that is, I will have a detailed statement \naddressing the detainee issue a little later on this morning. It will \naddress some of the statements that are incorrect and misleading which \nwere in the administration's statement on this subject. Also, some of \nthe statements of our colleagues need to be addressed and, I believe, \ncorrected. Because this is a complex issue it is important to know what \nis in the bill and what is not in the bill. If it is properly \ncharacterized and if it is properly stated, it is still complex, but to \nmisstate it or overstate it or to mischaracterize what is in our bill \njust confuses an issue which needs to be debated on its merits and not \nconfused. It is complicated enough without obfuscation and confusion \nabout what is in the bill on detention or other matters and what is not \nin the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n Amendments Nos. 1200, 1066, 1067 as Modified, 1068, 1119, 1090, 1089, \n                         1056, and 1116 En Bloc\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of my friend, \nSenator Udall. If it is OK with the chairman, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the following amendments be considered pending on behalf of their \nsponsors? Would that be agreeable?\n  For Senator Cornyn, amendment No. 1200, related to Taiwan F-16s; for \nSenator Ayotte, amendment No. 1066, related to financial audits; for \nSenator Ayotte, amendment No. 1067, as revised, related to the \nnotification of Congress for the initial custody of members of al-\nQaida; for Senator Ayotte, amendment No. 1068, related to the \nauthorization of lawful interrogation methods; for Senator Brown of \nMassachusetts, amendment No. 1119, related to child custody rights; for \nSenator Brown of Massachusetts, amendment No. 1090, related to housing \nallowance rates; for Senator Brown of Massachusetts, amendment No. \n1089, related to disclosures by schools participating in tuition \nassistance; for Senator Wicker, amendment No. 1056, related to military \nchaplains; and for Senator Wicker, amendment No. 1116, related to truck \nlicenses for transitioning servicemembers.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let me notify Senators on our side that we are more than \nwilling to do that same courtesy for them if they would let our staff \nknow at the cloakroom this morning. We can do the same thing for \nSenators on our side as the Senator from Arizona properly did for \nSenators on his side.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I say, I hope Members on both sides, if they have \namendments, get them to us this morning so we can bring this part of \nthe process to an end.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And if I may, doing what the Senator from Arizona just did \nwill also facilitate, hopefully, the acceptance of a unanimous consent \nrequest that there then be a cutoff as I described at perhaps noon or 1 \no'clock today so we can know what the universe is and begin to whittle \nit down.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report by number the \namendments called up by the Senator from Arizona.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], proposes amendments \n     numbered 1200, 1066, 1067 as modified, 1068, 1119, 1090, \n     1089, 1056, and 1116 en bloc.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1200\n\n(Purpose: To provide Taiwan with critically needed United States-built \n multirole fighter aircraft to strengthen its self-defense capability \n           against the increasing military threat from China)\n\n       At the end of subtitle H of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1088. SALE OF F-16 AIRCRAFT TO TAIWAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Department of Defense, in its 2011 report to \n     Congress on ``Military and Security Developments Involving \n     the People's Republic of China,'' found that ``China \n     continued modernizing its military in 2010, with a focus on \n     Taiwan contingencies, even as cross-Strait relations \n     improved. The PLA seeks the capability to deter Taiwan \n     independence and influence Taiwan to settle the dispute on \n     Beijing's terms. In pursuit of this objective, Beijing is \n     developing capabilities intended to deter, delay, or deny \n     possible U.S. support for the island in the event of \n     conflict. The balance of cross-Strait military forces and \n     capabilities continues to shift in the mainland's favor.'' In \n     this report, the Department of Defense also concludes that, \n     over the next decade, China's air force will remain primarily \n     focused on ``building the capabilities required to pose a \n     credible military threat to Taiwan and U.S. forces in East \n     Asia, deter Taiwan independence, or influence Taiwan to \n     settle the dispute on Beijing's terms''.\n       (2) The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) conducted a \n     preliminary assessment of the status and capabilities of \n     Taiwan's air force in an unclassified report, dated January \n     21, 2010. The DIA found that, ``[a]lthough Taiwan has nearly \n     400 combat aircraft in service, far fewer of these are \n     operationally capable.'' The report concluded, ``Many of \n     Taiwan's fighter aircraft are close to or beyond\n\n[[Page S7788]]\n\n     service life, and many require extensive maintenance support. \n     The retirement of Mirage and F-5 aircraft will reduce the \n     total size of the Taiwan Air Force.''\n       (3) Since 2006, authorities from Taiwan have made repeated \n     requests to purchase 66 F-16C/D multirole fighter aircraft \n     from the United States, in an effort to modernize the air \n     force of Taiwan and maintain its self-defense capability.\n       (4) According to a report by the Perryman Group, a private \n     economic research and analysis firm, the requested sale of F-\n     16C/Ds to Taiwan ``would generate some $8,700,000,000 in \n     output (gross product) and more than 87,664 person-years of \n     employment in the US,'' including 23,407 direct jobs, while \n     ``economic benefits would likely be realized in 44 states and \n     the District of Columbia''.\n       (5) The sale of F-16C/Ds to Taiwan would both sustain \n     existing high-skilled jobs in key United States manufacturing \n     sectors and create new ones.\n       (6) On August 1, 2011, a bipartisan group of 181 members of \n     the House of Representatives sent a letter to the President, \n     expressing support for the sale of F-16C/Ds to Taiwan. On May \n     26, 2011, a bipartisan group of 45 members of the Senate sent \n     a similar letter to the President, expressing support for the \n     sale. Two other members of the Senate wrote separately to the \n     President or the Secretary of State in 2011 and expressed \n     support for this sale.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) a critical element to maintaining peace and stability \n     in Asia in the face of China's two-decade-long program of \n     military modernization and expansion of military capabilities \n     is ensuring a militarily strong and confident Taiwan;\n       (2) a Taiwan that is confident in its ability to deter \n     Chinese aggression will increase its ability to proceed in \n     developing peaceful relations with China in areas of mutual \n     interest;\n       (3) the cross-Strait military balance between China and our \n     longstanding strategic partner, Taiwan, has clearly shifted \n     in China's favor;\n       (4) China's military expansion poses a clear and present \n     danger to Taiwan, and this threat has very serious \n     implications for the ability of the United States to fulfill \n     its security obligations to allies in the region and protect \n     our vital United States national interests in East Asia;\n       (5) Taiwan's air force continues to deteriorate, and it \n     needs additional advanced multirole fighter aircraft in order \n     to modernize its fleet and maintain a sufficient self-defense \n     capability;\n       (6) the United States has a statutory obligation under the \n     Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) to provide \n     Taiwan the defense articles necessary to enable Taiwan to \n     maintain sufficient self-defense capabilities, in furtherance \n     of maintaining peace and stability in the western Pacific \n     region;\n       (7) in order to comply with the Taiwan Relations Act, the \n     United States must provide Taiwan with additional advanced \n     multirole fighter aircraft, as well as significant upgrades \n     to Taiwan's existing fleet of multirole fighter aircraft; and\n       (8) the proposed sale of F-16C/D multirole fighter aircraft \n     to Taiwan would have significant economic benefits to the \n     United States economy.\n       (c) Sale of Aircraft.--The President shall carry out the \n     sale of no fewer than 66 F-16C/D multirole fighter aircraft \n     to Taiwan.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1066\n\n(Purpose: To modify the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness Plan \n   to provide that a complete and validated full statement of budget \n        resources is ready by not later than September 30, 2014)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1005.

Mr. President, I am offering this amendment, \nalong with my cosponsors Senators Heller, Bingaman, Feinstein, and \nGillibrand, to provide a simple fix to a loophole in the Tariff Act of \n1930.\n  Our amendment will allow our Federal agents and prosecutors to crack \ndown on smugglers who use ultralight aircraft, also known as ULAs, to \nbring drugs across the U.S.-Mexico border.\n  In the last Congress, then-Congressman Heller introduced a very \nsimilar bill in the House with Congresswoman Gabriel Giffords. That \nbill passed overwhelmingly by a 412-3 vote. I hope we can have a \nsimilar bipartisan result here in the Senate.\n  ULAs are single-pilot aircraft capable of flying low, landing and \ntaking off quickly, and are typically used for sport or for recreation. \nHowever, because of increased detection and interdiction of more \ntraditional smuggling conveyances, ULAs have increasingly been employed \nalong the Southwest border by Mexican drug trafficking organizations to \nsmuggle drugs into the United States.\n  The use of ULAs by drug smugglers presents a unique challenge for law \nenforcement and prosecutors. Every year hundreds of ULAs are flown \nacross the Southwest border and each one can carry hundreds of pounds \nof narcotics.\n  Under existing law, ULAs are not categorized as aircraft by the \nFederal Aviation Administration, so they do not fall under the aviation \nsmuggling provisions of the Tariff Act of 1930. This means that a drug \nsmuggler piloting a small airplane is subject to much stronger criminal \npenalties than a smuggler who pilots a ULA.\n  Our amendment will close this unintended loophole and establish the \nsame penalties if convicted--a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison \nand a $250,000 fine--for smuggling drugs on ULAs as currently exist for \nsmuggling on airplanes or in automobiles.\n  This is a common sense solution that will give our law enforcement \nagencies and prosecutors additional tools they need to combat drug \nsmuggling.\n  The amendment would also add an attempt and conspiracy provision to \nthe aviation smuggling law to allow prosecutors to charge people other \nthan the pilot who are involved in aviation smuggling. This would give \nthem a new tool to prosecute the ground crews who aid the pilots as \nwell as those who pick up the drug loads that are dropped from ULAs in \nthe U.S.\n  Finally, the amendment directs the Department of Defense and \nDepartment of Homeland Security to collaborate in identifying equipment \nand technology used by DOD that could be used by U.S. Customs and \nBorder Protection to detect ULAs.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1154\n\n  Mr. President, this next amendment would establish an Open Burn Pit \nRegistry. This amendment, filed by myself and lead cosponsor Senator \nCorker, is important to both our active duty troops and veterans.\n  In both Afghanistan and Iraq open air burn pits were widely used at \nforward operating bases. Disposing of trash and other debris was \nadmittedly a major challenge. Commanders had to find a way to dispose \nof it while concentrating on the important mission at hand.\n  The solution that was chosen, however, had serious medical and \nenvironmental risks. In Afghanistan and Iraq, pits of waste were set on \nfire, sometimes using jet fuel for ignition. Oftentimes, these burn \npits would turn the sky black.\n  Some burn pits were small, but others covered multiple acres of land. \nAt Joint Base Balad, Iraq, over ten acres of land were used for burning \ntoxic debris.\n  This was a base, that at the height of its operations, hosted \napproximately 25,000 military, civilian and coalition personnel. These \npersonnel would be exposed to a toxic soup of chemicals released into \nthe atmosphere. According to air quality measurements taken near the \nbase, the air at Balad had multiple particulates harmful to humans.\n  These particulates ranged from plastics and Styrofoam, metals, \nchemicals from paints and solvents, petroleum and lubricants, jet fuel \nand unexploded ordnance, medical and other dangerous waste . . . all of \nthis was in the air and being inhaled into the lungs of service \nmembers.\n  More specifically, air samples at Joint Base Balad turned up some \nnasty stuff: Particulate matter--chemicals that form from the \nincomplete burning of coal, oil and gas, garbage, or other organic \nsubstances--Volatile Organic Compounds such as acetone and benzene. \nBenzene is known to cause leukemia and dioxins associated with Agent \nOrange.\n  Our veterans have slowly begun to raise the alarm as they learn why, \nafter returning home, they are short of breath, or experiencing \nheadaches or other symptoms and in some cases developing cancer.\n  Many other independent organizations have also urged action on this \nissue, including the American Lung Association which has stated that:\n\n       Emissions from burning waste contain fine particulate \n     matter, sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide, volatile organic \n     compounds and various irritant gases such as nitrogen oxides \n     that can scar the lungs.\n\n  The registry created by this amendment will help our medical and \nscientific experts better analyze who was exposed and who is suffering.\n  In New Mexico, service members and veterans have begun to come \nforward about their medical conditions. Some, like MSG Jessey Baca, a \nmember of the New Mexico Air National Guard who was stationed in Balad, \nIraq, are facing serious ailments such as cancer and chronic \nbronchiolitis. It is stories like Master Sergeant Baca's which have \nmotivated me to take action on this issue and I urge my colleagues to \nhear the stories of heroes like him in all 50 States.\n  During my meetings with veterans and active duty members of the \nmilitary, I have truly learned how important it is that we act now.\n  Among active duty members there is uncertainty regarding the link \nbetween burn pits and the illnesses that they are suffering from. This \nuncertainty is discouraging service members from coming forward to have \ntheir illness diagnosed because they are fearful about the implications \non their career.\n  A registry will help create the data set needed to bring certainty to \nthe issue because it will improve our understanding of the link between \nthe burn pits and illness. The information will also help DoD better \nunderstand the link and aid their efforts to improve treatment of our \ntroops.\n  The Open Burn Pits Registry Act has bipartisan and bicameral support. \nIn the House, Representative Akin, a Republican, is sponsoring this \nimportant piece of legislation with a strong bipartisan group.\n  I thank all the supporters and champions for our veterans suffering \nfrom these hidden wounds and I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1202\n\n  Mr. President, solar power increases energy security for American \nmilitary installations and our troops in the field.\n  With solar power, our military is less dependent on the surrounding \nelectricity grid or fuel supplies for generators.\n  As a result, the Department of Defense is a leader on utilizing solar \npower--not for environmental reasons, but national security reasons.\n  However, if we are going to use taxpayer funds to support military \nsolar power--which also qualifies for solar energy tax incentives--we \nmust provide a level playing field for U.S. solar manufacturers.\n  Last year's Defense Authorization bill took an important step, by \nclarifying that DOD's Buy American Act requirements apply to solar.\n  Previously, when solar was installed on DOD property, Buy American \nwould not apply because DOD only owned the power, not the panels.\n  While last year's bill attempted to fix this situation, it left 2 \nloopholes:\n  No. 1, first, Buy American requirements still do not apply to many \nDOD facilities, including much of DOD housing, since these facilities \nare leased and not technically ``owned'' by DOD. If we do not close \nthis loophole, several hundred megawatts of DOD taxpayer funded solar \nprojects could go to Chinese firms.\n  No. 2, last year's bill only applied Buy American when solar devices \nare ``reserved for the exclusive use'' of DOD for the ``full economic \nlife.'' Solar power projects often sell back to the grid, so the \ncombined effect of both of\n\n[[Page S7792]]\n\nthese loopholes is that Buy American does not apply to DOD-purchased \nsolar on DOD property.\n  The amendment I am offering today, on behalf of myself and Senator \nSchumer, closes these loopholes and applies Buy American requirements \nto all solar panels that are part of contracts with DOD.\n  If American taxpayer funds are used to improve our military bases' \nenergy security, American solar firms should have an ability to \ncompete.\n  We know that other nations like China are spending vast resources to \nbecome leaders in the solar power market. They do not play by our trade \nrules, and they are taking advantage of our taxpayer funds.\n  This amendment halts that practice, while maintaining all existing \nprovisions of the Buy American Act: nations who are in the WTO are not \ndiscriminated against and existing exemptions such as availability and \ncost still apply.\n  Our amendment is supported by a strong coalition of U.S. solar \nmanufacturers, many of which are based overseas, and U.S. workers and \nlabor unions.\n  I thank Sen. Schumer and his staff for their work on this and I urge \nthe Senate's support.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his remarks. I \nagree with him; it was a lively debate. I also agree with him it is to \nbe desired that kind of debate occurs more often in the Senate. The \nSenator from New Mexico has been very active in the effort to have \nthese kinds of debates by rules changes, which would make these kinds \nof debates a lot more likely, and by other mechanisms.\n  To make an inquiry, did the Senator from New Mexico restore the \nregular order to the Levin-McCain amendment? I missed that.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I did. Let me say to Chairman Levin, not \nonly lively, robust, but very informative. I learned a lot in the \nprocess of listening to him and to Senator McCain and Senator Durbin \nand the other Senators who came down about the issue. I think that is \nthe way the Senate works best: to have the amendments and various \nprovisions of the Defense authorization bill be a part of a lively and \ninformative debate.\n  I thank the Senator for that, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I assume, then, having watched the debate \nand been informed, that the Senator from New Mexico now takes the \nposition that Senator Levin and I do on this issue, and his next \nmission is to convince his colleague from Colorado of the correctness \nof our position?\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. At this point I am still listening and \ntrying to ascertain as much as I can about the actual provisions of the \nDefense authorization bill. But the Senator is correct. There could be \ntrouble in Udall Valley. There might be a split. We do not see that \nyet, but there is a possibility of it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. One thing I have learned about the Senator from New \nMexico is that he does give all issues a fair and objective hearing. He \nlistens and he pays attention and he is informed in his decisions. I \nthank him for taking part in this one.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I also know that when the two of my \ncolleagues--when the chairman and Senator McCain, the ranking member--\ncome together on a prevision and are able to persuade their committee \nto go with it, that says something to the Senate itself, to have that \nbefore the Senate. I want to study it very carefully. I know Senator \nGraham was down here, who has been very active on this issue and has a \ntremendous amount of experience. I look forward to the continuing \ndebate, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico again \nfor the comments, but also tell him how very much impressed I have been \nright from the first day I heard him with his openmindedness on \nsubjects. It is very important that we keep open minds, and he has \nshown just how to do that. We appreciate that on an issue this complex, \nparticularly on the Defense bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, our staff is working on various amendments \nthat we could get approved by both sides. We think there are a number \nof those on which we can get agreement to make progress today. While we \nare going through that process, I would like to point out the front \npage of this morning's Wall Street Journal, I am sorry to note, may be \na harbinger of events that will happen in the future, that will take \nplace in the future, which will be unfortunate for the United States of \nAmerica and indeed tragic for Iraq.\n  The front page of the Wall Street Journal today says ``Standoff Over \nU.S. Airbase in Iraq.''\n\n       A tense standoff between local police and the Iraqi Army \n     played out on Thursday at the gate of the U.S. airbase in the \n     northern city of Kirkuk, where a dispute over land and oil \n     threatens national stability and unity as U.S. forces \n     withdraw.\n       The territorial conflict, between the central government in \n     Baghdad and the semiautonomous Kurdistan region, is just one \n     flash point that some American and Iraqi officials say could \n     boil over after the full pullout of U.S. troops at the end of \n     December.\n       Fears of a clash between Iraqi troops and Kurdish forces \n     were heightened on Thursday when the Kurdish-dominated police \n     in Kirkuk blocked senior Iraqi Army commanders from entering \n     the airbase, where they said they were planning to take over \n     the facility from the U.S. military.\n       The Army officials brought reporters from Iraqi State-owned \n     television to document the handover, in what appeared to be \n     an effort to show the nation that Baghdad was in charge. The \n     central government, headed by Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki, \n     is increasingly eager to project its power ahead of the U.S. \n     pullout.\n\n  This is about a volatile region, particularly in the area around \nKirkuk, which is also symptomatic of the entire northern Iraq border \nbetween Kurdistan, the semiautonomous region of Iraq, and the rest of \nIraq. The area is inhabited by different ethnic groups that range from \nTurkmen to Arab to other nationalities who all inhabit the area. One of \nthe reasons some of us wanted to have a residual force remain in Iraq--\none of actually three major reasons--was because of the tensions in \nthis area which have already bubbled up on several occasions. In fact, \nthere was a point some months ago where two forces were--the Pershmaga, \nthe Kurdish military, and the Iraqi military--close to a shooting \nsituation. The U.S. forces intervened. Obviously, they are not going to \nbe there. Obviously, already before they have even left there has been \na tense standoff at one of the major airbases in Iraq.\n  I greatly fear--I pray not, but I greatly fear that we will see more \nand more of these kinds of tensions between the Kurdish area and the \nrest of Iraq. A lot of it has to do with oil. A lot of it has to do \nwith who is going to control the oil revenues in the area. Other parts \ngo back to the era of Saddam Hussein, where he moved out Kurdish \nindividuals and others and moved in people who were loyal to him. There \nare still enormous land disputes in the area as well. Suffice to say, \nit is a place of great tension. I continue to be deeply worried about \nthis kind of tension which could lead to armed conflict, but also over \ntime, in the view of some, could lead to an actual breakup of Iraq into \nKurdish areas, Sunni areas, and even two different Shia areas of Iraq.\n\n  I am sorry to see this. I am sorry this is happening and that there \nare more people who are predicting greater tensions in the area, but I \nhave to say, I am surprised. I am not surprised. The sad thing about \nall this--I had a rather, shall I say, spirited exchange with the \nSecretary of Defense the other day in the hearing that was held in the \nArmed Services Committee. This isn't a policy matter, this is a not an \nissue of whether we should have French fries served in school lunches. \nThis is an issue we have shed the blood of well over 4,400 young \nAmericans. I greatly fear that the opportunity that was purchased with \ntheir expenditure of American blood and treasure may go all for naught \nbecause of our failure to maintain a residual force in Iraq which, I \nrepeat, was always envisioned when the\n\n[[Page S7793]]\n\nagreement for U.S. withdrawal was made by the previous administration--\nby the way, an agreement I disagreed with at that time.\n  So I hope that when Prime Minister Maliki comes to Washington next \nmonth some of these issues can be ironed out, that we can have greater \ncooperation. But I don't think there is any doubt that right now up in \nthe area of Kirkuk, they are paying much attention to the statements \nthat may be made by the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012. I wish to commend Senator Levin \nand Senator McCain for their leadership in bringing this piece of \nlegislation to the floor. All my colleagues in the Armed Services \nCommittee have done a remarkable job and have done it with great \ndiscipline and dedication and concern for the men and women of our \nArmed Forces and the defense of the Nation.\n  This is the 50th consecutive Defense authorization bill that the \nSenate has considered, and I hope we will soon be able to send it to \nthe President for his signature. We owe this to our service men and \nwomen who are devoting themselves, and indeed their families also, to \nthe protection of the United States.\n  We made difficult decisions in putting together this bill, especially \nin these challenging economic times. We were able to find $26 billion \nin savings from the original budget request the President submitted \nearlier this year. But I am confident this bill provides a budget that \nallows the Department of Defense to combat current threats, plan for \nfuture threats and provide for the welfare and protection of those men \nand women and their families who serve this Nation.\n  I am pleased that at the start of the debate on this important \nmeasure, that we were able to take up and pass Senator Ayotte's \namendment on strategic airlift, which I was pleased to cosponsor. I \nwas, indeed, very impressed with Senator Ayotte's thorough \nunderstanding of this issue, her ability to seize on a point and make \nsure it is fully understood. We were able to also bring together \nleaders of our services, the Department of Defense, TRANSCOM, and the \nAir Force, so that this decision was based on a very thorough analysis. \nWe owe a great deal of thanks to Senator Ayotte for her extraordinary \nperformance in this regard.\n  I am also working on several other amendments that would provide \nadditional assistance, not just to the overall structure of the Defense \nDepartment but also to our military personnel. These deal with \nprotecting the individual service men and women from exploitation by \nbusinesses and by other financial entities. We have taken some steps \ngoing forward with the creation of the new Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau's Office of Service Members Affairs, headed by Holly \nPetraeus, but we have to do more. I hope we can in this bill.\n  I am also proposing amendments that would address some of the \ninconsistencies in the policies of National Guard dual-status \ntechnicians. A further area of concern is better coordination between \nthe mental health care provided by the Department of Defense and the \ncommunity providers, particularly for members of the National Guard and \nReserve and their families. They often don't have the opportunity to be \nclose to a major military installation and so coordination with local \ncommunity providers is so critical to helping these members and their \nfamilies. I hope, again, we can work together to get these provisions \nincluded in the legislation.\n  Let me highlight a few of the measures in the overall legislation \nthat are very important. It authorizes a 1.6-percent across-the-board \npay raise and reauthorizes over 30 types of bonuses and special pays \nfor our men and women in uniform. This is critical in meeting the needs \nof our military personnel.\n  The legislation also authorizes the full funding of the DOD's Mine \nResistant Ambush Protected Vehicle, the MRAP program, which provides \nfor the sustainment of MRAPs and M-ATVs to protect our troops on the \nground. Again, having recently returned about 3 weeks ago from \nAfghanistan, these are critical weapon systems. My colleagues on the \ncommittee who also frequently travel into these war zones will attest \nto that fact. I am pleased we included this provision in the \nlegislation.\n  The proposed legislation also authorizes $11.2 billion for the Afghan \nSecurity Forces Fund to train and equip the Afghan Army and police. \nThis is a $1.6 billion reduction from the President's request. The \nCENTCOM commander, General Mattis, and Lieutenant General Caldwell, who \nwas the commander on the ground, determined that this reduction could \nbe made because of the efficiencies being achieved by the NATO training \nmission in Afghanistan.\n  We have to be much more efficient going forward in terms of \nresources, and we also have to prepare for the long term support, not \nalone but with our international partners, of the creation and \nsustainment of the Afghan National Security Forces. It represents \nprobably the most significant component, long term, of stabilizing \nAfghanistan. We cannot do it alone. There has to be political will and \ncapacity. As we develop this military force, we also have to think \nahead about how we are, not alone but together with our allies, going \nto ensure it is properly resourced in order to be a contributing factor \nin the stability of Afghanistan.\n\n  This year, once again, I also had the privilege of serving as the \nchairman of the Seapower Subcommittee alongside Senator Wicker, whom I \nwish to thank for his thoughtful and significant contribution to the \nlegislation. The Seapower Subcommittee is focused on the needs of the \nNavy, Marine Corps, and the strategic mobility forces. The subcommittee \nput particular emphasis on supporting Marine and naval forces engaged \nin combat operations, improving efficiencies, and applying the savings \nto higher priority programs.\n  The subcommittee specifically included requested funding for two \nVirginia-class submarines, the DDG-1000 Program, the Aircraft Carrier \nReplacement Program, the DDG-51 Aegis Destroyer Program, the Littoral \nCombat Ship (LCS) Program, the LHA  Amphibious Assault Ship, the Joint \nHigh Speed Vessel, the Mobile Landing Platform, and the P-8 maritime \npatrol aircraft. All these weapons systems are important aspects of \nNavy and Marine projection power throughout the world.\n  I am particularly pleased, obviously, about the continued support for \nthe Virginia-class submarine program and the DDG-1000, which are \nintegral parts not only of our national security but of the economy of \nNew England.\n  The subcommittee also included language that would require the \nDepartment of Navy to restructure plans to replace the canceled \nExpeditionary Fighting Vehicle system for the Marine Corps and to \ncomplete an analysis of the Amphibious Combat Vehicle alternatives \nbefore launching into a Marine Personnel Carrier acquisition program. \nEssentially, the Marine Corps is restudying their ability to move \nmarines from ship to shore and then from shore inland to exploit the \nbeachhead, and that careful study is necessary before they make a \ncommitment for future programs for equipment.\n  We also included language that would permit the Navy to use multiyear \nprocurement authority to buy common cockpits and avionic systems for \nthe Navy's H-60 helicopters in the most efficient manner.\n  Let me conclude by once again thanking Senator Wicker, particularly \nfor his help with respect to the Seapower Subcommittee, and thanking \nall my colleagues. I think we have a good piece of legislation before \nus. I hope in the process of amending it, we can improve the bill, and \nI look forward to sending such a bill to the President for his \nsignature.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, my dear friend, for all the work he does on our committee and \nthe other work he does for the Senate.

SENSE OF SENATE ON THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY \n                   ORGANIZATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) \n     historically set a target commitment for member states to \n     spend two percent of their gross domestic product on their \n     defense expenditures.\n       (2) In 2010, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     identified only 5 member states meeting this target for \n     defense expenditures, including the United States, Albania, \n     France, Greece, and the United Kingdom, leaving 23 member \n     states short of meeting the target.\n       (3) Secretary of Defense Robert Gates made the following \n     statement on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on \n     October 14, 2010, in a conversation with reporters: ``[m]y \n     worry is that the more our allies cut their capabilities, the \n     more people will look to the United States to cover whatever \n     gaps are created. . . And at a time when we're facing \n     stringencies of our own, that's a concern for me''.\n       (4) Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in an interview \n     with the BBC on October 15, 2010, stated that ``NATO has been \n     the most successful alliance for defensive purposes in the \n     history of the world, I guess, but it has to be maintained. \n     Now each country has to be able to make its appropriate \n     contributions''.\n       (5) On March 30, 2011, Admiral James G. Stavridis stated in \n     a hearing before the Committee on Armed Services of the House \n     of Representatives that ``[w]e need to be emphatic with our \n     European allies that they should spend at least the minimum \n     NATO 2 percent''.\n       (6) In a speech delivered in Brussels on June 10, 2011, \n     Secretary of Defense Gates further stated that ``[i]n the \n     past, I've worried openly about NATO turning into a two-\n     tiered alliance: Between members who specialize in `soft' \n     humanitarian, development, peacekeeping, and talking tasks, \n     and those conducting the `hard' combat missions. Between \n     those willing and able to pay the price and bear the burdens \n     of alliance commitments, and those who enjoy the benefits of \n     NATO membership - be they security guarantees or headquarters \n     billets - but don't want to share the risks and the costs. \n     This is no longer a hypothetical worry. We are there today. \n     And it is unacceptable''.\n       (7) In that same speech on June 10, 2011, Secretary of \n     Defense Gates added that ``I am the latest in a string of \n     U.S. defense secretaries who have urged allies privately and \n     publicly, often with exasperation, to meet agreed-upon NATO \n     benchmarks for defense spending. However, fiscal, political \n     and demographic realities make this unlikely to happen \n     anytime soon, as even military stalwarts like the U.K have \n     been forced to ratchet back with major cuts to force \n     structure. Today, just five of 28 allies - the U.S., U.K., \n     France, Greece, along with Albania - exceed the agreed 2% of \n     GDP spending on defense''.\n       (8) Secretary of Defense Gates also stated that ``[t]he \n     blunt reality is that there will be dwindling appetite and \n     patience in the U.S. Congress - and in the American body \n     politic writ large - to expend increasingly precious funds on \n     behalf of nations that are apparently unwilling to devote the \n     necessary resources or make the necessary changes to be \n     serious and capable partners in their own defense. Nations \n     apparently willing and eager for American taxpayers to assume \n     the growing security burden left by reductions in European \n     defense budgets''.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) to commend the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for \n     historically providing an extension to the United States \n     security capabilities; and\n       (2) to call upon the President--\n       (A) to engage each of the member states of the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization in a dialogue about the long-\n     term health of the North Atlantic Alliance and strongly \n     encourage each of the member states to make a serious effort \n     to protect defense budgets from further reductions, better \n     allocate and coordinate the resources presently available, \n     and recommit to spending at least two percent of gross \n     domestic product on defense; and\n       (B) to examine and report to Congress on recommendations \n     that will lead to a stronger North Atlantic Alliance in terms \n     of military capability and readiness across the 28 member \n     states, with particular focus on the smaller member states.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

EXPANSION OF MARINE GUNNERY SERGEANT JOHN DAVID \n                   FRY SCHOLARSHIP.\n\n       (a) Expansion of Entitlement.--Subsection (b)(9) of section \n     3311 of title 38, United States Code, is amended by inserting \n     ``or spouse'' after ``child''.\n       (b) Limitation and Election on Certain Benefits.--\n     Subsection (f) of such section is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraph (2) as paragraph (4); and\n       (2) by inserting after paragraph (1) the following new \n     paragraphs:\n       ``(2) Limitation.--The entitlement of an individual to \n     assistance under subsection (a) pursuant to paragraph (9) of \n     subsection (b) because the individual was a spouse of a \n     person described in such paragraph shall expire on the \n     earlier of--\n       ``(A) the date that is 15 years after the date on which the \n     person died; and\n       ``(B) the date on which the individual remarries.\n       ``(3) Election on receipt of certain benefits.--A surviving \n     spouse entitled to assistance under subsection (a) pursuant \n     to paragraph (9) of subsection (b) who is also entitled to \n     educational assistance under chapter 35 of this title may not \n     receive assistance under both this section and such chapter, \n     but shall make an irrevocable election (in such form and \n     manner as the Secretary may prescribe) under which section or \n     chapter to receive educational assistance.''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect on the date that is 90 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1256\n\n      (Purpose: To require a plan for the expedited transition of \n responsibility for military and security operations in Afghanistan to \n                     the Government of Afghanistan)\n\n       On page 484, strike lines 8 through 24 and insert the \n     following:\n       (8) During the course of Operation Enduring Freedom, \n     members of the Armed forces, intelligence personnel, and the \n     diplomatic corps have skillfully achieved the core goal of \n     the United States strategy in Afghanistan, and Secretary of \n     Defense Leon E. Panetta has noted that al Qaeda's presence in \n     Afghanistan has been greatly diminished.\n       (9) On May 1, 2011, in support of the goal to disrupt, \n     dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda, President Obama authorized a \n     United States operation that killed Osama bin Laden, leader \n     of al Qaeda. While the impact of his death on al Qaeda \n     remains to be seen, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates called \n     the death of bin Laden a ``game changer'' in a speech on May \n     6, 2011.\n       (10) Over the past ten years, the mission of the United \n     States has evolved to include a prolonged nation-building \n     effort in Afghanistan, including the creation of a strong \n     central government, a national police force and army, and \n     effective civic institutions.\n       (11) Such nation-building efforts in Afghanistan are \n     undermined by corruption, high illiteracy, and a historic \n     aversion to a strong central government in that country.\n       (12) The continued concentration of United States and NATO \n     military forces in one region, when terrorist forces are \n     located in many parts of the world, is not an efficient use \n     of resources.\n       (13) The battle against terrorism is best served by using \n     United States troops and resources in a counterterrorism \n     strategy against terrorist forces wherever they may locate \n     and train.\n       (14) The United States Government will continue to support \n     the development of Afghanistan with a strong diplomatic and \n     counterterrorism presence in the region.\n       (b) Benchmarks Required.--The President shall establish, \n     and may update from time to time, a comprehensive set of \n     benchmarks to evaluate progress being made toward the \n     objective of transitioning and transferring lead security \n     responsibilities in Afghanistan to the Government of \n     Afghanistan by December 31, 2014.\n       (c) Transition Plan.--The President shall devise a plan \n     based on inputs from military commanders, the diplomatic \n     missions in the region, and appropriate members of the \n     Cabinet, along with the consultation of Congress, for \n     expediting the drawdown of United States combat troops in \n     Afghanistan and accelerating the transfer of security \n     authority to Afghan authorities.\n       (d) Submittal to Congress.--The President shall include the \n     most current set of benchmarks established pursuant to \n     subsection (b) and the plan pursuant to subsection (c) with \n     each report on progress.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1257\n\n      (Purpose: To require a plan for the expedited transition of \n responsibility for military and security operations in Afghanistan to \n                     the Government of Afghanistan)\n\n       On page 484, strike line 22 through line 24 and insert the \n     following:\n       (c) Transition Plan.--The President shall devise a plan \n     based on inputs from military commanders, the diplomatic \n     missions in the region, and appropriate members of the \n     Cabinet, along with the consultation of Congress, for \n     expediting the drawdown of United States combat troops in \n     Afghanistan and accelerating the transfer of security \n     authority to Afghan authorities.\n       (d) Submittal to Congress.--The President shall include the \n     most current set of benchmarks established pursuant to \n     subsection (b) and the plan pursuant to subsection (c) with \n     each report on progress.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1258\n\n  (Purpose: To require the timely identification of qualified census \n  tracts for purposes of the HUBZone program, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. DESIGNATION OF QUALIFIED CENSUS TRACTS.\n\n       (a) Designation.--\n       (1) Identification of hubzone qualified census tracts.--Not \n     later than 2 months after the date on which the Secretary of \n     Housing and Urban Development receives from the Census Bureau \n     the data obtained from each decennial census relating to \n     census tracts necessary for such identification, the \n     Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall identify and \n     publish the list of census tracts that meet the requirements \n     of section 42(d)(5)(B)(ii) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986.\n       (2) Specification of effective dates of designation.--\n       (A) Hubzone effective date.--The Secretary of Housing and \n     Urban Development, after consultation with the Administrator \n     of the Small Business Administration, shall designate a date \n     that is not later than 3 months after the publication of the \n     list of qualified census tracts under paragraph (1) upon \n     which the list published under paragraph (1) becomes \n     effective for areas that qualify as HUBZones under section \n     3(p)(1)(A) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. \n     632(p)(1)(A)).\n       (B) Section 42 effective date.--The Secretary of Housing \n     and Urban Development shall designate a date, which may \n     differ from the HUBZone effective date under subparagraph \n     (A), upon which the list of qualified census tracts published \n     under paragraph (1) shall become effective for purposes of \n     section 42(d)(5)(B)(ii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (3) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection may \n     be construed to affect the method used by the Secretary of \n     Housing and Urban Development to designate census tracts as \n     qualified census tracts in a year in which the Secretary of \n     Housing and Urban Development receives no data from the \n     Census Bureau relating to census tract boundaries.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Small \n     Business Administration shall submit to the Committee on \n     Small Business and Entrepreneurship of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Small Business of the House of Representatives a \n     report that--\n       (1) describes the benefits and drawbacks of using qualified \n     census tract data to designate HUBZones under section 3(p) of \n     the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(p));\n       (2) describes any problems encountered by the Administrator \n     in using qualified census tract data to designate HUBZones; \n     and\n       (3) includes recommendations, if any, for ways to improve \n     the process of designating HUBZones.\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I call for the regular order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in a short while I hope we will have, and \nexpect that we will have, some amendments that have been cleared on \nboth sides that we are going to be able to offer and hopefully adopt.\n  What I thought I would do now is make a fairly lengthy statement \nabout statements which have been made relative to the detainee \nprovisions in S. 1867. First, I want to comment on the statements that \nwere made in the Statement of Administration Policy--this is a so-\ncalled SAP. So when I refer to SAP during these comments, and I use \nthat term, it is the acronym which means Statement of Administration \nPolicy.\n  I am going to first quote exactly from the SAP, and then I am going \nto\n\n[[Page S7797]]\n\ncomment and show why these statements I am referring to are inaccurate. \nFrom the SAP:\n\n       Section 1031 attempts to expressly codify the detention \n     authority that exists under the authorization for Use of \n     Military Force.\n\n  The authorization for use of military force is referred to as the \nAUMF. The quote continues:\n\n       The authorities granted by the AUMF, including the \n     detention authority, are essential to our ability to protect \n     the American people from the threat posed by al-Qaida and its \n     associated forces, and have enabled us to confront the full \n     range of threats this country faces from those organizations \n     and individuals.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, given how important the administration says \nthese authorities are, it should be helpful to have them codified so \nthey can stand on the strongest possible footing.\n  The next quote:\n\n       Because the authorities codified in this section [1031] \n     already exist, the administration does not believe \n     codification is necessary and poses some risk.\n\n  The quote continues:\n\n       After a decade of settled jurisprudence on detention \n     authority, Congress must be careful not to open a whole new \n     series of legal questions that will distract from our efforts \n     to protect the country.\n\n  The quote continues:\n\n       While the current language minimizes many of those risks, \n     future legislative action must ensure that the codification \n     in statute of express military detention authority does not \n     carry unintended consequences that could compromise our \n     ability to protect the American people.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, section 1031 was written by administration \nofficials for the purpose of codifying existing authority. The \ndescription of persons covered is identical to the position taken by \nthe administration and upheld in the courts. The provision specifically \nprovides that nothing in the provision either limits or expands the \nauthority of the President or the scope of the AUMF.\n  It is also worth noting that the SAP does not support the argument \nmade by some Senators that section 1031 creates a new or unprecedented \nauthority. On the contrary, the Statement of Administration Policy, the \nSAP, acknowledges the provision codifies existing law.\n  Now, this is hardly surprising since the committee accepted all of \nthe administration's proposed changes to section 1031.\n  I am continuing to quote from the Statement of Administration Policy:\n\n       The administration strongly objects to the military custody \n     provision of section 1032, which would appear to mandate \n     military custody for a certain class of terrorism suspects. \n     This unnecessary, untested and legally controversial \n     restriction of the President's authority to defend the Nation \n     from terrorist threats would tie the hands of our \n     intelligence and law enforcement professionals.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, it is interesting that the SAP states the \namendment would ``appear to'' mandate military custody. In fact, it \ndoes not mandate military custody and does not tie the administration's \nhands because it includes a national security waiver which allows \nsuspects to be held in civilian custody.\n  Next quote:\n\n       Moreover, applying this military custody requirement to \n     individuals inside the United States, as some Members of \n     Congress have suggested is their intention, would raise \n     serious and unsettled legal questions and would be \n     inconsistent with the fundamental American principle that our \n     military does not patrol our streets.\n\n  Well, the administration itself asked that we delete limitations in \nsection 1031 on the applicability of detention authority inside the \nUnited States that would have excluded U.S. citizens and lawful \nresidents based on conduct taking place inside the United States to the \nextent authorized by the Constitution. The exact words were ``except to \nthe extent authorized by the Constitution.''\n  If it is appropriate to authorize military detention inside the \nUnited States under section 1031, it is not at all clear what ``serious \nand unsettled legal questions'' in this narrow category of cases could \nbe raised by requiring such detention subject to a national security \nwaiver. Further, nothing in section 1032 would require or even permit \nour military to ``patrol our streets.''\n  Section 1032 applies, by its very term, only to a person ``who has \nbeen captured in the course of hostilities'' authorized by the AUMF. \nThe provision has no applicability to a person who has not already been \nso captured and does not speak to the question of when or where such a \ncapture might be authorized.\n  The provision does not give the military authority to make arrests or \nconduct any law enforcement functions inside the United States.\n  Next quote:\n\n       We have spent ten years since September 11, 2001, breaking \n     down the walls between intelligence, military, and law \n     enforcement professionals; Congress should not now rebuild \n     those walls and unnecessarily make the job of preventing \n     terrorist attacks more difficult.\n\n  In answer to that, it is not clear what walls the administration \nthinks the provision builds. Nothing in this provision limits the \nparticipation of law enforcement or intelligence professionals in the \ninterrogation of detainees in military custody or vice versa or the \nsharing of information.\n  Next quote:\n\n       Specifically, the provision would limit the flexibility of \n     our national security professionals to choose, based on the \n     evidence and the facts and the circumstances of each case, \n     which tool for incapacitating dangerous terrorists best \n     serves our national security interests.\n\n  The provision does not limit the flexibility of the executive branch \nto choose the appropriate tool for taking on terrorists. On the \ncontrary, the provision expressly directs the President to establish \nprocedures for making determinations of coverage, authorizes the \nexecutive branch waiver of military detention requirements where they \ndo apply, and expressly authorizes the transfer of any detainee to \ncivilian custody for trial.\n  The next quote from the SAP:\n\n       The waiver provision fails to address these concerns, \n     particularly in time-sensitive operations in which law \n     enforcement personnel have traditionally played the leading \n     role.\n\n  It is not clear why the administration thinks the use of a waiver \nwould be problematic in time-sensitive operations. The need for a \nwaiver is not triggered until the executive branch determines an \nindividual is covered. The President has control over who makes these \ndeterminations, how they are made, and when they are made, so the \nexecutive branch should not be faced by a determination of coverage for \nwhich it is not ready. And even if, for some reason, executive branch \nofficials were not ready to deal with their own determination, the \nprovision specifically provides that a determination of coverage may \nnot be used to interrupt ongoing surveillance, intelligence gathering, \nor interrogation sessions.\n  The next quote from the SAP:\n\n       These problems are all the more acute because the section \n     defines the category of individuals who would be subject to \n     mandatory military custody by substituting new and untested \n     legislative criteria for the criteria that the Executive and \n     Judicial Branches are currently using for detention under \n     AUMF in both habeas litigation and military operations. Such \n     confusion threatens our ability to act swiftly and decisively \n     to capture, detain, and interrogate terrorism suspects, and \n     could disrupt the collection of vital intelligence about \n     threats to the American people.\n\n  The SAP is wrong. Detention under section 1032 is expressly limited \nto persons for whom detention is authorized under criteria currently \nused by the executive branch and the courts. The new and untested \nlegislative criteria about which the SAP expresses concern is language \nnarrowing the application of the provision to a small category of those \nfor whom detention is already authorized.\n  Also, because the provision addresses only the question of whether an \nindividual should be transferred to military custody after capture, it \nis not clear how it could possibly threaten the ability of executive \nbranch officials to act swiftly and decisively to capture anybody.\n  Because the provision expressly states it may not be applied to \ninterfere with an ongoing surveillance, intelligence gathering, and \ninterrogations, it is not clear how it could possibly threaten the \nability of executive branch officials to interrogate terrorism suspects \nor disrupt the collection of vital intelligence about threats to the \nAmerican people.\n  The next quote from the SAP:\n\n       Rather than fix the fundamental defects of section 1032 or \n     remove it entirely, as the administration and the chairs of \n     several congressional committees with jurisdiction over\n\n[[Page S7798]]\n\n     these matters have advocated, the revised text merely directs \n     the President to develop procedures to ensure the myriad \n     problems that would result from such a requirement do not \n     come to fruition.\n\n  The administration reviewed the language directing the President to \ndevelop procedures and they made several suggestions for improvements \nto that language. The committee adopted all of the administration's \nsuggestions. The remaining change suggested by the administration, \nwhich the committee did not adopt, was a proposal to limit the \napplication of the provision to persons captured abroad. This \ndifference does not constitute a myriad of problems which are complex \nor hard to understand.\n  This is the last comment they make on that section:\n\n       Requiring the President to devise such procedures concedes \n     the substantial risks created by mandating military custody, \n     without providing an adequate solution. As a result, it is \n     likely that implementing such procedures would inject \n     significant confusion into counterterrorism operations.\n\n  The language referred to was included to address concerns expressed \nby the administration. That does not in any way constitute an \nacknowledgment that the concerns were valid. Whether these concerns \nwere valid or not, they have now been resolved by specific language in \nthe revised provision.\n  Continuing:\n\n       The certification and waiver, required by section 1033 \n     before a detainee may be transferred from Guantanamo Bay to a \n     foreign country, continue to hinder the Executive Branch's \n     ability to exercise its military, national security, and \n     foreign relations activities. While these provisions may be \n     intended to be somewhat less restrictive than the analogous \n     provisions in current law, they continue to pose unnecessary \n     obstacles, effectively blocking transfers that would advance \n     our national security interests, and would, in certain \n     circumstances, violate constitutional separation of powers \n     principles. The Executive Branch must have the flexibility to \n     act swiftly in conducting negotiations with foreign countries \n     regarding the circumstances of detainee transfers.\n\n  The provision is not only ``intended to be somewhat less \nrestrictive'' than provisions that are included in previous \nauthorization and appropriations acts signed by the President, it is \nless restrictive. Unlike last year's bill, this provision includes a \nwaiver, which allows the administration to proceed with a transfer even \nif the certification requirements cannot be met.\n  Congress has expressed strong concerns about recidivism among Gitmo \ndetainees who have been released in the past. It cannot be in our \nnational security interests to ``act swiftly'' if we fail to provide \nadequate safeguards against terrorists rejoining the fight against us.\n  In discussions on this issue, administration officials have made a \nsingle priority request--that the provision be made a 1-year limitation \ninstead of a permanent limitation. And the committee agreed to that \nchange.\n\n       Section 1034's ban--\n\n  And I am now continuing the quote from SAP--\n\n     on the use of funds to construct or modify a detention \n     facility in the United States is an unwise intrusion on the \n     military's ability to transfer its detainees as operational \n     needs dictate.\n\n  This provision is the same as the provisions included in last year's \nauthorization and appropriations acts which were signed by the \nPresident. In discussions on this issue, administration officials made \na single priority request--that the provision be made a 1-year \nlimitation instead of a permanent limitation. The committee agreed to \nthat change.\n  The next quote from the SAP:\n\n       Section 1035 conflicts with the consensus-based interagency \n     approach to detainee reviews required under Executive Order \n     No. 13567, which establishes procedures to ensure that \n     periodic review decisions are informed by the most \n     comprehensive information and considered views of all \n     relevant agencies.\n\n  Section 1035 does not conflict with the Executive order of the \ninteragency review process established in the Executive order; rather, \nit requires the issuance of procedures to implement the review process \nrequired by the Executive order.\n  The Executive order states that a Gitmo detainee will not be released \nif the interagency process results in a unanimous recommendation \nagainst release. The Executive order states that a Gitmo detainee will \nbe released if the interagency process results in a unanimous \nrecommendation for release. But it is silent as to what happens if the \nprocess does not result in a unanimous recommendation.\n  The provision in the bill addresses that issue by providing that no \nGitmo detainee will be released without the consent of the Secretary of \nDefense. This does not contradict the Executive order; it is a truism, \nsince nobody can be released without agreement of all of the agencies.\n  In discussions with the committee, administration officials did not \neven raise this provision as a priority issue.\n  Finally, on the Statement of Administration Policy, the SAP:\n\n       Section 1036, in addition to imposing onerous requirements, \n     conflicts with procedures for detainee reviews in the field \n     that have been developed based on many years of experience by \n     military officers and the Department of Defense.\n\n  The only new requirement imposed by section 1036 is the requirement \nfor a military judge and legal representation for any detainee who will \nbe held in long-term custody. In discussions with the committee, the \nadministration did not object to this new requirement. On the contrary, \nthe only change requested by the administration in this provision was \nto strike the words ``long-term.'' The committee did not agree to this \nproposed change because it would have been onerous to impose this \nrequirement in the case of all detainees, including those who are \ncaptured and released or held on a short-term basis.\n  Mr. President, I now would like to move to my comments on some of the \nstatements of the senior Senator from California. The first comment of \nSenator Feinstein that I wish to address is the one where she said: \n``Section 1031 needs to be reviewed to consider whether it is \nconsistent with the September 18, 2001, authorization for use of \nmilitary force.''\n\n  On this one, the committee accepted all of the administration's \nlanguage changes which were written to ensure that the provision is \nconsistent with the AUMF. The provision specifically states it does not \n``limit or expand the authority of the President on the scope of the \nAUMF.'' The SAP on the provision states that ``the authorities codified \nin this section already exist'' under the AUMF.\n  The next quote from the Senator from California is the following. \nSection 1031:\n\n     . . . would authorize the indefinite detention of American \n     citizens without charge or trial. Do we want to go home and \n     tell the people of America that we're going to hold them if \n     such a situation comes up without any review, without any \n     habeas?\n\n  The committee accepted all of the administration's proposed changes \nto section 1031, and as the administration has acknowledged, the \nprovision does nothing more than codify existing law. Indeed, as \nrevised pursuant to administration recommendations, the provision \nexpressly ``affirms'' an authority that already exists. The Supreme \nCourt held in the Hamdi case that existing law authorizes the detention \nof American citizens under the law of war in the limited circumstances \nspelled out here, so this is nothing new.\n  The initial bill reported by the committee included language \nexpressly precluding ``the detention of citizens or lawful resident \naliens of the United States on the basis of conduct taking place within \nthe United States, except to the extent permitted by the Constitution \nof the United States.''\n  The administration asked that this language be removed from the bill. \nMr. President, 1031 does not refer to habeas and in no way limits \nhabeas, nor could it. No American can be held in military detention \nwithout habeas review and no non-American can be held in military \ndetention inside the United States without habeas. For non-Americans \noutside the United States, the bill requires the administration to \nestablish review procedures, including, for the first time, a military \njudge and access to a military lawyer for the status determination.\n  The next quote of the Senator from California is the following. Under \nSection 1032:\n\n     . . . any noncitizen al-Qaida operative captured in the \n     United States would be automatically turned over to military \n     custody. Military custody for captured terrorists may make \n     sense in some cases, but certainly not all.\n\n  Mr. President, Section 1032 does not mandate military custody. It \ndoes not\n\n[[Page S7799]]\n\ntie the administration's hands because--and this is critically \nimportant--it includes a national security waiver which explicitly \nallows any suspect to be held in civilian custody. Nothing is \nautomatic. The administration would have the discretion to waive \nmilitary detention and hold a detainee in civilian custody if it \ndecided to do so.\n  The next quote in the case of Najibullah Zazi:\n\n       If the mandatory military custody in the armed service bill \n     was law--\n\n  The committee bill was law--\n\n     all of the surveillance activities, all of what the FBI did \n     would have to be transferred immediately to the military. . . \n     . Then the government would have been forced to split up co-\n     defendants, even in cases where they otherwise could be \n     prosecuted as part of the same conspiracy.\n       Zazi was a permanent legal resident. His co-conspirators \n     were both U.S. citizens. They would be prosecuted on \n     terrorist charges in Federal criminal court, but Zazi himself \n     would be transferred to military custody. Two different \n     detention and prosecution systems would play out and could \n     well complicate a unified prosecution.\n\n  It is not accurate to say everything the FBI did in the Zazi case \nwould have had to be ``transferred immediately to the military.'' \nFirst, it is not at all clear Zazi was covered by the provision because \nwe don't know that he was al-Qaida, and in any event there is an \nexclusion because he is a lawful resident alien of the United States.\n  Second, until a coverage determination was made, no transfer would be \nrequired and the President would decide how and when that determination \nwould be made.\n  Finally, even if Zazi were somehow determined to be covered, the \nrequirement could have been waived and Zazi could have been kept in \ncivilian custody in the discretion of the executive branch.\n  Also, as to this statement that the executive branch would be forced \nto split up codefendants in the Zazi case, even if he was covered by \nthe provision or in any other case, that is because the provision \nincludes a waiver that would have allowed him to be held in civilian \ncustody from the outset if the executive branch officials decided to do \nso and also because the provision expressly authorizes the transfer of \nany military detainee to civilian custody for trial in the Federal \ncourts even without a waiver. So executive branch officials are always \nable to consolidate cases should they decide to do so in the Federal \ncourts.\n\n  The next statement which the Senator made was the following:\n\n       The Department of Justice has said that approximately one-\n     third of terrorists charged in Federal court in 2010 would be \n     subject to mandatory military detention, absent a waiver from \n     the Secretary of Defense.\n\n  Taking the Justice Department at its word, there have been \napproximately 300 terrorist cases in Federal court over the last 10 \nyears or about 30 a year. One-third of that number would be just 10 \ncases a year in which the executive branch officials would have to make \ndeterminations of coverage and, if necessary, exercise their waiver \nauthority.\n  Even that number appears to be exaggerated. Cases of attempted al-\nQaida attacks on American soil have been highly publicized and receive \nextensive scrutiny, understandably, in Congress. We are not aware of \nmore than half a dozen cases, total, over the last decade. The reason \nthe debate on this issue always seems to come back to the same handful \nof cases appears to be there only are a handful of cases that are \ncovered by this provision potentially.\n  In her next quote:\n\n       The administration contends that the mandatory military \n     custody is unwise because our allies will not extradite \n     terror suspects to the United States for interrogation and \n     prosecution or even provide evidence about suspected \n     terrorists if they will be sent to a military brig or \n     Guantanamo.\n\n  This provision expressly states that the waiver authority may be used \nto address these concerns and to assure an ally that a suspect will not \nbe held in military custody if transferred to the United States and if \nthat assurance is necessary to obtain that transfer. Administration \nofficials suggested a wording change to preclude misinterpretation of \nthis provision and the committee adopted the very wording proposed by \nthe administration.\n  The next quote of the Senator from California is that Section 1033:\n\n     . . . essentially establishes a de facto ban on transfers of \n     detainees out of Guantanamo, even for the purpose of \n     prosecution in United States courts or in other countries.\n\n  There is no limitation at all in the bill on the transfer of Gitmo \ndetainees to the United States for trial or for any other purpose. With \nregard to the transfer to other countries, Section 1033 is less \nrestrictive than current law, which was signed by the President.\n  The next quote I would address is the following. Section 1033:\n\n     . . . requires the Secretary of Defense to make a series of \n     certifications that are unreasonable and candidly unknowable \n     before any detainee is transferred out of Guantanamo. Again, \n     an example, the administration proposed eliminating the \n     requirement that the Secretary of Defense certified that the \n     foreign country from whence the detainee will be sent to is \n     not quote `facing a threat that is likely to substantially \n     affect its ability to exercise its control over the \n     individual.'\n\n  The same language was included in last year's authorization and \nappropriations bills that were signed by the President. We added a \nwaiver provision this year to make it easier to transfer detainees. In \ndiscussion with the committee, the administration made a single \npriority request on this issue; that the provision be made a 1-year \nlimitation instead of a permanent limitation, and the committee agreed \nto that change.\n  Finally, the last quote of the Senator from California from yesterday \nthat I am going to address is the following:\n\n       In March, the President issued an executive order that laid \n     out the process for reviewing each detainee's case to make \n     sure that indefinite detention continues to be an appropriate \n     and preferred course. Section 1035 essentially reverses the \n     interagency process created by the President's order.\n\n  This was the same allegation made by the statement of administration \npolicy. It is erroneous, and I addressed the answer to that allegation \nin my remarks a little earlier today, relative to the statement of \nadministration policy, the SAP, so I am not going to comment further. \nBut I would direct everyone back to those comments on the statement of \nadministration policy similar to that statement of the Senator from \nCalifornia, which I addressed at that time.\n  I appreciate the patience of our Presiding Officer. This was a long \nstatement, but I think it is essential we understand there are issues \nthat need to be debated and should be debated, but there is nothing but \nconfusion created on an issue that is already complex when \nmisstatements are made about what is in a bill of the committee and \nwhat is not in the bill of a committee.\n  The words in the committee bill are words that are clear. They need \nto be debated, but they should not be exaggerated or misinterpreted. \nThis is an important debate. We had a good debate yesterday, and I \nexpect we will complete this debate on Monday so we can vote on these \ndetention provisions and amendments relative thereto of Senator Udall \nhopefully on Monday night.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1087\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and amendment No. 1087, the Leahy FOIA \namendment, be called up and then be set aside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1087.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To improve the provisions relating to the treatment of \n certain sensitive national security information under the Freedom of \n                            Information Act)\n\n       Strike section 1044 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1044. TREATMENT UNDER FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT OF \n                   CERTAIN SENSITIVE NATIONAL SECURITY \n                   INFORMATION.\n\n       (a) Critical Infrastructure Security Information.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Defense may exempt \n     Department of Defense critical infrastructure security \n     information from disclosure under section 552 of title 5, \n     United States Code, upon a written determination that--\n       (A) the disclosure of such information would reveal \n     vulnerabilities in such infrastructure that, if exploited, \n     could result in the disruption, degradation, or destruction \n     of Department of Defense operations, property, or facilities; \n     and\n\n[[Page S7800]]\n\n       (B) the public interest in the disclosure of such \n     information does not outweigh the Government's interest in \n     withholding such information from the public.\n       (2) Information provided to state or local first \n     responders.--Critical infrastructure security information \n     covered by a written determination under this subsection that \n     is provided to a State or local government to assist first \n     responders in the event that emergency assistance should be \n     required shall be deemed to remain under the control of the \n     Department of Defense.\n       (b) Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance System.--\n     The Secretary of Defense may exempt information contained in \n     any data file of the Military Flight Operations Quality \n     Assurance system of a military department from disclosure \n     under section 552 of title 5, United States Code, upon a \n     written determination that the disclosure of such information \n     in the aggregate (and when combined with other information \n     already in the public domain) would reveal sensitive \n     information regarding the tactics, techniques, procedures, \n     processes, or operational and maintenance capabilities of \n     military combat aircraft, units, or aircrews. Information \n     covered by a written determination under this subsection \n     shall be exempt from disclosure under such section 552 even \n     when such information is contained in a data file that is not \n     exempt in its entirety from such disclosure.\n       (c) Delegation.--The Secretary of Defense may delegate the \n     authority to make a determination under subsection (a) or (b) \n     to any civilian official in the Department of Defense or a \n     military department who is appointed by the President, by and \n     with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n       (d) Transparency.--Each determination of the Secretary, or \n     the Secretary's designee, under subsection (a) or (b) shall \n     be made in writing and accompanied by a statement of the \n     basis for the determination. All such determinations and \n     statements of basis shall be available to the public, upon \n     request, through the office of the Assistant Secretary of \n     Defense for Public Affairs.\n       (e) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) The term ``Department of Defense critical \n     infrastructure security information'' means sensitive but \n     unclassified information that could substantially facilitate \n     the effectiveness of an attack designed to destroy equipment, \n     create maximum casualties, or steal particularly sensitive \n     military weapons including information regarding the securing \n     and safeguarding of explosives, hazardous chemicals, or \n     pipelines, related to critical infrastructure or protected \n     systems owned or operated by or on behalf of the Department \n     of Defense, including vulnerability assessments prepared by \n     or on behalf of the Department, explosives safety information \n     (including storage and handling), and other site-specific \n     information on or relating to installation security.\n       (2) The term ``data file'' means a file of the Military \n     Flight Operations Quality Assurance system that contains \n     information acquired or generated by the Military Flight \n     Operations Quality Assurance system, including the following:\n       (A) Any data base containing raw Military Flight Operations \n     Quality Assurance data.\n       (B) Any analysis or report generated by the Military Flight \n     Operations Quality Assurance system or which is derived from \n     Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance data.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I offer an amendment to the National \nDefense Authorization Act, NDAA, that would address an overbroad \nexemption to the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, contained in the \nbill. This amendment is supported by a broad coalition of open \ngovernment groups from across the political spectrum. I hope that the \nSenate will adopt it.\n  For 45 years, the Freedom of Information Act has been a cornerstone \nof open government and a hallmark of our democracy, ensuring that the \nAmerican people have access to their government's records. My amendment \nwill help ensure that FOIA remains a viable tool for access to \ninformation that impacts the health and safety of the American public.\n  I am concerned that the exemption included in the NDAA would allow \nthe Department of Defense to keep secret important information that \nAmericans need to know to protect their own health and safety. For \nexample, there have been alarming reports about the Department of \nDefense keeping citizens in the dark about health hazards, such as \ngroundwater contamination on military facilities, by claiming that this \ninformation was a matter of national security. While I certainly \nunderstand the need for the government to keep certain sensitive \ninformation confidential, I believe this exemption goes too far.\n  This amendment adds a public interest balancing test to the Secretary \nof Defense's determination about whether to withhold critical \ninfrastructure information from the public. This change will help \nensure that truly sensitive information is protected, while allowing \nthe public to obtain important information about potential health and \nsafety concerns. An essentially identical provision is contained in the \nHouse-passed version of this bill.\n  The amendment I offer today will also revise the language in section \n1044 related to Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance Systems to \nensure that truly sensitive flight information is protected, while \nmaintaining the public's interest in obtaining information about the \nsafety of military aircraft.\n  This amendment strikes an appropriate balance between safeguarding \nthe ability of the Department of Defense to perform its vital missions \nand the public's right to know. I hope that all Senators will support \nthis commonsense amendment and that the Senate will adopt it without \ndelay.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of a letter in support of this \namendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                November 17, 2011.\n       Dear Senators: On behalf of the undersigned organizations, \n     we are writing to urge you to support an amendment offered by \n     Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) to fix an over-broad and ill-\n     defined provision relating to ``critical infrastructure \n     information,'' in Section 1044 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act that could prevent the public from having \n     access to critical health and security information.\n       Section 1044, as written in the bill passed by the Senate \n     Armed Services Committee, grants the Secretary of Defense, or \n     his delegate, the authority to expand protections from public \n     disclosure for any information that could result in the \n     ``disruption, degradation, or destruction'' of Department of \n     Defense (DoD) operations, property, or facilities. The \n     language defining ``critical infrastructure information'' is \n     exceedingly broad, encapsulating information that is crucial \n     for the public to understand public health and safety risks \n     and information already protected under one of the Freedom of \n     Information Act's (FOIA) other exemptions.\n       We believe that the provision is intended to address agency \n     concerns about protecting information since the Supreme Court \n     threw out the broad use of FOIA Exemption Two in Milner v. \n     Department of Navy. Granting DoD carte-blanche to withhold \n     information under an exceedingly broad and ill-defined rubric \n     of ``critical infrastructure information'' is not the right \n     step, especially given that DoD has misused such authority to \n     hide information in the past.\n       Between 1957 and 1987, the United States Marine Corps \n     knowingly allowed as many as one million Marines and their \n     family members at Camp Lejeune to be exposed to a host of \n     toxic chemicals, including known human carcinogens benzene \n     and vinyl chloride. Civilian employees who worked on the base \n     and people who live in the communities around the base near \n     Jacksonville, NC, are now reporting a high incidence of \n     cancers. For years, the Marine Corps kept this secret, \n     blocking many attempts to uncover the truth--even after the \n     first news of water contamination broke in 1987. Many FOIA \n     requests for information about the contamination were denied, \n     sometimes using Exemption Two in a way that is no longer \n     allowable after this year's Milner decision. The entire truth \n     about the incident only came to light in part from \n     information accidentally (and temporarily) posted on the \n     internet by the Marine Corps.\n       We support language in Senator Leahy's proposed amendment \n     that helps protect against such cover-ups by requiring DoD to \n     weigh whether there is an over-riding public interest in \n     disclosing the information and further protects public health \n     and safety by tightening the definition of ``critical \n     infrastructure security information'' to make it clear that \n     the Secretary may withhold only information that could \n     substantially increase effectiveness of a terrorist attack. \n     The Leahy Amendment also would slightly modify another \n     exemption to FOIA in Section 1044 for information in the data \n     files of the Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance \n     System, which we support, though we would prefer it to be \n     further narrowed or stricken altogether.\n       We urge you to pass the Leahy Amendment to narrow the \n     overly-broad Section 1044, and welcome an opportunity to \n     discuss this issue with you further.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up the \nLeahy-Grassley amendment No. 1186, Fighting Fraud to Protect Taxpayers \nAct, and it then be set aside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for himself and Mr. \n     Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered 1186.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to have joined once again with \nSenator Grassley to offer the bipartisan Fighting Fraud to Protect \nTaxpayers Act as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization \nAct. Combating fraud is a vital issue on which we have a long track \nrecord of working together, with great success. In these trying \neconomic times, cracking down on fraud, which has harmed so many \nhardworking Americans, is more important than ever.\n  Fraud in military contracting and procurement is a persistent problem \nwhich costs taxpayers millions and hurts our military men and women. \nThis amendment will help the critically important effort to crack down \non fraud in the military and elsewhere, and so including this amendment \nwith the Department of Defense authorization bill makes good sense. I \nurge Senators from both parties to support this amendment.\n  One of the first major bills the last Congress passed was the Leahy-\nGrassley Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act. That bill gave fraud \ninvestigators and prosecutors additional tools and resources to better \nhold those who commit fraud accountable and has led to significant \nsuccesses. Our work is not done though. Our amendment reflects the \nongoing need to invest in enforcement to better protect hardworking \ntaxpayers from fraud.\n  In the last fiscal year alone, the Department of Justice recovered \nwell over $6 billion through fines, penalties, and recoveries from \nfraud cases--far more than it costs to investigate and prosecute these \nmatters. The recovery of these vast sums of money demonstrates that \ninvestment in fraud enforcement pays for itself many times over.\n  The centerpiece provision of the Fighting Fraud to Protect Taxpayers \nAct capitalizes on this rate of return by ensuring that a percentage of \nmoney recovered by the government through fines and penalties is \nreinvested in the investigation and prosecution of fraud cases. That \nmeans that we can ensure more fraud enforcement, more returns to the \ngovernment, and more savings to taxpayers, all without spending new \ntaxpayer money.\n  The bill also makes other modest changes to promote accountability \nand to ensure that prosecutors and investigators, including the Secret \nService, have the tools they need to combat fraud. For example, it \nextends the international money laundering statute to tax evasion \ncrimes and increases key fines. The bill also promotes accountability \nthrough increased reporting and transparency.\n  The renewed focus on fraud enforcement we have seen from Congress and \nthis administration has yielded significant results, but we must \ncontinue to strengthen the tools that law enforcement has to root out \nfraud. Hardworking, taxpaying Americans deserve to know that their \ngovernment is doing all it can to prevent fraud and hold those who \ncommit fraud accountable for their crimes. Fighting fraud and \nprotecting taxpayer dollars are issues Democrats and Republicans have \nlong worked together to address. I thank Senator Grassley for his \ncommitment to these issues, and ask all Senators to support this \namendment.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 1160 and Amendment No. 1253 En Bloc\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for the pending \namendment to be set aside, and to call up amendment No. 1160 and \namendment No. 1253 en bloc.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden] proposes amendments en \n     bloc numbered 1160 and 1253.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1160\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the closure of Umatilla Army Chemical Depot, \n                                Oregon)\n\n       At the end of title XXVII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 2705.

Reserves: temporary retention on active duty after \n              demobilization following extended deployments in \n              contingency operations or homeland defense missions.''.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1160\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this first amendment has previously passed \nthe Senate, and it would solve a problem created by the lawyers at the \nPentagon who, in effect, at the last minute on a critical issue for \neastern Oregon pulled the rug out from under our communities.\n  When we have a problem or conflict in our State, we solve it the \nOregon way, by finding consensus and building common ground. That is \nwhy, when it became apparent 20 years ago that the U.S. Army's chemical \ndepot in Umatilla, OR would be closing once all the chemical weapons \nwere destroyed, the community leaders gathered all of the critical \norganizations together and began the process of planning what to do \nwith the land once the facility closed.\n  The depot straddles two counties, several cities, and historic tribal \nlands. So suffice it to say, there are a lot of folks at home in my \nState who are interested in what happens to the land.\n  As progress was made in destroying the weapons at Umatilla, we were \nable to find consensus. The Federal Government helped. More than $1 \nmillion in grants was made available to move the project along. When \nthe facility was listed in the 2005 BRAC recommendations for closure, \nthe Pentagon eventually recognized the organizations that were involved \nin building this consensus in an official local reuse authority. \nEverything appeared on track, until last summer. That was, in effect, \nthe time when at the last moment the Pentagon changed the rules.\n  After decades of planning and $1 million was spent pulling together \nan extraordinary communitywide consensus, a lawyer at the Pentagon \ndecided to reinterpret the law and declared that the 2005 BRAC report, \nwhich became law when Congress didn't pass a resolution of disapproval, \ndidn't matter. He decided that the Umatilla depot would be closed \noutside of the BRAC authority because the last of the chemical weapons \nwouldn't be destroyed until after the 6-year limit for completion of \nBRAC actions.\n  What this lawyer either didn't know, or chose to ignore, is this was \nprecisely the intention of the BRAC Commission when they put the depot \non the closure list. The BRAC report discusses the fact that the \nmission of destroying the chemical weapons wouldn't be completed until \nafter deadline.\n  On page 239 of the report, the Commission found Secretary Rumsfeld's \nassertion that the chemical demilitarization would be complete by the \nsecond quarter of 2001 was optimistic. The Commission wrote:\n\n       An examination of status information for the depot's \n     mission completion and subsequent closure revealed that dates \n     may slip beyond the six-year statutory period for completing \n     BRAC actions.\n\n  Therefore, the Commission took the Secretary of Defense's \nrecommendation: ``Close Umatilla Chemical Depot, OR'' and changed it \nto: ``On completion of the chemical demilitarization mission, in \naccordance with treaty operations, close Umatilla Chemical Depot, OR.''\n  These facts make it clear that the Commission did not, as this \nPentagon lawyer claimed, make a conditional recommendation that the \nfacility only be closed if the chemical demilitarization mission is \ncompleted by September of 2011. Rather, the Commission acknowledged \nthat the closure will have to happen when the demilitarization mission \nis complete, even if that is after September 2011. That decision by the \nCommission became law.\n  It is also important to note that the Commission was aware that the \ndemilitarization mission had a deadline of its own. Under the terms of \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention treaty, Umatilla had to complete the \nmission by April 29, 2012. The fact is, they actually beat the \ndeadline.\n  The depot should be closed under BRAC so that the will of the \ncommunity in the form of this local reuse authority and the will of \nCongress and the BRAC law will be taken into account. The Pentagon has \nto implement the law as it is, not as it wants it to be. But since the \nlawyers at the Pentagon seem to think there is some ambiguity, I seek \nto clarify it for them with my amendment. The amendment would require \nthe Pentagon to follow the BRAC commission's report and close the \nUmatilla depot under BRAC.\n  Once again, I would like to note that this has already passed the \nSenate once. I am very appreciative of Chairman Levin, Senator McCain, \nand all our colleagues who are involved, and I thank them.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1253\n\n  Briefly--and I appreciate the courtesy of Chairman Levin on this \nmatter--I want to discuss my second amendment, which I call the Soft \nLanding Act. I think we all recognize the extraordinary contributions \nthat are made by our Guard and Reserve. They do tour after tour after \ntour, and we all understand that never in our Nation's history has the \nAmerican military relied more on the Guard and Reserve than it has in \nthe last 10 years. More than 800,000 members of the Guard and Reserve \nhave been called to Active Duty since 9/11. As I indicated, they are \nserving repeated tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I strongly believe that, for the period from when a Guard member is \nholding a rifle to the time when they are holding a child back at home \nin beautiful Oregon, there is not sufficient time being given in order \nto have what I call a soft landing--an opportunity to reintegrate and \nget your life back in order and get back into the community. What we \nhave is a very abrupt period where a soldier faces the trauma of combat \nand comes right back to the community and really does not get an \nadequate time to readjust. Literally in a matter of days, these \nguardsmen go from holding guns in the chaos of a combat zone to holding \ntheir children in the serenity of their own homes. It is a difficult \ntransition.\n\n[[Page S7803]]\n\n  I want to make the point that it is a very different transition than \nmost of our Active-Duty troops have. Many of our Active-Duty troops \ncome back to communities that are close to facilities, close to bases. \nThere is a variety of support services. Many of the guardsmen come back \nto communities that do not have the support of a large base.\n  It seems to me that the amount of personal and professional \nrequirements that are placed on these patriotic, courageous Americans \nwho serve in the Guard and Reserve warrants our making it possible for \nthem to have what I call a softer landing getting back into their home \ncommunities.\n  I am very appreciative that Chairman Levin has given me the \nopportunity to discuss this briefly. He and I and his staff have talked \nabout this before.\n  I will close by saying that to have all these men and women who have \nserved with great valor in the Guard and Reserve coming home--we all \nunderstand they already face an unacceptably high unemployment rate. We \nknow that in many instances they feel strongly about taking the time to \nget mental health services, to get back together again with their \nfamilies, and very often the time period simply is insufficient for \nGuard members who come home. And right now, the reality can be pretty \nharsh. They go and serve their country. Their families are concerned \nabout them being in harm's way for months on end, and then they come \nback with no job and no source of income to be able to support their \nfamilies.\n  What this legislation does is provide a soft landing for Guard and \nReserve members by allowing returning guardsmen and reservists to take \nup to 45 days--it is not a long period of time--to come back, get home, \nget their lives in order, and still get paid. My view is that this is \npart of the promise we have made in this country to take care of our \ntroops. They did their best for us. We ought to do our best for them.\n  I am hopeful that the soft landing amendment, amendment No. 1253, \nwill be included when this legislation passes here in the Senate.\n  I again express my appreciation to Chairman Levin. I know he is \nspeaking on an important matter. I thank him for working on both of \nthese amendments, and I look forward to working with him on these \nmatters. He is our authority on these issues. I appreciate his \ncourtesy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Oregon. We \nare happy to work with him. He is very deeply into these and so many \nother issues. His contribution is well known to all of us in the \nSenate. We are happy to work with him on these matters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I would like to thank the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee for such a thorough analysis of the detainee \nprovisions represented in section 1031 through 1034 of the Defense \nauthorization bill. This is a very important part of the Defense \nauthorization bill, and I certainly appreciate the thoughtful analysis \nthat the chairman did.\n  I would say that his thoughtful and detailed analysis addressed all \nthe red herrings that have been raised about these particular \nprovisions. Because if you read carefully the language in the \nprovisions that were addressed by the Armed Services Committee, they do \nprovide the flexibility that the administration says they have sought \nin making the best decisions on how to treat detainees, particularly \nthose who become members of al-Qaida and come to our country to commit \nan attack against our country. We have to make sure we have the right \nprovisions in place to protect Americans and the flexibility so the \nexecutive branch officials are able to decide what is the best track to \nhandle a particular case or member of al-Qaida who comes to our country \nto, unfortunately, attack us.\n  I also wish to remind this body that these provisions of the Defense \nAuthorization Act were passed out of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee on an overwhelming bipartisan basis. In fact, the entire \nDefense Authorization Act was voted out twice unanimously by the Armed \nServices Committee, including on Monday of this week, when we again \nvoted out the entire provisions of this act unanimously.\n  So the particular provisions the chairman just discussed were the \nresult of extensive discussions not only within the committee but also \nbased upon testimony we heard over months from military officials \nregarding concerns they had about the lack of clarity in our detention \npolicy, and that is where we came to the provisions in 1031 through \n1034.\n  I wish to also remind this body there were many of us who would have \ngone much further in terms of how we would handle members of al-Qaida \nwho come to our country to commit attacks against our citizens or those \nwho would commit attacks against our citizens or soldiers overseas and \nour coalition partners. I brought forth an amendment on the CJS \nappropriations minibus that would have prohibited funding altogether \nfor civilian trials of this same category for terrorists in the United \nStates. So I would have liked to have gone much further. But I respect \nthe amendment the committee voted out, which, in this instance, \naddressed the administration's concerns of allowing the administration \na national security waiver to decide how to handle these cases whether \nthey wanted to take a military track or a civilian track based on the \nnational security interests of our country, which is, of course, what \nhas to be foremost in these cases.\n  I wish to again remind everyone of the problem we have, which is that \nthe priority, when we are dealing with a member of al-Qaida who is \nseeking to attack our country, has to be intelligence gathering. We \nhave to make sure we give our executive branch agencies the tools they \nneed to be able to gather information to know about future attacks and \nto protect our country.\n  What happens now in our civilian system is, if someone is arrested \nhere, if they are in the civilian system, they are given rights that \nare part of our constitutional system, which is Miranda rights, for \nexample. If they are in custody and there is interrogation, they have \nto be told they have the right to remain silent, that they have a right \nto a lawyer, and that they have a right to speedy presentment. These \ntypes of rights are incredibly important to our civilian system.\n  When we have a terrorist who is a member of al-Qaida, who is a \nforeigner, and who comes to this country to attack our country, the \nfirst thing they hear should not be ``you have the right to remain \nsilent.'' We have to allow our executive branch officials the ability \nto make intelligence gathering the first priority. This amendment \nallows that and gives the executive branch the ability to decide in \nwhich system they want to treat them and to be able to prioritize \nintelligence gathering so we can protect Americans and make sure if \nsomeone who is a member of al-Qaida comes to our country to attack us, \nwe can gather information without immediately having to tell them ``you \nhave the right to remain silent.''\n  That is what is so important with this amendment. It was a bipartisan \ncompromise. As I said, there are Members of the Senate, including \nmyself, who would have liked to have gone much further. But we \naddressed so many of the concerns of the administration they came up \nwith to make sure they had, with these provisions, the ability to not \nhave to interrupt an interrogation, to conduct the interrogation as \nthey saw fit, to make sure they could conduct ongoing surveillance, and \nto decide whether a military or civilian track was best based on our \nnational security interests.\n  I will say just one thing with respect to the transfer provisions and \nthe concerns that have been raised about the provisions set forth for \ntransferring detainees from Guantanamo. This is an area that cried out \nfor some clarification, and it is important that the standard the \ncommittee came up with is in statute. Actually, as the chairman \nmentioned, the reason the committee addressed this is because our \ndefense officials raised some concerns about what the waiver provisions \nshould be from Guantanamo. This has been an area of interest of mine \nbecause of where we are right now with the Guantanamo detainees.\n  Unfortunately, the reality is that 27 percent of those who have been \nreleased from Guantanamo have gotten\n\n[[Page S7804]]\n\nback into the fight and are back trying to kill us, our troops, and our \ncoalition partners. This is an area where it was very important to have \nclear standards: where transfer would only be appropriate in the \ninstances where we could ensure there wouldn't be recidivism so that we \ncould protect our troops and our partners from having to see the very \nsame individuals we had already had in custody at Guantanamo. So the \nprovisions set forth here are very important to have that statutory \nstandard for when transfers can be made and how they should be handled.\n  In fact, I would add, when we think about some of the detainees who \nhave gotten back into theater whom we had in our custody at Guantanamo, \nthey are conducting suicide bombings, recruiting radicals, and training \nthem to kill Americans and our allies. Some of the former Gitmo \ndetainees--and I think unfortunately it is a little bit of a badge of \nhonor now to get back into theater and to be engaged in fighting again. \nSaid al-Shihri and Abdul Zakir represent two examples of former \nGuantanamo detainees who returned to the fight and assumed leadership \npositions in terrorist organizations that are dedicated to killing \nAmericans and our allies. Said al-Shihri has worked his way up to be \nNo. 2 in al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. We had him in our custody \nand, unfortunately, he was released. Abdul Zakir now serves as a top \nTaliban military commander and a senior leader in the Taliban Quetta \nShura again fighting us and our allies.\n  Again, I am concerned that in the world of terrorists it has become a \nbadge of honor to be released from Guantanamo and then to get back into \nthe fight against us. So I just wanted to put in perspective what we \nheard from our senior defense officials over a period of months in the \nArmed Services Committee as to why it is important to have a standard \nthat allows the Department of Defense, under limited circumstances and \nbased on protecting our country, to transfer the detainees, but only \nwhen we have addressed the issue of recidivism and they are assured \nthat these individuals aren't going to get back in theater and try to \nkill American soldiers or our allies. That is why this provision is in \nhere, and I am very pleased it is in here to make sure we address this \nimportant issue to keep Americans protected and our allies protected.\n\n  I will repeat again that this was a bipartisan compromise. This \nmorning the chairman very thoroughly went through each of the issues \nraised in the Statement of Administration Policy. Also, in my view, he \nthoroughly knocked down many of the red herrings that were raised about \nthis provision on the Senate floor yesterday by Senators who are \nseeking to strike this provision from the Defense Authorization Act.\n  It is important that this body pass this Defense authorization. It is \nimportant for not only these provisions, but also so many of the \nprovisions of this Defense authorization that give our troops the tools \nthey need, as we tell them we are here to support them, to make sure we \nmove forward with the Defense authorization, including these important \nprovisions that address how we handle detainees.\n  Again, I wish to thank the chairman of the Armed Services Committee \nfor his leadership on this issue. I know he has worked very hard in \nmeeting with the administration, meeting with those of us on the other \nside of the aisle who actually wanted to go much further in coming up \nwith a very strong, important piece of legislation that will protect \nAmericans and move us forward and provide some clarity in an area where \nwe need clarity to make sure our executive branch officials have the \ntools they need to gather intelligence to protect Americans from the \nterrorist attacks because, unfortunately, those who are members of al-\nQaida still seek to kill us for what we believe, not for anything we \nhave done, and we can't forget that.\n  So I thank the chairman.\n\n\n   Amendments Nos. 1179, 1230, 1137, 1138, 1247, 1246, 1229, 1230 as \n     Modified, 1249, 1071, 1220, 1132, 1248, 1250, and 1118 En Bloc\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE.

The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, before the Chair recognizes our friend from \nAlabama, let me thank the Senator from New Hampshire not just for her \nkind and warm remarks, but also for the great contribution she has made \nto our committee. It has been an extraordinary launch for her, if I may \nput it that way. I think--and I know our Presiding Officer would agree \nwith me on this because he has been a witness as well--it has been a \nmajor contribution.\n  I thank the Senator. She has the kind of experience and is so \ncommitted to the security of this country that the Senator is already \nvenerable as a member of our committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank the chairman. He is very kind, and it has been \nwonderful to serve under his leadership on the Armed Services \nCommittee, of which I would say, one of the great experiences in the \nSenate is that the Armed Services Committee--in a time when people see \nso much partisan--works on a very strong, bipartisan basis to ensure \nour country is protected.\n  With that, I would yield to my colleague who also serves on the Armed \nServices Committee, whom I have great respect for, Senator Sessions \nfrom Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

That has \nbeen a real pleasure.\n  I will join Senator Levin in thanking Senator Ayotte for her \nleadership.

Mr. President, I wish to share a few general comments \nabout where we are. All of us have been confronting, whether we want to \nor not--I think some of us more realistically than others--the debt \nsituation this Nation faces. We are, indeed, borrowing 40 cents of \nevery $1 we spend. That is an unsustainable path. We have already had 3 \nconsecutive years of deficits exceeding $1 trillion, and we are \nprojected to have another trillion-dollar deficit next year.\n  The debt under President Obama has now increased by 42 percent in the \nfirst 3 years of his term in office. It is an unsustainable course. We \nhave to do better.\n  The National Defense Authorization Act represents our committee's \nvision for defense in the future. We have done something about the \nspending problem America has. As we calculate the numbers, we are down \nfrom $548 billion--in actual money spent on the Defense Department last \nyear--to $527 billion this year, an actual reduction, in noninflation-\nadjusted dollars, of over $20 billion, which represents about a 5-\npercent reduction, a 4-percent reduction in defense spending.\n\n[[Page S7809]]\n\n  That is what all of our accounts should be doing. But, indeed, that \nis not happening. In the other aspects of discretionary spending--\ndefense being the largest portion of discretionary spending in the \nCongress--the other agencies and departments are not showing a \nreduction at all. Indeed, they are showing an increase, even after \nnondefense discretionary spending increased 24 percent in the first 2 \nyears under President Obama.\n  Some think the base defense budget has been surging--and it has been \nincreasing over the last decade--but it has increased 84 percent over \nthe past decade. I will note that Medicaid, for example, has increased \nover 100 percent. Food stamps are now up to $80 billion this year. It \nis four times what it was in 2001, from $20 billion to about $80 \nbillion.\n  So defense has not been surging out of proportion, I would suggest, \nto the other spending programs in our government. In fact, it has been \nincreasing, even in this decade long of war against terrorism, at a \nrate that is not excessive, in my view. It has been a pretty \nsignificant increase under realistic controls and not out of proportion \nto what we are concerned about. However, it is looking to be hammered a \ngreat deal more in the future, disproportionate, again, to what is \nhappening in other spending accounts.\n  The Defense Department now is working on a total reduction in \nspending of $489 billion more, which is about 10 percent of what we \nwould expect to spend in the next 10 years. That is because of the \nBudget Control Act we passed in August that required reductions in \nspending in discretionary accounts. The choices so far have been to \nreduce defense spending far more than the other accounts.\n  In addition, if the deficit committee--the 12 supercommittee \nmembers--if they do not reach an accord, we all need to understand \nthere will be an automatic sequester. Many people thought--and I think \nSenators probably thought--if that were to be done, it would be done \nacross the board in an equal way. Not so. If that happens, $600 billion \nadditional would be taken out of defense, and items such as food \nstamps, Medicaid, the earned income tax credit, Social Security--all of \nthose would have no reductions. So it would amount to almost a 20-\npercent reduction in the Defense Department in real dollars over 10 \nyears.\n  It should not have been that way. The agreement should not have \ntargeted the Defense Department in such a Draconian way. We cannot \nallow that to happen.\n  All accounts need to be tightened. Every agency and department has to \ntighten its belt, including the Defense Department, but not \ndisproportionately so.\n  Admiral Mullen said, if this were to occur, it would ``hollow us \nout,'' it could break the Defense Department and our military; so did \nLeon Panetta, President Obama's Secretary of Defense. He said it was \nbasically an unacceptable situation, and he agreed with Admiral Mullen, \nwho was sitting beside him at the time of that testimony, and in \nresponse to questions I asked of him.\n  When I asked him about it--the hearing was on another subject--he \nresponded with passion, Secretary Panetta did, and expressed deep \nconcern about the course of our Defense Department if these cuts were \nto take place.\n  I will quote former Secretary Robert Gates, who served President Bush \nand President Obama. Recently, he said this:\n\n       I think, frankly, the creation of this supercommittee was a \n     complete abdication of responsibility on the part of the \n     Congress. It basically says, ``this is too hard for us. Give \n     us a BRAC. Give us a package where all I have to do is vote \n     it up or vote it down and I don't have to take any personal \n     responsibility for any of the tough decisions.'' So now we're \n     left with this sword of Damocles hanging over the government, \n     hanging over defense, and if these cuts are automatically \n     made, I think that the results for our national security will \n     be catastrophic.\n\n  That is what the former Secretary of Defense, a most respected \nSecretary, said not long ago. So I think that is fundamentally correct, \nthat we are proceeding on a path that disproportionately impacts the \nDefense Department and would be damaging in a way that is not necessary \nand should not happen.\n  A lot of these other programs have been surging out of control with \nproblems after problems--whether it is Solyndra loans that were made, \napparently knowing the company is going under--those kinds of things we \nneed to focus on. To suggest they cannot have any cuts, and all the \ncuts have to fall on defense, or a disproportionate number of them, is \na mistake.\n  I am a firm believer that the Defense Department, and every \ndepartment of our government, has to tighten its belt, and we cannot \ncontinue with business as usual, and we should be having reductions in \nspending in every single bill that is coming before us. But I am afraid \nthe only bill that will actually show an actual reduction in spending \nis the Defense bill, when we have men and women in harm's way right now \non guard to defend our country.\n  I feel we need to get our act together. I am hopeful this committee \nof 12 can reach an accord that would not hammer the Defense Department \nadditionally from the huge cuts they are already being asked to make \nover the next 10 years. Maybe they can help us begin to get on a path \nto fiscal responsibility. But I am doubtful they are going to make a \nbig change. Hopefully, they will make some agreement, but it does not \nlook hopeful we will have the kind of financial alteration of spending \nin America that is necessary to get our country on the right path.\n  After all, Admiral Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nsaid last year that the greatest threat to our national security is our \ndebt. We are already seeing how it impacts us when you see these cuts \nbeing discussed and being threatened.\n  I want to thank Senator Ayotte--a former prosecutor, attorney general \nof New Hampshire--for jumping in right away into the very critical \nissue of detainees and how they should be treated in the United States. \nIn the short time she has been here, she is making a big difference on \nthat.\n  I was involved in it on the Judiciary Committee. I have been involved \nin it on the Armed Services Committee. I am basically exhausted with \nit. I remain flabbergasted. I think you are right, Senator Ayotte. This \nis progress I believe you have made in these negotiations, but I think \nwe have gone too far in many of these ideas already. It does not make \ncommon sense.\n  Let me say a couple of things about it. When a person is at war \nagainst the United States and they are captured in combat activities \nagainst the United States, they are able to be detained. They do not \nhave to be tried. They do not have to be given Miranda rights. They \nhave to comply with the Geneva Conventions about food and the right to \ncommunicate, and, within limits, they can be interrogated. All of those \nthings are part of the Geneva Conventions. And they are to be detained \nuntil the war is over. That is so fundamentally logical. Why in the \nworld would a person who is fighting an enemy and could have killed the \nenemy at one moment and captures them the next moment then be required, \nwhile the war is still ongoing, to release them so they can shoot you \nagain and attack you again?\n  This is perfectly logical. It is part of the history of war, and it \nhas long been established that when you capture enemy combatants, you \ncan detain them until the conflict is over. But we have had this \nobsessive desire and attack by some that the people who have been \ncaptured need to be released, and they insisted that they be released. \nSo they started with the least dangerous members, and they have \nreleased, I guess now, a majority of the people who have been detained. \nAnd among the least dangerous members who have been released, as \nSenator Ayotte says, we now have 27 percent who have been identified as \nin the war, attacking us now, and one of them is one of the top leaders \nin al-Qaida. This was never necessary.\n  Guantanamo is a perfectly logical place to hold these individuals, \nand how it became such a political issue--and President Obama \ncampaigned on it, and Attorney General Eric Holder was out there \ncomplaining about it. Then he gets in as the Attorney General of the \nUnited States, and they commence to make some serious errors, in my \nopinion.\n  One of the biggest errors was to create a presumption that somebody \nwho has been apprehended attacking the United States should be treated \nin civilian courts. I know Senator Ayotte\n\n[[Page S7810]]\n\njust said this earlier, but people need to know. If you are going to \ntry someone in civilian court, you have to give them the Miranda \nimmediately because when they come before the judge, if they made an \nadmission without Miranda, it cannot be used against them. And you have \nto tell them immediately that they are entitled to a lawyer. When you \ncapture people in a war, you don't give them lawyers. That has never \nbeen a part of the rules of war. And they are guaranteed presentment, \nthe right to speedy trial in Federal court within 70 days. They are \nentitled to a preliminary hearing. So all of the other bad guys and \nterrorists now have an opportunity to know that you have captured their \nco-conspirator, perhaps, and are aware of the circumstances and may \nscatter in a way that you would not want to occur.\n  So these are realistic things. So if there is a presumption--first of \nall, I would say all of the cases should be tried in military \ncommissions, if they are tried, and not in civilian court. But \ncertainly the presumption should be that they would be in military \ncommissions because if the presumption, as Attorney General Holder has \ndeclared, is that it is civilian, then you have to do the warning.\n  I remember in one of my hearings, Senator Lindsey Graham, a JAG \nofficer in the Air Force--still trains as a reservist--grilled I \nbelieve it was Attorney General Holder and asked him: Well, what would \nhappen if bin Laden were captured? Would you give him Miranda rights? \nAnd he could not answer the question. He would not answer the question \nbecause under his presumption, if Osama bin Laden were apprehended, he \nshould be given Miranda rights.\n  So that is the nub of the problem we have been wrestling with, and we \nhave had a lot of political rhetoric, in my opinion, attacked President \nBush time and time again. They did not conduct everything perfectly, \nbut many of the attacks on President Bush, his Department of Justice, \nand his military were unfair.\n  Do you know that not a single person in Guantanamo was ever \nwaterboarded, that the U.S. military never participated in that? These \nwere intel interrogations done under limited circumstances to a very \nfew people. Whether they should have been done or not, we can all argue \nand disagree, but the idea that the U.S. military, the Defense \nDepartment, was systematically torturing and abusing prisoners is \nabsolutely untrue. No military under such difficult circumstances has \nperformed so well.\n  Another subject. One of my amendments deals with a subject I have had \nan opportunity to be engaged in for some years. Around 2002, 2003, or \n2004, I led a congressional delegation to Europe dealing with the \nextent of our forces in Europe, how many we have deployed there, and \nthe opportunity we had and maybe the need we have to bring home some of \nthose forces.\n  We were going through a BRAC process in the United States, closing \nbases and consolidating bases. That process did not apply officially to \nEurope and bases around the world. And a number of us were engaged in \nthat. I recall that Senator Saxby Chambliss and Mike Enzi traveled with \nus to Europe, and we examined--went to Germany and Italy and Spain, and \nwe saw the bases that were important to the United States, bases that \nwe really needed and we had good support from our allies on and that \nwould be enduring bases. And there was a plan in place to reduce the \ndeployment in areas where it was less important.\n  So as a matter of background, I would share these thoughts. Since \n2004, the Defense Department has had a plan to transfer two of its four \ncombat brigades in Europe back to the United States as part of a larger \npost-Cold War realignment. However, in April of this year---April of \nthis year--the Department of Defense announced it would maintain three \ncombat brigades and the fourth would not leave Europe until 2015.\n  Earlier this year, Admiral Stavridis told the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee that roughly 80,000 troops remain in Europe. Moving a brigade \ncombat team back to the United States would have cut U.S. forces by \n5,000 personnel.\n  A 2010 plan developed by a congressionally appointed committee found \nthat cutting one-third of the U.S. military presence in Europe and the \nPacific would save billions of dollars over 10 years. I do believe \nsignificant cost savings can be realized. In addition to these savings, \nstationing these troops in the United States would have a stimulative \neffect on State and local economies, with these soldiers and families \nliving in their local economies and being able to stay with their \nfamilies more easily and reducing the number of extensive movements of \npersonnel and families to deploy in different places around the world. \nSo I believe we need stay on track with this plan.\n\n  A February 2011 GAO report found that DOD posture planing guidance \ndoes not require the EUCOM--the European Command--to include \ncomprehensive cost data in its theater posture plan. As a result, DOD \ndoes not have critical information that can be used by decision-makers \nas they deliberate posture requirements.\n  The GAO analysis showed that of the approximately $17 billion \nobligated to the services to support installations in Europe between \n2006 and 2009, approximately $13 billion--78 percent--was for operation \nand maintenance costs. Now, those countries want our people there. It \nbrings American money to their economy--just like we would like to have \na brigade combat in Alabama, New Hampshire, or some other places. It is \ngood for the economy.\n  NATO and European allies, however, are not meeting their defense \nspending obligations. Many of our allies do not meet the EU standard. \nThe United States should not be continuing to subsidize NATO and \nEuropean allies' defense spending. They need to participate some more.\n  I believe there are significant savings that could be found by \nbringing both of these brigade combat teams to the United States, as \nhas been planned.\n  I would ask, is Europe more threatened today than it was 2, 3, 4, 6 \nyears ago? I do not think so. They do not think so. Europeans committed \nto 2 percent of their GDP to be committed to defense, but many of those \nnations are down to 1 percent. They are not even fulfilling their 2 \npercent goal. The United States is at 4 percent of GDP on defense, \nalmost.\n  I think the Europeans need to be prepared to understand that they \ncannot live off the United States. There is a great book by Kagan \ncalled ``Paradise and Power.'' It is very insightful, a very insightful \nbook. It says, in a sense: Europeans are comfortable. Why? Because they \nare under the umbrella of American power. They have been comfortable \nwith that. They do not feel threatened. They are not paying their fair \nshare of the defense burden. And they do not like it when we want to \nbring home troops. Give me a break. It is time to do something about \nthat.\n  I believe all of our allies around the world, whether in the Pacific \nor in Europe or in other areas of the globe, ought to work with us in \npartnership so that we can be most effective in providing some \nstability around the world. But the idea that the United States can \nunilaterally fund a security force for the whole world is unrealistic. \nIt can't be sustained.\n  I just cannot possibly see how we need this many troops in Europe at \nthis point in history. I believe it would be good for our economy to \nhave those troops back home in the United States. You can have the \nbases there that we could surge and meet any challenge in short order. \nI believe that is the right approach.\n  I see my friend, Senator Enzi. We traveled together on that trip to \nEurope a number of years ago to examine the bases that we felt should \nbe permanent and the ones that should be closed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I would like to give my thanks to the \nSenator from Alabama for his comments about the concerns he has about \nour detainee policy and about how important it is that we have the \nright policies in place to protect Americans so that we can prioritize \ngathering intelligence.\n  I also wanted to share in his concerns about what is happening with \nthe supercommittee in terms of the impact on our national security. \nThere is no question that there are areas where we can do much better \nand be more effective with taxpayer dollars on defense\n\n[[Page S7811]]\n\nspending. But we cannot subjugate our national security for our failure \naround here to do our job and to have courage to take on the entire \nbudget and bring ourselves on a path of fiscal responsibility.\n  So I know the Senator from Alabama has been a great leader in this \narea, and I appreciate his comments in that regard.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1249\n\n  Mr. President, I also wanted to speak briefly on an amendment that \nhas already been made pending that Senator McCain and I are \ncosponsoring together.\n  Over the last year, as a new Member of the Senate and the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, one of the concerns I have had is the way we \ndo contracting at the Department of Defense. My overall impression has \nbeen that a third year law student could negotiate much better terms \nfor the United States than we have been negotiating for the country. In \nsome of the negotiations with our defense contracts we end up on the \nhook when contractors don't perform or it takes longer than they \nindicate, and we seem to always bear the financial burden of that.\n  When we look at the fiscal state of the country and where we are, we \nneed to reform that process. That is what drew my interest to this \nissue. Senator McCain has long worked on this issue of reforming our \nacquisition process, and I have great respect for the work he has done \nthere. So we have offered on this National Defense Authorization Act \namendment No. 1249, which would prevent millions of dollars in wasteful \ncontract cost overruns from the Department of Defense on major defense \nacquisition programs and help to ensure that our warfighters have the \nweapons and systems they need to protect our Nation but doing so within \nbudget and on time frames that contractors commit to for our needs to \nmake sure we have what we need to protect our country.\n  According to the Government Accountability Office, in a March 2011 \nreport entitled ``Defense Acquisitions: Assessments of Selected Weapons \nPrograms,'' from fiscal year 2010 collectively, we ran more than $400 \nbillion over budget and were an average of almost 2 years behind \nschedule for major defense acquisitions programs.\n  Today, half of the Department of Defense major defense acquisition \nprograms do not meet cost performance goals. Eighty percent of our \nmajor defense acquisition programs have an increase in unit costs from \ninitial estimates that were given. While there can be many factors that \nexplain the cost overruns, the cost-type contracts have been a \nsignificant contributing factor in why we have these overruns both for \nproduction and development of our major defense acquisition programs. \nWe have to address these cost overruns, particularly at a time when we \nare asking our Department of Defense to reduce spending. We need to get \nthe maximum bang for our buck and hold contractors accountable when \nthey do not perform what we have contracted them for. We need to make \nsure the terms of our contracts are good for the United States and are \nfiscally responsible, and that is what this amendment would do.\n  It would prohibit the use of cost-type contracts for the production \nof major defense acquisition contracts and limit the use of cost-type \ncontracts for major defense acquisition development contracts. This \nrepresents the core investment in our Nation's military, and as these \ncosts increase, and as the Department of Defense faces the looming \nprospect of major budget cuts over the next decade, we have to address \nthis now for our troops and for our national security. We have to get \nthis right.\n  I am hoping for and I ask my colleagues to support this amendment we \nare bringing forward. Again, I would say on behalf of Senator McCain, \nwho has done so much work in this area, reforming our acquisition \nprocess and getting this right is so important to what we are asking \nour military to do right now, which is to do more with less.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n   Amendments Nos. 1146, 1147, 1148, 1204, 1294, 1293, 1206, and 1292\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

The majority leader.\n\n\n                             Reno Wildfire\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Reno, NV, is a beautiful place. It is right \nbelow the great Lake Tahoe, the beautiful Sierra Nevada Mountains. It \nis a beautiful picturesque place.\n  I was troubled this morning to wake up and find that Reno, NV, is in \ntrouble because of a devastating fire. We have more than 500 acres that \nhave been burned, and we have a number of homes that have been \ndestroyed. The problem we have is, because of these beautiful Sierra \nNevada mountains that are towering over Reno, we get devastating winds, \nand those winds are blowing now. The winds are at 60 miles an hour \nwhile they are trying to control this fire. It is ravaging everything \nin its path.\n  So my thoughts are certainly with the families who have lost their \nhomes and the thousands of residents who have been evacuated. The \nPinehaven and Caughlin Ranch neighborhoods at this time have been \nparticularly affected. But this terrible fire is raging across these \nacres in Reno and Washoe County. We have fire crews from all over the \nregion that are trying to stop this disaster, trying to get this \nrampaging fire under control, but the winds are so strong that \nhelicopters can't take off. So there is a lot of help that should be \navailable that isn't because the winds are so difficult and because, as \nI said, the helicopters can't get off the ground.\n  Of course, I called my son Leif as soon as I heard about this. The \nphone was answered by my little granddaughter Nina, who was trying to \nexplain to me what was going on. Her dad--my son--had been called to \nhis best friend's home to try to help him. He had been ordered to \nevacuate. They have no water. Alfredo Alonso's home has no water \nbecause there is a well and the electricity is out so he can't pump \nwater. But my son couldn't make it there because the police stopped \nhim. They wanted no one coming into the neighborhood because they are \nevacuating everyone. But my son and his children--my four \ngrandchildren--seem to be well, and they are quite a ways away from the \nfire.\n  Of course, I express my appreciation to the brave firefighters who \nhave been working around the clock to contain the blaze and to the \ndedicated first responders who acted so quickly to protect lives and \nassist in the evacuation.\n  Mr. President, it is times such as this we understand what happens to \nlocal governments when they have to lay off people--firefighters, \npolice officers. It has happened all over Nevada and all over this \ncountry. We were here, as you remember, a week or two ago trying to get \nassistance for places such as Reno and other communities in America for \ntheir fire and police, but the bill was defeated. But these people who \nare working are shorthanded, so they are\n\n[[Page S7814]]\n\nworking long hours there. It is impossible to say how many lives they \nhave already saved, but they have.\n  So my heart, and all our hearts, go out to the firefighters as they \ncarry on with this difficult work to control the flames and protect the \ncommunities. I will continue to follow the progress of this fire, and, \nof course, I will assist Mayor Bob Cashell and members of the Reno City \nCouncil and the Washoe County Commission with anything they think I can \ndo to help. I support Governor Sandoval's decision to request a Federal \nemergency declaration, as firefighters and first responders are doing \ntheir utmost to contain things.\n  So Reno and all of Washoe County can depend on my support in any way \nthey think I can help, and I will continue, as I have indicated, and I \nindicate for the second time, to monitor this situation very closely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, first of all, let me say to the \nmajority leader that our thoughts and prayers go out to folks in \nNevada, and we certainly hope this emergency situation is rectified in \nthe near term.\n  In Georgia, we had about 400,000 acres destroyed by a forest fire \nback earlier this summer, and it is always a tragedy. Loss of property \nis one thing, but injury and potential loss of life, obviously, is very \nmuch a part of that, and our hearts go out to all the residents. Our \nthanks go out to these brave men and women who are fighting those fires \nout there, as they did in my State, to get them under control.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1304\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside and that my amendment, which is at the desk, be made pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Chambliss] for himself and \n     Mr. Isakson, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Lee, and Mr. Coburn, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1304.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require a report on the reorganization of the Air Force \n                           Materiel Command)\n\n       Strike section 324 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 324. REPORTS ON DEPOT-RELATED ACTIVITIES.\n\n       (a) Report on Depot-level Maintenance and Recapitalization \n     of Certain Parts and Equipment.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Director of the Defense \n     Logistics Agency (DLA), in consultation with the military \n     departments, shall submit to the congressional defense \n     committees a report on the status of the DLA Joint Logistics \n     Operations Center's Drawdown, Retrograde and Reset Program \n     for the equipment from Iraq and Afghanistan and the status of \n     the overall supply chain management for depot-level \n     activities.\n       (2) Elements.--The report required under paragraph (1) \n     shall include the following elements:\n       (A) An assessment of the number of backlogged parts for \n     critical warfighter needs, an explanation of why those parts \n     became backlogged, and an estimate of when the backlog is \n     likely to be fully addressed.\n       (B) A review of critical warfighter requirements that are \n     being impacted by a lack of supplies and parts and an \n     explanation of steps that the Director plans to take to meet \n     the demand requirements of the military departments.\n       (C) An assessment of the feasibility and advisability of \n     working with outside commercial partners to utilize flexible \n     and efficient turn-key rapid production systems to meet \n     rapidly emerging warfighter requirements.\n       (D) A review of plans to further consolidate the ordering \n     and stocking of parts and supplies from the military \n     departments at depots under the control of the Defense \n     Logistics Agency.\n       (3) Flexible and efficient turn-key rapid production \n     systems defined.--For the purposes of this subsection, \n     flexible and efficient turn-key rapid production systems are \n     systems that have demonstrated the capability to reduce the \n     costs of parts, improve manufacturing efficiency, and have \n     the following unique features:\n       (A) Virtual and flexible.--Systems that provide for \n     flexibility to rapidly respond to requests for low-volume or \n     high-volume machined parts and surge demand by accessing the \n     full capacity of small- and medium-sized manufacturing \n     communities in the United States.\n       (B) Speed to market.--Systems that provide for flexibility \n     that allows rapid introduction of subassemblies for new parts \n     and weapons systems to the warfighter.\n       (C) Risk management.--Systems that provide for the \n     electronic archiving and updating of turn-key rapid \n     production packages to provide insurance to the Department of \n     Defense that parts will be available if there is a supply \n     chain disruption.\n       (b) Report on Air Force Materiel Command Reorganization.--\n       (1) Restriction on reorganization activities.--With respect \n     to the planned reorganization of the Air Force Materiel \n     Command announced on November 2, 2011, the Secretary of the \n     Air Force shall make no changes related to organizational \n     alignment, reporting officials, or any other change related \n     to oversight or the duties of system program managers, \n     sustainment program managers, or product support managers who \n     reside at installations where Air Logistics Centers or depots \n     are located until 60 days after the report required under \n     paragraph (2) is submitted to the congressional defense \n     committees.\n       (2) Report.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary of the Air Force shall \n     submit to the congressional defense committees a report \n     containing an analysis of alternatives for alignment and \n     reporting of Air Force System Program Managers and Product \n     Support Managers.\n       (B) Elements.--The report required under subparagraph (A) \n     shall--\n       (i) focus on the impacts to Air Force life cycle \n     management, sustainment, readiness, and overall support to \n     the warfighter that would likely be realized through the \n     various alternatives;\n       (ii) address legal, financial, and other relevant issues;\n       (iii) identify criteria for evaluating alternatives;\n       (iv) include a list of alternatives, including analysis and \n     recommendations relating to the alternatives;\n       (v) describe cost and savings factors; and\n       (vi) focus on how the Air Force should be best organized to \n     conduct life cycle management and sustainment, with overall \n     readiness being the highest priority.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to voice my support for the 2012 \nNational Defense Authorization Act, S. 1867. This is one of the most \nimportant bills the Senate considers each year, and this is the ninth \nDefense authorization bill I have been involved in drafting since being \nelected to the Senate. It sets funding levels and implements policies \nfor the Department of Defense and provides pay raises for our men and \nwomen in uniform.\n  After extended debate, this bill, which authorizes $662 billion for \nthe Department of Defense and national security-related aspects of the \nDepartment of Energy, was passed unanimously out of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. The committee was in a difficult situation this \nyear, considering our Nation's fiscal crisis. As I have firmly believed \nall along, everything, including defense spending, must be on the table \nto address our fiscal circumstances.\n  In the midst of intense budget negotiations, I am pleased we can \noffer and debate a bill that addresses the real need to reduce \ngovernment spending in a responsible and calculated manner. As several \nof my colleagues have already stated on the Senate floor, the National \nDefense Authorization Act cuts a considerable amount from the defense \nbudget, as requested by the President. It is $27 billion less than the \nadministration requested and $43 billion less than the amount \nappropriated for 2011. These were very difficult decisions to make, but \nit was the fiscally responsible thing to do given our Nation's fiscal \nsituation.\n  I am pleased the committee was able to make these cuts without \njeopardizing our national security. Given the unstable state of affairs \naround the world, now is not the time to slash important programs that \nhelp our military carry out their responsibilities. We still have \nwidespread enemies and interests around the world. With this in mind, \nthe bill authorizes $3.2 billion for DOD's Mine Resistant Ambush \nProtected Vehicle fund; authorizes $10.3 billion for U.S. Special \nOperations Command, an increase of 6 percent above fiscal year 2011 \nlevels; and authorizes more than $2.4 billion for DOD's counter-\nimprovised explosive device activities.\n  In recent months, we have seen what a remarkable impact a small, \nelite force of U.S. soldiers can have, and I am pleased this bill \nauthorizes a deserved funding increase for U.S. Special Operations \nCommand in order to expand their resources, training, technology, and \nequipment to accomplish their missions. Along with funding, this bill \nwill extend the authority of Special Operations Forces to provide \nsupport to operations fighting against terrorism around the world.\n  Regarding our ongoing operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere \noverseas, the bill allocates $11.2 billion for training and equipping \nthe Afghan security forces commensurate with recommendations from the \nCommander of\n\n[[Page S7815]]\n\nU.S. Central Command, and fully supports the budget request of $1.75 \nbillion in Coalition Support Funds to reimburse key partner nations \nsupporting U.S. military operations in Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  I am also pleased that I will be leaving later on today, along with \nSenator Burr, and heading to Afghanistan to visit our troops and to \nvisit with our commanders on the ground, both from an intelligence \nstandpoint as well as an operational standpoint. This is the fourth \nThanksgiving I have had the opportunity to be on the ground with our \ntroops and to look them in the eye, with their boots on the ground, and \ntell them how much we, as policymakers, but more importantly we, as \nAmericans, appreciate the great sacrifice each and every one of them is \nmaking and how much we appreciate the great job they are doing of \nprotecting America and protecting Americans.\n  This bill also authorizes $500 million for counterterrorism, \ncapacity-building activities, including targeted efforts in east Africa \nand Yemen, and fully supports the budget request of $524 million to \nsupport the activities of the Office of Security Cooperation in Iraq in \noverseeing and implementing foreign military sales to the Iraqi \nsecurity forces.\n  Keeping in mind the strategic value of our nuclear deterrent and our \nongoing need to modernize and maintain our nuclear triad, the bill \nauthorizes $1.1 billion to continue to develop the Ohio-class \nreplacement program, the SSBN(X), to modernize the sea-based leg of the \nnuclear deterrent system.\n  The U.S. military requires the capability to counter a growing amount \nof nontraditional threats. In this bill, we strengthen our forces on \nthe threat of cyber warfare and the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction and their means of delivery. It is no secret that American \ncomputer networks are the victim of attempted hacking from state and \nnon-state actors around the world on a regular basis. With funds \nauthorized in this bill, the Department of Defense will be able to \nbetter guard against the threat of cyber attacks.\n  I am also pleased that in this bill we were able to focus on the \nwell-being of our brave men and women fighting on the front lines for \nour freedom overseas, as well as their devoted family members back at \nhome who make sacrifices every single day. The bill authorizes $100.6 \nbillion for military personnel, including costs of pay, allowances, \nbonuses, death benefits, and permanent change of station moves. The \nbill also authorizes a 1.6-percent across-the-board pay raise for our \nservice men and women as well as authorizes over 30 types of bonuses \nand special pays aimed at encouraging enlistment, re-enlistment, and \ncontinued service by Active-Duty and Reserve component military \npersonnel. Our attention remains on improving the quality of life of \nthe men and women of the Armed Forces and their families, as well as \nDepartment of Defense civilian personnel, through fair pay, policies, \nand benefits, including first-rate health care, while addressing the \nneeds of wounded, ill, and injured servicemembers and their families.\n  Let me also briefly address the amendment I have just filed. I have \nbeen working for the last several weeks with my colleagues, Senators \nIsakson, Hatch, Lee, Inhofe, and Coburn, on an issue related to the \nreorganization of the Air Force Materiel Command.\n  Let me first say that I support this reorganization. It is the first \nmajor reorganization of the Materiel Command by the Air Force in some \n60 years. I support the Air Force's need and desire to make themselves \nmore efficient and more effective, and for the most part, I believe the \nproposed reorganization will do that.\n  In these tight budget times, when we are all going to have to accept \nstreamlined budgets and resources, some loss of jobs and positions is, \nunfortunately, inevitable, and I realize that. However, there is one \nissue with respect to this proposed reorganization that I think we are \nall having a hard time understanding and that relates to how the \nreorganization may affect the way the Air Force organizes for \nsustainment of weapon systems.\n  The proposed reorganization would take some of the key personnel who \nare helping to orchestrate these sustainment efforts and put them in a \nseparate chain of command from their partners in carrying out those \nsustainment efforts. This is hard to understand. And, in a time when \nour Air Force is working harder than ever and keeping their aircraft in \nthe fleet longer than ever, it is hard to imagine how a change such as \nthe Air Force is proposing here will help sustainment of weapon \nsystems.\n  We are working with the Air Force on this issue, and we are still in \nnegotiations, but this is an issue for which we have yet to receive a \nsatisfactory explanation, and we have not reached a conclusion of this \nissue. I think the Air Force needs to clearly understand that there is \na risk here. There is a risk that this reorganization may have some \nunintended consequences specifically related to the readiness of our \nAir Force. This is serious. We have not seen any explanation for how \nthe Air Force arrived at their proposed course of action on this \nspecific issue or why they think it will improve readiness. I would \nalso note that the way the Air Force is seeking to reorganize in this \nrespect goes against some of the basic principles and recommendations \nof a recent, very thorough report on this specific issue.\n  It is with these issues in mind that we are filing this amendment. I \nvery much look forward to the Air Force's explanations on this issue \nand to having this reorganization be executed in a way that allows the \nAir Force to conserve personnel and resources, organize more \nefficiently, and sustain weapon systems to support the warfighter in \nthe most effective way possible.\n  In conclusion, I am extremely proud of the hard work the Armed \nServices Committee Members and staff have done to put together this \nDefense authorization bill. I would particularly like to compliment our \nleadership, Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain, on the job they \nhave done and their willingness to work with Members of the Committee \non our specific issues--issues such as the one Senator Ayotte and I \ndiscussed on the floor yesterday, along with Senator Graham, Senator \nMcCain, and Senator Levin, regarding detainee policy, of which we have \nnone at the present time and to which folks such as Senator Ayotte have \ngiven a great deal of thought and have come up with some very logical \nways in which we can address this issue of detainees so that we can get \nactionable intelligence from those detainees and, at the same time, \nensure they are treated in ways that are respectful to our system of \njurisprudence on the military side as well as on the civilian side.\n  I want to also say that we have had a couple of hiccups along the \nway, but staff on both sides, the majority and minority, have addressed \nthose hiccups, and we have been working very closely to try to ensure \nthat the issues we raised with staff after the bill was filed have been \naddressed and are in the process of being taken care of.\n  As a reflection of the extremely tight budget environment, we have \ntaken responsible reductions in spending; however, we maintain our \ncommitment to the Armed Forces by providing funds and authorizations to \nprotect our national security and support our men and women on the \nfront lines, as well as their dedicated families here in America.\n  I look forward to the remainder of the debate on this bill when we \nreturn after our Thanksgiving break.\n  To all of our men and women who wear the uniform of the United States \nof America, Happy Thanksgiving.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for his \nleadership on the Armed Services Committee and also for the important \nwork he has been doing as the vice chair of the Intelligence Committee \nto make sure our country is protected. He is particularly knowledgeable \non these issues of how we treat detainees, and we did have a detailed \ncolloquy on the floor. His insight has been so important in making sure \nwe have the right policies in place to protect America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Enzi pertaining to the introduction of S. 1909 \nare located in today's Record under Statements on Introduced Bills and \nJoint Resolutions.)\n\n[[Page S7816]]\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           The National Debt\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I was sorry to hear the supercommittee is in \ntrouble, that they might not be able to agree. Then this morning's \nWashington Post front page headline was ``Debt Panel Failure Won't \nCause Catastrophe.''\n  Every day we do not find a solution, every day we spend is a \ncatastrophe. We have maxed out our credit cards. Here is one way that \ncame to my attention. I was traveling in Wyoming and I checked into the \nhotel for the night. The person checking me in, very embarrassed, said: \nI am sorry, but it will not take your credit card. It was a Federal \ncredit card.\n  I said: Goodness, we are in more trouble than I thought. I gave them \nmy personal credit card and that went right through so I am not sure \nwhere we are. But I know we have maxed out our credit cards and not \njust that but also the symbolic credit cards that we have. We have as \nmuch debt as we probably can sustain and as debt comes due across the \nworld for other countries, it is going to be tougher and tougher to be \nable to sell more debt.\n  We are kind of in the same situation as Greece and Italy, except for \ntwo things. No. 1 is we are a big, flexible country that has pulled \nitself out of terrible situations time and time again, and we will do \nit this time too. We also own our own money supply. That helps.\n  When constituents ask what can they expect, I always start the \nconversation by saying you should expect to get no more than what the \n2008 level was. We increased things considerably after that with the \nstimulus bill and that increased some bases. We have to get back down \nto 2008, just as a beginning.\n  I have to say the President has had a chance to change direction. I \nhave to congratulate the President for naming a deficit commission. I \neven like the people he named to it, with Senator Simpson from Wyoming \nand Erskine Bowles heading up that committee. I think they did some \ntremendous work. I think we should pay more attention to what they had \nto say.\n  I had a little disappointment when the President did his State of the \nUnion speech following their report. He had an opportunity to repaint \nthe same bleak picture that committee painted and America would have \nunderstood better. Although from traveling across our country, and \nparticularly in Wyoming, I know the people there understand it better \nthan Congress does. But he could have changed it by repainting that \npicture and then he could have followed it up with a solution which \nwould have been his budget. Instead, his budget was another stimulus \nplan. It has been voted on by Congress. It was not voted for by \nCongress, it was voted on by Congress, and it was voted 97 to nothing--\nit was defeated. I think the deficit commission report would have done \nmuch better.\n  Congress has also had the chance to change direction--and in some \ncases we have. We have kind of eliminated earmarks. There are still \nsome of them that are slipped in, but we kind of eliminated them. We \nhave a couple new problems. Now we add demonstration projects. We have \nalways had demonstration projects, but now we do it as a substitute for \nearmarks and that is where we allow maybe five States to have an \nopportunity to do a particular program to see if it works. So we fund \nit in a minimal amount--that still is millions. The difficulty is that \nat the end of the period of time for that demonstration project, they \nall work. They are all spectacular. They all would save America if we \njust put it in every single State and funded it from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  It can't happen. We are out of money. There are lots of good ideas \nout there, lots of good ideas that would help. When those ideas are \nproved--the idea with the demonstration is that it would demonstrate \nwell enough how good it is that somewhere at the local level that \nproject would be picked up and done or forgotten. But, no, we do make \nthem a national program and we do fund them forever in chunks of time.\n  Another thing we are doing is that we propose a project and, because \nwe like the word ``pay-for,'' because we should pay for whatever we are \ndoing, we put up a project, we put a 2-year limit on the project, and \nthen we pick a pay-for by showing some program that, if it were \neliminated for 10 years, might bring in that amount of revenue. We \ncannot pay for a 2-year program with 10 years' worth of revenue because \nsomebody is going to spend the rest of that anyway and it may never be \ncollected. A Congress can change its mind all the time. We have to quit \nusing gimmicks and we have to quit adding new programs. What part of \nmaxed out credit cards don't we understand? We have to quit buying \nvotes with dollars we do not have.\n  We do have to address mandatory spending. Social Security and \nMedicare have been a problem for a long time. I remember when I first \ncame to Congress, President Clinton was the President and he called for \na special conference on Social Security. We had 1 day where we got to \nbe initiated into what all the problems were--fantastic speakers. \nWe had a second day where Members of the House and Congress met in \nsmaller committees to work on pieces of the Social Security problem. We \ncame up with a plan and President Clinton looked at the plan and met \nwith us as a group and said: If all of you are willing to put your \nfingerprint on this, we will do it. We can only do it if everybody puts \ntheir fingerprint on it so both parties are responsible for it, and \neverybody in the room agreed to do that.\n\n  Unfortunately, we were distracted a little bit by something called \nMonica Lewinsky, and that bill never came up anywhere.\n  The situation we are in right now is passing bills to fail. Each side \nhas a tendency to put up a bill that has something good in it, packaged \nwith something they like but the other side doesn't like. It is going \nto get defeated on the basis of what each side doesn't like and the \ngood part is left out. That is not going to get anything done for us.\n  We have tried the stimulus bill. We got negligible effects on jobs. \nIt did escalate the basis for budgets and it was the use of one-time \nmoney. That has created some problems for it. We hear that 30,000 \nteachers and firefighters are going to be laid off. That comes from \nsafety money and education money that went to the States. It was one-\ntime money. They cannot use one-time money for a continuing contract. \nIf a State did, yes, they are having to lay off people because the \nstimulus is not being repeated each and every year.\n  Are there solutions? Yes, there are solutions. I am optimistic about \nthe solutions. I do recognize everything has to be on the table and we \nshould all reread the deficit commission report. We have to ask \nconstituents to suggest their own programs to reduce.\n  In the spring, we will be inundated by a whole lot of people who will \nbe ready to have us support the program that makes a difference in \ntheir life and the life of the community. I always ask them how we are \ngoing to pay for it? They always suggest somebody else's program to \ncancel. There are never any suggestions of how to consolidate within \ntheir own program and do it. They have to do it and each of us in \nCongress needs to evaluate our own programs. Not all of them can be \nsacred cows. I wish to congratulate Senator Rubio and Senator Coons for \na jobs creation bill they have put together. They have taken the \ndiverse bills from both sides of the aisle and several others and \nlooked to see if there was any common thread. All they did was pick out \nthe common thread from each of those and put them into a bill. If both \nsides and others in Congress like it, why would that not pass and pass \nquickly?\n  I congratulate our Congresswoman Lummis, from Wyoming. She is on the \nAppropriations Committee. I think that is the first time we have ever \nhad anybody on the Appropriations Committee. She gets into the details \nof the budget. In fact, she has gotten into details of the budget down \nto very small\n\n[[Page S7817]]\n\namounts, so much that she has been told she is not going to be invited \non any trips with any of the rest of them. That is probably what we \nneed right now, and I congratulate her on her attention to detail.\n  Another thing we have to do is make sure the bills go to committee. I \nhave been a committee chairman. I have been a ranking member. I know \nwhen a bill goes to committee, that is where we can get into the \ndetails of the bill, and we can do nuances. When a bill comes to the \nfloor of the Senate, and it came from the President to the leader and \nthen to us, the amendments we put in are not very workable as far as \nreaching agreement from both sides. They are kind of an up-or-down \nvote. They are very political, and that kind of stymies what we are \ntrying to do.\n\n  We have to quit doing comprehensive bills. We can do them in stages. \nWe can do parts of them. They can be very major parts, but they can be \ndone in parts.\n  I remember reading a book about the compromise of 1850. Henry Clay \nput himself in the hospital trying to pass this huge compromise. When \nhe did, some of his friends took the bill, broke it into parts, four \nparts, and got all the parts passed. Now, there were only four people \nin all of the Senate at that time who voted for all the parts, but all \nthe parts passed. There should be a lesson in there for us. I do follow \nan 80-percent rule; I found we can agree on 80 percent of the issues. \nIf we stick to that 80 percent, we can pick any one issue and we can \nsolve 80 percent of that problem. We can solve 100 percent if we can \nget everybody to think of an alternative way to do that, one sticky \npart that we have polarized for years.\n  Another thing we need to do is eliminate duplication. Senator Coburn \nand I took a look at the primary department that comes under the \njurisdiction of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. \nWe found $9 billion in duplication. Because it is duplication, we \ncannot eliminate $9 billion because there are some who would stay and \ndo the same thing the other group was doing. It stimulated Dr. Coburn \nenough that he looked at all the programs. In all of the programs he \nfound $900 billion worth of duplication.\n  Duplication is not like fraud, waste, and abuse. Fraud, waste, and \nabuse, we don't know how much is out there. We catch a piece at a time, \nand we speculate on how much there is. But duplication is specific \nbecause it is already in the budget.\n  We can look at what they are paid right now, and if we eliminate \nthat, it is a specific amount. When he talks about $900 billion worth \nof duplication, it is $900 billion worth of duplication. We ought to be \nable to get rid of at least $450 billion of that. Half of it could be \nduplication. It is twice as much of what we effectively need.\n  Why did we find $9 billion in one agency and $900 billion by looking \nat all of them? When we go outside the jurisdiction, we find--this one \nalways kind of interests me--financial literacy programs in virtually \nevery department and agency in this Federal Government. If we really \nhave financial literacy, would we be in the position we are in now? I \ndon't think so. So that is a whole lot of duplication. It is \nduplicating each and every agency. If we have only one jurisdiction \nover one agency, that is the only place we can eliminate it.\n  When I got here there were 119 preschool programs. I took a look at \nthem, and there were quite a few of them that were failing according to \ntheir own evaluation--not my evaluation, their own evaluation. We were \nable to get that down to 69 programs. There are 69 preschool programs \nat the present time. Here is the interesting part of that: Only eight \nof those are under the Department of Education. Sixty-one of them are \nin other departments. It seems like we could have consolidation and \nmaybe some elimination of duplication.\n  Also, we have the States and the local governments coming to us and \nsaying: We are out of money. We need money, and we don't have any \nmoney. We cannot afford to help them that way.\n  I have put in a bill to help them collect the sales tax already due \nthem, and this is the marketplace fairness bill that would take care of \ntheir infrastructure and their jobs. So I hope everyone will take a \nlook at that.\n  Finally, another solution would be the Buy Back America Bonds that I \nspoke about just a little while ago.

Mr. President, one of the greatest--if not the greatest \nthreats to the security of our Nation and our ally Israel--is the \nconcerted effort by the Government of Iran to acquire the technology \nand materials to create a nuclear weapon that will alter the balance of \npower in the Middle East, and which would most certainly lead to \nhostilities. To forestall or ideally prevent this scenario, we must use \nALL of the tools of peaceful diplomacy available to us.\n  Simply put, we must do everything in our power to prevent Iran from \nobtaining a nuclear weapon. I am pleased to offer an amendment that \nwill limit Iran's ability to finance its nuclear ambitions by \nsanctioning the Central Bank of Iran, which is complicit in Iran's \nefforts.\n  This amendment will require the President to make a determination \nabout whether the Central Bank of Iran's conduct threatens the national \nsecurity of the United States or its allies based on its facilitation \nof the activities of the Government of Iran that threaten global or \nregional peace and security, its evasion of multilateral sanctions \ndirected against the Government of Iran; its engagement in deceptive \nfinancial practices and illicit transactions, and most importantly its \nprovision of financial services in support of Iran's effort to acquire \nthe knowledge, materials, and facilities to enrich uranium and to \nultimately develop weapons of mass destruction.\n  Last week we learned just how far down the nuclear road Iran has \ncome. The International Atomic Energy Agency's report indicates that \nIran continues to enrich uranium and is seeking to develop as many as \n10 new enrichment facilities; has conducted high explosives testing and \ndetonator development to set off a nuclear charge, as well as computer \nmodeling of a core of a nuclear warhead; and has engaged in preparatory \nwork for a nuclear weapons test. We also learned that an August IAEA \ninspection revealed that 43.5 pounds of a component--used to arm \nnuclear warheads--was unaccounted for in Iran and that Iran is working \non an indigenous design for a nuclear payload small enough to fit on \nIran's long-range Shahab-3 missile, a missile capable to reaching \nIsrael.\n  These revelations--combined with Iran's provocative effort in October \nto assassinate the Saudi Ambassador to the United States--demonstrate \nthat Iran's aggression has taken a violent turn and that we can expect \nthat if it gets a nuclear weapon that it will use that weapon.\n  This amendment will impose sanctions on any foreign financial \ninstitutions that engage in significant transactions with the Central \nBank of Iran, with the exception of transactions in food, medicine, and \nmedical devices. It sends the message that you have a choice--to do \nbusiness with the United States or to do business with Iran.\n  Iran has a history of exporting terrorism--against coalition forces \nin Iraq, in Argentina, Lebanon, and even in Washington; and while \nIran's drive to advance its nuclear weapons program has been slowed by \nU.S. and international sanctions, it remains undeterred. Today, we take \nthe next step to isolate Iran politically and financially.\n  I also look forward to continuing to work with the administration and \nwith my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to achieve our shared \ngoals and to make this a bipartisan initiative.\n  Our efforts to date have been transformative, but Iran has adapted to \nthe sanctions, unanticipated loopholes have allowed the regime to \nadjust and circumvent the sanctions and drive forward its effort to \nachieve a robust nuclear program.\n  We have to be just as prepared to adjust and adapt by closing each \nloophole that arises. By identifying the Central Bank of Iran as the \nIranian regime's partner and financier of its terrorist agenda we can \nbegin to starve the regime of the money it needs to achieve its nuclear \ngoals.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1114\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak on amendment No. \n1114 to S.1867, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2012. The amendment is cosponsored by Senators Snowe, Casey, Leahy, \nGraham, Murkowski, Akaka, Pryor, Brown of Massachusetts, Tester, and \nManchin.\n  This amendment can be explained very simply. It expands the ability \nof Reserve component members and surviving spouses to travel on \nmilitary aircraft when space is available.\n  Members of the National Guard and Reserve and surviving military \nspouses make great sacrifices for our Nation. However, too often these \nindividuals do not receive the benefits they have earned for their \nservice. For example, Reserve component members' and retirees' space-\navailable travel privileges are limited within the United States and \ntheir family cannot travel with them.\n  As we all know, the National Guard and Reserve contributions to our \nNation's defense since 9/11 are invaluable. There is no reason why \ntheir ability to travel on a military aircraft when space is available \nshould be limited or restricted just because they are in the Guard or \nReserve. They have fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. They have lost \ncomrades. Virtually every member of the National Guard in Alaska has \ndeployed in support of Iraq or Afghanistan.\n  Surviving spouses of a military member eligible for retired pay or of \na member killed in the line of duty retain no space-available travel \nprivileges at all after the death of their spouse. Yet they have made a \nlifetime commitment to the military or, in many cases, lost their loved \none in war--the ultimate sacrifice.\n  We must continue to provide support to our surviving spouses and \nrecognize their commitment to our military. As many of our Nation's \nmost senior leaders have said, families are the backbone of the \nmilitary. We must continue to recognize the National Guard and Reserve \nwho are such a vital part of our Nation's defense and homeland \nsecurity.\n  In this time of fiscal constraint, this amendment gives us the \nopportunity to support our National Guard, Reserves, and surviving \nspouses without a cost to taxpayers. The amendment is budget neutral.\n  The amendment is supported by the National Guard Association of the \nUnited States, Air Force Sergeants Association, and the Gold Star \nWives.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in providing better \nbenefits--at no cost--to surviving spouses and Reserve component \nmembers.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1149\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, today I am pleased to speak about my \namendment No. 1149. I would like to thank my cosponsor, Senator \nMurkowski, for her work on this amendment.\n  This amendment is very simple. It authorizes the Air Force to enter \ninto a land exchange and conveyance in Alaska.\n  The exchange will resolve land-use conflicts between the municipality \nof Anchorage, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, and Eklutna, an Alaska \nNative village.\n  By working out this agreement, we are ensuring the airmen and \nsoldiers at the joint base have more land available to continue the \nvital training they need to defend our Nation.\n  All Federal agencies involved support this land exchange and \nconveyance. This includes the Air Force and Bureau of Land Management.\n  I appreciate my colleagues' consideration of this amendment and urge \ntheir support.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today, with my colleagues, \nSenator Collins, Senator Akaka, and Senator Lugar, to support an \namendment to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our government \nby fostering greater integration among the personnel who work on \ncritical national security and homeland security missions.\n  The national security and homeland security challenges that our \nNation faces in the 21st century are far more complex than those of the \nlast century. Threats such as terrorism, proliferation of nuclear and \nbiological weapons,\n\n[[Page S7823]]\n\ninsurgencies, and failed states are beyond the capability of any single \nagency of our government--such as the Department of Defense, DOD; the \nDepartment of State; or the intelligence community--to counter on its \nown.\n  In addition, threats such as terrorism and organized crime know no \nborders and instead cross the so-called foreign/domestic divide--the \nbureaucratic, cultural, and legal division between agencies that focus \non threats from beyond our borders and those that focus on threats from \nwithin.\n  Finally, a new group of government agencies is now involved in \nnational and homeland security. These agencies bring to bear critical \ncapabilities--such as interdicting terrorist finance, enforcing \nsanctions, protecting our critical infrastructure, and helping foreign \ncountries threatened by terrorism to build their economies and legal \nsystems--but many of them have relatively little experience of \ninvolvement with the traditional national security agencies. Some of \nthese agencies have existed for decades or centuries--such as the \nDepartments of Treasury; Justice; and Health and Human Services, HHS--\nwhile others are new since 9/11, such as the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, DHS.\n  As a result, our government needs to be able to apply all instruments \nof national power--including military, diplomatic, law enforcement, \nforeign aid, homeland security, and public health--in a whole-of-\ngovernment approach to counter these threats. We only need to look at \nour government's failure to use the full range of civilian and military \ncapabilities to stymie the Iraqi insurgency immediately after the fall \nof Saddam Hussein's regime in 2003, the government's failure to prepare \nand respond to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and the government's failure \nto share information and coordinate action prior to the attack at Fort \nHood, TX, in 2009, for examples of failure of interagency coordination \nand their costs in terms of lives, money, and the national interest.\n  The challenge of integrating the agencies of the executive branch \ninto a whole-of-government approach has been recognized by \ncongressionally chartered commissions for more than a decade. Prior to \n9/11, the commission led by former Senators Gary Hart and Warren \nRudman, entitled the U.S. Commission on National Security in the 21st \nCentury, issued reports recommending fundamental reorganization to \nintegrate government capabilities, including for homeland security.\n  In 2004, the 9/11 Commission, led by former Governor Tom Kean and \nformer Representative Lee Hamilton, found that the U.S. Government \nneeded reform in order to foster a stronger, faster, and more efficient \ngovernmentwide effort against terrorism.\n  And in 2008, the Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass \nDestruction Proliferation and Terrorism, led by former Senators Bob \nGraham and Jim Talent, called for improving interagency coordination in \nour Nation's defenses against bioterrorism and other weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Congress has long recognized that a key way to better integrate our \ngovernment's capabilities is to provide strong incentives for personnel \nto do rotational assignments across bureaucratic stovepipes. The \npersonnel who serve in our government are our Nation's best and \nbrightest, and they have and will respond to incentives that we \ninstitute in order to improve coordination across our government.\n  In 1986, Congress enacted the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense \nReorganization Act. That legislation sought to break down stovepipes \nand foster jointness across the military services by requiring that \nmilitary officers have served in a position outside of their service as \na requirement for promotion to general or admiral.\n  Twenty-five years later, this requirement has produced a sea change \nin military officers' mindsets and created a dominant military culture \nof jointness.\n  In 2004, Congress enacted the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \nPrevention Act at the 9/11 Commission's recommendation and required a \nsimilar rotational requirement for intelligence personnel. The Director \nof National Intelligence has since instituted rotations across the \nintelligence community as an eligibility requirement for promotion to \nsenior intelligence positions, and this requirement is helping to \nintegrate the 16 agencies and elements of the intelligence community.\n  Finally, in 2005, Congress enacted the Post-Katrina Emergency \nManagement Reform Act to improve our Nation's preparedness for and \nresponses to domestic catastrophes and instituted a rotational program \nwithin the Department of Homeland Security in order to integrate that \nDepartment.\n  This proven mechanism of rotations must be applied to integrate the \ngovernment as a whole on national security and homeland security \nissues. Indeed, the Hart/Rudman Commission called for rotations to \nother agencies and interagency professional education to be required in \norder for personnel to hold certain positions or be promoted to certain \nlevels. And the Graham/Talent Commission called for the government to \nrecruit the next generation of national security experts by \nestablishing a program of joint duty, education, and training in order \nto create a culture of interagency collaboration, flexibility, and \ninnovation.\n  The executive branch has also recognized the need to foster greater \ninteragency rotations and experience in order to improve integration \nacross its agencies. In 2007, President George W. Bush issued Executive \nOrder 13434 concerning national security professional development and \nto include interagency assignments. However, that Executive order was \nnot implemented aggressively toward the end of the Bush administration \nand has languished as the Obama administration pursued other \npriorities.\n  Clearly, it is time for Congress to act and to institute the \npersonnel incentives and reforms necessary to further integrate our \ngovernment and enable it to counter the national security and homeland \nsecurity threats of the 21st century.\n  In June of this year, I joined with Senator Susan M. Collins and \nSenator Daniel K. Akaka to introduce the bipartisan Interagency \nPersonnel Rotation Act of 2011, S. 1268. Companion legislation was \nintroduced in the House of Representatives on a bipartisan basis by \nRepresentative Geoff Davis and Representative John F. Tierney. The \nlegislation was marked up by the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs on October 19, 2011. I am pleased that Senator \nRichard Lugar, ranking member of the Committee on Foreign Relations, \nhas joined as a cosponsor of that bill. Senator Collins, Senator Akaka, \nSenator Lugar, and I are pleased to offer the Interagency Personnel \nRotation Act, with minor modifications from the marked-up version, as \nan amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2012.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to enable executive branch personnel \nto view national security and homeland security issues from a whole-of-\ngovernment perspective and be able to capitalize upon communities of \ninterest composed of personnel from multiple agencies who work on the \nsame national security or homeland security issue.\n  This amendment requires that the executive branch identify \n``Interagency Communities of Interest''--which are subject areas \nspanning multiple agencies and within which the executive branch needs \nto operate on a more integrated basis. Interagency communities of \ninterest could include counterinsurgency, counterterrorism, counter \nproliferation, or regional areas such as the Middle East.\n  This amendment then requires that agencies identify positions that \nare within each interagency community of interest. Government personnel \nwould then rotate to positions within other agencies but within the \nparticular interagency community of interest related to their \nexpertise.\n  Government personnel could also rotate to positions at offices that \nhave specific interagency missions such as the national security staff. \nCompleting an interagency rotation would be a prerequisite for \nselection to certain Senior Executive Service positions within that \ninteragency community of interest. As a result, personnel would have \nthe incentives to serve in a rotational position and to develop the \nwhole-of-government perspective and the network of contacts necessary \nfor integrating across agencies and accomplishing national security and \nhomeland security missions more efficiently and effectively.\n\n[[Page S7824]]\n\n  Let me offer some examples of how this might work.\n  An employee of the U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, \nwho specializes in development strategy could rotate to a DOD \ncounterinsurgency office to advise DOD in planning on how development \nissues should be taken into account in military operations, while a DOD \ncounterinsurgency specialist could rotate to USAID to advise on how \ndevelopment priorities should be assessed in a counterinsurgency.\n  A Treasury employee who does terrorist finance work could benefit \nfrom a rotation to Department of Justice to understand operations to \ntake down terrorist cells and how terrorist finance work can help \nidentify and prosecute their members, while a Justice employee would \nhave the chance to learn from the Treasury's financial expertise in \nunderstanding how sources of funding can affect cells' formation and \nplotting.\n  An HHS employee who specializes in public health could rotate to a \nDOD counterinsurgency office to advise on improving public health in \norder to win over the hearts and minds of the population to counter \ninsurgency, while a DHS employee could rotate to HHS in order to learn \nabout HHS's work to prepare the U.S. public health system for a \nbiological terrorist attack.\n  The cosponsors of this amendment and I recognize the complexity \ninvolved in the creation of interagency communities of interest, the \ninstitution of rotations across a wide variety of government agencies, \nand having a rotation as a prerequisite for selection to certain Senior \nExecutive Service positions. As a result, our legislation gives the \nexecutive branch substantial flexibility--including to identify \ninteragency communities of interest; to identify which positions in \neach agency are within a particular interagency community of interest; \nto identify which positions in an interagency community of interest \nshould be open for rotation and how long the rotations will be; and, \nfinally, which Senior Executive Service positions have interagency \nrotational service as a prerequisite.\n  To be clear, this legislation does not mandate that any agency be \nincluded in an interagency community of interest or the interagency \npersonnel rotations; instead, this legislation permits the executive \nbranch to include any agency or part of an agency as the executive \nbranch determines that our Nation's national and homeland security \nmissions require.\n  Finally, I wish to stress that this amendment is designed to be \nimplemented with no cost to the executive branch.\n  First, this amendment is designed to be implemented without requiring \nany additional personnel for the executive branch. The amendment \nenvisions that rotations will be conducted so that there is a \nreasonable equivalence between the number of personnel rotating out of \nan agency and the number rotating in. That way, no agency will be short \nstaffed as a result of having sent its best and brightest to do \nrotations; each agency will be receiving the best and brightest from \nother agencies.\n  Second, this amendment relies on the office that is currently \nimplementing the executive branch's national security professional \ndevelopment program to implement this framework instituted by this \namendment. This office is currently housed at DOD, and the legislation \nwould move the office and its three employees to the Office of \nManagement and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management, which \nhave oversight responsibility for this framework. Thus, no new staff \nwould be required to administer the framework set forth in the \namendment.\n  Third, this amendment has a 5-year implementation period which \nrequires the executive branch to create two interagency communities of \ninterest--for emergency management, and stabilization and \nreconstruction--to restrict the number of personnel doing rotations to \n20 to 25 per year per each of these two interagency communities of \ninterest, and to restrict the rotations to within a metropolitan area \nin order to avoid any relocation costs.\n  Fourth, this amendment requires that personnel doing a rotation \nreceive the same training by the receiving agency that the receiving \nagency would provide to its own new employees, rather than more \nelaborate training that would incur costs.\n  And fifth, this amendment requires that any reports produced pursuant \nto the amendment be submitted on line rather than published in hard \ncopy.\n  Let me close by answering a common objection to government \nreorganization. To quote the 9/11 Commission:\n\n       An argument against change is that the nation is at war, \n     and cannot afford to reorganize in midstream. But some of the \n     main innovations of the 1940s and 1950s, including the \n     creation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and even the \n     construction of the Pentagon itself, were undertaken in the \n     midst of war. Surely the country cannot wait until the \n     struggle against Islamic terrorism is over.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to take bold action to improve the efficiency \nand effectiveness of our government in countering 21st century national \nsecurity and homeland security threats by promptly adopting this \namendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2012.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/18/senate-section/article/S7824-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         REPEAL OF JACKSON-VANIK TRADE RESTRICTIONS ON MOLDOVA\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise in support of an amendment to the \nNational Defense Authorization Act, which would repeal the Cold War-era \nJackson-Vanik trade restrictions on Moldovan products and thereby \nprovide impetus for closer U.S. strategic engagement between our two \nnations.\n  I have introduced this legislation in the previous three Congresses \nand believe that the time is ripe for Moldova to finally be granted \npermanent normal trade relations. Moldova has been in the WTO since \n2001 but still remains subject to Jackson-Vanik, despite currently \nbeing in full compliance with Jackson-Vanik-related concerns. Until the \nUnited States terminates application of Jackson-Vanik on Moldova, the \nU.S. will not benefit from Moldova's market access commitments nor can \nit resort to WTO dispute resolution mechanisms. While all other WTO \nmembers currently enjoy these benefits, the United States does not.\n  The Republic of Moldova has been evaluated every year and granted \nnormal trade relations with the United States through annual \npresidential waivers from the effects of Jackson-Vanik. The Moldovan \nconstitution guarantees its citizens the right to emigrate and this \nright is respected in practice. Most emigration restrictions were \neliminated in 1991 and virtually no problems with emigration have been \nreported since independence. More specifically, Moldova does not impose \nemigration restrictions on members of the Jewish community. Synagogues \nfunction openly and without harassment. As a result, several past \nadministrations, including this one, have found that Moldova is in full \ncompliance with Jackson-Vanik's provisions.\n  The United States and Moldova have established a strong record of \nachievement in security and non-proliferation cooperation. We have \nencouraged Moldova's ambition of European integration, particularly in \nlight of the new coalition that was swept to power in 2009, the \nAlliance for European Integration.\n  One of the areas where we can deepen U.S.-Moldovan relations is \nbilateral trade. In light of its adherence to freedom of emigration \nrequirements, compliance with threat reduction and cooperation in the \nglobal war on terrorism, the products of Moldova should not be subject \nto the sanctions of Jackson-Vanik.\n  The continued support and encouragement of the United States and the \ninternational community will be key to encouraging the Government of \nMoldova to follow through on important reforms. The permanent waiver of \nJackson-Vanik and establishment of permanent normal trade relations \nwill be the foundation on which further progress in a burgeoning \neconomic, trade, and security partnership can be made.\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nimportant amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/18/senate-section/article/S7824-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7824-S7825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  FDIC\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the Senate an \nissue of critical importance.\n  Last night, the Senate was able to pass by unanimous consent \nlegislation\n\n[[Page S7825]]\n\nthat will provide much needed transparency to the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation process of examining and resolving bank failures.\n  Not only is this an issue that has severely impacted the wellbeing of \nmy state of Georgia, but this Nation is suffering as a whole.\n  There are some communities across the country that are no longer have \na bank to serve them and will continue to suffer on their economic \ndevelopment efforts because the sole bank in their community has \nfailed.\n  Since 2008 there has been over 400 bank failures nationwide. Seventy \nof those failures have occurred in Georgia. This year alone 18 banks in \nGeorgia have failed.\n  While that represents over 27 percent of all the banks in my State, \nthis is not just a Georgia issue.\n  There are nine other States that have extraordinarily high rates of \nfailures including: Florida, Illinois, California, Minnesota, \nWashington, Michigan, Nevada, Missouri, and Arizona.\n  Unfortunately, there will continue to be bank failures in this \ncountry and this bill will provide the Congress with information about \nthe underlying fundamentals that cause these failures.\n  The bill directs the FDIC IG, in consultation with Treasury and \nFederal Reserve IGs to study FDIC policies and practices with regard to \nLoss Share Agreements; the fair application of regulatory capital \nstandards; appraisals; FDIC procedures for loan modifications; and the \nFDIC's handling of Consent Orders and Cease and Desist Orders.\n  Further, the GAO will be directed to a study those questions the FDIC \nIG is unable to fully explore such as the causes of the high number of \nbank failures; procyclical impact of fair value accounting; analysis of \nthe impact of failures on the community; and, the overall effectiveness \nof loss share agreements for resolving banks.\n  The swift passage of this legislation by the House of Representatives \nin July was a rare instance of bipartisan support and a sincere \nacknowledgement to the American people that bank failures on the whole \nneed to be carefully considered by the Congress.\n  The FDIC does a commendable job of ensuring that depositors at banks \nthey regulate are going to be able to access their money in the event \nof a bank failure.\n  I want the FDIC to know that their good work does not go unnoticed by \nthis body, however it is clear that Congress needs more information \nabout the underlying causes of these bank failures and it is imperative \nthat the US Congress send a clear message that ``if there is a better \nway, then we must pursue it.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/18/senate-section/article/S7825-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, over the years, I have visited dozens of \nschools in Illinois, and I have learned more about the childhood \nobesity problem in this country by stepping into the lunch room than I \nhave just about anywhere else. Particularly in disadvantaged \nneighborhoods, school staff tell me that while students might pick up a \npiece of fruit or a serving of vegetables, the first food choice for \nthe majority of students is a large soda and a bag of flaming hot \ncheetos. But for the young people we are asking to perform at ever \nincreasing academic levels, we should be able to provide better options \nfor their meals.\n  Last year, Congress took a big step including provisions to improve \nschool lunches in the reauthorization of the Child Nutrition Act. The \nU.S. Department of Agriculture deserves credit for taking the first \nsignificant steps in 15 years to make school lunches healthier. These \nproposed changes would provide children with a balanced diet that \nincludes more green leafy vegetables, limiting starchy vegetables--like \nfrench fries--to two servings a week, limiting sodium, and boosting \nwhole grains. USDA also proposed that tomato paste could only be \ncounted as a vegetable if a half cup of tomato paste is used. Today, \nonly two tablespoons of tomato paste is considered a serving of a \nvegetable which means schools can serve pizza to fulfill a vegetable \nrequirement and receive Federal subsidies for doing so.\n  I was dismayed to learn that the conferees for the Fiscal Year 2012 \nAgriculture Appropriations legislation have decided to slow or even \nstop some of the new proposed nutrition standards for school meals. The \nUSDA's proposal is science-based and informed by 2009 recommendations \nfrom the Institute of Medicine to reduce childhood obesity and future \nhealth care costs. Rather than uphold these sound recommendations to \npromote children's nutrition, the conferees report will roll back these \nstandards and continue the status quo.\n  But maintaining the status quo comes at a heavy cost. Federal \nsubsidies will support a school lunch menu that is heavy on french \nfries and pizza, ignoring nutrition science and common sense while \ncontributing to our country's childhood obesity epidemic. These policy \nriders will maintain the current standards.\n  Across the country school districts are showing that with creativity \nand determination it is possible to improve school meals on a limited \nbudget. Two years ago Chicago Public Schools made a commitment to try \nto wean kids off the junk food they have grown accustomed to and has \nmoved to improve nutrition standards in school lunches and breakfasts. \nFlaming hot cheetos are still popular but no longer ubiquitous. The \nschool district has exceeded the U.S. Department of Agriculture's \nHealthier U.S. School Challenge Gold Standards and is offering more \nfruits and vegetables, and serving more whole grains. CPS now has one \nof the healthiest nutrition standards in the Nation. There is certainly \nmore work to be done, but the school district has shown how to \nimplement healthier meals on a limited budget and should be hailed as a \nnational leader for affordably delivering healthy food to children.\n  I am deeply disappointed that the conferees have decided to resist \nimplementing better nutrition standards in our schools, rather than \nfighting to reduce childhood obesity among our children. I am \ndisappointed that the voice of powerful interest groups drowned out \nbasic nutritional science and collaborating on strategies to improve \nchildren's options at lunch time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/18/senate-section/article/S7825-3", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7825-S7826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MS.

Ruth has served as a member of the LCADD's board of directors \nsince 1993 and has served as a member of the executive committee since \n2003. In 2008, Ruth was named LCADD Citizen Board Member of the Year \nfor her exceptional work.\n  Currently, the LCADD serves the counties of Adair, Casey, Clinton, \nCumberland, Green, McCreary, Pulaski, Russell, Taylor and Wayne by \nproviding a regional forum to local governments to help identify issues \nand opportunities and then provide leadership in planning and \nimplementing programs that will help improve the quality of life of the \nregion's citizens.\n  Over the years, Ruth's strength of character, adventurous spirit, and \ncare for her fellow man have been a constant echo throughout the many \nsuccesses she has enjoyed in her life. During World War II, Ruth \ntraveled from her home in Pennsylvania to California to work in a \nfactory--her personal contribution to the war effort. Some years\n\n[[Page S7826]]\n\nlater, after marrying her husband Randolph and relocating to Kentucky, \nRuth immediately immersed herself in the local community. She spent her \ntime working side by side with her husband helping to run both a dry \ngoods store and a small-town retail store to support their young family \nwhile simultaneously volunteering and supporting many community \norganizations. She has been chosen for many leadership roles, including \npresident of the local chamber of commerce and delegate to the \nRepublican National Convention.\n  About 15 years ago, Ruth was widowed when Randolph passed \nunexpectedly. Ruth was burdened with the task of liquidating the family \nbusiness and finding a job. Not long after, Ruth began a new career \nwhich lasted for over 17 years when the Lake Cumberland District Health \nDepartment hired Ruth to work with teen mothers through the Clinton, \nMcCreary and Cumberland County Health Departments in the HANDS Program. \nRuth mentored countless young women into becoming responsible mothers, \nemployees and citizens while loving and nurturing their children into \nfeeling special at the same time.\n  Throughout this unintended second career, Ruth continuously found \nherself in situations where the needs were clear but the means to \nachieve them were not always so. Yet, with her determination as her \nguide, she always found a way to meet these daily demands, oftentimes \nreaching into her own pockets when resources were not available, and \nnever complaining.\n  Last summer, Ruth took a road trip to Pennsylvania with her daughter-\nin-law to visit her family and friends. A day or so later, news spread \nback in Kentucky that she had fallen ill, and at her age some feared \nthe worst. But it turned out it was not Ruth that had fallen ill but \nher daughter-in-law--and the ever-resourceful Ruth Smith quite possibly \nsaved the younger woman's life by calling an ambulance and \nadministering CPR until help arrived.\n  Ruth truly loves people, especially those of her community, and they \nrespond in kind. For example, when she decided to retire in July of \nlast year at the age of 85, people from all over came to her retirement \ncelebration to honor her--the impact that she had on those who were \nfortunate enough to know and work with her over the years was evident \nand immeasurable.\n  My dear friend, Ms. Ruth Smith, is an honorable Kentuckian whose \nselflessness and service to her fellow citizens deserves the utmost \nrespect. She dedicated her life to helping her community and improving \nthe lives of her fellow Kentuckians. She leaves behind her a legacy of \ninspiration and hope to all those she touched, and her achievements \nwill not soon be forgotten.\n  I would ask that my Senate colleagues join me in congratulating Ms. \nRuth Smith in receiving the UK Sanders-Brown Center on Aging \nFoundation's Senior Star Award. She is most deserving of this honor, \nand I commend her for all that she has done for our great Commonwealth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/18/senate-section/article/S7826-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      H.R. 2112 CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate voted on the \nconference report to H.R. 2112. Unfortunately, I was not able to cast \nmy vote in support of the conference report because it increased \nspending. By increasing spending, Congress is ignoring the fact that \nour country is facing a $15 trillion debt and $1.3 trillion budget \ndeficit. By Congress refusing to cut Federal spending, we are telling \nthe American public that we are not serious about restoring fiscal \nresponsibility in government and will continue with business as usual.\n  In addition, the bill contains language that would increase the FHA \nloan limits from $625,500 to $729,750, further putting the American \ntaxpayer at risk. Taxpayers are already on the hook for $170 billion in \nbailouts to mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac because of \nirresponsible lending practices. And just last week Fannie and Freddie \nasked for an additional $13.8 billion in Federal funding from the \npockets of hardworking Americans, many of whom are underwater on their \nmortgages. With over 50 percent of homeowners in Arizona underwater on \ntheir mortgages, I cannot support this increase in loan limits that \ncould potentially worsen the disastrous housing market our country is \ncurrently facing.\n  While I appreciate the fact that Congress is doing its job by moving \nappropriations bills, I could not in good conscience have voted in \nsupport of this conference report knowing we are bankrupting our \ncountry. We must make sacrifices now to ensure that our children and \ngrandchildren have the same opportunities that all of us have had \ninstead of handing them a future filled with unsustainable debt and \nlost opportunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/18/senate-section/article/S7826-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MICHELE WYMER\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing Michele Wymer for her outstanding service to her country in \nher role on the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related \nPrograms Subcommittee. Before Michele and her family leave for greener \npastures, I wanted to express my appreciation and thanks for her \nservice to the Senate.\n  For the past five years, Michele has diligently worked on issues \nimportant to America's national security, including those mitigating \nthe devastating impact of HIV/AIDS globally, providing security and \nstability through development assistance, and addressing the needs of \nrefugees. She performed her duties in a professional manner, including \nconducting oversight on the ground in conflict areas such as Chad, \nIraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \nI know I speak for the subcommittee staff in saying that Michele will \nbe missed not only for her good work and professionalism, but also for \nher good humor and compassion.\n  I ask that the Senate join me in recognizing Michele's outstanding \nservice and wishing her family a safe journey and an exciting new \nchapter in their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/18/senate-section/article/S7826-3", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          50TH ANNIVERSARY OF CENTER OF LATIN AMERICAN STUDIES\n\n  Mr. MORAN.

The Center was founded in 1961 to equip KU students to face \nthe political, economic, sociological and geographical realities of our \nworld and, 50 years later, that vision continues. KU's strong ties to \nthe University of Costa Rica have continued, and the Center's \nconnections have expanded in Mexico, the Caribbean and South America. \nThe Center provides students with advanced language and area studies \ntraining, including opportunities for study and research abroad. The \nCenter provides the education and experience Kansans need in order to \npursue successful, satisfying careers as teachers, scholars, and \nbusiness and government professionals in the 21st century.\n  I want to congratulate the Center of Latin American Studies for its \n50 years of commitment to building strong international relations with \nLatin America for the benefit of Kansas and the nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/18/senate-section/article/S7826-4", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7826-S7827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I rise today to \nacknowledge November as National Adoption Month and National Adoption \nDay on Nov. 19, 2011. With over 107,000 children waiting to be adopted \nfrom the U.S. foster care system, I think it is crucial to celebrate \nthe parents, social workers, judges, lawyers, teachers, doctors, \nnurses, police officers, and other dedicated advocates who help \nchildren find safe, permanent and loving homes.\n  It seems quite appropriate that as we prepare to celebrate \nThanksgiving, we also celebrate the ways in which families grow through \nadoption. My own family has been personally touched by adoption, and I \ncan't express enough the positive impact that adoption can have on \nchildren and families.\n  Together, National Adoption Month and National Adoption Day aim to \nraise awareness of the 408,000 children living in the nation's foster \ncare system and encourage individuals to consider opening their homes \nand hearts through adoption. Each year more than 20,000 children age \nout of the foster care system without finding a permanent family to \ncall their own. The majority of these children struggle to\n\n[[Page S7827]]\n\nmeet the demands of adult life on their own. Only 50 percent earn a \nhigh school diploma, barely 3 percent go on to obtain a college degree, \nand one out of four will experience homelessness at some point in their \nlives. While we generally recognize adult independence at age 18, \nchildren rarely stop needing the stability, support and guidance that \nfamilies provide. The benefits of being adopted into a loving home \nextend well into adulthood.\n  Each year I recognize one South Dakota family as Angels in Adoption \nin order to highlight the many ways in which exemplary individuals and \nfamilies across the State have made a positive impact in the lives of \nchildren through adoption. I recently had the opportunity to honor Nora \nand Randy Boesem of Newell, SD, as Angels in Adoption. Nora and Randy \nhave adopted nine children, all of whom are affected by Fetal Alcohol \nSpectrum Disorders and face a range of physical and mental birth \ndefects that occur as a result of alcohol use during pregnancy. In \naddition to their adopted children, the Boesems have opened their home \nto nearly 70 children in foster care over the last 10 years.\n  As a founding member of the bipartisan Congressional Coalition on \nAdoption, which sponsors Angels in Adoption, I am committed to \nassisting children in the United States to find stable, loving and \npermanent homes. Additionally, I support the goals of National Adoption \nDay, which encourage others to adopt children from foster care, build \nstronger ties between local adoption agencies, courts and adoption \nadvocacy organizations, and learn more about children waiting to be \nadopted and the families looking to grow through adoption.\n  I was proud to support the Fostering Connections to Success and \nIncreasing Adoptions Act of 2008 and the recent passage of the Child \nand Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act, which made some of \nthe most important improvements to the foster care and adoption system \nwe have seen in the last 10 years. I am also proud that Members of the \nSenate continue to support ways to make adoption easier and more \naffordable. Since the cost of adoption can be very high, we ought to do \nwhat we can to minimize this initial burden for the exceptional people \nwho provide caring homes for children. Adoption proceedings and legal \nfees for some domestic adoptions can cost more than $40,000. If we ask \nindividuals to care for and adopt children, we must provide some relief \nfrom the financial burdens associated with that care. The adoption tax \ncredit is an effective way to help lessen the financial burden families \nface when adopting a child and I support making the adoption tax credit \npermanent.\n  The commitment of adoptive parents in South Dakota and throughout our \ncountry to provide children with safe, permanent, and loving homes \nwill, of course, have a positive impact on their lives. As we celebrate \nNational Adoption Month and National Adoption Day on November 19, 2011, \nI call on my colleagues to continue finding ways to support the \nchildren, parents, and other important players involved in the child \nwelfare system and to work to ensure all children have stable, \npermanent and loving families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/18/senate-section/article/S7827-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/18/senate-section/article/S7827-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/18/senate-section/article/S7827-3", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:15 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagreed to the amendment numbered 1 of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 394) \nto amend title 28, United States Code, to clarify the jurisdiction of \nthe Federal courts, and for other purposes, and that the House agreed \nto the amendment numbered 2 of the Senate, with an amendment, in which \nit requests the concurrence of the Senate.\n  The message also announced that the House has passed the following \nbill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1637.

S7831-S7835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 1907. A bill to promote transparency by permitting the Public \nCompany Accounting Oversight Board to allow its disciplinary \nproceedings to be open to the public, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing the PCAOB Enforcement \nTransparency Act of 2011 along with Senator Grassley.\n  One of the largest securities frauds in history began unraveling in \nAugust 2001 when an Enron vice president expressed her concern that the \ncompany might ``implode under a series of accounting scandals.'' Enron \ndisclosed a few months later that its historical financial statements \nwere not accurate. A subsequent restatement revealed over that $500 \nmillion in losses had gone unreported. Several other large corporate \nfrauds followed shortly thereafter. For instance, in June 2002, \nWorldCom admitted that it had misrepresented its profitability to \ninvestors.\n  The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs conducted \na series of hearings on the issues that were raised by the revelations \nof Enron and other public companies. The hearings produced a remarkable \nconsensus on a number of underlying causes, including weak corporate \ngovernance, a lack of accountability, and inadequate oversight of \naccountants charged with auditing a public company's financial \nstatements.\n  In order to address the gaps and structural weaknesses revealed by \nthe investigation and hearings, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act \nof 2002. The Senate passed this legislation on a 99 to 0 vote.\n  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act ensured that corporate officers were directly \naccountable for their financial reporting and for the quality of their \nfinancial statements. The new law also created a strong, independent \nboard to oversee the conduct of the auditors of public companies, the \nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board, PCAOB or Board.\n  The board is responsible for overseeing auditors of public companies \nin order to protect investors and further the preparation of \ninformative, accurate, and independent audit reports on the financial \nstatements of public companies. The board operates under the oversight \nof the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC.\n  The PCAOB is responsible for setting auditing standards for auditors \nof public companies, for examining the quality of audits performed by \npublic company auditors, and where necessary, for imposing disciplinary \nsanctions on registered auditors and auditing firms. The PCAOB oversees \nmore than 2,400 registered auditing firms, as well as the thousands of \naudit partners and staff who contribute to a firm's work on each audit.\n  The board's ability to commence proceedings to determine whether \nthere have been violations of its auditing standards or rules of \nprofessional practice is an important component of its oversight. In \norder to determine whether to institute a proceeding, the board's \nenforcement staff conducts a nonpublic investigation and makes a \nrecommendation to the five-member board.\n  However, unlike other oversight bodies, such as the SEC, the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FDIC, \nthe U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, the Financial \nIndustry Regulatory Authority, FINRA, and others, the Board's \ndisciplinary proceedings are not allowed to be public.\n  Unfortunately, over the last several years, bad actors have been \ntaking advantage of this lack of transparency. In April 2011, the \nSubcommittee on Securities, Insurance, and Investment, which I chair, \nconsidered the issue of enhancing the PCAOB's effectiveness by \npermitting the Board to disclose information about its enforcement \nproceedings. PCAOB Chairman James Doty noted that the ``secrecy has a \nvariety of unfortunate consequences'' and\n\n[[Page S7832]]\n\nthis ``state of affairs is not good for investors, for the auditing \nprofession, or for the public at large.''\n  In one example, an accounting firm that was subject to a disciplinary \nproceeding continued to issue no fewer than 29 additional audit reports \non public companies without any of those companies knowing about the \nPCAOB proceedings. Those public companies and their investors were \ncompletely in the dark about the board's decision to both institute \ndisciplinary proceedings and about the progress of those proceedings. \nThe auditor knew about the proceedings, but the investors and public \ncompanies were denied information that was arguably very relevant to \nthe audit relationship.\n  There are additional reasons that the proceedings should be open and \ntransparent. First, the closed proceedings run counter to the public \nproceedings of other oversight bodies, as I have already noted. Indeed, \nnearly all administrative proceedings brought by the SEC against public \ncompanies, brokers, dealers, investment advisers, and others are open, \npublic proceedings.\n  The PCAOB's secret proceedings are not only shielded from the public, \nbut from Congress as well. The public and Congress have a role in \nensuring that not just auditors are held to account, but also that the \nPCAOB is held to account as well for its oversight of the auditors and \naudit firms.\n  Second, the incentive to litigate cases in order to continue to \nshield conduct from the public as long as possible frustrates the \nprocess and requires the expenditure of needless resources by both \nlitigants and the PCAOB. In April, Chairman Doty, who testified before \nthe Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance, and Investment, noted that \n``the fact that PCAOB disciplinary proceedings are required to be \nsecret creates a considerable incentive to litigate.''\n  Third, a recent academic study noted that the public nature of SEC's \nproceedings against companies result in good results. ``Observing a \npublic SEC enforcement action in its industry against a target firm is \nlikely to increase a peer firm's knowledge about SEC activity and cause \nit to revise upward its subjective probability of attracting such an \naction against itself.'' In effect, the study noted that this may serve \nas a deterrent to misconduct because of a perceived increase in \n``getting caught.'' Accordingly, the audit industry would also benefit \nfrom timely, public, and non-secret enforcement proceedings.\n  Our bill will make hearings by the PCAOB, and all related notices, \norders, and motions, open and available to the public unless otherwise \nordered by the board. The board procedure would then be similar to the \nSEC's Rules of Practice for similar matters, where hearings and related \nnotices, orders, and motions are open and available to the public.\n  We need to ensure public proceedings to better protect and serve \ncompanies and investors. I hope our colleagues will join Senator \nGrassley and me in taking the legislative steps necessary to enhance \ntransparency in the PCAOB's enforcement process.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1907\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``PCAOB Enforcement \n     Transparency Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

PUBLICATION OF DETERMINATIONS.\n\n       Section 105(d)(1)(C) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 \n     U.S.C. 7215(d)(1)(C)) is amended by striking ``(once any stay \n     on the imposition of such sanction has been lifted)''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI:\n  S. 1909. A bill to amend title 31, United States Code, to provide for \nthe issuance of Buy Back America Bonds; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ENZI. I rise today to introduce my Buy Back America Bonds bill, \nS. 1909. This bill will not only help raise awareness of our Nation's \ndebt crisis, but it will also give every American the chance to be a \npart of the solution to fix our country's fiscal dilemma. My bill will \nallow Americans to invest in this incredible country and bring foreign-\nheld U.S. debt back to American hands while at the same time reducing \nFederal Government spending. But before I talk about where my bill is \ngoing, I want to explain where I am coming from.\n  In World War II, war bonds were sold to help pay for our Nation's \nnational defense and reduce the amount of debt incurred. People from \nall kinds of backgrounds saved toward purchasing war bonds, often with \nnickels, dimes, and quarters. On the job, people deducted the cost of \nwar bonds from their meager paychecks. Families invested in war bonds \nand saved for the future. During World War II, President Roosevelt even \nasked the Boy Scouts of America to sell war bonds, and they did. Boy \nScouts and Girl Scouts worked with their packs and troops to sell bonds \nto their neighbors and communities. In other words, all across the \ncountry, folks of all walks and types were working together for one \ncollective goal--to do their part for the country's war effort. Men, \nwomen, and children were selling and purchasing these war bonds, all in \nthe name of lending a hand to our fellow countrymen and to pay for the \ncosts of war.\n  I was born during World War II. When I was born, my parents bought me \na war bond. I still have that $20 bond today. Not cashing it was my \nfirst gift to my country, and it is also a keepsake to me.\n  In 1941, when savings bonds were retitled as ``war bonds'' in the \nterrible and devastating aftermath of Pearl Harbor, the United States \nrallied as a collective nation in support of the war and war bond \neffort. At the time, though, the average American only earned about \n$2,000 a year. Despite these hardships and tough times, 134 million \nAmericans were called on to be part of the war bond effort, and more \nthan half of the U.S. population--85 million people--responded to the \npatriotic call to participate.\n  The Scouts raised money and personally donated their own funds 10 \ncents at a time in the form of stamps that could be pasted into a war \nbond booklet. When war bond books were complete, they could be taken to \nthe local bank, and sometimes even the local post office, to purchase \nbonds. One innovative group even created a promotional cardboard with \nslots for 75 quarters that had to be filled before it could be redeemed \nfor a bond.\n  Showing his leadership and dedication to the effort, President \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt purchased the very first war bond issued. In \npart of President Roosevelt's April 30, 1941, radio address to the \nAmerican people, he said:\n\n       One thought is uppermost in my mind as I make grateful \n     acknowledgment of this dual honor. It is that in reserving \n     the first Defense Savings Bond and the first Defense Postal \n     Savings Stamps in the name of the President, the Secretary of \n     the Treasury and the Postmaster General have given emphasis \n     to the national character of this defense savings campaign. \n     This character of the campaign is national in the best sense \n     of the word, for it is going to reach down, we hope, to the \n     individual and the family in every community and on every \n     farm, in every State and every possession of the United \n     States.\n\n  The President goes on to say:\n\n       It is national and it is homey at the same time. For \n     example, I am buying not one stamp but ten stamps each to go \n     into a little book for each of my ten grandchildren. And the \n     first savings bond is being made out in the name of Mrs. \n     Roosevelt as beneficiary.\n       It is fitting that the President in his purchases should be \n     a sort of a symbol of the determination of all the people to \n     save and sacrifice in defense of democracy. In a larger \n     sense, this first defense bond and these first defense stamps \n     sold to the President constitute tangible evidence of a \n     partnership--a partnership between all of the people and \n     their Government--entered into to safeguard and perpetuate \n     all of those precious freedoms which Government guarantees. \n     In this time of national peril, what we all must realize is \n     that the United States Government is you and I and all other \n     families next door all the way across the country and back \n     again. It is one great partnership.\n\n  That ends the quote from President Roosevelt.\n  The President concluded his address by asking his fellow Americans to \ndemonstrate their faith in America by investing in the new defense \nbonds and stamps.\n\n[[Page S7833]]\n\n  I remember as a child bringing dimes to school so that I could \npurchase a stamp for my savings bond book--one stamp at a time, saving \ntoward the price of a full savings bond. I remember vividly that the \nbond was a lofty $18.75. When I got my book filled, we could go down to \nthe bank so that I could finally trade for my bond--that piece of paper \nshowing that I had done my small part to help in the effort and make \nthis country better. Kids of my generation learned the value of saving \nand helping their country through the savings bond program.\n  Today, I rise to speak about a different sort of fight, and yet, at \nthe same time, this fight is one that is no less serious than the one I \nremember as a child. Today, our Nation is struggling to fight a growing \nspending problem and a debt crisis. Debt is our problem now.\n  It is time to get all of America involved, not with a promise of \nwealth but with a sense of investing in our country, of buying America \nback, pulling us back from the brink of bankruptcy to other countries. \nThe national debt stands at $15 trillion, which breaks down to nearly \n$48,000 for every person in our entire country. These figures are a \nfrightening reminder that we cannot continue to put off the tough \nchoices and that we must restore the fiscal discipline to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  This is a tough fight that has to be tackled on all fronts. Today I \nam proposing a step in the right direction and calling upon Americans \nfor support of this effort. I am proposing that we bring American debt \nback to American hands. I am introducing the Buy Back America Bonds, S. \n1909. My bill would buy back American bonds to American citizens in \naffordable $25 increments so every American can afford to invest and do \ntheir part. The Treasury would then use the funds from these bonds to \nbegin paying down the $4.4 trillion in foreign-held U.S. debt. \nInvesting in Buy Back America Bonds would allow Americans to show their \npatriotism and faith in this great Nation.\n  Unlike the war bonds of my childhood, Buy Back America Bonds would \ncreate a new series of savings bonds which are indexed for inflation as \nwell as earning a fixed interest rate. By tying Buy Back America Bonds \nto inflation, we ensure the buying power of consumers' investments \nremains the same while also earning them additional interest. These \ncould be called Gold Standard Bonds.\n  Those are two ways the Buy Back America Bonds would earn and keep \ntheir value for investors in addition to their patriotic and symbolic \ninvestment. These are not going to be barn-burner investments, but they \nwill help our Nation not only pay down our debt but pay down the amount \nof debt owed to foreign nations.\n  What makes this bill particularly special is that for every bond \npurchased, citizens are also helping the Federal Government to reduce \nspending. Every year after the first year the amount of Buy Back \nAmerica Bonds sold would be tallied and that exact amount would then be \ncut from Federal spending the following year.\n  I stand before you to explain not only where I am coming from with my \nBuy Back America Bonds but also why our Nation needs a collective \neffort to rally around to make steps toward a more responsible Federal \nbudget and getting our national debt under control. Investing in \nAmerica and bringing foreign-held debt back to American hands is where \nI propose to start. I ask my colleagues and the American people to help \nme be an integral part of the debt crisis solution.\n  Not only am I a father, I am a grandfather, and I want to be the \nfirst to purchase Buy Back America Bonds for my four grandchildren. I \nwant my grandchildren and yours to have every opportunity for a great \nquality of life, to know the meaning of faith and investment in a \nprosperous United States. I am doing everything I can to ensure that \nhappens. That means proposing solutions to problems and working to get \nmy colleagues on board.\n  So I rise and ask for the support of my colleagues for this great \neffort and support for S. 1909, my Buy Back America Bonds bill. What \nPresident Roosevelt said then is equally true now:\n\n       In this time of national peril we must realize the U.S. \n     Government is you and I, and all other families next door all \n     the way across the country and back again. It is one great \n     partnership.\n\n  Working together we can solve all of this. We need to solve all of \nthis. We need to start solving it right now and this is one way to do \nit.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1909\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. BUY BACK AMERICA BONDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subchapter I of chapter 31 of subtitle III \n     of title 31, United States Code, is amended by inserting \n     after section 3105 the following new section:\n\n     ``Sec. 3105a.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nrecruitment and retention incentives for volunteer emergency service \nworkers; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Volunteer \nEmergency Services Recruitment and Retention Act of 2011. This bill \nfixes a long-standing problem with the tax code that harms the ability \nof volunteer fire departments to recruit and retain both firefighter \nand emergency service personnel.\n  For years, local and state governments have provided their volunteer \nfirefighters and EMS personnel with different forms of benefits \nincluding Length of Service Award Plans, commonly known as LOSAPs. \nThese are pension-like benefits for volunteer emergency responders.\n  Unfortunately, the way the tax code handles LOSAPs hinders \ndepartments' abilities to administer the plans and makes it more \ndifficult for volunteer emergency personnel to receive the benefits.\n  My bill would simplify the taxation of LOSAPs in two steps. First, it \nwould allow LOSAPs to be elected as deferred compensation plans, and \nsecond, it would exempt them from the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974. This bill makes these necessary changes, which \nwill improve access to LOSAP benefits for volunteer emergency \nresponders, without increasing federal spending.\n  Today, an estimated 180,000 volunteer firefighters across 27 states \nparticipate in some form of LOSAP. Many states that do not offer these \nbenefits would be more likely to do so if the federal tax code were \nsimplified. This, in turn, would help volunteer fire departments to \nmore easily recruit and retain personnel. These men and women our local \nfirst responders--are the foundation of our emergency response \ncapabilities.\n  These volunteers put their lives on the line to help protect our \ncommunities, and their spirit of selflessness and service should be \nrewarded. I am proud to introduce this legislation with Senators \nSchumer and Blumenthal, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to pass this bill through the Senate and into law.\n  Mr. President, I would ask for unanimous consent that a letter of \nsupport be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Maine Fire Chiefs' Association,\n\n                                  Augusta Maine, November 8, 2011.\n     Re ``Volunteer Emergency Services Recruitment and Retention \n         Act of 2011.''\n\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins The Maine Fire Chiefs' Association is \n     a 425 member organization that represents fire and EMS \n     services in every county in the State of Maine. The Maine \n     Fire Chiefs' Association is charged with regularly advising \n     the Legislature and the Governor and providing \n     recommendations regarding necessary changes to Maine's fire \n     service system. The Maine Fire Chiefs' Association represents \n     numerous fire and emergency service interests in Maine. \n     Members of the Maine Fire Chiefs' Association represent \n     fulltime, call and volunteer firefighters.\n       The recruitment and retention of experienced emergency \n     responders is a priority of the Maine Fire Chiefs' \n     Association and Maine's fire service. The majority of Maine's \n     fire departments rely on call and/or volunteer firefighters \n     and the recruitment and retention of these crucial volunteers \n     is the number one issue facing the volunteer fire service \n     today. Length of Service Award Programs (LOSAPs)--pension-\n     like programs for volunteer emergency responders--are \n     effective recruitment and retention tools and are quite \n     popular among the volunteer fire service.\n       In 2009, the Maine Fire Chiefs' Association proposed the \n     following legislation--L.D. 1499 ``An Act To Establish the \n     Maine Fire Protection Services Commission Length of Service \n     Award Program''--offering a LOSAP to emergency responders in \n     Maine. Although there was support for the bill's concept \n     during the public hearing process, members of the Criminal \n     Justice and Public Safety Committee cited the potential \n     problems associated with the present federal tax laws--\n     specifically that the Internal Revenue Code, Section 457, \n     does not include LOSAPs--and L.D. 1499 ultimately was not \n     passed. Federal legislation--H.R. 1792--was proposed in the \n     111th Congress but was not passed before adjournment. H.R. \n     376 ``Volunteer Emergency Services Recruitment and Retention \n     Act of 2011'' was submitted earlier this year in the House of \n     Representatives and sponsorship of similar legislation in the \n     Senate is anticipated.\n       The Maine Fire Chiefs' Association respectfully requests \n     your sponsorship of this important legislation for emergency \n     responders. Length of service award programs are important \n     recruitment and retention tools for communities who primarily \n     rely on volunteers. By clarifying the tax treatment of \n     LOSAPs, local communities will find it easier to establish \n     and administer these programs. H.R. 376 would not create new \n     LOSAPS, place additional requirements on existing LOSAPs or \n     require communities to provide LOSAPs to their volunteer \n     emergency responders. LOSAPs would create incentives for \n     firefighters to remain in the fire service and encourage new \n     members to join the fire service. The Maine Fire Chiefs' \n     Association joins the Fire Commission, the Maine State \n     Federation of Firefighters, and many Maine fire departments \n     in thanking you for similar senate sponsorship.\n       The Maine Fire Chiefs' Association thanks you for your \n     strong support of the fire service and consideration of this \n     important issue. We welcome the opportunity to discuss this \n     proposal and other fire service issues at your convenience,\n           Respectfully,\n\n                                        Chief Stephen Nichols,\n\n                                                        President,\n                                   Maine Fire Chiefs' Association.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Bingaman, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1914. A bill to amend the Internal ``Revenue Code of 1986 to \nprovide a credit for performance based home energy improvements, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to speak about bipartisan \nlegislation I am introducing today, the Cut Energy Bills at Home Act, \nwhich would provide a 30 percent tax credit for Americans to cut their \nenergy bills, and catalyze our construction industry, reduce pollution, \nand seize the opportunity in residential energy efficiency to secure \nAmerica's energy future. With heating oil prices at $3.94 nationally \nfor home heating oil, a record for this time of year, this legislation \nis a timely method to address what may be the most expensive heating \nseason in history.\n  I am pleased to have developed this bill with Senators Bingaman and \nFeinstein, two longtime leaders on energy efficiency, and look forward \nto discussing this bill with my colleagues on the Senate Finance \nCommittee. The Cut Energy Bills at Home Act recognizes the sea-change \nthat has occurred in the energy efficiency industry and tries to ensure \nthat middle-class Americans can harness these technological strides in \ntheir own lives.\n  Specifically, not only have windows, insulation, and boilers become \nmore advanced to reduce energy consumption, but our contractors who \nperform this work have developed sophisticated practices to \nholistically improve a home's energy consumption.\n  In the past, homeowners would simply place insulation in the attic to \ncontain heat, now companies are using infared thermography to identify \ntemperature differences in a house, a blower door test to measure \nairflow leaks, to replace windows, doors, and insulation that will \nmaximize the cost-effectiveness of home energy efficiency improvements.\n  Today, we are on the cusp of a milestone turn in the energy \nefficiency industry--one with benefits for homeowners unimaginable even \njust five years ago. To spur early adoption of these advances and to \nensure that cost is not prohibitive, our bill provides a 30 percent tax \ncredit up to $5,000 to assist homeowners who make an investment that \nwill reduce energy costs for not only this winter, but for future years \nto come.\n  For example, under this bill if a homeowner invests in energy \nefficiency that will reduce heating oil consumption from 1,000 gallons \nof home heating oil to 800 gallons, a 20 percent improvement, the \nindividual may claim 30 percent of the cost of the improvements as a \ntax credit up to $2,000.\n  In 2009, New England consumed 3.4 billion gallons of home heating \noil, which is approximately $13 billion that households spent simply to \nkeep warm. A 20 percent reduction in this figure would yield a savings \nof $2.6 billion for households in New England. Energy efficiency can \nprovide a critical tool to reduce this amount and allow households to \ninvest in food, medicine, and the American economy. I urge my \ncolleagues to support me in passing this legislation into law.\n\n[[Page S7835]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/18/senate-section/article/S7835-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 334--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF NOVEMBER 6 THROUGH \n      NOVEMBER 12, 2012, AS ``VETERANS EDUCATION AWARENESS WEEK.''\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 334\n\n       Whereas brave men and women throughout the history of the \n     United States have served with honor in the United States \n     Armed Forces;\n       Whereas since President Franklin Roosevelt signed the first \n     GI Bill, the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 (58 Stat. \n     284, chapter 268), the Federal Government has provided \n     Federal aid to help veterans readjust to civilian life, \n     including financial assistance for tuition, books, and \n     supplies, and other fees for education;\n       Whereas by the time the first GI Bill expired on July 25, \n     1956, approximately 7,800,000 of the 16,000,000 World War II \n     veterans had participated in an education or training program \n     by using benefits provided through the GI Bill;\n       Whereas recognizing the educational needs for a new \n     generation of veterans, Congress passed and President Bush \n     signed the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of \n     2008 (38 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) to provide educational benefits \n     for veterans who have served in the United States Armed \n     Forces since September 11, 2001;\n       Whereas the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act \n     of 2008 provides educational benefits for veterans, including \n     active duty Army National Guard and Army Reserve members that \n     significantly reduce the cost of attending college;\n       Whereas according the Census Bureau, employees with an \n     associate degree earn 26.3 percent more than employees with \n     only a high school diploma and employees with a bachelor \n     degree earn 87.4 percent more than employees with only a high \n     school diploma;\n       Whereas making postsecondary education and job training \n     available is critical to creating access to opportunity in \n     the economy of the 21st century;\n       Whereas the lack of awareness of available educational \n     benefits, or how to attain them, can deter veterans from \n     seeking postsecondary education;\n       Whereas according to a survey conducted by the American \n     Council on Education during the first year after the date of \n     enactment of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance \n     Act of 2008, 38 percent of survey respondents reported having \n     difficulty understanding and choosing the best education \n     benefits for their needs; and\n       Whereas Veterans' Education Awareness Week is an \n     appropriate time to make veterans across the United States \n     aware of the valuable information that they can access \n     through organizations such as Operation College Promise, \n     which provides ongoing updates on transitional assistance for \n     military-affiliated students: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates the week of November 6 \n     through November 12, 2012, as ``Veterans' Education Awareness \n     Week'' to raise public awareness about--\n       (1) the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of \n     2008;\n       (2) the educational benefits to which veterans are \n     entitled; and\n       (3) the resources available to help veterans maximize \n     educational benefits under the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational \n     Assistance Act of 2008.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/18/senate-section/article/S7835-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 335--HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF EVELYN H.

LAUDER\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 335.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 335) honoring the life and legacy of \n     Evelyn H. Lauder.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of this \nresolution, submitted with my colleagues, Senator Gillibrand and \nSenator Feinstein, which honors the life and legacy of Evelyn Lauder.\n  Fittingly extolled by The New York Times as a ``Champion of Breast \nCancer Research,'' Evelyn will be long remembered by our Nation and \nindeed the world for her profound and lasting leadership in combating \nthe dreaded scourge of breast cancer which Evelyn battled herself.\n  One of the great philanthropists of our time or any time, Evelyn \nundeniably had the Midas touch as a superb business leader and \ninnovator during her more than 50 years at the Estee Lauder Companies, \nwhere she had been initially persuaded by her mother-in-law, Mrs. Estee \nLauder, to join the family business.\n  And over the course of five decades, Evelyn became a driving impetus \nbehind some of the company's most monumental strides. Make no mistake, \nany one of her myriad industry milestones alone would have secured \nEvelyn's name in the constellation of stars in cosmetics, but truly \nwhat set her apart time and again was the Midas heart she possessed \nthat reached millions, especially breast cancer survivors.\n  Evelyn was a rare visionary who not only conceived tremendous \nendeavors, but also possessed the will, talent, and fortitude to bring \nthem to fruition. When the venerable Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer \nCenter lacked a breast and diagnostic center, Evelyn undertook a \nfundraising campaign to establish the Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Center \nwhich opened its doors in 1992 and underwent an expansion in 2009.\n  When also in 1992 Evelyn saw a gap in breast cancer awareness, she \nand Alexandra Penney, then editor of SELF magazine, developed the now \niconic and legendary Pink Ribbon Campaign which has become the \nuniversal symbol for the battle against breast cancer.\n  When Evelyn recognized a lack of funding for breast cancer research, \nshe founded the landmark Breast Cancer Research Foundation which under \nher aegis grew from providing research grant awards totaling $159,000 \nto fund eight researchers in 1994 to remarkably awarding $36.5 million \nto 186 researchers this year. And this renowned foundation has since \nbecome the largest national organization dedicated exclusively to \nfunding research relating to the causes, treatment, and prevention of \nbreast cancer.\n  And so, Mr. President, you can imagine the honor I felt upon being \nnamed a Funding Hero by The Breast Cancer Research Foundation along \nwith then-Senator Hillary Clinton in 2004. And it is only fitting that \nI have joined with then-Senator Clinton's successor, Senator \nGillibrand, in paying tribute to one of their legendary constituents \nfrom the Empire State.\n  Evelyn Lauder was proof positive of Andrew Jackson's tenet that ``one\n\n[[Page S7875]]\n\nman''--or, I might add, a woman--``with courage makes a majority'' as \nshe helped to dramatically destigmatize and demystify the topic of \nbreast cancer, spurring more women to seek medical attention sooner and \nimprove their capacities to be their own best advocates. With \nunsurpassed leadership, Evelyn helped fill the so-called ``funding \ngap'' that scientists too often must confront between good and bold \nideas.\n  And I don't have to tell any of my colleagues here today, that means \nenabling more promising scientists with innovative scientific proposals \nto accelerate their research and findings rather than apply for federal \ngrants alone.\n  As I have remarked in the past, breast cancer doesn't wait to strike, \njust as our best researchers shouldn't have to wait to begin the work \nthat just might lead to the goal we all seek a cure. Not only that, but \nwith more than 90 cents of every dollar going directly to research and \nawareness, it seems to me Congress would do well to emulate the \nFoundation's efficiency.\n  By increasing awareness, by funding research, by searching tirelessly \nfor a cure, Evelyn Lauder was a vital, public service catalyst in this \nbattle against breast cancer. Undoubtedly, Evelyn was not just a \ndifference-maker in this fight, but the consummate, indispensable game-\nchanger as well.\n  Surely, integral to Evelyn's long cavalcade of achievements will be \nour continuous drive to make breast cancer history to move the needle \nwhere 1 in 8 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer at some point \nin their lifetime to eradicating this disease for all time. As someone \nwho battled breast cancer herself, Evelyn understood better than anyone \nthe urgency of waging a full attack that was both relentless and \ncomprehensive.\n  Indeed, Evelyn through her foundation was crucial in contributing \ndollars to the development of targeted therapies, such as Herceptin. As \na longtime, vigorous advocate of the DOD Breast Cancer Research \nProgram, which also contributed funding into the early research behind \nHerceptin, I recognize how essential it is to have strong partners like \nEvelyn complementing and amplifying our efforts in Congress.\n  Finally, no discussion about Evelyn Lauder is remotely complete \nwithout paying tribute to the love of her life for well more than half \na century, her incredible husband Leonard Lauder, Chairman Emeritus of \nthe Estee Lauder Companies. Theirs was indeed a partnership in every \nsense of the word their mutual regard and respect for one another could \nnot have been greater, and the joy they took in being in each other's \ncompany could not have been more evident. Each was instrumental to the \nsuccess and trajectory of the other.\n  Evelyn's legacy was perhaps best crystallized in her response to an \ninterviewer's question about none other than her own critically-\nacclaimed photography. Regarding her passion for being behind the \ncamera, Evelyn observed that ``you can't hold back time, but you can \nlook forward to what's coming next and do everything in your power to \ncreate the best possible future.''\n  Suffice it to say, the lens through which Evelyn saw her camera's \nsubjects will forever be the lens through which we will remember \nEvelyn, as she helped create the best possible future for millions of \nbreast cancer survivors around the world.\n  Our thoughts and prayers remain with her beloved Leonard and their \ntwo sons, William and Gary. It's often been said that ``we make a \nliving by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.'' Never have \nthe words rung more true than when associated with the incomparable, \nselfless, trailblazer for good, Evelyn Lauder.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, there be no intervening action or debate, and any \nrelated statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 335) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

Lauder, the world has \n     lost an energetic and dedicated friend and ally who \n     catapulted to the world stage the quest to prevent and cure \n     breast cancer in this lifetime;\n       Whereas Evelyn was born Evelyn Hausner on August 12, 1936, \n     in Vienna, Austria;\n       Whereas in 1940, the Hausner family fled Nazi-occupied \n     Austria, eventually settling in the State of New York, where \n     Eveyln was a proud product of the New York City public school \n     system and met her future husband of more than half a \n     century, Leonard Lauder;\n       Whereas Evelyn and Leonard wed in July 1959;\n       Whereas, Evelyn joined the family cosmetic company, Estee \n     Lauder, handling many roles in the early years and later \n     becoming Senior Corporate Vice President and Head of \n     Fragrance Development Worldwide;\n       Whereas Evelyn helped bring global awareness to breast \n     cancer after being diagnosed with early stages of the disease \n     in 1987;\n       Whereas in 1989, Evelyn initiated the fundraising drive to \n     establish the Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Cancer Center at \n     Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, \n     which opened in 1992 and quickly became the model for similar \n     breast cancer diagnostic centers around the world;\n       Whereas the expanded Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Cancer Center \n     opened in 2009 and provides the most up-to-date breast cancer \n     prevention, diagnosis, and outpatient treatment services \n     under 1 roof;\n       Whereas in 1992, Evelyn worked with longtime friend \n     Alexandra Penney, former editor-in-chief of SELF magazine, to \n     create the Pink Ribbon Campaign for breast cancer;\n       Whereas Evelyn launched the Estee Lauder Companies' Breast \n     Cancer Awareness Campaign, which has distributed more than \n     115,000,000 pink ribbons worldwide;\n       Whereas in 1993, Evelyn founded The Breast Cancer Research \n     Foundation, thereby affirming her commitment to preventing \n     breast cancer and finding a cure in this lifetime through \n     funding some of the most innovative clinical and translation \n     research at leading medical centers worldwide;\n       Whereas The Breast Center Research Foundation, which to \n     date funds 186 researchers around the world and has raised \n     $350,000,000, has grown to become the largest national \n     organization dedicated exclusively to funding research \n     relating to the causes, treatment and prevention of breast \n     cancer;\n       Whereas during Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October \n     2010, Evelyn and the Estee Lauder Companies' Breast Cancer \n     Awareness Campaign achieved a first-ever Guinness World \n     Record, ``Most Landmarks Illuminated for a Cause in 24 \n     Hours'', by illuminating 38 iconic landmarks, including the \n     Taj Mahal, the Tokyo Tower, the Hotel Majestic, the Empire \n     State Building, and Niagara Falls;\n       Whereas in October 2011, the Lauder family was honored with \n     the prestigious Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy for commitment \n     to philanthropic endeavors and public service;\n       Whereas Evelyn will be remembered for her vision and \n     leadership in achieving funding for promising scientific \n     research that lead to breakthrough drugs, including Herceptin \n     and Avastin, a better understanding of how tumors develop and \n     risk factors for recurrence, and an improved quality of life \n     for breast cancer survivors;\n       Whereas her work continues to help promising scientists who \n     have equally promising, imaginative, and innovative proposals \n     get research off the ground;\n       Whereas there is no doubt that we must find a cure, and \n     research is instrumental to achieving this goal;\n       Whereas this year, nearly 40,000 women of the United States \n     are expected to die of breast cancer; and\n       Whereas we must keep up the battle and recruit more heroes \n     like Evelyn if we are to achieve ``prevention and a cure in \n     our lifetime'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) mourns the loss of Evelyn H. Lauder;\n       (2) honors the life and accomplishments of Evelyn H. \n     Lauder, a world renowned advocate for breast cancer awareness \n     and health of women; and\n       (3) offers the deepest condolences to the beloved husband, \n     Leonard, sons, William and Gary, and 5 grandchildren of \n     Evelyn H. Lauder.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/18/senate-section/article/S7875-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7875-S7876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PERMITTING COLLECTION IN SENATE BUILDINGS\n\n  Mr. REID.
