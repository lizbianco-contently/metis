Mr. President, a woman from Nevada by the name of Amy--a \nsingle mother from Las Vegas--was devastated when she was laid off 3 \nyears ago because of her employer having little work. She wasn't in \nlove with her job doing bookkeeping for a local construction company, \nbut she loved the steady paycheck. Looking back on that pink slip, Amy \nviews it, of course, as a setback in one sense, but she feels very good \nabout the fact it gave her a second chance.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S2891, May 7, 2012, the Record reads: . . . by the name \nof Amy Reilly . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . by the name \nof Amy . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Like many resourceful Americans who lost their jobs after the \nfinancial and housing markets collapsed, Amy took the opportunity to \nreturn to school. She enrolled in classes at the College of Southern \nNevada and completed her associate's degree at the age of 33. Going \nback to school transformed her life. She got involved in the political \nprocess for the first time. During her whole time at school she \nmaintained straight A's--a 4.0 grade point average--and was elected \nstudent body president. But she also racked up $20,000 in student loan \ndebt.\n  Amy doesn't regret the decision to go to the university. Not only has \nshe gotten a second chance at college, she has shown her 14-year-old \nson the power of education. Still, working three part-time jobs and \nliving on a few thousand dollars a year hasn't been easy. That is an \nunderstatement. It would have been impossible for her to get her \neducation if she hadn't gotten her Federal student loans. But Amy will \nneed more loans to complete her bachelor's degree at the University of \nNevada-Las Vegas, where she starts classes this fall.\n  For most students, taking on debt is the only way to turn dreams of \nhigher education into a reality. The average student graduates with \n$25,000 in loan debt. On July 1, the interest rates on Federal loans \nare set to double for more than 7 million students. Unless Congress \nacts quickly, rates will jump from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent. That \nwill cost Amy and millions of other students at least $1,000. For a \nsingle mom working three part-time jobs, $1,000 is the difference \nbetween completing her bachelor's degree and simply dropping out of \nschool. In Nevada, higher interest rates will affect 26,000 students. \nCollege is already unaffordable for far too many Americans, and we \ncannot afford to put higher education any further out of reach. So \nSenate Democrats have introduced a proposal to freeze student loan \ninterest rates at current levels for a year, without adding a single \npenny to the deficit. Democrats will vote to advance that proposal \ntomorrow, before noon, and, hopefully, the Republicans will join us.\n\n[[Page S2892]]\n\n  The Republicans claim they share Democrats' goal of protecting these \n7 million students I have talked about from these interest rate \nincreases. We will see. But they insist we should pay for this proposal \nwith unreasonable cuts to preventive health care services for millions \nof Americans. This is a program that is so vitally important to the \nhealth care delivery system in this country. Senators Mikulski, Harkin, \nand others have worked very hard to maintain this program. It is so \nessential. Republicans know their proposal would never pass the \nSenate--never--and President Obama has said he would veto more cuts to \ncrucial preventive health care. But there is already a compromise on \nthe table. Our legislation closes a loophole that allows the rich to \navoid paying taxes they already owe. Our proposal is not a new tax. It \nwould simply stop wealthy Americans from dodging the taxes they are \nrequired to pay. If Senate Republicans are truly serious about \nprotecting 7 million students, they will work with us to pass this \nreasonable proposal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/07/senate-section/article/S2892-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATIONS OF AJIT VARADARAJ PAI AND JESSICA ROSENWORCEL TO BE MEMBERS \n                OF THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations: \nCalendar Nos. 512 and 513; that the nominations be confirmed en bloc, \nthe motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, \nwith no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in \norder to any of the nominations; that any related statements be printed \nin the Record; that the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nominations considered and confirmed are as follows:\n\n\n                   federal communications commission\n\n       Ajit Varadaraj Pai, of Kansas, to be a Member of the \n     Federal Communications Commission for a term of five years \n     from July 1, 2011.\n       Jessica Rosenworcel, of Connecticut, to be a Member of the \n     Federal Communications Commission for a term of five years \n     from July 1, 2010.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words about the \nnomination of Ajit Pai to be a member of the Federal Communications \nCommission. I have supported his nomination and that of his fellow \nnominee, Jessica Rosenworcel, and am pleased that unrelated matters \nhave finally been resolved and that the Senate has confirmed both \nnominees.\n  Ajit is somebody whom many of us have come to know from his years of \npublic service, whether on the Senate Judiciary Committee, at the \nDepartment of Justice, where Ajit worked on both antitrust and legal \npolicy matters, or in the general counsel's office of the FCC. I \nespecially appreciate his important work on the Roberts, Miers, and \nAlito Supreme Court nominations during the 109th Congress, as well as \nhis careful attention to national security matters while at the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  Ajit is the son of immigrants who came to this country seeking \nopportunity, as did the ancestors of so many of our fellow Americans. \nThey settled in the small town of Parsons, KS, population of 10,000. \nDuring his testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee, Ajit shared \nhis memories of the sense of community and the Midwestern values that \nhe learned in Parsons. He worked hard in school, excelled at both \nHarvard College and the University of Chicago Law School, and built a \ncareer in law and policy. Today, Ajit finds himself being confirmed to \nthis position of honor and receiving a unique opportunity to serve his \nNation. I am certain that his parents, having come to this country just \n40 years ago, are immensely proud of him.\n  We should all be grateful that individuals like Ajit choose to serve \nin these important positions, especially in fields where there are also \nopportunities in private life. He will be a member of the FCC for more \nthan 4 years. I am grateful for his service and appreciate that he and \nhis wife Janine have agreed to make this sacrifice for the good of our \nNation.\n  I am very disappointed that these nominations have been delayed for \nso long for nongermane reasons. Good men and women simply will not \nvolunteer to serve if they are arbitrarily forced to spend months in \nlimbo, uncertain as to their future.\n  As an FCC Commissioner, Ajit will be one of five individuals \noverseeing an agency with 2,000 employees and a budget of $350 million. \nThe Commission has broad regulatory authority over the Nation's \ncommunications industry. The communications landscape has evolved \ndramatically, not just during my lifetime but since I entered the \nSenate in 1995 and even in the past few years. It is sometimes \ndifficult to remember how we functioned before we had the ability to \nreach most people on cell phones, to access the Internet from computers \nin any corner of the globe, or to watch videos of our children and \ngrandchildren on mobile devices. Most Americans were raised in a world \nin which the television offered just a few channels, there was no cable \nnews, and telephones had rotary dials.\n  Policymakers should be reminded that many of the technologies that we \ntake for granted today will soon be gone, and we do not really know \nwhich technologies will become obsolete and in which direction the \nNation's innovators and consumers will take us. Congress and the FCC do \nnot make those decisions, or at least they should not. These decisions \nshould be made by the American people in their capacity as consumers, \nbusinessmen, entrepreneurs, investors, and citizens.\n  Government does not create innovation or make entrepreneurs, and it \nshould not be in the business of picking winners or losers or trying to \nshape private investment. The government's proper role in \ncommunications, as in other sectors of our economy, is to establish \nclear and stable rules that encourage competition, that give consumers \nchoice and allow markets to thrive, and that keep bureaucratic \npreferences and politics to a minimum.\n  Ajit has made clear that he shares this understanding of his role. I \nthink that we can expect good things from him as a member of the \nFederal Communications Commission.\n  I congratulate Ajit on this honor and am proud to have supported his \nnomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/07/senate-section/article/S2892-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: We are now on the \nStop The Student Loan Interest Rate Hike Act of 2012, is that not \ncorrect?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is on the motion to \nproceed to that measure.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I can't emphasize strongly enough the \nimportance and the urgency of the legislation before us--the Stop the \nStudent Loan Interest Rate Hike Act of 2012--which the majority leader \nspoke about. On July 1, unless Congress intervenes, the interest rate \non Federal student\n\n[[Page S2893]]\n\nloan debt is set to double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent. More than \n7.4 million American students, including an estimated 255,000 students \nenrolled in Iowa colleges and universities, will be required to pay an \naverage of $1,000 more per year of school.\n  The bill before us is straightforward and it is fully paid for. It \nkeeps the interest rate at 3.4 percent, and the cost is offset by \nclosing a tax loophole that benefits certain high-income professional \nservice providers.\n  I wish to thank Senator Reid for his leadership in advancing this \ncritical legislation. I also thank President Obama for making this \nlegislation an urgent priority and for visiting college campuses across \nthe country to speak out on this urgent problem facing our Nation's \nstudents and their families.\n  In today's global knowledge-based economy, an education beyond high \nschool is no longer an option but a necessity. A worker with a \nbachelor's degree earns 85 percent more, on average, than a high school \ngraduate. Almost two-thirds of the job vacancies between now and 2018 \nwill require some postsecondary education, and more than half of those \njobs will require at least a bachelor's degree.\n  You can see by this chart, as I said, 63 percent of the jobs will \nrequire at least some college education--either some college, an \nassociate's degree or bachelor's degree or more. And that is by 2018. \nThe demand is going to grow even beyond that. These statistics convey a \nvery clear message: Higher education is the key to entry not only to \nthe middle class but to a middle-class life.\n  Another message is equally clear, and that is America's economic \ncompetitiveness and growth depends on a highly educated and highly \nskilled workforce. That is why the ever-growing mountain of student \nloan debt is a major concern to me as the chair of the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee, and also a major concern for \nfamilies all across America who are struggling to get by. It is a \nshocking fact that total student loan debt has now surpassed total \ncredit card debt for the first time ever, with $867 billion right now \nin student loans, auto loans at $734 billion, and credit cards at $704 \nbillion. So for the first time ever, American families now owe more on \nschool loans than they do on their car loans or on their credit cards.\n  Again I want to bring this closer to my own home. It affects Iowans \nprofoundly. Nearly 72 percent of Iowa's college graduates have debt--\nthe fourth highest percentage in the Nation. And those borrowers have \nan average of $30,000 in student loan debt, which is the third highest \nlevel in the Nation.\n  Over the past 3 years, President Obama and Congress have taken robust \nsteps to improve college affordability and help our students succeed. \nFrom the Recovery Act and its unprecedented support for our education \nsystems, to the student loan reforms that enabled us to help more \nstudents through larger Pell grants, and most recently our efforts to \nmake it easier for students to repay their loans--this all happened in \nthe last few years--we have made major strides toward the President's \ngoal--and I hope it would be our shared goal--of reclaiming America's \nstanding by 2020 as the country with the highest proportion of college \ngraduates. Needless to say, it will be much harder to reach this goal \nif Congress allows interest rates to double on July 1.\n  As I said, more than 7.4 million American students will be required \nto pay an average of $1,000 over the lifetime of their loan for each \nyear they borrow. Again, if you look at this chart, it shows what is \nhappening. If the interest rate is paid at 3.4 percent, we are looking \nat about $883 in interest over the life of the average loan. Double \nthat interest rate and it goes to $1,876. That is at 6.8 percent. So \nthe average savings to the average student would be almost $1,000 a \nyear.\n  I might add that the 255,404 borrowers in Iowa will save an estimated \ntotal of $254 million with this bill in front of us.\n  With today's tough economy, and given the very high unemployment rate \namong young Americans, it is absolutely unacceptable to ask middle-\nclass families to shoulder sharply higher student loan interest \npayments. We must not allow this to happen.\n  If we look closer at the characteristics of students who will be \nimpacted by this interest rate hike, we see that it affects middle-\nclass families and vulnerable students from disadvantaged backgrounds \nat the very time when they are under enormous financial strain. If we \nlook at who gets the subsidized loans, from this chart we can see, by \nfamily income, dependent students, their family income is less than \n$60,000 a year.\n  If we look at the independent student loan borrowers, their income is \nless than $50,000 a year, and 89 percent of them earn less than \n$50,000. Of the dependent student loan borrowers, 60 percent are from \nfamilies who earn less than $60,000. I might also add that 7 out of 10 \nof those independent students here reported under $30,000 a year in \nincome.\n  So allowing the interest rate to double would also disproportionately \naffect minority students who account for 40 percent of these borrowers. \nSo 40 percent of these borrowers are minority students. This bill, \nagain, would prevent the interest rate from doubling on July 1 for \nthose borrowers.\n  So with the bill before us, we are considering a pragmatic and \nfiscally responsible solution to this problem that will keep interest \nrates low for more than 7.4 million students. Again, the bill is fully \npaid for, and we offset the cost by raising revenues in a way that will \nprovide a solution to a longstanding problem in the Tax Code that has \nbeen subject to widespread abuse.\n  Now, let me just define how this measure is paid for. For many years \nwe have seen avoidance of properly owed Social Security and Medicare \ntaxes by some subchapter S stockholders who can declare that a portion \nof their income is effectively profit and therefore not subject to \nSocial Security or Medicare taxes. This is not supposed to be a choice \nthat is made at the whim of the taxpayer. It should be based on \nobjective facts. The offset in this legislation does just that. It \ncreates a bright-line test for a small share of subchapter S \nshareholders--basically, those engaged in professions such as doctors, \nlawyers, accountants, consultants and lobbyists--whose financial gains \nthey have come from the work they do.\n  It is narrowly tailored to cover only those subchapter S \norganizations in which there are three or fewer stockholders, and only \nfor those earning $250,000 on joint filings. With this bright-line \ntest, the Medicare and Social Security trust fund will receive the \nfunds that are properly owed, which are not received today because they \nare counted not as income but as profits.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle have proposed a different \noffset to pay for keeping the interest rate at 3.4 percent. The bill \nthat passed the House of Representatives and the legislation proposed \nby Senator Alexander of Tennessee would offset the cost of this bill by \neliminating the Prevention and Public Health Fund which was created by \nthe Patient Protection and Affordability Care Act.\n  In short, rather than put an end to a widespread abuse of the Tax \nCode, my friends on the other side of the aisle are proposing that we \neliminate the sole dedicated source of Federal funding for critical \ninvestments in preventing disease and keeping women and children and \nelderly families healthy. They want to eliminate the Prevention and \nPublic Health Fund.\n  Many of my Republican colleagues have acknowledged the critical \nimportance of investing in prevention and wellness, which makes the use \nof this offset that is eliminating it all the more troubling. \nPreventing disease, expanding access to screenings, encouraging people \nto stop using tobacco--these used to be bipartisan goals strongly \nsupported by a vast majority of Republicans and Democrats alike. So in \nthe affordable care act we created the prevention fund, with the \nexpress goal of ramping up our investments in these prevention and \nwellness initiatives, again, with Republican support.\n  Here are quotes from two Republican leaders. Senator Kyl, on July 12, \n2010, just a few months after we passed the affordable care act, said:\n\n       One of the things we did in the health care legislation was \n     to provide a lot of different incentives for preventive care, \n     for screening to try to help people avoid illnesses on the \n     theory that it would be a lot cheaper if we didn't do a lot \n     of treatment that was unnecessary.\n\n  I couldn't agree more.\n\n[[Page S2894]]\n\n  The Republican leader, Senator McConnell, said in an op-ed the same \nyear, 2010:\n\n       Congress should be able to work together on our practical \n     ideas that the American people support, such as . . . \n     encouraging wellness and prevention programs that have proved \n     to be effective in cutting costs and improving care.\n\n  That was less than 2 years ago, right after passage of the health \nreform law. But now Republicans are making outrageous partisan attacks \non the prevention fund. I find this deeply disturbing and \ndisappointing. It is not hard to imagine the message gurus, those who \nhone messages, telling Republicans: Here is all you have to do. Just \nsmear the prevention fund by calling it a slush fund.\n\n  How many times have I heard that: the prevention fund is a slush \nfund? I have heard it in committee, I have heard it on the floor, I \nhave seen it in print, Republicans calling the prevention fund a slush \nfund. Well, this is shameful. That term ``slush fund'' is a malicious \nuntruth. Nothing could be further from the truth. The truth is the \nprevention fund has been a giant step forward for public health in our \nNation.\n  Typically, prevention and public health initiatives are an \nafterthought. This means important community-based interventions often \ngo unsupported. The prevention fund is making it possible for us to \nmake national investments in evidence-based programs that promote \nphysical activity, improved nutrition, and reduced tobacco use. Well, \nthese are the investments we make.\n  This prevention fund, which Republicans want to eliminate, invests \n$226 million to reduce chronic diseases, including diabetes and heart \ndisease. That minimizes the $440 billion a year in health care costs \nfrom heart disease alone. It invests $93 million for antitobacco \neducation and support campaigns to minimize the fact that over 6 \nmillion kids will die from smoking if the current rates persist. It \ninvests $190 million for childhood immunization programs, again, to \nminimize the $3 billion a year in unnecessary health care costs right \nnow.\n  I might just add the lead editorial in today's New York Times said, \n``No Longer Just `Adult Onset'.'' That is the head of it. I will not \nread it all, but I think there are a few pertinent paragraphs in the \nTimes editorial. It starts off by saying:\n\n       A study of diabetes in overweight and obese youngsters \n     bears an ominous warning about future health care trends in \n     this country. It found that Type 2 diabetes, a new scourge \n     among young people, progresses faster and is harder to treat \n     in youngsters than in adults. The toll on their health as \n     they grow older could be devastating.\n\n  This new study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. \nReading further:\n\n       Some experts suggest that young patients at risk of \n     diabetes need to be detected earlier and treated more \n     aggressively. But the long-term goal should be prevention of \n     obesity and of diabetes.\n       Congressional Republicans, meanwhile, are bent on \n     dismantling health care reforms that could greatly assist in \n     curbing the obesity epidemic. The Republican-dominated House \n     last month narrowly passed a bill that would eliminate a \n     Prevention and Public Health Fund, established under the \n     reform law, in part to pay for lowering the interest rate on \n     subsidized student loans for this year.\n       The fund is already providing grants to state and local \n     governments to help pay for programs to fight obesity and \n     prevent chronic diseases, including diabetes, in the \n     community, the workplace and among minority groups that have \n     high rates of obesity and diabetes. Killing off this program \n     would be hugely costly to Americans' health and future health \n     care costs. There is no explanation for this move, except for \n     the usual anti-health care reform demagoguery.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the \nfull editorial.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     No Longer Just ``Adult-Onset''\n\n\n The virulence of Type 2 diabetes in children is yet another reason to \n                        fight childhood obesity\n\n       A study of diabetes in overweight and obese youngsters \n     bears an ominous warning about future health care trends in \n     this country. It found that Type 2 diabetes, a new scourge \n     among young people, progresses faster and is harder to treat \n     in youngsters than in adults. The toll on their health as \n     they grow older could be devastating.\n       These findings provide more evidence of why the country \n     must get the obesity epidemic under control--to improve \n     health and to curb soaring health care costs.\n       Only two decades ago Type 2 diabetes was called ``adult-\n     onset diabetes'' because it was seldom found in young people, \n     who suffered primarily from Type 1, in which the patient's \n     immune system destroys cells that make insulin, a hormone \n     needed to control blood sugar levels. Type 2--thought to be \n     brought on by obesity and inactivity in many people--has \n     increased alarmingly and accounts for almost a fifth of newly \n     diagnosed cases in young people.\n       Obesity increases the risk of many chronic diseases. And \n     some 17 percent of American children from age 2 to 19 are now \n     considered obese, roughly half the rate of obesity among \n     adults.\n       The new study, published in The New England Journal of \n     Medicine, tested three ways to attain durable control of \n     blood sugar in youngsters between the ages of 10 and 17. None \n     worked very well. Almost half of the 699 youngsters had to \n     add daily shots of insulin within a few years to lower their \n     blood sugar. Metformin, the standard drug used to treat Type \n     2 diabetes in children, failed to control blood sugar in more \n     than half of the children. When lifestyle changes, including \n     one-on-one counseling on how to lead a healthy life, were \n     added to metformin, the results were only marginally better.\n       When a second drug was added, the results were \n     significantly better. But the two-drug treatment still failed \n     in 39 percent of the recipients, and the added drug, Avandia, \n     has been linked to heart attacks and strokes in adults.\n       The findings are especially ominous because poorly \n     controlled diabetes can lead to heart disease, stroke, \n     blindness, amputations and kidney failure. The longer one has \n     the disease, the greater the risk, so the fact that children \n     are starting so young bodes ill for their futures.\n       Some experts suggest that young patients at risk of \n     diabetes need to be detected earlier and treated more \n     aggressively. But the long-term goal should be prevention of \n     obesity and of diabetes.\n       Congressional Republicans, meanwhile, are bent on \n     dismantling health care reforms that could greatly assist in \n     curbing the obesity epidemic. The Republican-dominated House \n     last month narrowly passed a bill that would eliminate a \n     Prevention and Public Health Fund, established under the \n     reform law, in part to pay for lowering the interest rate on \n     subsidized student loans for a year.\n       The fund is already providing grants to state and local \n     governments to help pay for programs to fight obesity and \n     prevent chronic diseases, including diabetes, in the \n     community, the workplace and among minority groups that have \n     high rates of both obesity and diabetes. Killing off this \n     program would be hugely costly to Americans' health, and \n     future health care costs. There is no explanation for this \n     move, except for the usual anti-health care reform \n     demagoguery.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                         More Time for Justice\n\n\n  States need to extend the time for victims to bring claims against \n                             sexual abusers\n\n       Hawaii significantly strengthened its protections against \n     child sexual abuse last month when Gov. Neil Abercrombie \n     signed a measure extending the statute of limitations for \n     civil lawsuits filed by child victims. At least as important, \n     it opens a one-time two-year window to allow victims to file \n     suits against their abusers even if the time limit had \n     expired under the old law.\n       Like similar laws in California and Delaware, the Hawaii \n     measure recognizes some wrenching realities. It can take many \n     years, even decades, before child abuse victims are \n     emotionally ready to come forward and tell their stories in \n     court. But by then, they may be barred from suing by the \n     statute of limitations. For example, many suits against the \n     Catholic Church have been blocked because the church's \n     covering up for pedophile priests made it hard for victims to \n     come forward until long past the time limit for bringing \n     civil claims.\n       Hawaii's new law allows child victims to bring suits up to \n     the age of 26 (it was 20), or three years from the time the \n     victim realizes the abuse caused injury. The law's leading \n     opponent was the Roman Catholic Church, which has been \n     working hard to defeat statute of limitations reform across \n     the country.\n       Lobbying by the church recently succeeded in blocking \n     reform in Pennsylvania. But lawmakers in Massachusetts seem \n     ready to follow Hawaii's example by passing similar reforms.\n       In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has not yet indicated that \n     he would support a measure sponsored by Margaret Markey in \n     the Assembly to lift the statute of limitations for one year \n     for civil lawsuits involving child sex abuse. After that \n     year, an accuser would have 10 years after turning 18 to make \n     a claim, instead of five years, which is the current law. Mr. \n     Cuomo has voiced concern about fading memories and missing \n     evidence, but those concerns need to be balanced with justice \n     for victims and the need to stop abusers.\n       Like measures in other states, the Markey bill requires \n     that a victim obtain a certificate from a mental health \n     professional to show there is a reasonable basis to believe \n     the abuse occurred before a suit can go forward.\n       Getting the measure through the State Senate would be an \n     uphill climb; previous attempts have failed, and Republican \n     leaders have again vowed to stop it. Cardinal Timothy Dolan \n     has made defeating statute of\n\n[[Page S2895]]\n\n     limitations reform one of his top legislative priorities. Mr. \n     Cuomo's strong leadership will be needed if New York is to \n     match Hawaii's accomplishment any time soon.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I don't know that I can make it any more clear than the \nNew York Times editorial, and there is not the time to mention all of \nthe ways this fund is already making Americans healthier. But I want to \nmention several representative investments that are happening, again, \nright now.\n  I mentioned those right here, the $226 million for diabetes and heart \ndisease, the $93 million for antitobacco education, the $190 million, \nagain, for childhood immunization programs.\n  I might just go back to that first on the heart disease because heart \ndisease disproportionately affects women. Most people don't know that. \nI think most people would say the No. 1 cause of death in women today \nmight be breast cancer. Not so. The No. 1 cause of death for women in \nthis country is heart disease. Some 42 million women in America are \ncurrently living with some form of heart disease, and the World Health \nOrganization estimates that a staggering 80 percent of heart disease, \ndiabetes, and stroke could be prevented just from changes in smoking, \nnutrition, and physical activity alone. That is what this prevention \nfund is doing right now.\n  Moreover, this investment by the prevention fund isn't only saving \nlives, but it is saving money. Right now, heart disease costs our \nNation about $440 billion a year. We can reduce those costs.\n  I might also mention smoking. Cigarette smoking also kills an \nestimated 173,000 women every year. If current smoking rates persist, \nmore than 6 million kids will die from smoking.\n  The new national antitobacco ad campaign called Tips From a Former \nSmoker is being supported by this prevention fund. I think many of us \nprobably have seen these ads. They are extremely powerful and effective \nads, and they are going to save lives. In fact, this ad campaign is \nexpected to inspire a half million quit attempts and help at least \n50,000 Americans quit smoking forever.\n  I might just add that within 2 days of these ads first appearing, the \nnumber of phone calls to quit-smoking lines tripled from people who \nwanted help in quitting smoking.\n  I mentioned the immunization programs for kids. These investments \nfrom the prevention fund aren't just at the national level, they are \nalso in our communities. This fund is helping States and cities and \ntowns to implement evidence-based programs that meet their particular \nlocal needs.\n  For example, in Illinois, the State has made improvements to its \nsidewalks and has marked crossings to increase levels of student \nphysical activity. Because of these improvements, the number of \nstudents who are walking to school has doubled. That is a good thing. \nSo not only is this good for their health; it is expected to save the \nschool system about $67,000 yearly on bus costs.\n  In Mobile, AL, Mobile County officials enacted a comprehensive smoke-\nfree policy expected to protect 13,000 residents and visitors from \nbeing exposed to secondhand smoke.\n  All across America, the prevention fund is investing in proven, \nlocally developed programs that promote health and wellness. These \nevidence-based programs not only improve health but, as I said, will \nhelp us save money in health care costs.\n  According to a new study by the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, programs such as the National Diabetes Prevention Program \ncould prevent or delay nearly 885,000 cases of type 2 diabetes, saving \nour health care system about $5.7 billion over the next 25 years. The \nNational Diabetes Prevention Program is a public-private partnership of \nhealth care organizations working together to prevent the type 2 \ndiabetes the New York Times editorial was talking about. Given that in \n2007 diabetes alone accounted for $116 billion in direct medical costs, \nit is critical we continue these investments.\n  Again, here is how this investment is returned, the return on \ninvestment for public health care spending. For every $1 spent on \nchildhood immunizations, we save $16.50--proven; tobacco control \nprograms, for every $1 we save $5; for chronic disease prevention, for \nevery $1 we save $5.60; for workplace wellness programs, $3.27. If we \nwant to look at it just in terms of dollars and not just in terms of \nlives, we are saving money also.\n  The prevention fund's investments in cancer prevention also provide \nan opportunity to save lives and money. In 2007, the direct and \nindirect costs of cancer, which account for nearly one out of every \nfour deaths in the United States, totaled about $123 billion. Earlier \nthis year, researchers found nearly half of U.S. cancer deaths could be \nprevented--again, through the kinds of programs the prevention fund is \nfunding today. Preventable U.S. cancer deaths, about 50 percent; \npreventable deaths from heart disease, diabetes, and stroke, about 80 \npercent. This is what the prevention fund is going after. For the life \nof me, I have never understood those who want to get rid of the \nprevention fund, yet are willing to pump untold billions, trillions of \ndollars into patching, fixing, mending surgery and health care costs \ndown the line. Perhaps my friends on the other side of the aisle never \nlearned the old axiom of Ben Franklin about an ounce of prevention is \nworth about a pound of cure. Here, an ounce of prevention is worth \nabout 10 pounds of cure or more.\n  The list goes on. Recently, the Trust for America's Health released a \nstudy showing that a 5-percent reduction in the obesity rate could \nyield more than $600 billion in savings on health care costs over a 20-\nyear period of time--a 5-percent reduction. Studies such as this one \nconfirm what common sense tells us, that prevention is the best \nmedicine for our bodies and for our budgets. That is why nearly 800 \norganizations have spoken out against these misguided efforts to slash \nor eliminate the prevention fund. These organizations, such as the \nYoung Invincibles, the U.S. Student Association, the American Diabetes \nAssociation, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, have all said: No, \ndon't cut, don't eliminate the prevention fund.\n  Despite misguided efforts to cut or eliminate the Prevention and \nPublic Health Fund, most Americans understand what is at stake. Prior \nto the prevention fund, for every $1 spent on health care, 75 cents \nwent to treating people with chronic illnesses and only about 4 cents \nwent to prevention: 75 cents taking care of people later on with \nchronic diseases that are preventable, only 4 cents out of every $1 \nwent to prevention. This underinvestment has had devastating \nconsequences. Nearly half of American adults have at least one chronic \ncondition. Yes, you heard me right. Nearly half of American adults have \nat least one chronic condition, and two-thirds of the increase in \nhealth care spending between 1987 and 2000 was due to the increased \nprevalence of chronic diseases. So two-thirds of our budget, of the \nincrease in spending, is on chronic diseases. Yet since we can reduce \nthose chronic diseases through prevention, one would think we would \nwant to increase that 4 cents a little bit--4 cents on the $1 we are \nspending right now. This prevention fund gives us an unprecedented \nopportunity to bend the cost curve.\n  How many times have I heard about bending the cost curve in medicine? \nThe best way to do it is to prevent chronic diseases. The \ntransformation of America into a true wellness society, a society that \nfocuses on preventing diseases, saving lives and thereby money is the \nmost cost-effective way to proceed. As we can see, to slander the \nprevention fund as a so-called slush fund is a shameful \nmischaracterization. This fund is saving lives and saving money. \nEliminating this fund--as proposed by my friend from Tennessee--would \nbe bad public policy, a serious case of misplaced priorities. The very \nidea that Republicans would slash prevention in public health care so a \nsmall group of high-income taxpayers can continue to abuse the Tax Code \nI find simply unacceptable.\n  Before I close my remarks, I would like to address an egregious \nmischaracterization that I have heard from the other side of the aisle. \nSome Republicans claim Democrats, in our historic reform of the student \nloan program, took money that had been going to students and used it to \npay for the health care bill. I have heard that a lot of times. Again, \nthat is simply not so. The reforms passed by Democrats in Congress--I \nmight add over vehement Republican opposition--did not take a single \ndime from students. Instead, the\n\n[[Page S2896]]\n\nbill eliminated wasteful, taxpayer-funded subsidies to banks by \nconverting all new Federal student loans to a more stable, reliable, \ncost-efficient direct loan program and redirected that money to \nstudents, to deficit reduction, and some important health care reforms.\n  The money did not come from students. The money came from the \nsubsidization we have been giving to banks. Specifically, thanks to the \nhuge savings generated by eliminating wasteful subsidies to banks, what \nwe were able to do with that--we provided increases in the maximum Pell \ngrant award to keep up with inflation. We provided funding for \nminority-serving colleges and universities. We made a major investment \nin community colleges, creating a community college and career training \ngrant program. We were able to make loan repayment more manageable by \ncapping a new borrower's loan payment at 10 percent of their net income \nand, for some, forgiving any remaining debt after 20 years of payment.\n  That was all done by stopping these wasteful subsidies to banks and \nputting it into the direct loan program. Again, we provided more than \n$10 billion in deficit reduction at the same time we were able to \nexpand the Community Health Center Program to ensure access to \nlifesaving medications and to expand vital consumer protections to \nmillions of Americans with private health insurance--protections we put \nin such as banning lifetime limits, requiring dependent coverage, \nprohibiting cancellation of coverage due to an illness. In other words, \nthanks to the education reform bill, students benefited, the middle \nclass benefited, taxpayers benefited, and health care consumers \nbenefited. For my friends on the Republican side, had they had their \nway and had those reforms been defeated, only the banks would have \nbenefited.\n\n  Indeed, I kind of detect a pattern. When we Democrats were fighting \nto end this subsidy to banks so we could dramatically increase college \ngrants and loans for middle-class and disadvantaged students, my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle stood with the banks and did \neverything they could to kill the reforms. Likewise, today Democrats \nare fighting to prevent a 100-percent student loan rate hike. We want \nto fully pay for it by correcting a provision in the Tax Code that \nallows a small group of wealthy Americans to avoid paying some Social \nSecurity and Medicare taxes. Republicans are going to the mat to \nprevent those wealthy taxpayers from having to pay their fair share. \nInstead, how do they want to pay for keeping the interest rate down? By \ngutting the prevention fund, killing it, eliminating it--the very fund \nthat is investing in initiatives to fight cancer and heart disease and \nto protect the health of our children, our women, and our elderly.\n  What they are proposing is bad public policy. It is bad priorities. \nWe need to be putting the middle class first. We need to be putting \nstudents struggling to pay for college first. We need to be putting \npublic health care and prevention first--put all those out there. To \nmake these things possible, we should ask a small group of wealthy \nAmericans to put their country first and stop abusing this provision, \nthis loophole in the Tax Code. I urge my colleagues to support the Stop \nThe Student Loan Interest Rate Hike Act and to support the offset \ncurrently in the bill.\n  Five years ago, the original law that reduced the student loan \ninterest rate to 3.4 percent passed with overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport and was signed by a Republican President. I hope we can find \ncommon ground to pass this new legislation with that same kind of broad \nand bipartisan support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am glad I had an opportunity to hear \nthe distinguished Senator from Iowa, who is my friend and the chairman \nof the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. I wish to \naddress the same subject he did, but I want to hasten to summarize it \nat the beginning to say that we agree. By we, I mean Governor Romney, \nthe likely Republican nominee for President, President Obama, the House \nRepublicans, I, and others agree that for the next year we should keep \nthe interest rate on 40 percent of new student loans at 3.4 percent. \nThere is no difference of opinion on that.\n  What is different is how we propose to pay for it. The distinguished \nSenator from Iowa has actually outlined the difference of opinion very \nwell. What we are saying, what the Republicans are saying, is that in \norder to pay for the $6 billion it will cost taxpayers to keep that 3.4 \npercent interest rate the same for the next year, we want to give to \nstudents--give them back their own money, the money the Democrats are \novercharging them on their student loans. The Senator from Iowa went \nthrough a very careful explanation on that which was largely correct. \nHe pointed out that at the time the majority decided it would make the \nSecretary of Education the Nation's leading banker and put him in \ncharge of administering what is becoming to be nearly $1 trillion worth \nof student debt--in other words, take it away from banks and make the \ngovernment the banker--that there was about $61 billion in ``savings.'' \nThat is from the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle argued those were \nunnecessary subsidies to banks. Let's say, for the moment, for the sake \nof argument, they are correct about that. That $61 billion is money \nstudents were paying in interest on their student loans. Wouldn't the \nlogical thing to do be to let the students keep the money? If we truly \ncared about college tuition going up and student loans rising, wouldn't \nthe thing to do be to say: We have done a big favor to you students--\nthe government has been overcharging you on your student loans, all 18 \nor 19 million of you who have student loans--so instead of the rate of \n6.8 percent, which it is for most students, we are going to lower that \nrate to 5.3 percent.\n  That is not my number. That is the number the Congressional Budget \nOffice said. We could have that $61 billion our friends on the other \nside said the government is overcharging students and we could reduce \nthe average loan of about $25,000 to a 5.3-percent rate instead of 6.8 \npercent and that would save the average student on the average loan \nabout $2,200 over 10 years. But they didn't do that. They spent it on \nmore government; $10 billion to reduce the debt and $8.7 billion to pay \nfor the health care bill. So what we are saying is in order to freeze \nthis rate at 3.4 percent, let's give to students the money they were \npaying. Instead of paying for the health care bill, let's reduce the \nstudent rates. That is the difference of opinion here.\n\n  Of course, our friends on the other side of the aisle have a better \nway, in their opinion. Not only do they want the students to continue \nto pay for other government programs, and some money for the health \ncare bill, they want to raise taxes on job creators in the middle of \nthe longest recession we have had since the Great Depression.\n  Let me go back to the beginning point here. We are talking about \nsomething that was reflected very well in the New York Times yesterday. \nI noticed the Senator from Iowa talked about the New York Times. Here \nis the national section from yesterday talking about what is going on \nin California.\n\n       Angry about tuition increases and cuts in courses and \n     enrollment, a dozen students at California State University \n     have taken their protest beyond marches . . . and declared a \n     hunger strike.\n       The fasting protest was the latest display of anger at the \n     23 California State University campuses. The system has lost \n     roughly $970 million in state financing since 2008.\n\n  The University of California is probably the best public university \nin the world. It has lost nearly $1 billion in State funding since \n2008, and the students are fasting. They are upset about the tuition \nincreases. Why is the tuition increasing? Well, the administrators say \nif we lose $1 billion from the State for our State universities, the \nmoney has to come from somewhere to pay for excellence in our \nuniversities, so we increased the tuition. That story has been going on \nall over the country. Why is that happening?\n  The President has put this issue on the table. I think we need to \ndiscuss it. Why are they fasting in California, protesting tuition \nincreases? In the last year why did State funding for the University of \nTennessee and Tennessee's community colleges and Tennessee Tech go down \n15 percent last year? The main reason is the Federal Government's \nhealth care policies and its\n\n[[Page S2897]]\n\nMedicaid mandates on States that are soaking up State dollars on \nMedicaid that would otherwise go to pay for public universities.\n  President Obama did not start this policy--it has been going on for \n30 years--but he is making it much worse with his health care law. And \nwhen it takes effect next year, the Kaiser Family Foundation says that \nStates, which already are spending one out of four of their State tax \nrevenues on Medicaid, will see a 29-percent increase in their spending \non Medicaid. What will that do? What that will do is force California, \nTennessee, Connecticut, and Iowa to look in their State budgets, to \ntake the money that most likely would have gone for the colleges and \ncommunity colleges and public universities and instead spend it on \nMedicaid. Those Federal Medicaid mandates are soaking up money that \nwould otherwise go to public colleges and universities, and as a result \nof that, universities are raising tuition. As a result of that, loans \nare up, students are fasting, and the President is on the campaign \ntrail promising to fix it.\n  Let's talk about his fix. First, it is the political season, so \nSenators, and all of us, need to listen very carefully when someone \nbegins to stir the crowd about a popular issue, and surely being able \nto pay for college is a popular issue. We hope all American students \nwho want to have a college degree will be able to go and afford to go \nto college. Our Federal Government goes to great efforts to make that \npossible.\n  Half of the students who go to colleges and universities in America--\nthere are 6,000 of them--have a Federal grant or loan to help pay for \ncollege. We have more than $100 billion in new loans going out this \nyear from the American taxpayer. That is from people out there working \nand paying taxes--the UAW member, the teacher, their taxes are going to \nloan more than $100 billion to students this year. The amount of money \nfor Pell grants this year is over $41 billion.\n  The University of Tennessee in Knoxville is a fine campus where the \ntuition is about $7,400 a year, which is a good bargain at a great \nuniversity. Almost all the students show up with a $4,000 State \nscholarship called the HOPE scholarship. For a quarter of the students \nwho are low income, they have Pell grants that carry them above the \namount of tuition. State and local governments have made a great effort \nto try to make it easier for our young people and older people to \ncontinue their education, and we want to continue to do that. There is \na bipartisan effort on that.\n  Now the specific issue at play here, and the one we are likely to \nvote on tomorrow, has to do with one type of those student loans, and \nlet's try to put that in perspective.\n  The Democrats have a version and the Republicans have a version. I \noffered a version which would pay for it by giving back to students the \nmoney the government is overcharging them. The Democrats have one that \nwould raise taxes on people who create jobs. But whatever one passes--\nif one were to pass--would save average students on new loans about $7 \na month in interest payments for the next 10 years. That can add up. \nThat could be $83 in a year, $830 over 10 years. But that is what we \nare talking about, $7 a month in savings or $7 a month in interest \npayments on the average loan, and that is for 40 percent of the new \nloans. So if you have a student loan and it is at 3.4 percent, that is \nnot going to change. There are 40 percent who have student loans today \nthat they took out last year at about 3.4 percent. Most everybody else \nis at 6.8 percent, which is a good deal lower than you could get with a \nprivate loan. A private loan is one where you go to a bank and say: I \nam going to college and I don't have a job so I need to borrow money. \nYou may get it, but they are going to charge you more because you may \nnot be able to pay it back as well as somebody else.\n  We have agreed on this--at least we agreed on the policy, but not how \nto pay for it. The President has agreed on it and Governor Romney \nagreed on it. For the next year we wish to take 40 percent of new loans \nand keep them at the 3.4 percent rate, and then later in the year--\nearlier next year--when we look at our entire budget, how much money we \nhave to spend, the size of the debt, which is of great concern to all \nof us on both sides of the aisle, we will see what we can afford to do. \nThat is the first question.\n\n  But I am glad the President has been going to college campuses. I am \nglad he has raised the issue of student loans and college tuition \nbecause as a former Governor of Tennessee who cares deeply about \neducation and as someone who was also U.S. Education Secretary about 20 \nyears ago, I have been trying for 20 or 25 years to get Washington to \npay attention to the idea that it is ruining our public colleges and \nuniversities where these Medicaid mandates soak up the dollars that \nought to go to public colleges and universities. Three-quarters of our \nstudents go to public universities such as the University of Tennessee \nor Iowa or Iowa State or California or the community colleges, which \nare our secret weapon. And even with the rising tuition, those costs \nare at least reasonable now. I mean tuition at a community college in \nTennessee is about $3,000. Nationally the average tuition for a 4-year \npublic university is about $8,200. It is not easy to find the money for \nthat, but it is still within range.\n  What has happened in the last 25 years? I can tell you what happened \nin my State. I visited with the retiring president of Tennessee Tech \nUniversity, a fine engineering school. He said two things: One, over \nthe last 3 years State funding for his university--and for most in \nTennessee--has gone down by 30 percent. That is not a 30-percent \nreduction in the rate of growth, that is a flat-out cut. And why has \nthat been happening? Well, our current Governor, a Republican, and our \nformer one, a Democrat, have said what I know and every Governor knows: \nwhen you make up your State budget and you get down toward the end of \nit, you make a choice between Medicaid and higher education. And \nbecause Medicaid is run from Washington with specific mandates on \nstates, the States end up having a stranglehold put on them, and in \neffect, if they participate in the program, they are forced to make \ndecisions about eligibility and how much they spend, and there goes the \nmoney. There goes the money and it doesn't go to the public colleges \nand universities, resulting in less money, higher tuition, and more \nloans.\n  The fasting students in California--if I walked up to them today and \nsaid: I bet you didn't know that President Obama's health care policies \nare the reason you are hungry today, they wouldn't believe that. But \nthe fact of the matter is not just the President's policies but the \npolicies over the last number of years have gradually soaked up money \nthat would make the University of California a great university and \nleft it no recourse but to become more efficient, which it should, and \nto raise tuition, which it is doing.\n  I will give an example of how much difference this makes. In the \nearly 1980s, I was a young Governor and I was making these budgets up. \nI would say: Well, about this much goes to K 12 education, and the \ncourts are running prisons, so I will have to put that in, and then the \ngas tax goes to the highways. And you get down to the end of the budget \nand you make a choice between Medicaid, the Federal program that States \npay about 30 percent of, and education. I was trying to restrict \nfunding for Medicaid and increase funding for education. I could see \nwhere we were headed over the next several years.\n  I went to see President Reagan. I had made an appointment. I saw him \nin the Oval Office. I said: Mr. President, let me propose a grand swap. \nHe said: What do you mean, a grand swap? I said: We will take all of K \n12 education in the States and you take all of Medicaid. He thought for \na moment, and he said that sounds like a pretty good idea. My reasoning \nwas that instead of Medicaid having two masters--one in Washington and \nthe other among all the different Governors--if it had one, it would be \nmanaged better. If Washington ran Medicaid, Washington would have to \npay for it all and make sure that it could be funded.\n  I thought then, and I still think today, that almost all of the \nresponsibility for kindergarten through the 12th grade belongs as close \nto the child as possible--first with the family, then with the \nclassroom, and then with the State. I believe that while there has been \nsome important advocacy from Washington over the last 30 years, if we\n\n[[Page S2898]]\n\nhad made that grand swap 30 years ago, the Medicaid Program would be \nrun better today and our public schools would be performing better \ntoday.\n  We could argue about that, but the one thing we could not argue about \nis the difference in money. Back then if we made the swap, the States \nwould have come out ahead by about $4.5 billion. In other words, the \nFederal Government would have taken over Medicaid and the States would \nhave taken over K 12. The States would have given back to the Federal \nGovernment the Federal aid for education and keep their Medicaid money. \nFour-and-a-half billion dollars was the difference in 1981 or 1982.\n  What would the difference be today if we made such a grand swap? It \nwould be $92 billion. It would be $92 billion of extra money the States \nwould have if today the Federal Government took over all of Medicaid \nand the States took over all of the responsibility funding for K 12.\n  That would mean in a State such as California where the students are \nfasting, California would probably have an extra $12 billion or $13 \nbillion. Do you think much of that would go to the University of \nCalifornia to continue its excellence? Sure it would. Would much of it \ngo to Tennessee Tech, the University of Tennessee, and the community \ncolleges? It absolutely would.\n  What happened over the years is that these well-intentioned Federal \nhealth care Medicaid mandates have put a stranglehold on Governors, \nwhich is why I said when we were debating the health care law that I \nthought any Senator who voted for it ought to be sentenced to serve as \nGovernor for 8 years and try to implement it.\n  I mentioned that last year Tennessee's State funding for higher \neducation went down 15 percent. Guess what. State funding for Medicaid \nwent up 16 percent. So there is a direct relationship: Medicaid up, \nState funding for public universities down, tuition and loans go up, \nand that is the real problem we have today.\n  I am glad the President has put this issue on the table. I am glad he \nis talking about it, and I hope Governor Romney talks about it. I hope \nwhat they agree to do is either to repeal the health care law or to \nrepeal the Medicaid mandates and give States more flexibility. We can't \npass a law in Washington, as we did 3 or 4 years ago with the stimulus, \nand say we are going to give you more Medicaid money, but, Mr. Governor \nand Ms. Legislator, you can't reduce State funding on Medicaid.\n  Lieutenant Governor Ravitch of New York, a Democrat, wrote an \nexcellent article in the Wall Street Journal. At the time it said: If \nyou tell New York that at a time when we are reducing revenues and say \nwe have to keep spending on Medicaid, we have to cut something else, \nand the State University of New York gets cut. So New York cuts the \nState University of New York, tuition goes up, loans go up, and \nstudents are protesting.\n  It is not just the student protests that I worry about. We are at a \ntime in our history when we are in a serious brain-power competition \naround the world. We have a lot of Chinese scholars who go from \nAmerican universities home to their universities. In a bipartisan way--\nand the Senator from Iowa and I were part of it--we passed something \ncalled the America Competes Act a few years ago and reauthorized it so \nwe could properly fund science and our innovation. Government-sponsored \nresearch has been an important part of our job growth over the last 30 \nor 40 years. Where is that done? It is done in our national \nlaboratories or our great research universities. Well, at least half of \nour great research universities are public universities, such as the \nUniversity of California, the University of Michigan, the University of \nTennessee, the University of Connecticut. If we keep cutting \ngovernment-sponsored research and the quality of those universities, \nour job growth won't be nearly as good in the future.\n\n  Here is another example of how much that has changed over the years. \nThirty years ago in Tennessee, the State paid 70 percent of the cost of \na student to attend a State university and the student paid 30 percent. \nWe had an implicit agreement between the government and the student, \nand we said: If we increase your tuition, we will increase the State \ncontribution by the same percentage. So we kept it at about 70 and 30, \nand it made it possible for a lot of students to go to college. What is \nit today? It is 30 and 70. It is upside down. Thirty percent of the \nsupport for colleges and universities comes from the State government \nand nearly 70 percent comes from the students. Why is that? The main \nreason is Federal health care mandates that put an unrealistic amount \nof money on top of States, and it is about to get worse.\n  I mentioned earlier the Kaiser Family Foundation, which estimates \nthat next year States that are already spending $1 out of every $4 for \nMedicaid will see a 29-percent increase in Medicaid funding. This fast \nwill have to go on a lot longer in California if that is going to \nhappen. We can't cut $1 billion out of the University of California \nevery 3 years and have it remain the best public university in the \nworld. It is just not going to happen. And we can't raise tuition 6 \npercent or 8 percent every year and make college available to the large \nnumber of students that would like to go.\n  So I am glad the President and our friends on the other side in this \npolitical year have raised the issue of rising tuition and student \nloans. We agree on the little issue before us. We would all like to \ntake that 3.4 percent interest rate and extend it for a year. That \ncosts $6 billion. That would affect new loans and only 40 percent of \nthe students. But we agree on that, the President agrees, and Governor \nRomney agrees. That is not an issue. The issue is, do we raise taxes on \njob creators or do we give back to students some of the money we are \ncontinuing to overcharge them on student loans? That is the issue. The \nlarger question--and one that I hope we all address this year in our \ndebates and that the President and Governor Romney address in their \ndebates--is, What about the future of our public colleges and \nuniversities, where three out of four American college students go? How \nare we going to maintain their quality and maintain the opportunity for \naccess to them if we continue to impose Medicaid mandates on States \nthat soak up the money that ought to be going for excellence in higher \neducation and the greatest amount of opportunity for students by \nkeeping tuition rates low? That is the real issue.\n  While President Obama is not responsible for what went on before he \nbecame President, he has made that condition much worse. If he is going \nto bring this up on the campaign trail, I hope he tells the rest of the \nstory, which is that he and his health care and Medicaid mandate \npolicies are a principal part of the reason and I would say the main \ncause going back over the years as to the reason California students \nare fasting, Tennessee students saw an 8-percent increase in tuition, \nand all across the country college presidents know very well that the \nreason there have been such reductions is because of Federal Medicaid \nmandates.\n  I hope we have an opportunity tomorrow to vote not only on the \nDemocratic proposal to keep student loan rates at 3.4 percent but also \non the Republican interest rate reduction act that I have proposed, \nwhich would also keep the rates at 3.4 percent but pay for it by \nstopping the overcharging of students to help pay for the health care \nlaw.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first let me say that I very much appreciate \nthe comments of the Senator from Tennessee and his leadership on this \nissue. I join him in hoping we will be able to vote for the alternative \nhe has provided, which is a more sensible way to ensure that this \nincrease in student loan interest fees does not continue.\n  Many students who entered college 4 or 5 years ago believing that \nhigher education would improve their prospects for getting a good job \nare now, sadly, very disappointed. The Obama economy is going to let \nthem down. According to a recent Associated Press story, one out of two \nrecent graduates is either unemployed or underemployed. The article \ncites a new analysis based on government data which found that young \ncollege graduates ``are heavily represented in jobs that require a high \nschool diploma or less . . . that's confounding their hopes a degree \nwould pay off despite higher tuition and mounting student loans.''\n\n[[Page S2899]]\n\n  At this time, most of us agree that Congress should extend the lower \ninterest rate on certain Stafford loans. Unless we do, interest rates \nwill double to 6.8 percent this July. There are competing proposals to \naccomplish this extension, as Senator Alexander pointed out. \nUnfortunately, the majority leader's proposal is going to make the \nunderlying jobs problem worse by burdening job-creating businesses with \nnew taxes and compliance costs. Let me illustrate how this occurs.\n  In order to pay for the $6 billion cost of extending the 3.4-percent \ninterest rates for 1 year, the Reid bill attempts to do what nearly \nevery bill proposed by Senate Democrats this session has done: It \npermanently raises taxes on job creators in order to pay for temporary \nspending. Worse, the majority is attempting to divert dollars that are \nsupposed to go to Medicare or Social Security in order to fund \ncompletely unrelated spending.\n  In this case, the legislation singles out certain professional \nservice businesses for a punitive tax hike, including those in the \nfields of health, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial \nscience, performing arts, and athletics. Ironically, these are some of \nthe fields in which there is actually demand for new employees, \naccording to the AP story I referenced earlier.\n  The tax hike would hit business owners who perform services for their \nbusinesses and make $200,000 or, if they are married, $250,000. If the \nIRS determines that 75 percent or more of the business's gross income \nis what this bill describes as ``attributable'' to the services of \nthree or fewer owners, then this bill would make the owners pay payroll \ntaxes on 100 percent of their share of the business profits even if \nsome of that profit had nothing to do with the owner's work. In \naddition, if family members also own a piece of the business, then the \nworking owner will owe additional payroll taxes on the family members' \nshare of the business even if that family member provides no services.\n\n  Obviously, there are several problems with this approach. Let's start \nwith the most obvious: It takes more money from the private sector and \ngives it to the government at the very time when we want the private \nsector to have enough to create new jobs. Second, it rewrites the laws \nof income from labor and income from capital investment. This should \nnot be done lightly, especially since confiscating more from small \nbusinesses means they will be less able to expand and create more jobs.\n  Underscoring that this proposal is a tax increase and not a mere \ncompliance measure, a coalition of 37 organizations that represents \nsmall businesses wrote a letter explaining that it ``could increase the \npayroll tax burden on business owners who are already fully complying \nwith the law. For those businesses, this provision represents a tax \nincrease rather than a clarification of existing tax burdens.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this letter be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair.\n  So a bill that is intended to help students would actually make their \njob prospects even bleaker when they graduate. The American Institute \nof Architects said of the Reid proposal:\n\n       If we're trying to make it easier for our college graduates \n     to get started in their career and become contributing \n     members of society, increasing taxes on those who would most \n     likely hire them is simply bad public policy.\n\n  Payroll taxes are already scheduled to become more punitive for the \nsmall business owners targeted by this bill. Under ObamaCare, the \nMedicare portion of their payroll tax will rise from 2.9 percent to 3.8 \npercent, and another 3.8 percent will be assessed on their investment \nincome.\n  To add insult to injury, this bill exposes family-owned businesses to \ndouble taxation. For example, in a business with three family member \nshareholders in which only two provide substantial services, those two \nfamily members would be responsible for payroll taxes on their own \nincomes and then both of them would have to pay payroll taxes on the \nincome of their third family member.\n  Applying this rising payroll tax to even more small business income \nis a terrible recipe in a time of a weak economy. At a time when \nbusinesses are struggling to hire, the last thing Congress should do is \nto make a bad situation worse.\n  Now, the other side will argue that their bill is intended to prevent \ncases of tax abuse, so let's look into that. According to the IRS, 4.5 \nmillion S corporation tax returns were filed in 2009. Data from the \nTreasury Department shows that S corporations account for nearly 40 \npercent of small businesses with employees. As these numbers showed, \ndoing business as an S corporation is popular because it allows a \nbusiness to avoid the double taxation of income that comes with \norganizing as a C corporation. The business income of these and other \nso-called flowthrough organizations is taxed as individual income by \nthe IRS.\n  Given the prevalence of flowthrough businesses in our economy, it is \nnot surprising that there has been some abuse from some S corporation \nshareholders who pay themselves small salaries in order to avoid paying \nMedicare and Social Security payroll taxes owed on their compensation. \nThe IRS is well aware of this potential and has developed and \nimplemented tools to go after firms and individuals who do not pay \nappropriate payroll taxes through what the IRS calls the reasonable \ncompensation test. This test has been used for over 50 years, and the \nIRS has won a number of cases against taxpayers who paid themselves \ncompensation that was deemed less than reasonable, most recently in \nlast year's United States v. Watson decision.\n  The Reid bill would impose a different standard--one that is arguably \nmore confusing and less enforceable than the current IRS reasonable \ncompensation test. Under the Reid bill, small businesses and the IRS \nwill be asked to determine whether 75 percent of the small business \nincome is ``attributable'' to the services of three or fewer \nshareholders. How on Earth is the IRS going to determine which income \nis attributable to the work of a particular shareholder and not to \nother employees or to capital investments? For example, if a business \nhas three physical therapists, how will the IRS know whether the \nbusiness's income is substantially due to their services or whether at \nleast part of it relates to the fact that they hired talented front \noffice staff, did marketing, bought a building in a good location, have \na comfortable waiting room, implemented an efficient billing system, \nand invested in state-of-the-art medical equipment? Let's say an IRS \nagent manages to determine that exactly 75 percent of the business's \nincome is attributable to the services of the three physical \ntherapists. That means 25 percent of the business income was not due to \ntheir services, but the bill would impose payroll taxes on that portion \nas well. In other words, this bill would impose taxes on business \nincome that is due to capital investment, which should not be subject \nto the payroll tax, and to the work of other employees who have already \npaid their payroll taxes. Payroll taxes should only apply to labor \nincome, and they should only be applied once. That is current IRS \npolicy and it is good policy.\n\n  As one commentator noted last week, the Reid proposal will be a \n``jobs program for tax lawyers defending clients before the IRS.'' To \ndetermine what percentage of business income is ``attributable'' to \nservices performed by certain shareholders of an S corporation will be \na boon for lawyers and CPAs but not for the professional service \nbusinesses that wish to expand and hire.\n  Those of us who were here in 2010 argued against ObamaCare, among \nother reasons because it relied on student loans to pay for part of its \ncosts. A more prudent way to extend the 3.4-percent interest rate on \nstudent loans is to cut at least $6 billion in ObamaCare spending, \nwhich is exactly what the House of Representatives recently voted to \ndo. The House bill would cut spending from an unaccountable ObamaCare \nslush fund, formerly known as the Prevention and Public Health Fund.\n  This approach, which our colleague Senator Alexander spoke to a \nmoment ago, and of which I am a cosponsor, fully offsets the cost of a \n1-year extension of the subsidized interest rate and\n\n[[Page S2900]]\n\ndirects an additional $6 billion toward debt reduction. This ensures \nthat job-creating capital will not be diverted from small businesses to \nfund a temporary unrelated spending program.\n  Notably, President Obama's own budget request recommended cutting \nthis very same ObamaCare slush fund, and he has already signed into law \nlegislation that cut $5 billion from it.\n  Finally, I want to express my dismay at the lack of urgency from the \nmajority about the most pressing issue facing small businesses and \nthose college graduates seeking work; that is, the automatic tax \nincrease for all Americans on January 1 of next year--the largest tax \nincrease in the history of our country. The legislation on the floor \ntoday will not become law. The majority knows that. It is another \npolitical showboat. We know this because this Chamber rejected a \nsimilar tax hike 2 years ago when the majority had 59 Senate seats, and \nwe know the House of Representatives would not pass the legislation.\n  As the senior Senator from Utah noted last month:\n\n       Senate Democrats are fiddling while Rome burns.\n\n  That is because, in 8 months, as I said, the largest tax increase in \nAmerican history will take effect on individuals, families, and \nbusinesses. Taxes on income, capital gains, dividends, family-owned \nfarms and estates will skyrocket. As previously mentioned, new taxes on \ninvestment and payroll from ObamaCare will also take effect.\n  Even without the tax increase in this Reid bill, small business \nowners are facing a marginal tax rate increase to nearly 41 percent, a \nregular payroll tax rising to 16.2 percent, and an additional 3.8-\npercent payroll tax on investment income. And we want these people to \nhire more, to create more jobs?\n  Instead of wasting valuable time on a bill that will never become \nlaw, I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will end their \nobsession with class warfare and start focusing on the most pressing \nissue at hand: stopping policies that will do further damage to our \nalready weak economy. Defeating the majority leader's latest tax hike \nproposal will be a good place to start.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      May 3, 2012.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Capitol Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Capitol Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senators Reid and McConnell: As organizations \n     representing millions of employers, we strongly oppose the \n     provision in S. 2343 to increase payroll taxes on S \n     corporations and partnerships by $9 billion.\n       While we are sympathetic with efforts to ensure that \n     taxpayers, including business owners, fully comply with the \n     tax law, we are concerned that the new rules envisioned by S. \n     2343 are less clear and less enforceable than current law and \n     will do little to increase compliance.\n       On the other hand, they could increase the payroll tax \n     burden on business owners who are already fully complying \n     with the law. For those businesses, this provision represents \n     a tax increase rather than a clarification of existing tax \n     burdens. Businesses engaged in service professions have \n     employees and capital investments. S. 2343 would apply \n     payroll taxes to the income attributable to both, thus \n     blurring the line between payroll taxes imposed on wages and \n     salary, and income taxes applied to other forms of income.\n       While the authors describe the targets of this provision as \n     lobby shops and law firms, the application of the \n     ``Professional Service Business'' definition included in the \n     bill is much broader and could embrace a significant portion \n     of the American economy. Closely-held businesses engaged in \n     health, real estate, engineering, architecture, consulting, \n     financial services, billing, and other fields could be \n     affected. Moreover, once the line between earnings from labor \n     and capital is removed, we are concerned that this provision \n     could be expanded to include other, more capital intensive \n     industries.\n       Under S. 2343, the active shareholders of service sector S \n     corporations would be required to pay payroll taxes on all \n     their income from the business--wage and business earnings \n     alike--if the S corporation is a partner in a professional \n     service business or if 75 percent or more of the gross income \n     of the S corporation is attributable to the service of three \n     or fewer shareholders.\n       This new approach, particularly the ``principal rainmaker'' \n     test, is neither clear nor more enforceable than existing \n     rules. These rules have been in effect for over half a \n     century, and the IRS has repeatedly and successfully used \n     them to ensure that active S corporation shareholders pay \n     themselves a reasonable wage, most recently in Watson v. US \n     (2011).\n       Legislation similar to the payroll tax provision in S. 2343 \n     failed to move through the Senate in 2010. Like S. 2343, that \n     provision was made public at the last minute and brought \n     directly to the Senate floor. It was not considered by the \n     full Finance Committee, nor was it subject to an open \n     amending process the Senate floor. Now, two years later, we \n     are presented with a similar policy to be debated in a \n     similar, truncated manner.\n       Finally, we are concerned that the permanent payroll tax \n     increase in S. 2343 would be used to fund a temporary \n     program--however worthy--outside of the Medicare or Social \n     Security programs. Moving forward, we would argue that \n     payroll tax collections should be reserved for Medicare and \n     Social Security and not diverted to offset unrelated federal \n     spending.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n       Air Conditioning Contractors of America; American Bankers \n     Association; American Council of Engineering Companies; The \n     American Institute of Architects; American Rental \n     Association; American Supply Association; Associated Builders \n     and Contractors; Associated Equipment Distributors; \n     Associated General Contractors of America; Automotive \n     Aftermarket Industry Association; Financial Executives \n     International's Committee on Private Company Policy; \n     Financial Planning Association; Financial Services Institute, \n     Inc.; Independent Community Bankers of America; Independent \n     Insurance Agents & Brokers of America; International \n     Foodservice Distributors Association.\n       International Franchise Association; National Apartment \n     Association; The National Association for the Self-Employed; \n     National Association of Convenience Stores; National \n     Association of Wholesaler-Distributors; National Electrical \n     Contractors Association; National Federation of Independent \n     Businesses; National Funeral Directors Association; National \n     Grocers Association; National Multi Housing Council; National \n     Restaurant Association; National Roofing Contractors \n     Association; National Small Business Association; National \n     Utility Contractors Association; Printing Industries of \n     America; Professional Beauty Association; The S Corporation \n     Association; Truck Renting & Leasing Association; U.S. \n     Business and Industry Council; U.S. Chamber of Commerce; Wine \n     & Spirits Wholesalers of America.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, there is no reason we should be having this \ndebate today. Freezing student loan interest rates for 1 year during \ntough economic times is something I believe we all agree on, so it \nshould be relatively simple to accomplish. The President supports it, \nGovernor Romney supports it, and a bipartisan majority in both the \nHouse and the Senate supports it. Given this kind of agreement, I see \nno reason why both sides could not have a good-faith discussion on \nwhere to find the $6 billion in savings in a government with a budget \nthat spends nearly $2 trillion annually. Actually, we spend more than \n$2 trillion annually.\n  I would mention, this bill has not been to committee. I hope the \nAmerican people have noticed that bills that go to committee and then \ncome to the floor are usually successful. I hope they also notice that \nbills that do not go to committee and come to the floor are usually not \nsuccessful; they are usually a political statement. That is what we \nhave here again today.\n  This is how it works: You bring a bill that you know the other side--\nwell, in fact, this body has already voted on the concept of this tax \nbefore and defeated it. They know with that provision in there, this \ncommon interest will fail. So why do they do it? Well, you notice this \nis a motion to proceed and requires a cloture vote. So 40 of us can \nstop this bill, and will stop this bill in the condition it is in \nwithout having gone to committee. But when we stop things, it seems \nthose Republicans think that students ought to be paying more interest. \nThat is the part that is wrong. The part we are disagreeing about is \nhow to pay for it.\n  Pay for it? We have an economic judgment day coming in this country \nbecause of the debt we are running up on a daily basis. That is what \nput the world into kind of this funk anyway. I am not sure what is \ngoing to happen now that France has decided they are not going to have \nausterity and Greece has decided they are not going to have austerity. \nNow they have leaders who say they are going to fight any kind of \nausterity. It could put the world in a real crisis.\n  But what we are talking about is whether to keep the student interest \nrate at the low rate that it is right now, and we are going to have to \nvote on a bill that we are going to have to defeat because of the pay-\nfor in it,\n\n[[Page S2901]]\n\nwhich will make it look as though Republicans want to raise the rates \non students, and that is not true.\n  But the majority prefers to pick a fight rather than help students \nduring these tough economic times. What do I mean by this? After \ninitially reaching out to my staff, indicating their willingness to \nwork toward a bipartisan solution, they leaked their proposal before \ntalking to us, which contained the offset they have in here.\n  There could be a solution. We have to counter with one and ask that \nthere can be two side-by-side bills. That means we can have one they \nvote against, so we can say they did not want to keep student rates \nlow, which is also wrong. But somehow we have to figure this out, and \nwe have to do it in a bipartisan way. That means probably neither \nsuggestion that is up right now is the one that is going to work.\n  The majority would have Americans believe their bill simply closes a \nloophole used by wealthy doctors and lawyers and other professionals \nwho organize as an S corporation in order to avoid payroll taxes. Well, \nlet me tell you about taxes. If you are in one of those small business \nS corporations, you pay your taxes. You pay them on the year the \ncompany earns them--not the year the dividends are distributed. The \nyear the company earns it, you pay all of the taxes that are due on \nthat piece of money, even though you have to leave it in your business, \nso you can keep reinventing your business, so you can stay in business, \nso you can maintain the jobs you already have, and, hopefully, add a \nfew. That is what an S corporation does. It says: We are going to give \nyou this big break. We are going to let you pay your taxes upfront, \neven though you cannot take the money out.\n  But what we are talking about here is payroll taxes. Payroll taxes \nare the money all of us put in as an investment for our Social Security \nand our Medicare. That is what payroll taxes are. That is what we are \ntalking about now, charging on this money that has already had all the \nincome taxes paid on it and, incidentally, has also had payroll taxes \npaid on it.\n  The IRS is already given the authority to check and see if people are \ntaking out a de minimis distribution. There is an amount you have to \ntake out of your business and you have to claim it for salary. You \ncannot hide it as if you were rich or something. It does not work that \nway. The IRS has rules. The IRS can claim those payroll taxes. But what \nwe are talking about now is taking those payroll taxes--payroll taxes, \nremember, are Social Security and Medicare payments; they are \ninvestments in your Social Security and your Medicare--we are talking \nabout taking those and subsidizing student loans.\n  Medicare is in trouble and, once again, we are talking about stealing \nfrom Medicare. We did that in the health care bill. We took half a \ntrillion dollars out of Medicare and we put it into new programs. We \ndid not put it into a doc fix. You keep hearing us talk about the doc \nfix. We are not paying the docs enough that they want to take any new \nMedicare patients. Well, we did not take the money in Medicare that \nmight have been used and use it in Medicare to keep the Medicare system \nrunning. No. We put it into new programs so we could say this health \ncare plan was paid for.\n  Now we are saying we are going to use those payroll taxes and we are \ngoing to use them to subsidize the student loans. When does Medicare \never get the money to pay for Medicare? Oh, that is right, we have a \nnew board now--an unelected board--and this unelected board will tell \nus each and every year where we have to cut in Medicare in order to pay \nfor Medicare, even though we stripped all this other money out that \ncould have paid for Medicare. What a deal.\n  Well, here we go again. This tax would end the payroll taxes by \nshifting them into the student loans. When we are talking about pay-\nfors, we do all kinds of crazy things around here, and we should not be \ndoing them. We should be a little bit more straightforward, not just \nwith the students but with the American taxpayer. In reality, this is \nan irresponsible tax increase on small businesses at a time when we \nneed small businesses creating jobs so college students have employment \nopportunities when they graduate.\n\n  In Wyoming, S corporations are family owned small businesses working \nhard to keep their businesses afloat. As I mentioned, they get to pay \ntheir taxes even if they cannot draw the money out and use it. So, for \ninstance, small motels, small architecture firms, and groups of \nengineers might choose to operate as S corporations. Or they could be a \nfull corporation, and then they would have some of the same benefits \nWarren Buffett has. Warren Buffett makes millions and he does not have \nto pay payroll taxes on that. But we did not suggest ending Warren \nBuffett's payroll tax-free money. We are only going to do this to the \nsmall business corporations. Sounds fair? I do not think so.\n  This will also hurt family businesses in another way. For example, a \nson who is taking over an accounting practice from his father could be \nhit with substantial payroll taxes if he owns, for example, 10 percent \nof the firm, while his father, who is no longer active in the business, \nretains the other 90 percent.\n  These are not the tax scofflaws that the majority suggests this tax \nwill impact. They are real, small businesses that are the fabric of the \nAmerican economy. Small businesses accounted for 65 percent of the 15 \nmillion jobs created between 1993 and 2009. So rather than increasing \ntaxes on small engineering and accounting firms, we should be \nencouraging these businesses to hire new employees. As a former small \nbusinessman, I know this will not happen if we raise taxes on the very \nbusinesses we depend upon to turn the labor market around.\n  Recent reports demonstrate the need to encourage, rather than \ninhibit, job growth and creation. That is what we are talking about: \njobs. This year, more than 50 percent of college graduates are either \nunemployed or underemployed. Graduating in a bad economy, where jobs \nare scarce and lower wages are the norm, can have negative economic \nconsequences for up to 15 years. With the cost of higher education \nincreasing more rapidly than the median family income, there will \ncontinue to be greater dependence on student loans. Unless the economy \nimproves, there will also be a lesser chance that going forward \ngraduates will have the resources to even make minimum loan payments.\n  The Republican alternative puts forward a solution that takes money \nout of--and I know the Senator from Iowa hates the word--a slush fund, \nbut it is a fund with rather wide possibilities, and a fund that can be \ndesignated by the Secretary. This is not the first time this has been \nused as an offset. Our President signed legislation that cut $5 billion \nfrom the fund to offset the payroll tax bill. Now we are talking about \npayroll taxes again, but our side is talking about using the same \nfunding source the President used to pay for a payroll tax cut earlier \nthis year. The President also proposed to cut an additional $4.5 \nbillion out of the same fund when he submitted his budget for this \nyear.\n  I had to go and look and see what some of the uses are for this fund \nthat we would be cutting into because it is spent at the discretion of \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services and there are not a lot of \nguidelines. Many of the programs funded by this Prevention and Public \nHealth Fund--often called a slush fund--duplicate existing health \nprograms or waste taxpayer money on some frivolous programs.\n  The fund has wasted millions of taxpayer dollars and even supported \npotentially unlawful lobbying activity. For instance, a public health \nclinic in Nashville, TN, used money to offer free preventive services \nfor dogs and cats, not women and children; $3.6 million went to the \nMinnesota Department of Health to create at least four regional food \npolicy councils, to increase the access and availability of affordable \nhealthy food; $8.4 million to the New York Fund for Public Health to \nimplement a local tax on sugar-sweetened beverages; $3.3 million to the \nWashington State Department of Health to increase local preemption of \ntobacco marketing and taxation and support legislation that repeals \npreemption of tobacco marketing; $3 million to lobby lawmakers in New \nYork for legislation requiring chain restaurants to publicly post the \namounts of the calories they serve; $7 million to Jefferson County,\n\n[[Page S2902]]\n\nAL, to urge Alabama lawmakers to raise tobacco taxes; $16 million to \nthe County of Los Angeles to help secure a ban on new fast food \nrestaurants around Los Angeles. A lot of that is lobbying activity. \nYes, I suppose the end results could be prevention of health care.\n  This country is coming up on an economic judgment day. We do not have \nextra money lying around. In fact, when we are talking about pay-fors, \nwe are only talking about paying for whatever new is put in. We do not \ntalk about how we are going to cover the $15 trillion in debt we have \nout there, the $49,000 every man, woman, and child in the United States \nowes. It is a heavy burden.\n  I talked earlier about Greece. Greece only owes $39,000 per person. \nThey are just not trusted as much as the United States. If we keep \nrunning up that debt, we are not going to be trusted either. \nUnfortunately, President Obama and the congressional Democrats would \nrather play election-year politics than find a solution that focuses on \nthe immediate need of America's students and their families.\n  Neither bill is ideal. Each spends 10 years of savings in 1 year and \nneither produces a long-term, sustainable solution. However, the \nRepublican proposal has the benefit of using an offset previously used \nby the Democrats, as I mentioned. The $5 billion from that fund was \nused earlier this year to help pay for the extension of the payroll tax \nholiday, and in this year's budget, the President proposed cutting an \nadditional $4.5 billion.\n  The Democratic bill raises taxes on small businesses at a time when \nthe Nation needs those businesses to be creating jobs so college \nstudents have employment opportunities when they graduate. It is \ndiscriminating against small businesses because it does not take in \ncorporate dividends that people get, which are the same thing. It is \nthe dividends they eventually are able to take out of the business. But \na big corporation pays dividends to investors and those do not have \npayroll taxes taken out either.\n  So no sincere attempt was made by the Democrats to find a bipartisan \nsolution. Both Senator Reid and Senator Harkin reached out to my staff \nto inquire about the possibility of funding a solution. My staff \nexpressed a willingness to discuss possible offsets, but the Democrats \nreleased the details of their proposed S corporation tax prior to any \nmeeting.\n  When my staff did meet with Senator Harkin's office, his staff \nindicated the S corporation offset was the only offset the Democrats \nwere willing to consider. That makes compromise pretty difficult. \nSenator Reid has filed for cloture on S. 2343, the Democrats' bill we \nare talking about now, and a vote will be held tomorrow at noon. At \nthis point, we have been told we are not going to have a vote on the \nRepublican bill at all.\n  So cloture tomorrow will fail because there will be no opportunity to \nput any amendments on this bill, and this is not a perfectly drafted \nbill. This is something that was put together in a bit of a hurry \nwithout having bipartisan input. The reason we have 535 people in \nCongress is that there are a whole bunch of different viewpoints. The \nreason we have 22 people on a committee is that there are 22 viewpoints \nthat go into the bill and we can see what unintended consequences there \nare. That did not happen on this bill.\n  This has been put together by two or three people or half a dozen \nstaff members or whatever, I am not sure. But it has not had the input \nfrom both sides. So our side had to come up with a bill that follows \nthe same procedure. I can tell you neither bill is ideal, and a \nsolution has to be reached for these young people. We are all agreed on \nthat. We are just not agreed on how we pay for it, and we do have a \nproblem with paying for things around here.\n  I urge the majority leader to pull the bill from the floor, sit down \nwith us, find a solution we all can agree to. This is not an issue over \nwhich election-year politics should prevent us from reaching a \nbipartisan agreement. I am not aware of anybody who is opposed to the \nextension of the reduction in the interest rate. Incidentally, that is \nnot an interest rate reduction to everybody; it is only to those who \nhave subsidized loans.\n  If someone is a student who has regular loans, they are not able to \nparticipate in this. That would require a lot more money. Again, I urge \nthe majority leader to pull this bill, sit down, come up with a \nsolution both sides can agree on. It is getting tougher and tougher to \nfind pay-fors because we are getting further and further in the hole. \nWe are not going to stop digging, so we better start digging together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is no allocation of time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, am I correct the time for debate under \nthis bill will expire at 4 p.m.?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. At 4:30.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, after listening to the \nprevious three speakers, it is hard to know where to begin to correct \nthe record with all the misstatements. Maybe I will kind of work \nbackward. My good friend, the Senator from Wyoming, gave a whole list \nof different things about where this money was spent. He mentioned \nsomething about California and fast food construction. I did not get it \nall. But I am informed there was absolutely no money from the \nPrevention and Public Health Fund that went for that program.\n  If the Senator from Wyoming has any evidence to the contrary, I would \nbe more than delighted to look at it. Then there was the one about the \ndogs and cats in Nashville, TN. I thought the newspaper article that \nwas in the Hill newspaper put that one to rest, but I guess it did not. \nIt just goes on and on.\n  That money actually was funded by private grant money. I guess \nPetSmart, from what I am told, put that money in for pet spaying and \nneutering in Nashville, TN. Again, that money did not come from the \nPrevention and Public Health Fund. If the Senator from Wyoming has \nevidence to the contrary, I would like to look into that. Then the \nSenator from Wyoming mentioned the New York Department of Health using \n$3 million to lobby in New York for a soda tax initiative. First of \nall, I will tell my good friend, the Senator from Wyoming, there is an \nabsolute prohibition on Federal moneys being used for lobbying. So if \nanyone has any evidence of Federal funds being used to lobby, please \nlet us know. We would like to take them to task for that and sic the \nJustice Department on them.\n\n  That did not happen. It was not CDC funding. This was funding by the \nNew York State Department of Health. Again, none of the CDC money we \nused in the prevention fund was used for that. Those were just three \nof--I do not how many examples my friend the Senator from Wyoming had, \nbut those are just three of them there that absolutely had nothing to \ndo with the Prevention and Public Health Fund, but somehow this has \ngotten out in the popular press.\n  The city of Nashville received a $7.5 million grant to provide free \npet spaying and neutering. You put that out there and the radio talk \nshows pick up on that and all that kind of stuff. Then they bat this \naround and it gets everyone upset. My God, we are using tax money now \nto neuter dog and cats in Nashville, TN. Who would not be opposed to \nthat? It is not true. That is all. It is simply not true. As I say, if \nanyone has any evidence to the contrary, please let me know and we will \nget the Justice Department after them.\n  Again, I say to my friends on this side of the aisle that talk about \nseriousness of whether--how we are going to pay for this. I heard it \nsaid by the previous three speakers we all agree the interest rate \nshould not go up. OK. We have before us, as I understand, two choices \nright now. The Republican choice is the one passed by the House of \nRepresentatives a couple weeks ago, which would eliminate the \nPrevention and Public Health Fund and put that money in to keep the \ninterest rate down at 3.4 percent rather than letting it go up to 6.8 \npercent.\n  So they would eliminate the Prevention and Public Health Fund, about \nwhich I spoke at length a little while ago. Our bill would close a \nloophole in the Tax Code that allows certain subchapter S corporations \nto avoid paying their FICA taxes, their Social Security and Medicare \ntaxes, because of the way they are arranged.\n\n[[Page S2903]]\n\n  I am going to get into that in a minute and try to explain exactly \nhow that is set up. We are not going after small businesses at all. We \nare simply providing more of a bright line on what are legitimate \ndividends from a corporation, which does not have to pay FICA taxes, \nand what are wages and salaries that they do have to pay FICA taxes on.\n  Right now, in certain subchapter S corporations, it is kind of \ncloudy. It is kind of cloudy. As someone on the other side said, we \nhave seen this big increase in subchapter S corporations. Well, of \ncourse. People who have had partnerships before or sole proprietorships \nall of a sudden are rushing to establish subchapter S corporations, \nwith very few stockholders, to get away from paying their legitimate \ntaxes on Social Security and Medicare.\n  Our bill would close that loophole. We have these two choices in \nfront of us. Which do we want? If those are the only two, do we want to \neliminate the Prevention and Public Health Fund or do we want to put a \nbright line on subchapter S corporations and say if they cross that \nline they have to pay their Social Security and Medicare taxes? Maybe \nwe can have that vote. Maybe we have to actually have that vote here.\n  I would like to see if my Republican friends want to eliminate the \nPrevention and Public Health Fund. Earlier this year, from our \ncommittee I passed out to every Member of the Senate how much money \nwent to the individual States and what it was used for in the \nPrevention and Public Health Fund because I wanted to be transparent \nand above board. So I pointed out, for example--these are not private \nthings; these are public. I pointed out to my friend from Tennessee \nthat $4,669,362 was made available to Tennessee in this Prevention and \nWellness Fund for fiscal year 2011. I listed all the things it went to: \ncommunity programs to promote healthy living, detection and prevention \nof infectious diseases, clinical preventive services, strengthening of \npublic health infrastructure, tobacco prevention programs, some to East \nTennessee State University for the training and preparing of a public \nhealth workforce, Vanderbilt University Medical Center for clinical \npreventive services.\n  I get right down to the dollar, where it all went. I am not trying to \nhide anything. I say to my friend from Tennessee, ask these people \nwhere did this money go. We know where it went. Does my friend propose \nthat we cut out all this money that went to the State of Tennessee?\n  Here is Arizona: $7,758,944 went to Arizona in 2011. I gave this to \nmy friend from Arizona listing exactly where it went and what it went \nfor in prevention and wellness. Does my friend say this ought to be \neliminated? Wyoming got $1,785,534. Every bit of it is listed here, \nexactly where it went.\n  If we accept the Republicans' proposal, we do away with all of that, \nall prevention and public health. It has been said on the other side \nthat even our President wanted to do away with or take money out of it. \nI point out that the President did propose earlier this year as a pay-\nfor for the extension of the unemployment insurance program and for \nother things to keep tax rates from going up that we take $5 billion \nout of this program over the life. But I think the President made it \nvery clear that was it.\n  In fact, we have a Statement of Administration Policy on this bill \nwhich states unequivocally that the President will veto this bill if \nthere are any cuts in the Prevention and Public Health Fund. While I \nwas personally opposed to the $5 billion that the President proposed \ntaking out--and was taken out of the fund--I can say that, well, that \nought to be the last penny taken out of the Prevention and Public \nHealth Fund. Now we see that the President agrees, no more. We took $5 \nbillion out and that is the end of it.\n  People keep calling it a slush fund. I have here where every dollar \nwent in all of the States, what it went for. It did not go to neutering \ndogs in Nashville, TN, regardless of how many times we may read it or \nhear it on Rush Limbaugh or Joe Scarborough or anyplace else. It is not \ntrue. I challenge anybody, if they have that evidence, let's see it.\n  Again, I just think what the Republicans have offered as an offset is \nnot serious. I cannot believe they want to do away with the Prevention \nand Public Health Fund. On the other hand, is our proposal serious? Do \nwe want to really close this loophole for professional corporations \nunder subchapter S? Yes, we do. I think that is serious. There has been \na lot of abuse of people using the cover of subchapter S to avoid \npaying their taxes. A number of cases have come before us that I have \nseen where people have used subchapter S as a means of not paying their \nfair share of taxes.\n  One of the examples that just came through was former Senator John \nEdwards of North Carolina, a former Member of this body, a former \nPresidential candidate and Vice Presidential candidate. I will not get \ninto his personal life; that is something else. But former Senator John \nEdwards of North Carolina claimed, over a multiyear period, that $26 \nmillion in revenue from his subchapter S corporation was unearned. He \nclaimed he didn't really work for a large share of his income from \nwinning court cases. By making this argument, he avoided nearly \n$750,000 in payroll taxes.\n  That is not fair. That is an inappropriate gimmick. It is a gimmick \nwhen we allow a professional to give his or her spouse and children 95 \npercent of the stock in their subchapter S corporation and then declare \nit their profit and not their work as an accountant or as a lawyer that \nis responsible for the income. That is a gimmick. That is why people \nare rushing to form these subchapter S corporations.\n  We have a recent case where the taxpayer was an S corporation, an \naccounting practice owned by a CPA and his wife. The CPA served as the \ncorporation's president, treasurer, director, and only full-time \naccountant but received no salary. Imagine that. He received no salary. \nInstead, the CPA ``donated'' his services to the corporation and \nwithdrew earnings from the entity in the form of dividend distribution. \nDuring the years under audit, the CPA worked for the corporation \napproximately 36 hours per week. In addition to testifying that his \nwork was crucial to the continued success of the corporation's \nbusiness, the CPA also indicated that dividends were drawn in lieu of \nsalary to reduce employment taxes. Imagine that. The corporation \nasserted that the CPA was not an employee, and even if he was an \nemployee dividend distributions cannot be taxed as wages.\n  Well, he was caught in an audit. But, we know audits are few and far \nbetween. So the court found the shareholder to be an employee who \nperformed significant services. His wages encompassed all remuneration \nfor services, and it constituted all wages for tax purposes. That is \nwhat is happening. That is what is happening out there.\n  What does our bill do? Right now, if you are in a subchapter S \ncorporation, you, the person, get to say whether what you are making is \nincome or dividends. I heard mentioned something about Warren Buffett. \nI don't know his whole deal, but it seems to me that most of his income \nis from dividends and capital gains. We are not talking about that. We \nare talking about--this would be--if we took the subchapter S situation \nand applied it to C corporations, which Mr. Buffett would be in, then \nMr. Buffett would face a board with independent people making a \ndecision on officers' salary.\n  Now with subchapter S corporations with only one, two or three \nstockholders, they are making their own decisions on their personal \ntaxes, whether they are dividends or salary. What do you think people \ndecide?\n  Again, an accountant tells a subchapter S corporation it can do 40 \npercent and it would not get audited, they do 40 percent and don't get \naudited, and they don't have to pay Social Security or Medicare taxes \non what is really gain.\n  What do we do in this bill? We say: Look, if you are a professional \nsubchapter S corporation and you have three or fewer shareholders, then \nwe draw a bright line. If your income is over $250,000 a year for a \njoint filer, and if in fact there was earned income, then it would be \nsubject to FICA taxes. That is the bright line that we are drawing. In \nfact, what it will do is give subchapter S corporations a better idea \nof whether profits are earning money or dividends.\n  Quite frankly, not only are we helping to raise money for the \nMedicare\n\n[[Page S2904]]\n\nand Social Security trust funds, we are actually making it better for \npeople out there who may not know where they fall. Is it dividends or \nis it earned income? Our bill only covers a very narrow share of S \ncorporations. It deals only with certain professional corporations. It \ndoesn't touch manufacturing or retail activities. It doesn't touch real \nestate activities. It covers the area where the abuse is most prevalent \nright now.\n  I want to speak for a minute on what Senator Alexander was talking \nabout earlier about the money that came from students and whether it \nwas given back to students. He said that instead of 6.8 percent, it \nwould have been 5.3 percent. We voted on that and it failed. So we did \nspeak on that.\n\n  Again, what I point out is that most of this money--most of the money \nthat we had in that $61 billion, most of that indeed went for students. \nI think I had it here--of that $61 billion, $36 billion went to Pell \ngrants, helping raise Pell grants; $750 million went to bolster college \naccess for students through the College Access Challenge Grant Program; \n$2.55 billion went to Historically Black Colleges and Universities and \nminority-serving institutions; $2 billion went to community colleges; \nabout $10 billion was used for deficit reduction; $9.2 billion, as I \nsaid, went to certain health care activities.\n  Guess what one of those was that was paid for. Requiring dependent \ncoverage--saying that a young person can stay on his or her parents' \nhealth care policy until age 26. Does that help students? Of course it \nhelps students. How many young people who go off to college, and they \nare in college and maybe drop out a little while to make some money and \nthen go back to college and maybe even graduate, but they don't have a \nfull-time job--they can stay on their parents' policy until they are \nage 26.\n  I cannot tell you how many people I have heard from in my State of \nIowa who have said what a godsend this is to them and their kids who \nare students. I make no apologies for the fact that some of this money \nout of that $61 billion that went to subsidize banks went to help \nstudents stay on their parents' health care policy.\n  When they say some of the money came from students, it didn't. The \n$61 billion all came from cutting the subsidy to banks. The great bulk \nof it, all but about--well, $10 million went to pay the deficit down, \nand $9.2 billion went to things such as banning lifetime limits, \nrequiring dependent coverage, expanding community health centers, that \ntype of thing. So none of it actually came from students themselves. It \nall came from closing the loophole where banks were making on that \nmoney.\n  The next thing that was said I wanted to correct was that the \nMedicaid expansion in the affordable care act--100 percent of that \nexpansion is paid for in the Federal side, not the stateside. Senator \nAlexander talked about this and was saying we are expanding Medicaid, \nwhich is a burden on the States. That would be true, but for the fact \nthat 100 percent of this expansion is paid for by the Federal \nGovernment. I think that phases down to 90 percent in the future, but \nit never comes below 90 percent.\n  If the Senator would like to debate whether Medicaid should be all \nFederal, or Federal and State, we can do that and maybe even find some \ncommon ground on that, but that is not the case before us. I didn't \nthink the debate on this bill to keep student interest rates low would \nnow morph into a debate on health care. But if you want to have a \ndebate on health care, I will be more than happy to do so, and whether \nor not we should use money from the Prevention and Public Health Fund \nto pay for it.\n\n  So, again, I would say no money--no money--comes out of the Medicare \ntrust fund to pay for this bill--none--and certainly none comes out of \nthe Social Security trust fund. The money that is raised goes to the \nSocial Security trust fund and the Medicare trust fund. None of it is \nactually diverted from the trust funds.\n  Under the budget rules we are operating under, money raised can be \nused as an offset even though that money is raised for Medicare. I want \nto make it crystal clear that the money we are raising from closing \nthis loophole on subchapter S corporations, none of it--none of it--\nactually comes out of the trust funds for student loans or to keep the \ninterest rate low. It does go to the Medicare and Social Security trust \nfunds.\n  Under the Republican proposal, we would not get any more money into \nMedicare or Social Security. They would just do away with the \nPrevention and Public Health Fund and take that money and use it to \noffset keeping the interest rates low, but not one nickel of that would \ngo to Medicare or Social Security. Our bill would help those trust \nfunds.\n  So our bill really has three benefits: First, it closes a tax \nloophole, provides for more definitive application of what is \nsubchapter S income or dividends for a narrow class of companies--\nearned income or unearned income; second, it provides money to the \nSocial Security trust fund and Medicare trust fund, which is needed; \nand third, it allows the student interest rate loans, Federal \nsubsidized loans, to stay at 3.4 percent for the next year.\n  Sometime in the next year, obviously, we are going to have to figure \nout a long-term fix for this or what we want to do on these subsidized \nloans in the future and how we are going to pay for this down the road. \nIn the meantime, as everyone has said on both sides, we both agree it \nought to stay at 3.4 percent for the next year.\n  So I guess the debate does revolve around how we pay for it. Again, \nfrom my viewpoint--not my viewpoint; the House already voted last week \nto kill the Prevention and Public Health Fund, and that is what the \nRepublicans are proposing here.\n  Again, to refer back to where I started earlier this afternoon, I \nthink the lead editorial in the New York Times today was quite clear in \ntalking about the findings found in the New England Journal of Medicine \nabout what is happening with type 2 diabetes and how devastating that \nis going to be in the future. They said the long-term goal should be \nthe prevention of obesity and diabetes. The editorial said:\n\n       Congressional Republicans, meanwhile, are bent on \n     dismantling health care reforms that could greatly assist in \n     curbing the obesity epidemic. The Republican-dominated House \n     last month narrowly passed a bill that would eliminate a \n     Prevention and Public Health Fund, established under the \n     reform law in part to pay for lowering the interest rate on \n     subsidized student loans for a year.\n\n  The editorial noted that there is no explanation for this move except \nfor the usual anti-health care reform demagoguery and noted that the \nfund is already providing grants to state and local governments to help \npay for programs to fight obesity and prevent chronic diseases, \nincluding diabetes, in the community, the workplace, and among minority \ngroups.\n  So I guess that is really the argument--how do we pay for it? It \ncomes as no surprise, I am sure, when I say that I think closing this \nloophole is much better than doing away with the Prevention and Public \nHealth Fund.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I said it before and I will say it again: \nNeither option is ideal. These ought to be the options we are voting \non, but actually we are not going to get to vote on the two options, we \nare going to get to vote on one option because this is a cloture vote. \nAnd this cloture vote will fail. It will fail because it is not a good \nenough bill to pass. It is not a good enough bill to get 60 votes, so \nit will fail. And the only purpose of it failing is to say: Look at \nthose Republicans who killed that bill.\n  There could be a solution, but it isn't a solution by bringing a bill \ndirectly to the floor and saying: Take it or leave it. It has to be a \nsolution by sending it to committee and having the people there work \nout a way that it can be done. We have done that in our committee a \nnumber of times, and the bills that go to our committee and then come \nto the floor are pretty successful. But this one did not go to \ncommittee.\n  So it isn't really two choices we are getting, it is one choice: We \ncan take it the way the Democrats wrote it or we can forget it.\n  They say this closes a loophole because of the wording regarding \nthere being three or fewer shareholders. Now, I can already hear how \npeople's minds are working. They are saying: OK, if I want to cheat on \nthat--and you have\n\n[[Page S2905]]\n\nnow taught me how I can--I will add a fourth person. Now your bill \ndoesn't cover it. So it is not written properly. We are not going to \nstop them by doing what is written in the bill, so it is not going to \ngenerate any revenue. If it doesn't generate any revenue, it will not \npay for the cost of keeping the health care down.\n  Besides that, the IRS has guidelines that say how much one should be \ntaking out of their business as wages, and they have to pay a payroll \ntax on that or they will be taken to tax court. That is the case to \nwhich the Senator from Iowa referred. It was a case of an accountant \nwho got caught and was taken to tax court and told he couldn't cheat on \nhis taxes. Now, we ought to have more enforcement like that. It should \nbe pretty easy for the IRS to check and see if there are some S \ncorporations out there that aren't paying any wages. That should be a \nlittle computer check since every return gets turned into a digital \nreturn now. Some of us help the IRS by sending our forms in digitally \nto begin with, which saves a lot of input on someone's part. But they \ncan check in a matter of seconds the S corporations that have no wages, \nand if they have no wages, perhaps they ought to have a much lower \nlimit than what the other side is suggesting.\n  If we are going to do tax reform, let's do tax reform. To do it this \nway is the wrong way.\n  I also heard the comment that this money is not being taken from \nMedicare and Social Security. Well, the way we do Federal accounting--\nand we should be ashamed of the way we do Federal accounting--that can \nbe a true statement, but, in fact, it is not true. Here is how we do \nit. Here is how we cook the books as a Federal Government. We will \ncollect this tax that should go to Medicare and Social Security and we \nwill put bonds in a drawer and we will spend the money on the reduction \nin interest rates for the students. That is spending it twice because \nwe are still showing it over here as owing it to the Social Security \nand Medicare folks. But we do this all the time. Do you know how much \nmoney there actually is in the drawer called Social Security? Nothing. \nThere are bonds in there.\n\n  I used to listen to Senator Hollings, Democrat from South Carolina, \ntalking about how we were lootin' Social Security--lootin' it--because \nall we do is put bonds in a drawer and we spend the money. And we have \nbeen doing that for decades. So the deficit we are talking about is \nprobably considerably greater than what we are willing to admit. But \nthat is exactly what we are going to be doing here once again. We are \ngoing to be lootin' Social Security and Medicare and providing some \nloopholes for them to keep on doing the same thing they have been \ndoing. We are going to have to get the IRS on that and get it going \nbetter.\n  There ought to be a lot more options. But that is not what we are \ndoing here. What we should be doing is getting together and figuring \nout more options, more ways to take care of all of the problems \nstudents are having. And they are going to be demanding a whole lot \nmore than what we are doing.\n  I would remind the Democrats that the President did take $5 million \nfrom this prevention fund, and I heard him say that was enough. Well, \nif that was enough, how come his new budget includes taking another \n$4.5 billion out of that fund? So I guess he doesn't think that is \nenough. He thinks there is still more that can be taken--$4.5 billion. \nThis is a $6 billion project we are talking about here, so $1.5 billion \nanother way.\n  We are just talking past each other, and that is what happens any \ntime a bill comes to the floor if this is the only place we get to \ndebate it. Notice how many of my colleagues are listening to me right \nnow. If there are two people on the floor, it usually means one is \ngetting ready to speak and is not listening to what is being said. That \nis not a debate. That is not a way to come up with solutions. What we \nhave to do is send these things to committee.\n  Senator Harkin and I have a way of working on bills in committee, and \nthat is to have people turn in their amendments a couple days ahead of \ntime and we look at those. It is surprising how many times an amendment \nby a Republican is almost the same as an amendment by a Democrat. The \ntrick is to get the two of them to sit down together and figure out \nwhich words need to be changed so that they can both take credit for \nit.\n  So this is a frustrating process. It is the wrong way to do it. But I \nhave to answer one more thing yet; that is, I cited some cases where \nfunds were being used from that prevention fund that I thought were \nwrong and I do think are wrong. The Senator said that if we had some \ninformation on that, if we would give it to him, he would make sure the \nDepartment of Justice gets on it. Well, now we not only need to have \nthe IRS working, we have to have the Department of Justice working a \nlittle bit because there is some pretty good evidence, I think, that \nsome money has been spent for lobbying. In some cases it is called \nadvocacy, but it is by people working the legislators over, and that, \nin my opinion, is lobbying.\n  I do hope this bill will be referred to committee, which is where it \ndeserves to be, so that a solution can be worked out. I would hope that \nif we do have that cloture vote tomorrow, instead of having the bill \npulled, that both sides will join in saying ``send it to committee'' \nand vote against cloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I say to my good friend from Wyoming--and \nhe is my good friend, and we do a lot of good work together--I wish we \ncould have this bill in our committee. I think we could work it out. \nBut the fact is, to raise the money, it has to come from the Finance \nCommittee, and we don't have jurisdiction over that. If we had \njurisdiction over that, we could probably work it out. We have a good \nway of working things out in our committee. But we don't have \njurisdiction over finance on this darned thing. If we did, we could \nprobably figure it out.\n  Mr. ENZI. Could I amend my comments to have the Finance Committee \ntake the bill and work out a solution?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, I think that is where this came from. I don't know.\n  I would also say to my friend from Wyoming, because I was listening \nto him, I think it is fair, if we are going to have a vote on ours, \nthat we ought to have a vote on yours. I think that if we are going to \nhave a vote, we ought to have a vote on ours, which is the subchapter S \ncorporation, and see how that falls, and have a vote on whether we want \nto end the Prevention and Public Health Fund and use that money. I \nwould like to have that vote. I would love to have that vote. I would \nlove to see how my friends on the other side of the aisle want to vote \non whether they want to kill the Prevention and Public Health Fund.\n  I would also say that on this subchapter S corporation issue, the IRS \nright now audits about one-half of 1 percent of the returns from \nsubchapter S corporations. So they have to think, what are the odds \nthey are ever going to catch me, and if they do, they pay a fine and \nthat is it. The IRS doesn't have the personnel to do everyone.\n  What we are doing, I wish to say again, just to make it very clear, \nthat because of the sort of fog that surrounds subchapter S \ncorporations right now, the IRS simply can't audit them all. They don't \nhave the personnel to do that, and some claim that there is a lot of \nquestions about whether something is income or dividends. But let me \nrepeat again what our bill does.\n  We create a bright-line test that affects only a narrow class of \nsubchapter S corporations. It affects only professional subchapter S \ncorporations, those engaged in professions such as doctors, lawyers, \naccountants, consultants, lobbyists, where the gain is due to the \nprofessional work. This provision does not include subchapter S gains \nfrom unrelated retail, wholesale or manufacturing activities.\n  The provision only covers subchapter S corporations where there are \nthree or fewer stockholders. It only covers those earning more than \n$250,000 a year as a joint filer, and it only covers gains when 75% or \nmore are attributable to 3 or fewer stockholders.\n  So if a subchapter S company has income that is partially from \nprofessional activities, such as lobbying, and partially from other \nactivities, such as real estate investments, the investment income does \nnot fall under the rule.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation and the Treasury Inspector General \nfor\n\n[[Page S2906]]\n\nTax Administration have both issued reports that show that \nunderreporting of earned income subject to FICA taxes is a significant \nissue. Using IRS data, the Government Accountability Office in 2009 \ncalculated that in 2003 and 2004 tax years the net shareholder \ncompensation underreporting amounted to nearly $23 billion. Since then, \nthe number of subchapter S organizations has been increasing rapidly, \nand I would suggest that is a main reason why.\n  Lastly, I just wish to point out for the record, to my friend from \nWyoming, that the House bill did not go through the committee either. \nThey brought it directly to the floor. It did not go through the \nEducation Committee. It only went through the Rules Committee and then \nto the floor. So they did the same thing. They didn't go through their \ncommittee either. Again, I am hopeful we can work this out. But if we \ncan't, I say to my friend, I hope we do have an up-or-down vote on both \nprovisions.\n  There was one other thing I wished to mention before I leave the \nfloor this afternoon and leave this debate on the student interest rate \nbill; that is, I heard time and time again from the other side about \nthe fact that the President took $5 billion out of this and the fact \nthat I said earlier: Yes, and that was the limit and that was all and \nhe didn't want any more taken out of it. Someone said, but he has $4.5 \nbillion in his budget to take out.\n  What happened, the President did put $4.5 billion in his budget to \ntake out of the Prevention and Public Health Fund--which I hope comes \nas no surprise to anyone. Then, when the House and Senate earlier this \nyear were engaged in negotiations on extending the unemployment \ncompensation and also the payroll tax deduction, when we were engaged \nin that, they put that on the table. The President stuck with his $4.5 \nbillion, the Congress added another $500 million, and they come up with \na $5 million cut to the Prevention and Public Health Fund. The \nPresident said: That was in our budget. If you want to use it for that, \nuse it for that but no more.\n  As I said, we have a statement of administration policy that says \nthat if the elimination or any cuts to the Prevention and Public Health \nFund are in here, he will veto the bill. I just wanted to make clear \nthat the $5 billion and the $4.5 billion are one and the same. They are \nnot $9.5 billion that he wanted to take out of the Prevention and \nPublic Health Fund. I wanted to make that clear.\n  I see my friend from Florida is here, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the chairman and the ranking member, \nthe Senator from Wyoming, for all their hard work on bringing this \nimportant legislation to the floor.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to try to paint a personal face on some of \nthe students whom I have met this past week on how it is going to \nimpact them. But let me just set the table by saying we voted on this \nback in 2007 in order to give some relief to students, and we cut the \nloan interest from 6.8 to 3.4 for undergraduate Stafford loans.\n  The whole idea was, in this time of economic trial, that we would \ngive some little break to students. Indeed, it is and has been a break. \nIt is something on the average of $1,000 a year we were looking at a \nstudent saving in extra interest payments on these loans. When it comes \nright down to the personal stories, they are wrenching.\n  At the University of Florida, meeting with a group of students this \npast week, a young woman--I will not use her name because she just \nbroke down in tears--pointed out how not only did she have Stafford \nloans but that her mom--who had gone through school as an adult raising \na family--had gotten a degree in computer science and could not get a \njob, was going back to school because she had an LPN associate degree \nand wants a registered nurse degree where she can get a job. So the mom \nand the daughter both had a considerable number of loans. This young \nwoman absolutely broke down as to what it was going to be in the way of \nfinancial burden.\n  Over at the University of South Florida in Tampa, student body \npresident Matthew Diaz said: You are cutting down the dreams of an \nentire generation.\n  Another student at USF, Emmanuel Catalan, a political science major, \nsaid he is the first in his family to attend college. He questions, if \nwe don't give this break on interest, whether his brother and other \nmembers in his family are going to be able to pursue higher education.\n  Another student, Austin Prince, a sophomore microbiology and Chinese \nmajor, wondered how in the world students are going to make it in this \nkind of economy if they are mired in debt. He said: It reduces consumer \nbuying power if we are paying off loans for 20 years.\n  At the University of Florida, Madison Todd, a political science \nmajor, said she took out the maximum amount of loans available to \nattend the University of Florida, and her family has been scraping \ntogether everything they could in order that she could continue her \neducation.\n  Why is this important? Can we remember back to World War II, when we \ndefeated two enemies on either side of the globe and all those GIs came \nhome, and for the first time we had a major part of American youth \nunder the GI bill going into college. What did that do? America was at \nthe pinnacle of her power and influence in the world. Then, with that \ngeneration of young people getting educated as they never had before, \nall of a sudden we had an expanding middle class as we went into the \n1950s and the 1960s.\n\n  We will also remember that was a time of attention to high technology \nbecause we suddenly found ourselves behind the Soviets in the space \nrace, with Sputnik and then Gagarin going up. All the more kids went \ninto math and science and technology and look what that spawned in the \ngenerations to come because of education. A lot of that came directly \nout of the GI bill. Are we now to adopt policies that are going to \nreverse that trend?\n  We tried to take care of it in a diminishing economy, as we slipped \ninto the recession back in 2007, by saying it is a matter of policy \nthat we should lower interest rates for students who want to get their \neducation. Here we are. What this boils down to is how are we going to \npay for it? It costs $6 billion for 1 year.\n  The House of Representatives has taken a position and that has been \ndiscussed here. Their position is take it out of the health care bill. \nWhen we take it out of health care, we are taking it out of diabetes \nscreening, heart disease screening, cancer screening for breast and \ncervical cancer. Do we want to do that? I don't think so.\n  Do we want to take it out of antitobacco programs to try to keep kids \nfrom getting hooked on tobacco? I don't think so.\n  Do we want to take it out of childhood immunizations, where the \nspending of $1 on childhood immunizations by the Federal Government \nsaves the government $16 in the long run? That is a ratio of 1 to 16 \nbecause of children not getting the diseases they were immunized \nagainst. Do we want to take it out of that? I don't think so.\n  What have we come up with in the Senate? We came up with a narrow \npart of the tax-paying public, subchapter S corporation individuals who \npay individual tax--not corporate tax--and only those in a joint return \nabove $250,000 gross income. They would do what? They would pay the \npayroll tax, Medicare, and Social Security that they do not pay under \nthe existing law because they are treated as if they were a corporation \ninstead of a partner which, in effect, they are, save for the tax laws.\n  That is the choice. If this motion does not get 60 votes in order to \nbreak the filibuster or even if it does, we have to reconcile the pay-\nfor for the $6 billion this student loan interest bill will cost. It is \nmy hope that common sense, that bipartisanship, that nonideological \nrigidity would rule the day and that we would simply ask what is best \nfor our people and for our country.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S2907]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/07/senate-section/article/S2907-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2907-S2913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF JACQUELINE H.

LEE TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n                     NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nominations of Jacqueline H. Nguyen, \nof California, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit; \nKristine Gerhard Baker, of Arkansas, to be United States District Judge \nfor the Eastern District of Arkansas; and John Z. Lee, of Illinois, to \nbe United States District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 60 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for the last 4 months, the Senate has been \nforced to slowly work its way through the backlog created by Republican \nobjections at the end of last year to consensus nominees. Finally, with \nconsideration today of the long-delayed nomination of Judge Nguyen to \nfill a longstanding judicial emergency vacancy on the overburdened \nNinth Circuit, the Senate will have completed the confirmations that \ncould and should have taken place last year.\n  Today, 5 months into the year, is the first time the Senate is \nconsidering judicial nominations reported by the Judiciary Committee \nthis year. Confirmations of the nominations of Kristine Baker to fill a \njudicial emergency vacancy in the Eastern District of Arkansas and John \nLee to fill a judicial emergency vacancy in the Northern District of \nIllinois have been delayed for nearly 3 months. These nominees have the \nsupport of their home state Senators and of a bipartisan majority of \nthe Judiciary Committee. Yet these consensus nominees have been delayed \nfor months for no good reason.\n  The nominations we consider today are but three of the 22 judicial \nnominees available for final Senate action. Most are by any measure \nconsensus nominees who could and should be confirmed without further \ndelay. That would go a long way toward getting us on track to make real \nprogress in reducing judicial vacancies that have plagued the Federal \ncourts around the country.\n  I want to share with the Senate and the American people a chart \ncomparing vacancies during the first terms of President Bush and \nPresident Obama. This chart shows that the lack of real progress during \nthe last 3\\1/3\\ years is in stark contrast to the way in which we moved \nto reduce judicial vacancies during the last Republican presidency.\n  During President Bush's first term we reduced the number of judicial \nvacancies by almost 75 percent. When I became Chairman in the summer of \n2001, there were 110 vacancies. As Chairman, I worked with the \nadministration and Senators from both sides of the aisle to confirm 100 \njudicial nominees of a conservative Republican President in 17 months. \nSee how sharply the line slopes as we reduced vacancies in 2001 and \n2002.\n  We continued when in the minority to work with Senate Republicans and \nconfirm President Bush's consensus judicial nominations well into 2004, \na presidential election year. At the end of that presidential term, the \nSenate had acted to confirm 205 circuit and district court nominees. \nThe chart notes where we stood in May 2004, having reduced judicial \nvacancies under 50 on the way to 28 that August. By comparison, see how \nlong vacancies have remained near or above 80 and how little \ncomparative progress we have made during the 4 years of President \nObama's first term. Again, if we could move forward to Senate votes on \nthe 22 judicial nominees ready for final action, the Senate could \nreduce vacancies to less than 60 and make progress.\n  Today also marks the first Senate action this year to address the \nneeds of the Ninth Circuit, by far the busiest Federal appeals court in \nthe country. The Senate should have voted on the long-delayed \nnomination of Judge Jacqueline Nguyen of California to the Ninth \nCircuit over 5 months ago, after it was reported unanimously by the \nJudiciary Committee. Her nomination is one of three Ninth Circuit \nnominations currently pending and awaiting a Senate vote to fill \njudicial emergency vacancies plaguing that circuit. With nearly three \ntimes the number of cases pending as the next busiest circuit, we \ncannot afford to further delay Senate votes on the other two \nnominations to the Ninth Circuit, Paul Watford of California, reported \nfavorably by the Committee over 3 months ago, or Andrew Hurwitz of \nArizona, reported favorably over 2 months ago.\n  There is no good reason for Senate Republicans to further delay votes \non these Ninth Circuit nominees. The 61 million people served by the \nNinth Circuit are not served by this delay. The circuit is being forced \nto handle double the caseload of any other without its full complement \nof judges. The Senate should be expediting consideration not only of \nJudge Jacqueline Nguyen, but also of Paul Watford and Justice Andrew \nHurwitz, not delaying them.\n  The Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit, Judge Alex Kozinski, a Reagan \nappointee, along with the members of the Judicial Council of the Ninth \nCircuit, wrote to the Senate months ago emphasizing the Ninth Circuit's \n``desperate need for judges,'' urging the Senate to ``act on judicial \nnominees without delay,'' and concluding ``we fear that the public will \nsuffer unless our vacancies are filled very promptly.'' The judicial \nemergency vacancies on the Ninth Circuit are harming litigants by \ncreating unnecessary and costly delays. The Administrative Office of \nU.S. Courts reports that it takes nearly 5 months longer for the Ninth \nCircuit to issue an opinion after an appeal is filed, compared to all \nother circuits. The Ninth Circuit's backlog of pending cases far \nexceeds other Federal courts. As of the end of 2011, the Ninth Circuit \nhad 13,913 cases pending before it, far more than any other circuit.\n  If caseloads were really a concern of Republican Senators, as they \ncontended last year when they filibustered the nomination of Caitlin \nHalligan to the D.C. Circuit, they would not be delaying the \nnominations to fill judicial emergency vacancies in the Ninth Circuit. \nIf caseloads were really a concern, Senate Republicans would consent to \nmove forward with votes on Paul Watford and Justice Hurwitz and allow \nfor up or down votes by the Senate without these months of unnecessary \ndelays.\n  Given that all three are superbly qualified mainstream nominees with \nbipartisan support, the long delays that have plagued these nominations \nare hard to understand. Judge Nguyen, whose family fled to the United \nStates in 1975 after the fall of South Vietnam, was confirmed \nunanimously to the district court in 2009 and the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee unanimously supported her nomination to the Ninth Circuit \nlast year. When confirmed, she will be the first Asian Pacific American \nwoman to serve on a U.S. Court of Appeals in our history. She is the \nkind of nominee who should have been confirming in 5 days, not 5 \nmonths.\n  We still await Republican agreement to vote on the other two \nnominees, neither of whom would have been considered controversial by \npast Congresses. Paul Watford was rated unanimously well qualified by \nthe ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, the highest \nrating possible. He clerked at the United States Supreme Court for \nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and on the Ninth Circuit for now-Chief \nJudge Alex Kozinski. He was a Federal prosecutor in Los Angeles. He has \nthe support of his home State Senators and bipartisan support from \nnoted conservatives such as Daniel Collins, who served as Associate \nDeputy Attorney General in the Bush administration; Professors Eugene \nVolokh and Orin Kerr; and Jeremy Rosen, the former president of the Los \nAngeles chapter of the Federalist Society.\n\n  Justice Hurwitz is a respected and experience jurist on the Arizona \nSupreme Court. He also received the ABA's Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary's highest rating possible, unanimously well \nqualified. This\n\n[[Page S2908]]\n\nnomination has the strong support of both his Republican home State \nSenators, Senator John McCain and Senator Jon Kyl.\n  We have much more work to do to help resolve the judicial vacancy \ncrisis that has persisted for more than 3 years. Today the Senate \nfinally votes on 3 of the 22 judicial nominations that have been \nreported by the Judiciary Committee after a thorough review. Despite \nvacancies in nearly 1 out of every 10 Federal judgeships, Senate \nRepublicans continue to delay votes and are stalling action on nearly \n20 current judicial nominations on which the Senate could be taking \nfinal action. If confirmed those judges would serve 150 million \nAmericans.\n  When the majority leader and the Republican leader came to their \ninterim understanding in March, it resulted in votes on 14 of the 22 \njudicial nominations then awaiting final consideration. Because the \narrangement took months to implement what the Senate could have done in \nhours, the backlog of judicial vacancies and judicial nominees \ncontinues. Today we are right back where we started with 22 judicial \nnominees awaiting action. I know that the majority leader is working to \ncontinue seeking Republican agreement to debate and vote on the \nremaining judicial nominees. It should not require overcoming \nfilibusters and political standoffs for the Senate to do its job of \npromptly considering judicial nominations, especially when so many of \nthem have bipartisan support and are consensus nominees.\n  The backlog of nominations ready for final action is not necessary or \ntypical. It is an artificial backlog created by the refusal of Senate \nRepublicans to consider judicial nominees at the end of each of the \nlast 2 years and their insistence of delays of months before \nconfirmation of consensus nominees. These practices have meant that the \nSenate's confirmations have barely kept up with attrition on the \nFederal bench. When Republicans refused to consent to consider 19 \njudicial nominations at the end of 2010, it took us until June of last \nyear to work through those nominations. When they did so again at the \nend of last year, it took us until today, a week into May, to catch up \nwith last year's nominations. That is not how to reduce judicial \nvacancies.\n  The Senate needs to continue working and continue consideration of \njudicial nominees recommended by the Judiciary Committee if we are to \nmake real progress in reducing the burden of judicial vacancies. That \nis what we did in the most recent presidential election years of 2004 \nand 2008 and what we should be doing this year. Before we hear any more \ntalk of slowing down or shutting off judicial confirmations, we have a \nlong way to go. We need to work to reduce the vacancies that are \nburdening the Federal judiciary and the millions of Americans who rely \non our Federal courts to seek justice.\n  At this same point in the Bush administration, we had reduced \njudicial vacancies around the country to under 50. Today they stand at \nnearly 80. And by August 2004, we reduced judicial vacancies to just 28 \nvacancies. Despite 2004 being a presidential election year, we were \nable to reduce vacancies to the lowest level in the last 20 years. At a \ntime of great turmoil and political confrontation, despite the attack \non 9/11, the anthrax letters shutting down Senate offices, and the \nideologically driven judicial selections of President Bush, we worked \ntogether to promptly confirm consensus nominees and significantly \nreduce judicial vacancies.\n  In 2008, another presidential election year, we again worked to \nreduce judicial vacancies and by October we were able to reduce \njudicial vacancies back down to 34 vacancies. I accommodated Senate \nRepublicans and continued holding expedited hearings and votes on \njudicial nominations into September 2008.\n  We lowered vacancy rates more than twice as quickly during President \nBush's first term as Senate Republicans have allowed during President \nObama's first term. The vacancy rate remains nearly twice what it was \nat this point in the first term of President Bush. The Senate is 30 \nbehind the number of circuit and district court confirmations at this \npoint in President Bush's fourth year in office. We are 63 \nconfirmations from the total of 205 that we reached by the end of \nPresident Bush's fourth year.\n  Today's consensus nominees are examples of those who have been \nunnecessarily stalled for months.\n  Kristine Baker, nominated to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the \nEastern District of Arkansas, has spent nearly 15 years in private \npractice after graduating with honors from the University of Arkansas \nSchool of Law and clerking for Judge Susan Weber Wright on the court to \nwhich she has been nominated. Ms. Baker's nomination has the bipartisan \nsupport of her home State Senators. Her nomination was favorably \nreported by the Judiciary Committee with the support of nearly every \nSenator on February 16.\n  John Lee, nominated to fill one of three judicial emergency vacancies \non the Northern District of Illinois, has worked in private practice \nfor almost 20 years. His personal story is remarkable. Born to a coal \nminer and a nurse of Korean descent, Mr. Lee immigrated to the United \nStates when he was 5 years old and went on to graduate from Harvard \nCollege and Harvard Law School. If confirmed, he will become the second \nKorean-American to serve as a Federal district court judge, and the \nsecond Asian-American to serve as a Federal judge in the courts \nencompassed by the Seventh Circuit. Mr. Lee's nomination has the \nbipartisan support of his home State Senators. They both also support \nthe confirmation of John Tharp, a former nominee of President George W. \nBush, to another judicial emergency vacancy in that district. With \nRepublican consent we could also be voting on the Tharp nomination. \nBoth Illinois nominations were favorably reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee with only one Senator dissenting on February 16.\n  Today's votes must be a starting point for considering this year's \njudicial nominations if we want to bring down judicial vacancies and \nhope to match the progress we were able to make in 2004 and 2008, both \nPresidential election years in which we considered the nominations of a \nRepublican President and continued to reduce judicial vacancies. I hope \nthat Senate Republicans will stop blocking prompt confirmation of \nconsensus nominees. That is a destructive development and new practice \nthat has contributed to keeping the Senate behind the curve, keeping \nFederal judicial vacancies unfilled, overburdening the Federal courts, \nand keeping Americans from securing prompt justice. The American people \ndeserve better.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent the time \nbe divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Kristine \nBaker's nomination as United States District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Arkansas. Kris Baker is a great lawyer recognized by her \npeers as well as legal organizations for her dedication to litigation \non a wide range of issues, from deceptive trade practices to first \namendment matters.\n  I had the opportunity to introduce her during her confirmation \nhearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. After reviewing her \nrecord and meeting with her personally, as well as meeting with those \nwho know her, looking at her reputation, looking at her abilities, I am \nconfident that Kris's experience makes her qualified to be the next \neastern district judge of Arkansas.\n  Kris moved to Arkansas in 1994 to pursue a JD from the University of \nArkansas School of Law. During law school, she established herself as a \nhard worker committed to success. She graduated with high honors, was \narticles editor for the Arkansas Law Review, a member of the board of \nadvocates, and a member of the University of Arkansas first amendment \nnational moot court team.\n  Kris began her legal career after graduation as a law clerk for Judge \nSusan Wright, then chief judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas. In \n2000 she joined her current law firm, Quattlebaum, Grooms, Tull, and \nBurrow, and became a partner 2 years later.\n\n[[Page S2909]]\n\n  Kris has earned the respect of the legal community across Arkansas, \nand I believe her litigation experience has given her the knowledge, \nthe skills, and the temperament needed to successfully serve on the \nFederal bench.\n  I am honored to recommend that the Senate confirm Kristine Baker to \nserve the people of America as a judge for the Eastern District of \nArkansas.\n  I note the absence of a quorum and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, is it appropriate in the Senate schedule \nto start debate on the judges?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The judges are pending.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today the Senate is expected to confirm \nthree additional judicial nominees. With the confirmation of Judge \nNguyen to the ninth circuit, Ms. Baker to the Eastern District of \nArkansas, and Mr. Lee to the Northern District of Illinois, we will \nhave confirmed 83 judicial nominees during this Congress.\n  It is somewhat ironic that today, according to press accounts, the \nWhite House is holding a forum and strategy session with administration \nofficials and 150 supporters from across the country concerned about \nthe judicial vacancy rate. I wonder if at this strategy session the \nWhite House took a look in the mirror when addressing the vacancy rate. \nOnly the President can make nominations to the Senate. While we have a \nresponsibility to advise and consent on those nominations, Senators \ncannot fill vacancies unless people are nominated for those positions. \nI would note the President has failed to do this in 47 of the 76 \nremaining vacancies, including 21 of 35 seats designated as judicial \nemergencies. That is more than 60 percent of the current vacancies with \nno nominee.\n  The White House and the Senate majority are fond of their claim that \nmillions of Americans are living in districts with vacancies. Of \ncourse, what the other side fails to tell you is that 88 million \nAmericans live in judicial districts where vacancies exist because the \nPresident has failed to nominate judges. Most of those seats have been \nvacant for more than a whole year. Once again, if the White House is \nserious about judicial vacancies, it holds the key to nominating and \nfilling those vacancies. It has failed in too many instances to use \nthat key.\n\n  Furthermore, according to the press accounts, in its invitation, the \nWhite House accused Republicans of subjecting consensus nominees to \n``unprecedented delays and filibusters.'' This is a statement without \nfactual basis, and it ignores the record of judicial nominations.\n  I would note that after today's confirmation, there are 12 nominees \non the Executive Calendar that might fall into the category of \nconsensus nominees. Seven nominees on the calendar had significant \nopposition in the committee and clearly are not consensus nominees. The \nsubstantial majority of those 12 nominees were reported out of \ncommittee less than 10 legislative days ago. Not only is there no \nfilibuster against any of the consensus nominees, but I am not sure how \nthere can be accusation of delay and particularly partisan delay.\n  Let me remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle of the \nobstructionism, delay, and filibusters which they perfected. The \nhistory of President Bush's nominees to the Ninth Circuit provides some \nexamples. President Bush nominated nine individuals to the Ninth \nCircuit. Three of those nominations were filibustered. Two of those \nfilibusters were successful. The nominations of Carolyn Kuhl and \nWilliam Gerry Myers languished for years before being returned to the \nPresident. A fourth nominee, Randy Smith, waited over 14 months before \nfinally being confirmed after his nomination was blocked and returned \nto the President. After being renominated, he was finally confirmed \nunanimously.\n  President Obama, on the other hand, has nominated six individuals to \nthe Ninth Circuit. Only one of those nominees was subject to a cloture \nvote. After the vote failed, the nominee withdrew. Today we confirm the \nthird nomination of this President to the Ninth Circuit. Those three \nconfirmations took an average of about 8 months from the date of \nnomination. For all of President Obama's circuit nominees, the average \ntime from nomination to confirmation is about 242 days. For President \nBush's circuit nominees, the average wait for confirmation was 350 \ndays. One might ask why President Bush was treated so differently, with \nso much more delay than this President has been treated or his nominees \nhave been treated.\n  Another example of past Democratic obstruction and delay is in \nArkansas. Today we confirm President Obama's nominee to the Eastern \nDistrict of Arkansas within about 6 months of her nomination. I would \nnote that President Bush's nominee, Jay Leon Holmes, sat on the \nExecutive Calendar for more than 14 months awaiting confirmation. From \nnomination, his confirmation took over 17 months. Again, why were \nPresident Bush's nominees treated worse than this President's nominees?\n  I can only conclude that the White House has selective memory or \ndifferent definitions when it accuses Republicans of unprecedented \ndelay and obstructionism. I am disappointed that the President \ncontinues to blame Republicans for vacancies that have no nominee and \nchooses to follow the political strategy of blaming rather than working \nwith the Senate to nominate consensus nominees. In other words, why \nisn't the President, instead of having a conference on why there are \njudicial vacancies, taking the same amount of time to get the names up \nhere so we can work on them?\n  Mr. President, Jacqueline Nguyen, presently serving as a U.S. \ndistrict judge, is nominated to be a U.S. circuit judge for the Ninth \nCircuit. Judge Nguyen received her A.B. from Occidental College in 1987 \nand her J.D. from the University of California, Los Angeles School of \nLaw, in 1991. She began her legal career as an associate in the \nLitigation Department at the Los Angeles law firm of Musick, Peeler & \nGarrett where she handled litigation matters involving commercial \ndisputes, intellectual property, and construction defects. From 1995 \nuntil 2002, Judge Nguyen was an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the U.S. \nAttorney's Office for the Central District of California. There, she \nhandled the investigation and prosecution of human trafficking, \nimmigration fraud, mail and tax fraud, and money laundering cases. In \n2000, Judge Nguyen became deputy chief of the General Crimes Section. \nIn that position, she handled the training and supervision of all new \nAssistant U.S. Attorneys and various types of criminal cases involving \nviolent crimes, drug trafficking, firearms violations, and fraud.\n  In 2002, Governor Gray Davis appointed Judge Nguyen to the Superior \nCourt for the County of Los Angeles. In 2009, she was nominated by \nPresident Obama to be U.S. district judge for the Central District of \nCalifornia. The Senate approved her nomination on December 1, 2009 by a \nvote of 97 0. In her capacity as a judge, she has presided over \nthousands of cases.\n  The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal judiciary unanimously rated \nher as ``qualified'' for this position.\n  Kristine Gerhard Baker is nominated to be U.S. district judge for the \nEastern District of Arkansas. Ms. Baker received her B.A. from St. \nLouis University in 1993 and her J.D. from University of Arkansas \nSchool of Law in 1996. She served as a law clerk for the Honorable \nSusan Webber Wright, then the chief judge of the United States District \nCourt for the Eastern District of Arkansas. In 1998 she became an \nassociate in the law firm Williams & Anderson, LLP, where she handled \ncommercial litigation cases involving breach of contract and fraud. In \n2000, Ms. Baker joined the law firm Quattlebaum, Grooms, Tull & Burrow, \nPLLC. Her focus at the firm has been devoted to complex commercial \nlitigation cases, including cases involving employment discrimination, \nsecurities violations, unfair competition, sic products liability, Fair \nHousing Act claims, and Freedom of Information Act claims. She has \nhandled in administrative proceedings and in Federal and State court \nclaims for discrimination, harassment, and wrongful termination as well \nas claims arising under\n\n[[Page S2910]]\n\nthe Family and Medical Leave Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, \nand the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The ABA Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary gave her a substantial majority \nrating of ``well qualified'' and a minority ``qualified.''\n  John Z. Lee is nominated to be U.S. district judge for the Northern \nDistrict of Illinois. Mr. Lee received his A.B. from Harvard College in \n1989 and his J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1992. He began his legal \ncareer as a trial attorney for the United States Department of Justice, \nEnvironment & Natural Resources Division. There he represented the \nUnited States in Federal courts on issues primarily involving \nenvironmental statutes. He also served as special assistant to the \ncounsel to former Attorney General Janet Reno.\n  In 1994, he left the public sector to take a job as an associate at \nMayer Brown. In 1996, he joined a new firm, Grippo & Elden, as an \nassociate. In 1999, he moved to his current firm, Freeborn & Peters. \nThere he made income partner in 2001 and equity partner in 2004. In \nprivate practice, Mr. Lee has focused almost entirely on litigation, \nexpanding his expertise to complex commercial disputes, including cases \ninvolving antitrust, intellectual property, employment, and business \ntort issues. Most of these cases were in Federal courts, particularly \nthe Seventh and Ninth Circuits. He also represented clients in criminal \ninvestigations of antitrust and financial regulations violations. In \nprivate practice, he represents public and private companies, \nindividual businesspersons and low-income clients pro bono. He has an \nABA rating of substantial majority ``qualified,'' minority ``not \nqualified.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nnominations of John Lee and Jay Tharp to serve on the District Court \nfor the Northern District of Illinois.\n  I have listened carefully to the statement made by the ranking \nRepublican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. I would note several \nthings.\n  First, at this point in President George W. Bush's first term, the \nDemocratic Senate had approved 30 more judges than have been approved \nunder the current situation with this divided Senate. Second, it would \ntake 60 judicial nominations to be filled by the end of the year for \nPresident Obama to have received the same treatment as President George \nW. Bush in his first term--60. We could get a lot of that done today. \nRight here are 22 nominations for the judiciary that have cleared the \ncommittee. If the Senator from Iowa would like to come to the floor and \njoin me, we could make a joint unanimous consent request to bring up \nall 22 immediately--every one of them--all of whom have cleared the \ncommittee. Those Senators who want to vote against those nominations \nmay do so. They can vote no. But, unfortunately, as we can see from \nthis calendar, the names of the nominees languished on this calendar \nfor months--literally for months--and many times passed with a voice \nvote or a unanimous vote. It really does not speak well of this process \nthat we have reached this point, this slowdown.\n  What many Republicans are waiting for is the so-called Thurmond rule. \nIt is not a rule written in a book; it refers to Senator Strom Thurmond \nof South Carolina, who kind of announced at one point in his career: We \nare going to stop considering judges as of a certain point in an \nelection year. I have been in the Senate a few years and have heard so \nmany different explanations about what the Thurmond rule really means, \nalthough I am not sure anyone really knows. All we know is that in a \npolitical campaign year, politics rule, and in this situation many \nRepublicans are holding up perfectly fine nominees approved by \nDemocrats and Republicans in committee for no other reason but the hope \nthat they can win back the White House in November and fill the \nnominees with their favorites. I don't think that is fair to the \nnominees who have gone through the process, many of whom have been \ncleared by a bipartisan vote and should be confirmed in a timely \nfashion.\n  Let me speak to a particular issue that is addressed by the nominee \nbefore us. There are two nominees from Illinois to fill vacancies: John \nLee and Jay Tharp. The chief judge of the Northern District, Judge Jim \nHolderman, sent a letter to me and Senator Kirk in February calling for \nMr. Lee and Mr. Tharp to be confirmed without delay because of the \nheavy caseload in this court. Senator Kirk and I decided to work \ntogether on a bipartisan basis, and we did. We had a process on which \nwe both agreed. He picked a bipartisan group to come up with his \nnominee and I did the same on my side. But the understanding was that \nat the end of the day, neither of our nominees would move forward \nwithout the approval of the other Senator. So, in fact, they were \nbipartisan choices, both of them. John Lee is my choice. Jay Tharp is \nSenator Kirk's choice. We both support one another's choice. We believe \nboth of these nominees have the experience, qualifications, \ntemperament, and integrity necessary to serve in the Federal judiciary.\n  Mr. Lee and Mr. Tharp were both nominated on November 10, 2011--6 \nmonths ago. They appeared together in a hearing before the Judiciary \nCommittee in January. They were both reported out of committee in \nFebruary on a bipartisan voice vote.\n  There was an agreement reached between Senator McConnell and Senator \nHarry Reid, the majority leader, about the nominees we brought forward \nfor a vote. I was surprised when it was announced in March that the Lee \nand Tharp nominations, which had been together all through the process, \nwere separated. The deal or arrangement called for John Lee to be \nscheduled for a confirmation vote by May 7, but at the insistence of \nthe Republican leader, Senator McConnell, the deal did not include all \nof the nominees on the Senate calendar and it did not schedule a vote \nfor Mr. Jay Tharp, Senator Kirk's nominee. I believe they should be \nconfirmed together, just as they were nominated together and went \nthrough the committee together.\n  As soon as I heard about this so-called arrangement, I went first to \nSenator Kyl and then to Senator McConnell and said: Don't do this. \nDon't hold up Senator Kirk's nominee. He is in the hospital--now he is \nhome, thank goodness--recovering from a stroke. We did this together. \nWe are working together. Don't separate these two fine men. There is no \nreason to do it.\n  But I understand that this was the arrangement and they didn't want \nto change it--even to help Senator Kirk under these circumstances. They \nwanted to do only two nominees a week over a 7-week period of time, and \nthe cutoff--the line they drew--was, unfortunately, between Mr. Lee and \nMr. Tharp.\n  Well, I was going to propound a unanimous consent request today to \ninclude Mr. Tharp along with Mr. Lee on the vote we are about to take. \nThere is only one reason I am not. We have received an ironclad \nassurance from the Senate Republican floor staff that Mr. Tharp is \ngoing to be called on a timely basis during this work period. I am \ngoing to hold them to it. I don't want to embarrass anyone, but it \nbothers me that the nominee of Senator Kirk is being held up by the \nRepublican side of the aisle when it should be voted on today. There is \nno reason why it should not be voted on today. We should vote for both \nof them. But because a word has been given to me by a staff member whom \nI respect very much, I won't make this unanimous consent request. \nHowever, let me say this: If something happens--I don't know what it \nmight be, and I hope it doesn't--I am prepared to come to the floor and \npropound that unanimous consent request not only on behalf of Senator \nKirk but on behalf of my State and on behalf of my own interests in \nmaking sure that our Federal judiciary has a complement of qualified \npeople.\n  Let me say a few words about each nominee--extraordinarily good \nnominees.\n  John Lee has been nominated to fill the judicial vacancy held by \nJudge David Coar. Mr. Lee is currently a partner at the law firm of \nFreeborn & Peters in Chicago, where he practices primarily in \ncommercial litigation.\n  He is the son of a coal miner and a nurse. He immigrated to this \ncountry, to Chicago, at a very young age. From humble beginnings, he \nattended Harvard College, where he graduated magna cum laude and then \nearned his\n\n[[Page S2911]]\n\nlaw degree cum laude from Harvard Law School.\n  After law school, Mr. Lee worked as a trial attorney in the \nDepartment of Justice Environment and Natural Resources Division. After \nhis tenure at the Justice Department, he worked in private practice and \neventually joined the firm at which he currently works. His law \npractice has focused on antitrust, intellectual property, \nenvironmental, and other complex commercial litigation matters. He has \nreceived numerous awards and recognitions, including being named a \n``Leading Lawyer'' from 2008 through 2011 by the Leading Lawyers \nNetwork.\n\n  Mr. Lee has an outstanding record of community service, including his \nwork as president of the board of directors of Asian Human Services of \nChicago, his service on the board of directors of the CARPLS legal \nhotline for low-income Cook County residents, and his service on the \nboard of the Asian American Bar Association of Greater Chicago.\n  This is a historic nomination for John Lee. Upon confirmation, he \nwill be the first Korean American ever to serve as a Federal article \nIII judge in Illinois and only the second to serve in that capacity in \nour entire Nation's history.\n  Let me say a word about Jay Tharp. Again, I am disappointed that I \ncouldn't persuade the Republican leadership to include him today, but I \nhave their assurance that he will be called during this work period.\n  Jay Tharp has been nominated to fill the Chicago district court \njudgeship that opened as a result of the senior status of Judge Blanche \nManning. Mr. Tharp is currently a partner in the Chicago office of \nMayer Brown, where he is the coleader of the firm's securities \nlitigation and enforcement practice.\n  He was born into a military family as the son of a lieutenant colonel \nin the Marine Corps. He attended Duke University on an ROTC \nscholarship, received his undergraduate degree summa cum laude, and was \ncommissioned as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps. Jay Tharp \nserved in Active Duty in the Marines for 6 years, achieving the rank of \ncaptain and earning the Navy Achievement Medal and the Navy \nDistinguished Midshipman Award.\n  After his military service, Mr. Tharp attended Northwestern \nUniversity Law School, graduating magna cum laude, and served on the \nNorthwestern University Law Review.\n  Upon graduation, he served as a judicial clerk for Judge Joel Flaum \non the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals and then worked as an assistant \nU.S. attorney for 6 years in Chicago.\n  After his tenure as a Federal prosecutor, he joined Mayer Brown, \nwhere his practice specializes in complex commercial litigation and \ncriminal investigations. He has received numerous recognitions.\n  Mr. Tharp has served as an adjunct professor of trial advocacy at \nNorthwestern University Law School, and he also serves as a member of \nthe Law Fund Board at Northwestern, which oversees fundraising efforts \nby law school alumni.\n  These are two extraordinarily good nominees who went through the \nbipartisan process together, were approved by Senator Kirk and approved \nby me, went through their investigative period in the White House \ntogether, came to the committee together, were reported out together, \ncame to the calendar together but were separated out. That is unfair.\n  I hope by the end of this work period Mr. Tharp will join John Lee on \nthe Federal bench. They are two exceptionally good nominees. On behalf \nof Senator Kirk, I will do everything to make sure this happens in the \ndays ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of a friend \nof mine who is going to be voted on by the Senate shortly to be a U.S. \ndistrict court judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas. But before I \ndo, I need to offer a few comments on what the Senator from Iowa and \nthe Senator from Illinois said a few moments ago that I agree with.\n  It is taking too long to get these nominees to this point in the \nprocess. There are too many games that are being played. From my stand, \nboth sides are at fault. I would hope my colleagues would stop playing \ngames and stop even the blame game, but let's get to work and let's \nhelp clear up the backlog in the Federal judiciary.\n  Right now, it is underresourced. We do have a judicial emergency in \nthis particular district I am about to talk about. As they say, justice \ndelayed is justice denied. We need these judges on the bench, and I \nwould hope the partisanship would stop.\n  In Arkansas we are very fortunate to have very strong Federal judges. \nWe have a history of that. Part of the reason we do is because our \njudges are, for the most part, nonpolitical. Sure, they come from \nvarious backgrounds, but there is a consensus on these judges that they \nare going to be good judges, and that is the tradition we have in our \nState.\n  We have a total of eight district court judges in our State, and Kris \nBaker fits perfectly in that line. She has a true record of \ndistinguished service in the legal community. She is well known and \nwell respected, and she will be a great U.S. district court judge for \nthe Eastern District of Arkansas.\n  The court right now, nationwide, is about 20 percent understaffed. \nThat is why it is great to have someone who has an ABA ``well-\nqualified'' recommendation to go along with her nomination.\n  She came out of the Judiciary Committee on a very large bipartisan \nvote. The reason is she has been with a midsized law firm in Little \nRock since 2000, she regularly has accepted prisoner and other \nappointment cases from the Federal courts, she has played a leadership \nrole not just in the legal community but in other organizations in the \nlarger community, and she is going to be a fantastic addition to the \nFederal bench, not just for Arkansas but nationwide.\n  Whenever I look at these nominees, I ask myself three questions: \nFirst, can they be fair and impartial? I think for Kris, absolutely the \nanswer is yes.\n  Second, do they bring to the bench credentials that represent the \nbest and the brightest in the legal community? In her case, the answer \nis yes.\n  Third--this is especially important for trial court judges--do they \nhave the proper judicial temperament? For Kris Baker, the answer to all \nthree of these questions is a resounding yes.\n  So I would ask my colleagues to give her a favorable voice vote, as I \nunderstand it, in a few moments. But that tells us how noncontroversial \nshe is and what a great credit she has been to the legal community and \nhow excited we are to have her as a member of the Federal judiciary.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong support of \nJudge Jacqueline Nguyen's nomination. She was unanimously approved by \nthe Judiciary Committee. She is an outstanding jurist with a 10-year \ntrack record of success as a trial judge in my State.\n  I recommended Judge Nguyen to President Obama to the district court \nin 2009 after my bipartisan judicial selection committee gave her its \nhighest recommendation. The Senate confirmed her then unanimously 97 to \n0 in 2009. I have no doubt she will be an outstanding circuit court \njudge, and I hope my colleagues will support her nomination.\n  Judge Nguyen earned her bachelor's degree from Occidental College and \nher law degree from the UCLA School of Law.\n  After law school, she practiced commercial law for 4 years with the \nlaw firm of Musick, Peeler & Garrett. She then moved into public \nservice, becoming an assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles. During her \n7 years there, she prosecuted a broad array of crimes, including \nviolent crimes, narcotics trafficking, organized crime, gun cases, and \nall kinds of fraud.\n  In 2000 she received a special commendation from FBI Director Louis \nFreeh for obtaining the first conviction ever in the United States \nagainst a defendant for providing material support to a designated \nterrorist organization.\n  The Justice Department recognized her with numerous other awards and \ncommendations for superior performance, and she was promoted to Deputy \nChief of the General Crimes Section.\n\n[[Page S2912]]\n\n  In 2002 Governor Gray Davis appointed Judge Nguyen to the Los Angeles \nsuperior court, where she established a track record of success as a \ndistinguished jurist.\n  In 2009 President Obama nominated her to the district court on my \nrecommendation, and she was confirmed unanimously.\n  Over nearly 10 years, as a State and Federal judge, Judge Nguyen has \npresided over thousands of cases, including 75 jury trials and 12 bench \ntrials. She prizes fairness and integrity, and treats all parties \nfairly and with respect.\n  Those who know Judge Nguyen--including two former U.S. attorneys \nappointed by President George W. Bush--have praised Judge Nguyen for \nher first-rate legal mind and judicial temperament.\n  Debra Yang, who led the U.S. Attorney's Office from 2002 to 2006, \nafter being appointed by President George W. Bush, submitted a letter \nto the Judiciary Committee in support of Judge Nguyen's nomination.\n  Yang says that she ``would make an excellent Federal . . . court \njudge.'' She also reports that her ``reputation among . . . colleagues \nis tremendous.''\n  Thomas O'Brien, who was appointed U.S. attorney by President Bush in \n2007, has also submitted a letter endorsing Judge Nguyen's nomination. \nO'Brien says Judge Nguyen ``handled complex and controversial cases \nwith technical finesse and grace'' and that Judge Nguyen is a ``highly \nqualified nominee who is intelligent, skilled, and exercises sound \njudgment.''\n  But she also has an inspiring life story. She was born in South \nVietnam in the midst of the Vietnam war. She came to America at the age \nof 10. Her family lived in a tent in a San Diego refugee camp for 3 \nmonths before moving to Los Angeles, where her parents worked two or \nthree jobs at a time.\n  Judge Nguyen and her five siblings helped their parents after school \nand on weekends. They helped to clean dental offices and to peel and \ncut apples. They helped run a small doughnut shop, which their parents \nscrimped and saved to open.\n\n  Judge Nguyen worked her way up--through school, as a lawyer and \nprosecutor, and as a trial judge. If she is confirmed today, she will \nbe the first Asian-American female Federal appeals court judge, and I \nam proud to express my very strong support for her nomination.\n  I would like to conclude by expressing my view that it is absolutely \ncritical that cooperation on judicial nominations continue.\n  Nearly 10 percent of judicial positions are currently vacant, Mr. \nPresident, as you well know--twice as many as when President Bush left \noffice. This high vacancy rate is today being felt more than anywhere \nelse by States in the Ninth Circuit. California and Arizona are home to \nsome of the busiest Federal trial courts in the Nation. This means \nbusinesses, individuals, and prosecutors already are struggling with \nseverely overburdened Federal courts.\n  The Ninth Circuit is also the busiest Federal appellate court in the \ncountry. It has over 1,400 appeals pending per three-judge panel--the \nmost of any circuit by a wide margin, and over twice the average of the \nother circuits.\n  The Judicial Conference of the United States has declared each Ninth \nCircuit vacancy a judicial emergency.\n  Judge Nguyen's confirmation today will help ease the burden, but it \nwill not do enough. Paul Watford is another outstanding Ninth Circuit \nnominee from California. He was approved by the Judiciary Committee 3 \nmonths ago. Based on the calendar, he should be the next circuit court \nnominee to receive a confirmation vote in this body.\n  He has sterling qualifications. He has worked as a Federal prosecutor \nand an appellate attorney at a prestigious law firm. He clerked for \nChief Judge Alex Kozinski and for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. He is a \nmoderate nominee, well schooled in the law. He has support on both \nsides of the aisle, including from two former presidents of the Los \nAngeles chapter of the Federalist Society.\n  So I hope the Senate will consider Mr. Watford's nomination very \nsoon. It is a judicial emergency.\n  So, once again, I thank the leaders on both sides for agreeing to \nbring Judge Nguyen's nomination to the floor. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this nomination. I hope we will continue to confirm highly \nqualified nominees to our Federal courts, which is especially important \nto the Ninth Circuit.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to express my strong support for \nCalifornia District Court Judge Jacqueline Nguyen, who has been \nnominated for a seat on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. When \nconfirmed, Judge Nguyen will make history as the first Asian-American \nwoman to serve on the Federal courts of appeals.\n  Judge Nguyen has had a distinguished career. She is a former Federal \nprosecutor who secured the first-ever conviction of a defendant for \nproviding material support to a designated foreign terrorist group. She \nserved as a California Superior Court judge from 2002 until 2009, when \nshe was nominated for a seat on the U.S. District Court for the Central \nDistrict of California. She was confirmed by a vote of 97 to 0.\n  I congratulate Judge Nguyen and her family on this important and \nhistoric day and urge my colleagues to vote to confirm this well-\nqualified nominee to the Ninth Circuit.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the first \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, earlier today, Senator Durbin and \nthe Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and \nHuman Rights held a hearing in Cleveland to examine efforts that could \nhinder the ability of Ohioans to exercise one of their fundamental \nconstitutional rights, the right to vote. These efforts, in the guise \nof preventing fraud, are part of a cynical effort to impede access to \nthe ballot. Specifically, H.B. 194 in Ohio repeals a number of \ncommonsense measures that assist people with voting.\n  For 8 years I served as secretary of state of Ohio, charged with \nadministering elections, so I understand what goes into ensuring the \nfundamental right to vote. Inherent in that responsibility is ensuring \nthat voting is accessible, free of intimidation and roadblocks.\n  As a State, over a period of decades, Ohio legislators undertook a \nbipartisan--and I underscore that word ``bipartisan''--effort to help \nOhioans get access to the polls. When I was secretary of state, we had \nsignificant input and assistance from Republicans as we made voting \nlaws work for huge numbers of people. We understood Ohioans had many \npriorities pulling them in many directions so we ought to make \nregistration accessible. People could register using utility bills. The \nelectric company included registration forms in utility bills. \nMcDonald's, at my request, printed 1 million tray liners so people \ncould actually fill them out to register to vote. At the Bureau of \nMotor Vehicles, people could register to vote. This was bipartisan. The \nlegislature, when acting, would expand this right to vote, make sure \nthis right to vote was protected. It was generally bipartisan.\n  Today, rather than protecting the right to vote, we are seeing brazen \nattempts to undermine it. We are told this bill and laws similar to it \nwill reduce costs and reduce the risk of voter fraud. The overwhelming \nevidence, however, indicates that voter fraud is virtually nonexistent \nand these new laws will make it harder and more costly for hundreds of \nthousands of Ohioans to exercise the right to vote and more costly for \nthe election system, meaning taxpayer--county boards of elections and \nall that.\n  Voters are simply not going to awaken one morning in Cleveland and \nvote and then drive to Elyria and then vote and then drive to Norwalk \nand then vote, then drive to Adena and then vote and then drive to \nMansfield and then vote. People are not going to defraud the system \nthat way. Why? No. 1, they are going to get caught, probably; and \nsecond, they are going to go to jail--all to take the risk of giving \nBarack Obama or Mitt Romney five more votes in a State of 11 million \npeople. That is not going to happen.\n  Yet the people who are attacking our voting rights are claiming \nindividuals are going to do things such as that to defraud--college \nstudents voting in college and then voting back in their hometown. \nPeople are not going to do that because the disincentives are too \nstrong, the penalties are too harsh. There is simply no reason, so one \ncan vote one extra time, that someone would possibly do that.\n  Let me tell a little bit about this new law. The new law--and what is \ndisappointing to me--this new law repeals what was a bipartisan effort \nin 2006. In 2006, in response to some election problems of 2004 in the \nPresidential race, where people stood in long lines to vote, and there \nwere other problems--in 2006, the Republican House and the Republican \nSenate in Columbus and the Republican Governor--with support from \nDemocrats, so it was clearly bipartisan--passed voter reforms to set up \nearly voting, to set up 1 week where voting and voter registration and \nearly voting overlapped so people could actually register and vote \nduring that week in early October. We did other things that made \nregistration and voting more accessible.\n  But in spite of that, in spite of the consensus in Ohio about voting, \nnow there is an effort to undercut that consensus. First, the law \nsignificantly reduces the early voting window. It takes away Saturday, \nSunday, and Monday voting before the election, when over 100,000 people \nvoted in Ohio that year, in 2008. This reduction in early voting was \nmade despite the fact that evidence overwhelmingly indicates that \nlimiting early voting will actually cost the taxpayers, boards of \nelections, money. Make no mistake, cutting Sunday voting was intended \nto suppress voting.\n  On the Sunday before election, Ohioans, who work long hours during \nthe week, often go to the polls after church, fulfilling their civic \nand spiritual obligations on the same day. By ending early voting, the \nlines outside polling stations on election day will only get longer. \nThe costs will only increase. This increases frustration and limits \nvoting.\n  Another burden posed by H.R. 194 is that it bars poll workers from \nperforming one of their most basic functions, helping voters find their \nright precinct. This law no longer requires that poll workers assist a \nconfused, elderly, disabled or young voter in getting to their correct \nprecinct. Here is how it works. We have tried to save money. As more \npeople voted earlier, relieving some of the pressure on election day, \nthe boards of elections have combined voting precincts. Instead, we \nwill have fewer precincts in the same county and have to hire fewer \npoll workers. What that also means is sometimes they combine these \nprecincts in these voting stations into one building so people might \nwalk into a polling station and go to the wrong table. Under the law \nnow, the poll worker is not required to help that person and say: No, \nyou can't vote here, but you can vote across in the room next door, at \nthis church or at this school. Someone today might walk in and the poll \nworker will simply say you are not eligible to vote in this precinct \nand they will walk home and not vote. This law discourages in many \nways. Because these poll workers are people who live in the \nneighborhoods it discourages neighbors helping neighbors.\n  This is a solution in search of a problem. It is not something we \nneed to do. There was consensus in Ohio that things needed to change \nafter 2004. The laws enacted in 2006 led to shorter lines, more \nclarity, and less frustration for voters. While none of the changes I \nmention today make it impossible to vote, they build burdens to voting, \nburdens that have no good reason. That will mean fewer minority voters, \nfewer young voters, fewer elderly voters, fewer disabled voters. That \nmay be what some politicians in this town want, but it is not what the \npeople of Ohio want. Ohio deserves better when it comes to protecting \nour most fundamental constitutional rights.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S2914]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/07/senate-section/article/S2914-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio.

Madam President, today I rise to honor and commemorate the \n65th anniversary of the Las Vegas News Bureau. Since its inception in \n1947, the News Bureau has captured photos and videos of the colorful \nhistory of Las Vegas. Community leaders started the News Bureau as a \nway to generate publicity for Las Vegas through the use of photography \nand film, and in doing so, they preserved the history of the city.\n  The News Bureau has been at the forefront of documenting and \npublicizing Las Vegas as the world's leading destination for decades. \nOver the years, they have captured memorable moments of some of Vegas's \nmost famous entertainers, illustrated the growth of the iconic skyline, \nand archived the scenic imagery of the surrounding Las Vegas landscape.\n  Amidst their archives, the News Bureau captured unforgettable moments \nof show biz legends and Las Vegas regulars, like Elvis, Liberace, Wayne \nNewton, and Frank Sinatra, among others. The archive also houses \nhistorical moments such as President Kennedy's trip to visit the troops \nat the Nevada Test Site, where the atomic bomb was detonated during the \n1950s and 1960s. And alongside the many photographs of celebrities and \nfamiliar faces are millions of photos documenting the various parades, \nevents, and tourists that helped make Las Vegas the thriving \ndestination that it remains today.\n  The Las Vegas News Bureau plays a unique role in marketing southern \nNevada as a one-of-a-kind destination. Their iconic images of Las Vegas \nprovide a competitive advantage that helps distinguish Las Vegas from \nother destinations, while also acting as an invaluable resource to \njournalists and historians alike. The unforgettable pictures of the \nneon lights of historic Fremont Street and glamorous images of Las \nVegas show biz are more than just pieces of Las Vegas history: They \nrepresent what made Las Vegas the universally renowned city that it is \ntoday.\n  For the past 65 years, the News Bureau has chronicled the rise of Las \nVegas into the Entertainment Capital of the World. I am proud to \nrecognize their accomplishments before the Senate today, and I know \nthat they will continue to tell the story of Las Vegas for years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/07/senate-section/article/S2914-3", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FOOD EMERGENCY\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, today I wish to submit for the Record my \nremarks and a speech by Taiwan's top diplomat in Washington, Jason C. \nYuan, of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office, who \nannounced on April 25, 2012, the donation by his government of 1,150 \nmetric tons of rice to Kenya through Feed the Children, a well-known \nand respected charity based in my home State of Oklahoma.\n  The food emergency in the Horn of Africa is a stark humanitarian \ncrisis and Kenya simply has not received enough rain to feed its \npeople. Record-high food prices, internal conflicts, and insecurity in \nthe region have exacerbated the situation. With malnutrition and \ndisease on the rise, dane Kenyan families are required to travel long \ndistances in search of food. It is evident that outside help must be \nprovided.\n  The people of Taiwan are providing that help. Its generous gift will \nhave an immediate impact on relieving the hardships brought on by this \nfirst drought of the 21st century.\n  Ronald Reagan once said that ``a hungry child knows no politics,'' \nmeaning that the American people are always willing to open up their \nhearts and the blessings of their bounty to the less fortunate around \nthe world. The people of Taiwan are doing the same thing today through \nthis generous donation.\n  Some may say that this gracious donation of rice is a mere drop in \nthe bucket compared to the overall need in Africa. Yet one must \nremember that every mighty wave starts with a tiny ripple.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record remarks from \nAmbassador Jason C. Yuan.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Ambassador Jason C. Yuan's Remarks at the Twin Oaks Estate\n\n\n                             Apri1 25, 2012\n\n       Mr. Steve Whetstone, Congressman Dan Burton, Ms. Barbara \n     Schrage of AIT/W, Mr. Mark Powers and Ms. Kiersten Powers of \n     Senator James Inhofe's Office, ladies and gentlemen, good \n     morning!\n       On behalf of my government, I am pleased to announce that \n     the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) of the Republic of \n     China (Taiwan), in cooperation with the Red Cross of the \n     Republic of China and Feed the Children have decided to form \n     an alliance to donate 1,150 metric tons of rice to Kenya, a \n     country currently suffering a famine. This partnership will \n     allow the rice donation from Taiwan to be distributed with \n     the help of FTC in refugee camps, to ongoing relief efforts \n     in Turkana and to primary schools in Mombasa, Kenya.\n       Feed the Children is one of the largest international \n     charities, with its headquarters in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, \n     and based on Christian values. It has been dedicated to \n     providing hope and resources for those without life's \n     essentials throughout the United States and the world for \n     decades.\n       Taiwan and FTC have associated in the past and successfully \n     cooperated in 2005 to deliver 10,000 metric tons of rice to \n     the tsunami ravaged areas in Indonesia. In 2006 Taiwan \n     donated 52 containers of new clothing to FTC worth \n     approximately US $17.6 million, which were later distributed \n     to more than 16,000 children, orphans, elderly, abandoned and \n     others in need in 11 countries (Honduras, Nicaragua, \n     Guatemala, El Salvador, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, \n     Azerbaijan, Russia, Armenia, and Ukraine). In 2007, Taiwan \n     donated 5,000 metric tons of rice to Kenya and 5,000 metric \n     tons of rice to Malawi through FTC, to help people in those \n     two countries suffering from famine. In 2011, Taiwan donated \n     100 metric tons of rice to restart the Mombasa Kenya School \n     Feeding Program, benefiting 27,000 children for 2 school \n     terms.\n       Enhancing Taiwan's contributions to international \n     development is one of the three lines of defense that \n     President Ma Ying-jeou has outlined for the ROC's national \n     security. As a maturing democracy and thriving economy, \n     Taiwan has been shouldering our own responsibilities in the \n     world. Humanitarian work has become an especially important \n     platform for Taiwan's contributions to the international \n     community. Taiwan's democracy and economic prosperity have \n     combined to give rise to a vibrant society of numerous non-\n     profit organizations. In almost every major disaster relief \n     program that has occurred in the world recently, Taiwan has \n     been an important contributor, whether this meant providing \n     financial aid to help rebuild homes in Sichuan, or giving \n     life-sustaining medical aid to Haitian children. Taiwan was \n     also one of the first to arrive with emergency relief \n     supplies and rescue teams when Japan was struck by the triple \n     disaster of an earthquake, tsunami and nuclear incident. In \n     fact, Taiwan ended up donating more than US $200 million to \n     the Japanese people.\n       Last week, President Ma just wrapped up a 12-day official \n     visit to Burkina Faso, Gambia and Swaziland, our three allies \n     in Africa. Pursuing a policy of viable diplomacy that \n     requires that all foreign assistance must be justified, \n     legitimate and efficient, President Ma announced a donation \n     of US $2.1 million worth of support to Mali refugee \n     assistance efforts in Burkina Faso, and US $3 million to \n     emergency food programs in Gambia. The project ``A Lamp \n     Lighting up Africa'' also helps the students of our West \n     African allies study at night with LED lamps.\n       The Republic of China used to be a country that received \n     economic assistance from other countries, particularly the \n     United States. Now that we are better off, the least we can \n     do is to help other people in need. So we look forward to \n     future cooperation with Feed the Children or other NGOs in \n     the United States for the good cause. Thank you!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/07/senate-section/article/S2914-4", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2914-S2915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IN ECUADOR\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Not only is the media targeted and silenced, the \nentire population is denied access to accurate reporting.\n  The Senate was in recess on May 3, but I would like to call other \nSenators'\n\n[[Page S2915]]\n\nattention to troubling events that currently pose one of the gravest \nthreats to freedom of expression in this hemisphere. I am speaking \nabout the actions of Ecuador's President Rafael Correa and officials in \nhis government to silence independent broadcasters and publishers and \nwatchdog organizations, undermining the fundamental right of free \nexpression in ways that resemble what we have come to expect in Cuba, \nNicaragua, and Venezuela.\n  There is no institution more fundamental to democracy than a free and \nindependent press. A free press helps protect the rule of law, to \nensure that no person or group is above the rules and procedures that \ngovern a democratic society. A free press helps ensure transparency to \nprod governments to be honest and accountable to their citizens.\n  Unfortunately, recent events in Ecuador suggest a deliberate shift \naway from these democratic traditions, and this could pose grave \nconsequences for democracy in Ecuador.\n  Although wavering at times, Ecuador has a history of democratic \ngovernment of which its citizens can be proud. Ecuador's first \nConstitution, written in 1830, stipulated that ``every citizen can \nexpress their thoughts and publish them freely through the press.'' \nEcuador's 1998 Constitution guarantees the right of journalists and \nsocial communicators to ``seek, receive, learn, and disseminate'' \nevents of general interest, with the goal of ``preserving the values of \nthe community.'' Even Ecuador's latest constitution, ratified just four \nyears ago, protects each citizen's right ``to voice one's opinion and \nexpress one's thinking freely and in all of its forms and \nmanifestations.'' However, it appears that these protections--a vital \npart of Ecuador's history of democratically elected, representative \ngovernment--now only apply at the discretion of President Correa.\n  During President Correa's term in office, the number of state-owned \nmedia organizations has exploded--growing from just one government-run \nnews outlet to a media conglomerate that today is made up of more than \na dozen outlets. He has pursued criminal charges against columnists and \nnewspaper owners, including legal actions aimed at El Universo, one of \nEcuador's most respected newspapers. In the El Universo case, President \nCorrea won a $42 million award, and several journalists were sentenced \nto 3 years in prison following a hearing before a temporary--and \nrecently appointed--magistrate. Although President Correa later \npardoned the journalists, an Ecuadoran court rejected his pardon, and \ntheir fates remain unresolved. The fear of being charged and dragged \nthrough the expensive legal system also silences many other journalists \nor compels them to temper criticism of the government.\n  President Correa and his government are not only targeting \njournalists. Some 200 activists, many of them indigenous people \nprotesting environmentally destructive mining projects, have been \ncriminally charged and detained. The pattern of arresting or \nthreatening to arrest social activists has suppressed the free flow of \ninformation in Ecuador, silencing dissenting voices either by legal \naction or self-censorship.\n  Perhaps most insidious to the principles of democracy, President \nCorrea's government has ushered in new reforms that could make illegal \nalmost all reporting about electoral campaigns. All censorship is \nbruising to a democracy, but electoral censorship is a fatal blow. With \nPresidential elections occurring in Ecuador in the next year, there is \ngrowing concern that President Correa's actions represent an attempt to \ninfluence the democratic process to his own political and personal \nbenefit.\n  Dr. Catalina Botero, the special rapporteur for freedom of expression \nat the Organization of American States, OAS, has rightly criticized \nPresident Correa's crusade against the press. In response, President \nCorrea has expanded his campaign of censorship beyond Ecuador's borders \nand targeted Dr. Botero's office, proposing to the OAS earlier this \nyear a plan that would have restricted the ability of Dr. Botero's \noffice to issue independent reports and cutting off some of its \nfunding. Although the plan was rejected by the member states of the \nOAS, President Correa's intent remains clear. No longer content to \nsilence his political opponents in Ecuador, he is now targeting his \ncritics elsewhere.\n  President Correa has tried to cloak his actions in populist \nvocabulary, declaring that his censorship is motivated by a desire to \nfree the public from the corrupt interests of the business \norganizations that often ran newspapers before the establishment of a \nlaw forbidding anyone with a significant stake in a media company from \nowning other businesses. Challenging viewpoints expressed in the media \nof course is legitimate, common, and healthy in any society, but \npreventing those views from being heard is not.\n  Mr. President, we should denounce attacks on the press in Ecuador and \nelsewhere in this hemisphere. We should strongly support Dr. Botero and \nher office. Protecting freedom of expression, a fundamental right \nenshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the American \nDeclaration of the Rights and Duties of Man is everyone's concern and \nresponsibility. In doing so, we stand with the people of Ecuador and \ntheir right to be heard and for the future of their democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/07/senate-section/article/S2915-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2915-S2916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WAR IN BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, as we consider the many important issues \ncurrently before us, I believe it is worthwhile for us also to pause \nand recall past events that remain relevant to our work today.\n  As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a long-time \nmember and Co-Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I would like to \nremind my colleagues that it was approximately 20 years ago that the \nconflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina began. While seeking to find a peaceful \npath out of the Yugoslavia which was collapsing around it, Bosnia and \nits people instead became chief victims of the clearly senseless \nviolence associated with that collapse.\n  The ethnic cleansing of villages and the shelling of Sarajevo which \nwe first saw in April 1992 were horrific, and little did we know how \nmuch worse things would get in subsequent months and years. It was in \nJuly and August of 1992 that we first saw the shocking pictures of the \ndetainees in Omarska and other camps run by nationalist, militant \nSerbs, in northeastern Bosnia. The next year, we saw Croat militants \ndestroy the famous bridge in Mostar for which the city got its name. In \n1995, we saw Srebrenica before and after the genocide in which 8,000 \npeople, mostly men and boys, perished.\n  While the United States and its friends and allies brought the \nconflict in Bosnia to an end with the Dayton Agreement in 1995, the \naction we took came too late for those who were ethnically cleansed and \ndisplaced, those who were tortured or raped, and those who were injured \nor killed. It is never too late, however, to provide justice. I am glad \nthat people like Slobodan Milosevic, Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic \nand all others indicted for war crimes, crimes against humanity and \ngenocide were apprehended and transferred to the International Criminal \nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague. I am also glad that \nthe United States and some other countries persevered to make this \nhappen despite the resistance to cooperation and the protection \nafforded these individuals. I want to thank my colleagues who joined me \nin supporting justice in Bosnia as a matter of U.S. policy.\n  I think it is important not only to remember the victims and culprits \nof the conflict in Bosnia but also to remember the heroes. There were \nthose who opposed extreme nationalism and aggression against neighbors. \nI particularly want to note the small group of human rights advocates \nand democratic forces in Serbia who opposed what Milosevic was doing \nallegedly in their name, even when he appeared to be getting away with \nit. I have met some of these courageous individuals over the years, \nincluding last July when I visited Belgrade, and they are truly \ninspiring people.\n  Today, Bosnia has recovered from the more than 3 years of brutal, \ndestructive conflict that started 2 decades ago, and the country \naspires to join both NATO and the European Union. I believe it is \nimportant that we support the people of Bosnia and their desires for \nintegration by holding firm against the lingering forces of ethnic \nexclusivity, which remain particularly\n\n[[Page S2916]]\n\nstrong in the entity of Republika Srpska created by the Dayton \nAgreement, and at the same time encourage practical reforms so that \nBosnia can function more effectively as a European partner. When one \ntalks to the young people that represent Bosnia's future, as several of \nus have, it is clear they do not want to forget the past but they \ncertainly do not want to repeat it. They want a future in Europe, and \ntheir political leaders need to give them that future. I hope the \nUnited States, which has invested so much in Bosnia thus far, will be \nthere as necessary to help.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/07/senate-section/article/S2916-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING SERVICES\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I have introduced the Diagnostic Imaging \nServices Access Protection Act of 2012, joined by my colleague from \nLouisiana, Senator David Vitter. Our goal is to preserve Medicare \nbeneficiaries' access to life-saving advanced diagnostic imaging \nservices, such as magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, computed tomography, \nCT, and ultrasound.\n  Let me explain why this legislation is necessary. Medicare \nreimbursement for radiology services is based on two components: \ntechnical and professional. The technical component comprises the cost \nof equipment, nonphysician personnel, and medical supplies associated \nwith the imaging process. The professional component is calculated by \nfactoring in the radiologist's time, effort, and skill involved in \ninterpreting images, rendering patient diagnoses, and reporting the \nfindings in the patient's medical record. In recent years, the Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services sought to control imaging growth by \ncutting reimbursement for the technical component--reducing payment for \nmultiple imaging services administered by the same physician to the \nsame patient during a single office visit. This policy is referred to \nas the multiple procedure payment reduction, or MPPR. It is designed to \ntake into account the efficiencies achieved by doing same-day \nprocedures on the same patient, and for the technical component of \nradiology, it makes sense.\n  However this year, CMS decided to apply the MPPR to the professional \ncomponent as well. The 2012 fee schedule rule, which took effect on \nJanuary 1, cut the professional component reimbursement for \nradiologists by 25 percent for additional images. This payment \nreduction ignores the realities of medical practice. It is not \nsupported by sound data, nor was it developed with meaningful physician \ninput. Because each imaging study produces its own set of images that \nrequire individual interpretation, radiologists are ethically and \nprofessionally obligated to expend the same amount of time and effort \ninterpreting each one, regardless of the number of images, the section \nof the body being examined, or the date of service.\n  Further, because radiologists are referral-based physicians who \nrarely order the studies they interpret, MPPR is an ineffective tool to \nreduce inappropriate utilization. Beneficiaries receiving multiple \nimaging studies often represent the sickest and most complex cases. \nThey may have advanced cancer or be recovering from a stroke, serious \ncar accidents, multiple gunshot wounds, or other forms of deadly \ntrauma.\n  Not only will CMS' flawed policy disproportionately affect the most \nvulnerable patients, it may also create incentives to shift services \naway from the private practice setting, where the physician fee \nschedule applies, to the more expensive hospital outpatient setting.\n  Our legislation will ensure that CMS does not arbitrarily undervalue \nthe role of the radiologist within the health care delivery system. It \nwould cancel the MPPR cut to the professional component of radiology \nservices through the end of 2012 and prevent it from taking effect in \nfuture years, pending more comprehensive study of the matter. \nSpecifically, the Secretary of Health and Human Services would be \nprohibited from taking this action unless the reduction is based on the \ndata, analysis, and conclusions of an independent expert panel convened \nby the Institute of Medicine.\n  A similar bill, HR 3269, has been introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives and it enjoys the strong bipartisan support of more \nthan 240 cosponsors. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan \nand budget-neutral approach to preserving patient access to community-\nbased diagnostic imaging services.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/07/senate-section/article/S2916-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2916-S2917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING DICK CLARK\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, today I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the memory of Dick Clark, one of our country's most beloved \ncultural icons who entertained grateful viewers in America and around \nthe world for more than 60 years. He passed away on April 17, 2012, at \nage 82.\n  Richard Wagstaff Clark was born on November 30, 1929 in Mount Vernon, \nNY. As a child, Dick looked up to his older brother, Bradley, who \nbecame a pilot in the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II and was \nkilled in the Battle of the Bulge. Dick became depressed after his \nbrother's death, and the only thing that lifted his spirits was music.\n  In some ways, Dick Clark was destined to work in the broadcasting \nindustry. As a child, he became interested in radio after his parents \ntook him to a live broadcast of the Jimmy Durante and Garry Moore show. \nEver the affable young man, Dick participated in A.B. Davis High \nSchool's drama club and was elected class president.\n  After graduating from Syracuse University with a degree in business \nadministration, Dick began working on ``Bandstand'' at Philadelphia's \nWFIL Radio. The popularity of this program led WFIL TV to begin \nbroadcasting it as an afternoon television show, which Dick started \nhosting in 1956. The following year, he pitched the show to the \nAmerican Broadcasting Company, and it became nationally broadcast as \n``American Bandstand.''\n  ``American Bandstand'' became a phenomenon, a trendsetting show that \ntouched people around the world across lines of race, culture, and \nethnicity. ``Bandstand 's'' integration of African Americans as \nmusicians and dancers played a role breaking down racial barriers at a \ntime when the civil rights movement was coming to the forefront. Over \nthe next three decades, while the show moved from weekdays to Saturdays \nand from Philadelphia to Los Angeles, Dick Clark introduced American \nfamilies to many artists who later became icons, including the \nSupremes, Michael Jackson, Madonna, and Prince. Aretha Franklin \nrecently noted, ``If you didn't go on `American Bandstand,' you hadn't \nmade it yet.''\n  Over the course of his career, Dick Clark came to be known as one of \nthe most hard-working people in show business. With Dick Clark \nProductions, founded in 1956, Clark produced television shows, made-\nfor-TV movies, award shows, and beauty pageants. Unistar, which he \ncofounded and owned, distributed Clark's radio shows including \n``Countdown America'' and ``Dick Clark's Rock, Roll & Remembers.''\n  In 1972 ``Rockin' Eve'' premiered, and since then generations of \nAmericans have welcomed in the New Year with Dick Clark and watched \nwith him as the ball dropped in New York City--a tradition that \ncontinued for 40 years. Throughout his time as host, Dick Clark only \nmissed one New Year's Eve celebration in 2005 due to a stroke. The \nfollowing year he was once again on the air welcoming the New Year with \nhis beloved wife Kari and showing all of us that with tenacity, \nanything is possible.\n  Throughout his career, Clark left an indelible mark on the landscape \nof American music and television, from his 1974 creation of the \nAmerican Music Awards to his productions of the Academy of Country \nMusic Awards, Golden Globe Awards, Emmy Awards, Live Aid, and Farm Aid. \nFor his successful career and tireless work ethic, Dick Clark was \nhonored with Daytime and Primetime Emmy Awards, Daytime and Primetime \nLifetime Achievement Awards, and inductions into the Radio Hall of \nFame, the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame, the Academy of Television Arts & \nSciences Hall of Fame, and the Philadelphia Walk of Fame.\n  I extend my heartfelt condolences to Dick's wife Kari, his sons \nRichard Augustus II and Duane, his daughter Cindy, and his \ngrandchildren. He will be missed by the millions of people worldwide \nwho were touched by his work.\n\n[[Page S2917]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/07/senate-section/article/S2917-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING DEPUTY ROBERT PARIS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the memory of Deputy Robert ``Bob'' Paris, a dedicated public \nservant in the Stanislaus County Sheriff's Office and a kind and loyal \ncolleague, friend, and family man. On the morning of April 12, 2012, \nDeputy Paris was tragically killed in the line of duty while serving an \neviction notice in north Modesto.\n  A graduate of Tracy High School and the Ray Simon Criminal Justice \nTraining Center in Modesto, Bob Paris joined the Stanislaus Sheriff's \nDepartment as a reserve deputy in May 1996 and became a full-time \nemployee in 1998. During his tenure with the department, he served the \ncommunity as a court bailiff, a patrol deputy, and as a member of the \nsheriff's water enforcement team. He was also the department's first-\naid and CPR instructor at the sheriff's academy.\n  For the past 16 years, Deputy Paris dutifully served the citizens and \ncommunities of Stanislaus County with great pride, integrity, and \nvalor. His devotion to helping others, along with his passion for law \nenforcement, helped him become a respected member of the Stanislaus \nCounty Sheriff's Department.\n  Deputy Paris served Stanislaus County with honor and bravery, and I \nsend my heartfelt sympathies to his family, friends, and colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/07/senate-section/article/S2917-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONOR FLIGHT NORTHERN COLORADO\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado.

Mr. President, on May 22, 2011, the city of Joplin, \nMO, was struck by an EF5 tornado. The path of devastation was an \nincredible 6 miles long and almost 1 mile wide. The destruction was \nbeyond words. Too many were lost, and lives were upended. Homes, \nschools, and businesses were destroyed. Joplin's mayor that terrible \nday was Mike Woolston. Mayor Woolston showed the world that Joplin was \nup to the challenge of not only surviving but rebuilding.\n  Mayor Woolston grew up in Joplin. Mike graduated from Joplin's \nParkwood High School and Missouri Southern State University. After \ngraduation from MSSU, Mike served his country in the U.S. Marine Corps \nat a number of locations at home and abroad. In 1988 Mike returned to \nJoplin and embarked on a career in real estate. For nearly 25 years \nMike has been active in the Joplin community, serving on a number of \ncommunity organizations such as United Way of Southwest Missouri, \nCommunity Blood Center of the Ozarks, American Red Cross, Salvation \nArmy, and Joplin public schools' Bright Futures Program.\n  Mike was elected to the Joplin City Council in 2002. In 2010 his \ncouncil peers elected him mayor. Mike was serving in that position when \nthe most destructive tornado of the last 60 years struck the city of \nJoplin. Mayor Mike Woolston spent countless hours guiding the city \nthrough rescue, recovery, and eventually the beginning of the \nrebuilding process. Mayor Woolston's calm demeanor, positive attitude, \nand recognition of the thousands of others who were involved in every \nstage of post-tornado actions gave the citizens of the Joplin area hope \nfor the future. As the face and voice for the city of Joplin, Mayor \nWoolston gave the Nation and the world a shining example of the spirit \nof cooperation and can-do work ethic which exemplifies Joplin, MO.\n  I hereby recognize and thank Michael R. Woolston for his leadership \nof the city of Joplin in the wake of the May 22, 2011, tornado and for \nhis commitment to the citizens of his community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/07/senate-section/article/S2918-3", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING THE JONES BAR-B-Q DINER\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nowners of one of the oldest African-American-owned restaurants in \nAmerica, the Jones Bar-B-Q Diner in Marianna, AR, which has been \nhonored by the James Beard Foundation Awards.\n  The foundation recognized Jones Bar-B-Q as one of five restaurants \nfrom across the country in the ``America's Classics'' category at the \n2012 annual awards ceremony taking place today at the Lincoln Center in \nNew York City.\n  Foodies will tell you this honor is a big one. Arkansas writer Rex \nNelson calls the Beard award the equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize for \njournalism--certainly high praise for a small operation that began on a \nback porch, but this is no ordinary run-of-the-mill barbecue.\n  This honor is a long time in the making. Jones Bar-B-Q Diner has been \nin operation, in some form, since at least the 1910s. Walter Jones, the \nfounder and first pitmaster, lived in a bare wood dogtrot house and \nfirst served barbecue from the screened-in back porch on Fridays and \nSaturdays. The family recalls that original cooking setup as a ``hole \nin the ground, some iron pipes, a piece of fence wire and two pieces of \ntin.''\n  Eventually, Walter moved from selling the meat on the back porch to a \nsmall place in town called the Hole in the Wall. It was literally a \nwindow in a wall from which he would sell meat from a washtub. The \nmodern incarnation, the Jones Bar-B-Q Diner, opened in 1964.\n  The business today remains true to its smalltown, family roots. \nHubert Jones, Walter's son, is the present day proprietor and his son, \nJames, tends the pits. The pork shoulder is still smoked with a simple \nsetup over the pit. They still serve a very limited menu that centers \naround smoked pork hacked into bits and served on white bread with the \nJones' vinegary sauce.\n  The James Beard Foundation--which is a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) \norganization dedicated to celebrating, preserving, and nurturing \nAmerica's culinary heritage--only awards its ``America Classics'' \ndistinction to restaurants with ``timeless appeal . . . that are \nbeloved for quality food that reflects the character of their \ncommunity.''\n  To qualify for the ``America's Classics'' award, establishments must \nhave been in existence at 10 years and they must be locally owned. The \nhonorees are selected each year by the James Beard Foundation's \nRestaurant Committee, which is comprised of 17 people throughout the \ncountry, many of whom are notable food critics and culinary writers. \nThe foundation is acutely aware of how special Jones Bar-B-Q Diner is \nto Marianna, the State of Arkansas, and southern cuisine.\n  I will leave you with one piece of advice. If you want some of Jones' \nfamous smoke pork, it is best to arrive early. The diner usually opens \naround 7:30 a.m. Monday through Saturday and then closes by early \nafternoons when all the meat runs out. So get there early, bring your \nappetite, and be sure to congratulate the Jones family for being \nrecognized by the James Beard Foundation. Their restaurant is \ndefinitely an integral part of the community and of Arkansas's culture. \nI am proud of Jones family's contribution to the Natural State's \nheritage and commend them for receiving this honor. The Jones Bar-B-Q \nDiner in Marianna truly is an American classic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/07/senate-section/article/S2918-4", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2918-S2919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING THE ALASKA QUARTERLY REVIEW\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President. I wish to recognize one of our \nNation's literary magazines, the Alaska Quarterly Review. This quiet \ngiant in the Alaska arts scene has earned numerous accolades and high \npraise. Today I\n\n[[Page S2919]]\n\nwant to specifically recognize the magazine for reaching its 30-year \nanniversary and for its continued literary excellence.\n  Since the magazine's birth at the Anchorage campus of the University \nof Alaska in 1982, the Alaska Quarterly Review has served as an \ninstrument to give voice to Alaska writers and poets as well as also \npublishing excellent material from non-Alaskan authors. In other words, \nwhile it is firmly rooted in Alaska, it has maintained a national \nperspective, bridging the distance between the literary centers across \nthe country and Alaska. This balanced presentation of views over the \nyears has earned the Review local, regional, national, and even \ninternational recognition.\n  The founding editor of the Review, Mr. Ronald Spatz, envisioned the \nReview as a way to break through stereotypes and present Alaska to the \ngreater literary community as a partner. With the Review under his \ndirection for three decades, he has also continued his focus on \npublishing new and emerging writers. After 30 years of hard work at the \nReview, each issue still contains the same labor of love and excitement \nfrom edition to edition.\n  Advances in technology have turned publishing on its head, but the \nReview has remained both a faithful forum for conventional work and an \noutlet for work that challenges accepted forms and modes of expression. \nIt has established itself as distinctly Alaskan because it is strongly \ninfluenced by the place, the people, and the cultural traditions, \nwithout ever being restricted by its geographical location. The \nmagazine's body of work is eclectic.\n  Through its stories, oral histories, folk tales, and poems, the \nliterary magazine seeks to portray Alaska's rich and diverse Native \ncultures. It pays tribute to the Native language speakers and tradition \nbearers that keep their cultures alive through their stories and \nthrough their words. Over the years Alaskans have learned that one of \nthe best ways to protect the social fabric of Native Alaskans is to \nprotect their culture, thus maintaining their pride in their history \nand their heritage. In this vein, Ronald Spatz has published stories in \nEyak, Haida, Tlingit, Tsimshian, Alutiq, Central Yup'ik, St. Lawrence \nIsland Yup'ik, Inupiaq, and Dena'ina. The Review has done much to \npreserve the culture and history of Alaska and her people.\n  To help commemorate these achievements and reaching the 30-year \nbenchmark, the Review is producing an ambitious photojournalism \ncollection in their spring/summer issue. The collection, called \n``Liberty and Justice (For All): A Global Photo Mosaic,'' pays tribute \nto photojournalists Tim Hetherington and Chris Hondros, who died in \nLibya in 2011. The biannual publication will also feature a special \nsection in the fall/winter edition in the form of 60 poems by 60 \ndifferent poets.\n  Alaska, and America, is far richer because of the Alaska Quarterly \nReview. I commend it and its contributors for its many achievements, as \nwell as the University of Alaska board of regents and the leadership of \nthe University of Alaska Anchorage for its support of the publication. \nIt has taken a tremendous commitment to academic and artistic \nexcellence to continue publication these 30 years. Again, \ncongratulations to the Alaska Quarterly Review for reaching 30 years of \ncontinued literary excellence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/07/senate-section/article/S2919-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING THE CITIZENS' HOSE COMPANY NO. 1\n\n Mr. CARPER.

Since that time the members of this company have \nprotected the property and residents throughout this historic \ncommunity. The company has reached many milestones throughout the last \n125 years--initially fighting fires with a man-drawn hose tender and \nladder cart to now answering fire calls using a 100-foot KME Kovatch \nladder truck which, in 1999, was the first ladder truck the company \npurchased new. Additional milestones included the formation of the \nLadies Auxiliary in 1950, as well as the expansion of the station in \n1985 to accommodate office space and future growth. With over 440 \nmembers today, the Citizens' Hose Company No. 1 maintains the highest \nlevel of excellence. Over the last several years, the Citizens' Hose \nCompany has answered an average of 475 calls per year and are on pace \nto keep that record in 2012.\n  The Citizens' Hose Company serves as a great neighbor to all in the \nSmyrna area. The company participates in numerous community activities \nthroughout the year and has a renowned company band. Since 1947, the \nCitizens' Hose Company Band has provided music for the marching unit of \nthe company during parades and other community gatherings. An annual \nparticipant in the Delaware Volunteer Firefighter's Association Parade, \nthe Citizens' Hose Company has won the prestigious Governor's Cup Award \na record 31 times. The company band has had the honor of playing music \nthroughout Delaware as well as in Dublin, Ireland, New York City, and \neven represented the First State at the inaugural parades of both \nPresident Bill Clinton and President Barack Obama in Washington, DC.\n  Delaware's firefighters are dedicated and caring professionals who \nwillingly put themselves at risk--day and night, in all kinds of \nweather.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 15th \nanniversary of NumbersUSA, a national grassroots organization that \nadvocates for immigration policies that seek to serve the national \ninterest.\n  NumbersUSA was formed in 1997 by Roy Beck, a former journalist who \nhas been recognized by the Houston Chronicle as ``one of the five \nleading thinkers in the national immigration debate.'' Under his \nleadership, NumbersUSA has grown from a mostly Internet-based \norganization of about 2,000 grassroots members to nearly 1.3 million \nactivists, giving a voice to American citizens on the important issue \nof immigration and securing our border.\n  Those who were in Congress during the 2006 and 2007 debates on \ncomprehensive immigration reform will confirm just how effective \nNumbersUSA is. NumbersUSA was an active leader in an outgunned \ncoalition that stood up to virtually all the elites in Washington. The \nbig lobbies pulled out all the stops, spent millions of dollars, and \nbore down hard in their push for mass amnesty. But Goliath fell to the \ngrassroots David, whose faxes, e-mails, rallies, visits to our offices, \nand phone calls registered the clear message that the American people \nwould not accept Washington rewarding lawbreaking. The overwhelming \ngrassroots response actuated by the NumbersUSA coalition was most \nevident when citizens called Capitol Hill in such volume that it shut \ndown the Senate's telephone system.\n  NumbersUSA approaches the important and sensitive issue of \nimmigration by emphasizing the number of immigrants that are lawfully \nadmitted to the United States. Their approach is captured in a \nstatement prominently placed on their website: ``To talk about changing \nimmigration numbers is to say nothing against the individual immigrants \nin this country. Rather, it is about deciding how many foreign citizens \nliving in their own countries right\n\n[[Page S2920]]\n\nnow should be allowed to immigrate in the future'' and ``about \nprotecting and enhancing the United States' unique experiment in \ndemocracy for all Americans, including recent immigrants, regardless of \ntheir particular ethnicity.''\n  I commend NumbersUSA for speaking out effectively on these important \nissues for America. Their voice has added a valuable perspective to the \ndiscussion. I congratulate them on a successful first 15 years and wish \nthem even greater success over its next 15 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/07/senate-section/article/S2920-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2920]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of January 5, 2011, the Secretary of \nthe Senate, on April 27, 2012, during the adjournment of the Senate, \nreceived a message from the House of Representatives announcing that \nthe House has agreed to the following concurrent resolution, without \namendment:\n\n       S.

A bill to promote the use of clean cookstoves and fuels to \nsave lives, improve livelihoods, empower women, and combat harmful \npollution by creating a thriving global market for clean and efficient \nhousehold cooking solutions; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The Clean \nCookstoves Support Act, which addresses a serious global environmental \nand public health issue. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Durbin.\n  Nearly half the world's population cooks food over open fires or \ninefficient, polluting, and unsafe cookstoves, using firewood, dung, or \ncoal as fuel. Smoke from these traditional cookstoves and open fires is \nassociated with a number of chronic and acute diseases, with women and \nyoung children affected disproportionately. The World Health \nOrganization estimates cookstove smoke to be one of the top five \nthreats to public health in poor, developing countries. This smoke may \naccount for nearly two million deaths annually in the developing world, \nwhich is more than the deaths from malaria, tuberculosis, or HIV.\n  Traditional cookstoves also create serious environmental impacts. The \namount of biomass cooking fuel required each year can reach up to two \ntons per family, and local environmental degradation can result where \ndemand for fuel outstrips the natural regrowth of resources. Recent \nstudies show that emissions of black carbon, or common soot, from \nbiomass cookstoves significantly contribute to climate change, second \nonly to carbon dioxide in impact.\n  These stoves should be replaced with modern alternatives to reverse \nthese alarming health and environmental trends. Fortunately, modern \nstoves, designed to burn fuel efficiently, can eliminate up to 90 \npercent of the black carbon produced during cooking and home heating. \nThis would be relatively inexpensive and could be done quickly it is \nwhat scientists call the ``low-hanging fruit'' of environmental fixes.\n  Through the leadership of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton and the \nUnited Nations Foundation, the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves was \nformed in 2010. Recognizing the severity of the global health and \nenvironmental issues, this public-private partnership aims to save \nlives, improve livelihoods, empower women, and combat pollution by \ncreating a thriving global market for clean and efficient household \ncooking solutions. The Alliance partners are working to help overcome \nthe market barriers that currently impede the production, deployment, \nand use of clean cookstoves in the developing world.\n  To assist in this important endeavor, several Federal agencies the \nDepartments of State, Energy, and Health and Human Services, including \nNIH and CDC, the United States Agency for International Development, \nthe Environmental Protection Agency, and the Overseas Private \nInvestment Corporation have committed to contribute to the Alliance in \nthree key areas.\n  First: support for research and development to improve design, lower \ncosts, and develop global industry standards and testing protocols for \ncookstoves. Second: diplomatic engagement to encourage a commercial \nmarket for clean stoves and promote several strategies, including \nreducing trade barriers, promoting consumer awareness, and improving \naccess to financing. Third: the launch of international development \nprojects to distribute the clean stoves to targeted areas, including \nrefugee camps, disaster relief efforts, and long-term aid programs, as \nwell as projects\n\n[[Page S2930]]\n\naimed at women and girls. These contributions will assist the Alliance \nin reaching its goal of spurring the adoption of clean cookstoves in \n100 million households by 2020.\n  Our legislation reinforces the commitment these U.S. agencies have \nmade to the Alliance and requires the Secretary of State in \nconsultation with the relevant Federal agencies, and in coordination \nwith relevant international nongovernmental organizations and private \nand governmental entities to work to advance the goals of the Alliance. \nIn addition, our bill formally authorizes the agency's funding \ncommitments to ensure that these crucial pledges toward preventing \nunnecessary illness and reducing pollution around the globe are met.\n  By supporting the work of the Alliance to replace primitive stoves \nwith modern versions that emit far less soot, this legislation would \ndirectly benefit some of the world's poorest people and reduce harmful \npollution that affects us all.\n  This measure addresses an important global pollutant and alleviates a \nserious public health and environmental concern affecting developing \nnations. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting The Clean \nCookstoves Support Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. \n        Coons, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Kohl, and Ms. Klobuchar):\n  S. 2554. A bill to amend title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and \nSafe Streets Act of 1968 to extend the authorization of the Bulletproof \nVest Partnership Grant Program through fiscal year 2017; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce a bill to \nreauthorize the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act.\n  I am pleased that Senator Coons, Senator Whitehouse, and Senator \nSchumer have joined me in this effort. When enacted, this legislation \nwill continue for another five years the lifesaving grant program that \nSenator Campbell and I authored in 1998. This measure will continue \nCongress' strong commitment to the safety and security of our Nation's \nlaw enforcement officers.\n  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program, administered by the \nDepartment of Justice, provides financial assistance to State law \nenforcement agencies to help purchase bulletproof vests. This program \nis an important part of the Federal Government's overall policy to \nassist and support State and local law enforcement partners around the \ncountry.\n  In February, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on this program \nand the need for reauthorization to emphasize just how important and \neffective this program has been. At that hearing, a representative from \nthe Government Accountability Office testified that since 1987, data \nshows that body armor has saved the lives of 3,000 law enforcement \nofficers. That is 3,000 men and women who may not otherwise have made \nit home to their families and loved ones. The BVP Program has assisted \nState and local jurisdictions with the purchase of nearly one million \nbulletproof vests since 1999. That is a measure of success all Senators \nshould be proud of. I hope we can support the continuation of this \nprogram unanimously, as the Senate did most recently in 2008.\n  Despite the progress that has been made in the improvement of \nlifesaving equipment and training, there is much work to be done. The \nyear 2011 was an especially tragic one for the law enforcement \ncommunity. Last year, 163 State and Federal law enforcement officers \nlost their lives and thousands were injured or disabled in the line of \nduty. This is an increase from 2010 and a grim reminder of the \nsacrifices far too many individuals make in the service of their \ncommunities and fellow citizens. The Senate should continue to do its \npart to help reverse the trend of the last several years.\n  The safety and support of law enforcement officers across the United \nStates should be something on which we can all agree. As we look toward \nNational Police Week this month, Senators have an opportunity with this \nlegislation to help make a difference and to show the thousands of law \nenforcement officers and their family members who will be in Washington \nthat the Senate stands with them. I encourage their support and I look \nforward to the enactment of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2554\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
