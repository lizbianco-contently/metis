Madam President, all across the country this morning, \nAmericans are struggling--and they are not getting much in the way of \nhelp or hope from Washington. Those who are unemployed or eager to hire \nare frustrated by the mountain of burdensome new rules and regulations \nDemocrats have imposed on them in the past 2 years and by the \nuncertainty that comes with every proposal to create another one. They \nare shocked that a White House which does not even try to balance its \ncheckbook would repeatedly propose to raise taxes. And more and more, \nthey are worried about the consequences of our debt and the President's \nreluctance to do anything about it.\n  But even more upsetting to many Americans is the repeated attempts of \nthe White House to seem as if it is doing something about these things \nwhen it is not. That is just what the President has sought to do in \ntalking about the need to reform entitlements and lower the debt, but \nrefusing to lift a finger to do either. And that is just what I fear he \nwill do again this afternoon in outlining his vision for tackling these \nproblems without so much as presenting a single new idea or anything \napproaching a workable plan to get us there.\n  The truth is, the President is only entering this debate at all \nbecause he can no longer ignore the growing bipartisan calls for \naction. If he were serious, he would be talking about a detailed \nroadmap for action, not just grabbing headlines by announcing another \nspeech.\n  Of course, we can hope that the President presents more than just his \nvision for the future this afternoon. But those who have hoped for that \nfrom this President have been disappointed many times before. What we \nare likely to get instead is a broad-brush notion of what the President \nwants to see--a vision that includes calls for strengthening \nentitlement programs that few people would disagree with but which will \nnever come about absent Presidential leadership; a partisan call for \ntax hikes on struggling job creators, and, I fear, a call for tax hikes \non energy producers when gas prices are already creating heavy burdens \nfor so many.\n  No doubt we will also get a fair share of finger-pointing and an \nattempt to cast Republicans in the worst possible light for actually \nlaying out a serious plan to address the crises we face while others \nmerely talk about their vision. But we can still hope that the \nPresident leaves the scapegoating aside for a change and finally admits \nthe obvious: that we can only solve these fiscal crises if we do so \ntogether.\n  So either the President agrees today that Republicans have a point \nwhen it comes to the seriousness of our fiscal problems and admits that \nthe old approach of pretending they do not exist will not work anymore \nor those problems will become harder and harder to solve. Either he \npretends that old programs, unlike everything else in life, do not need \nto adapt to survive or he joins us in acknowledging those programs will \nno longer be there for the people who are counting on them if we do not \ntake serious action now.\n  We need to keep our promises to seniors and to a rising generation of \nAmericans--and we will--but we can no longer afford to make promises to \nyounger workers that we all know we cannot afford to keep.\n  Look: if big government created jobs and opportunity, then we would \nbe in the middle of a boom right now. That experiment has failed. And \nthat is why the national conversation has shifted from how much \nDemocrats want to expand the scope of government to how much both \nparties should rein it in.\n  The fiscal crisis we face will not be solved by ``freezing'' \nunsustainable government spending or by raising taxes on the very small \nbusinesses we are counting on to create jobs. And the programs we \ncherish as Americans will not be preserved for the next generation \nthrough speeches alone. Americans do not want to hear the President's \nvision today--he has had 2 years to lay that out. They want to hear his \nplan.\n  Americans do not want to hear the President criticize or distort the \nserious efforts of those in our party who want to solve our problems \nhead on. They want to hear a detailed counterproposal of his own. And \nthey do not want to hear that the price of gas at the pump is going to \nget even higher, or that their opportunities to find or create jobs \nwill shrink. Now is not a time for mere speeches or political attacks. \nIt is a time for action.\n  That is what Americans want from this President. That is what they \nare failing to get. I hope that changes today.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise to mark National Volunteer Week \nand Delaware Volunteer Week. All week long throughout the Nation and \nacross the great State of Delaware, Americans and Delawareans will be \nengaged in volunteer service. Volunteer opportunities include helping \nthe homeless, tending to the environment, mentoring children in \nschools, and working to keep communities safer and stronger and free \nfrom fires and accidents and injuries, among many others.\n  Here in the Senate one can't talk about community service or national \nservice or voluntarism without thanking and recognizing our colleague \nSenator Barbara Mikulski from Delaware's neighboring State of Maryland. \nSenator Mikulski has been the leader on voluntarism for many years, \nmost of them alongside the late Senator Ted Kennedy. I am proud to be \nworking with her to fight to save our national service programs.\n  When Delaware's tireless Governor Jack Markell was sworn into office \nin 2009, he decided to forgo the traditional Governor's inaugural ball \nand he, along with his wonderful wife, our first lady Carla Markell, \ninstead organized a week of service projects across the State. Today \nthat week of service continues and has become a tremendous opportunity \nfor nonprofit organizations and community service organizations across \nthe State to connect with Delawareans excited about teaching our \nchildren the value of voluntarism, connecting with neighbors and \nhelping improve and strengthen our communities.\n  I have long believed that those who engage in voluntarism and service \nto others in fact get more out of it than they put in.\n  Voluntarism, as you know, Madam President, is a fundamental part of \nwhat it means to be American. It is a great--some would say the \ngreatest--part of America and its cultural traditions. However, \nvoluntarism need not be confined to my State or this week. It is \nsomething from which every American can benefit at every stage in their \nlife.\n  In my view, one of the most effective voluntarism efforts in modern \nhistory is one with which I was first engaged when I was a resident \nbriefly of the State of the Acting President pro tempore when I was \nworking for the national ``I Have a Dream'' Foundation in New York City \nnow many years ago.\n\n[[Page S2409]]\n\n  The national AmeriCorps program--a partnership between the Federal \nGovernment and local nonprofit communities--was launched with \nbipartisan support, initially an idea proposed by President Bush and \nthen enacted by President Clinton. The AmeriCorps program is now one \nwhich has had a tremendous and far-reaching impact over the last 17 \nyears. It enables 75,000 Americans to serve annually via AmeriCorps \nwith a very wide range of programs--programs where the funding is \nraised and its focus is directed by State, by State commissions of \nvolunteers, community leaders, who help identify the best and most \nappropriate, most effective partners for this federally funded program \nthat is also matched one to one with dollars from the local community. \nSo far more than 60 million hours of community service annually has \nbeen provided by AmeriCorps members.\n  In Delaware, voluntarism has a long tradition and a great history, \nand the volunteer fire service is one of the strongest parts of that \nlong and proud history of our State. There are more than 88 volunteer \nfire companies in our State. They provide the vast majority of fire \nsuppression services for our communities.\n  They faced a real problem when I became county executive: a steady \nloss in membership. As working-class families were under more and more \npressure, with both parents working, they were under more stress, more \ndemands, and it became more difficult for people to dedicate the time \nand energy needed to be trained and to serve as volunteer firefighters, \nand, in particular, to deliver ambulance service--one of the most \nimportant aspects of our volunteer fire service.\n  So in partnership with our New Castle County Volunteer Firefighters \nAssociation, and with the YMCA, and with AmeriCorps, I worked \ntirelessly to launch a new AmeriCorps program called the Emergency \nServices Corps.\n  The Emergency Services Corps helps recruit volunteer firefighters and \nconducts CPR and first aid training and provides fire awareness \ntraining for schoolchildren all across our county. So far they have \nrecruited more than 220 volunteer firefighters and logged more than \n108,000 hours of service to our community in the 5 years since it was \ncreated as a partnership between all these different entities.\n  I just thought I would draw attention to that one example today of \nthe hundreds of AmeriCorps programs across our country that I think are \na shining example of how the young people of this country--people at \nall ages across this country--bring their gifts, their talents, and \ntheir spirit to volunteering.\n  In every generation of Americans, heeding the call to service has \nbeen the answer to our greatest challenges, and with so many out of \nwork, suffering from hunger or facing homelessness right here in our \nown country, I think it is critical we all pitch in to help. It is an \naffirmation of our bond of citizenship and our compassion for our \nfellow citizens.\n  So I would like to encourage everyone in my State to visit the \nVolunteer Delaware Web site to find service opportunities this week. I \nam putting a link to it on my Web site at www.coons.senate.gov. For \nthose who happen to be outside Delaware, I hope they will visit \nwww.nationalservice.gov and participate in this National Volunteer \nWeek.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, may I be recognized to speak \nin morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/13/senate-section/article/S2409-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2409-S2410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, the Paul Ryan/tea party \nbudget of the House of Representatives privatizes Medicare. Let me \nrepeat that. Medicare, the program of medical care for senior citizens \nthat our seniors have come to depend on--the Paul Ryan/tea party budget \nof the House of Representatives privatizes Medicare.\n  This is not an empty threat. It is not this Senator's or any other \nSenator's political interpretation. The budget of the House Republican \nBudget Committee chairman would end Medicare as we know it. It ends \nMedicare. It hands seniors' health care over to insurance companies. It \nwould break a sacred contract between workers who paid into the system \nthinking it would be there for them when they retired. But under this \nnew scheme, senior citizens will not have a Medicare Program anymore. \nThey would have to pick an insurance plan, and a voucher would be given \ndirectly to the insurance company.\n  Under the proposal--I am not making this up--a voucher, paid for by \nthe Federal Government, would be given not to the senior citizen to go \nshopping, it would be given to the insurance company that they chose. \nMedicare for senior citizens would be turned over to insurance \ncompanies. If this sounds incredible, it is, because under that plan \ninsurers would decide what doctors seniors get to see and what health \nbenefits get covered.\n  Now, why do I say that? That is an HMO. An HMO is a health \nmaintenance organization. That is an insurance company. They have a \npanel of doctors, they have a panel of hospitals, and they determine \nwhat is in the coverage that a senior citizen gets.\n  Contrast that to Medicare now, that Medicare fee-for-service. The \nsenior citizen makes the choice of their doctor, of what are the things \nthey look for in their total medical care, paid for because they are \nsenior citizens and are eligible for Medicare, of which they have been \npaying in all of their lives through a Medicare tax.\n  So now this proposal is to privatize Medicare, take it out of being a \ngovernment fee-for-service plan, and, instead, insert it into a \nprivatized insurance company.\n  Do senior citizens want to change their Medicare and turn it over to \ninsurance companies? I do not think so. If insurance plans raise their \ncosts, which we know they do, seniors then would have to pick up the \nbill. Seniors would have to pay more out of their pocket for this \nvoucher program.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, out-of-pocket costs--\nthis is according to CBO, the nonpartisan actuarial accounting \norganization--according to CBO, out-of-pocket costs would more than \ndouble for seniors.\n  This voucher program proposed by the chairman of the Budget Committee \nin the House, Congressman Ryan, is not like Medicare Advantage. \nMedicare Advantage has been a great program for senior citizens, and in \nour State of Florida we have more signed up for Medicare Advantage than \nany other State because of what it does. It provides benefits at low \ncost to senior citizens because the Federal Government directly \nnegotiates with the insurance companies' plans. That is different from \nwhat Congressman Ryan and the tea party are proposing. So insurance \ncompanies, under Medicare Advantage, have to provide guaranteed health \nbenefits at a low price that is negotiated. As a result of the new \nhealth care reform law, Medicare Advantage premiums have actually gone \ndown. These are the premiums that are paid by senior citizens.\n  So do not let folks confuse you between what is proposed by the \nBudget chairman in the House and the existing Medicare Advantage \nProgram. The Ryan/tea party budget leaves these decisions up to the \ninsurance plan. In other words, insurance companies will be in charge \nof seniors' health care. I do not think that is what our senior \ncitizens intend to have happen.\n  The tea party wants to end Medicare. That is the bottom line. Yet the \nHouse budget does little--interestingly, little--if anything to \nactually reduce the Federal deficit, which is what they say their \nbudget is for, to reduce the Federal deficit.\n  Well, look at it. The House Budget chairman claims his budget \nincludes $5.8 trillion in spending cuts, but when we look at it closer \nwe learn this claim was an accounting gimmick. We have seen these \ngimmicks over and over in budgeting in the Federal Government.\n\n[[Page S2410]]\n\n  For example, first, we learned that his staff had made a $200 billion \nmathematical calculating error in calculating interest savings. Then, \nsecond, we learned that $1.3 trillion of the savings is artificially \nderived from a misleading assumption that the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan would continue indefinitely. Third, and most importantly, \nof his savings, $4.2 trillion of the savings come from the spending \ncuts that fly out the back door in the form of tax cuts for \nmillionaires.\n  At the end of the day, those $5.8 trillion in spending cuts in their \nbudget translates into less than $200 billion in real deficit reduction \nover those years, or less than 1 percent of the total debt held by the \npublic.\n  So the Congressman Ryan/tea party budget does little to address the \ndeficit while making every single senior citizen in this country get \ntheir health care from an insurance company.\n  So that is why Senator Baucus, our chairman of the Finance Committee, \nand I have introduced a resolution. This Senate resolution calls on the \nSenate to oppose this radical voucher program. Medicare has been \nproviding affordable health care for seniors and disabled Floridians \nand Americans for decades and decades. It is a very popular program \nwith our seniors. Medicare should not be dismantled. It should not be \nturned over in a voucher program to insurance companies that will \neliminate choices. It should not be turned over to insurance companies \nthat will increase costs, and, certainly, seniors' health care should \nnot be turned over to insurance companies.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/13/senate-section/article/S2410-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2410-S2412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BUDGET PRIORITIES\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, we are all kind of on pins and needles \nabout what the President is going to say today in his speech on the \nbudget at George Washington University. I hope he comes forward with a \nstrong program to get the budget deficit down because Presidential \nleadership will help us get the job done. Congress can do it on its \nown, but it will be a lot easier if we know we are working with the \nPresident instead of against the President.\n  I hope the President's remarks reflect the fact that elections have \nconsequences and the consequence of the last election was a very strong \nmessage to Washington that we ought to get spending down and government \nought to be smaller. In anticipation of what he says, I wish to make \nsome remarks, and my anticipation is based upon things that have \nalready been said from the White House by staff about the direction the \nPresident's speech is taking.\n  If we learned anything during the last 2 years, it is that America \ncan't tax and spend its way back to prosperity. The voters understood \nthat and sent a powerful message to Washington last November: Stop \npiling debt on the next generation. Stop the overspending that \nmortgages our children's future and jeopardizes job creation.\n  Thanks to the gravitational pull of the Republican majority in the \nHouse of Representatives responding to the results of the last \nelection, the compass is starting to point in the right direction. \nDespite the two-against-one lineup of the debate, meaning the President \nand the Democratic Senate on one side and the House under the control \nof the Republicans on the other side--that two-to-one lineup--we have a \ncontinuing resolution at the start of what must be a long-haul, \ncommitted effort.\n  The continuing resolution we will pass this week is just the \nbeginning because the hard work has only just begun. That is reflected \nin the leadership demonstrated by the House of Representatives' Budget \nCommittee chairman Paul Ryan. He did what the President failed to do in \nhis budget proposal--get serious. Today, I hope we have evidence that \nthe President is getting serious. But up until now, the President \nducked, even ignoring his own deficit reduction commission report fresh \noff the printer. He hasn't said yes or no whether he supports the \nrecommendations of the Bowles-Simpson commission.\n  In sharp contrast, House Chairman Ryan stepped up and put ideas on \nthe table for fiscal responsibility. Today, in response to this effort, \nto show the voters we got it in the last election and that it is time \nto reduce spending in Washington, the President is giving his speech on \nreducing the debt. After reluctantly coming to the table for very \nmodest reductions in spending that are going to be in this continuing \nresolution we will hopefully pass this week, the President has quickly \nmoved past any focus on getting spending under control and seems to be \ngoing back to that same old saw that we have to have tax increases to \nreduce the deficit. But history proves tax increases do not bring an \nadditional dollar to the bottom line. Tax increases are a license to \nspend even more than the $1 that might come in from a tax increase, and \nwe also know increasing taxes is not going to reduce the deficit. Only \ngrowing the economy is going to reduce the deficit. Tax increases can \nhave a detrimental impact on growing the economy because government \nconsumes well; it doesn't create well. Only workers and investors and \npeople who invent and people who create, create wealth.\n  There has always been a tug of war in Washington between tax-cutters \nand big spenders. There are those of us who believe taxpayers have a \nright to keep more of their own money and decide how best to save and \nspend and invest those dollars. Others in Congress and in Washington \nbelieve Washington knows best and work relentlessly to divert more \nprivate resources into the public coffers. Recycling even more tax \ndollars through Washington, especially during an economic downturn \nwhich we are in now, and eight-tenths percent unemployment proves it. \nDoing more of that doesn't make sense if we want recovery.\n  Consider the work of two U.S. Presidents from opposite sides of the \npolitical spectrum. Study the history of John Kennedy on one end and \nRonald Reagan on the other. They understood that raising taxes bore \nnegative consequences for job creation and economic growth. My \ncolleagues may remember that during World War II and afterwards, we had \n93 percent marginal tax rates. Who decreased that? Not some Republican \nPresident but a Democrat President. He reduced it because it was not \nraising revenue and it was hindering the economy. We had a situation \nwhen corporate and personal income tax rates climbed during the Great \nDepression, we have proof unemployment kept climbing as well. In fact, \nif there are two things we want to remember from Hoover that we should \nnever make these mistakes again, they are that he raised taxes \ntremendously high and he signed the Smoot-Hawley tariff bill, leading \nus into the Great Depression. As America struggles to shake off the \nbiggest economic downturn in decades, we can't afford to repeat the \nsame mistakes. We should learn from history.\n  In an economy where consumer spending accounts for nearly 70 percent \nof the Nation's gross domestic product and small businesses account for \n70 percent of the new jobs, it would be foolish to divert even more of \nAmerica's taxpayer money into the Federal Treasury. With a smaller tax \nliability, small business owners can expand their operations, upgrade \ntheir equipment, and hire more workers in their hometown communities. \nBut tax policies designed to increase revenues for more government \nspending will not help these hometown business leaders create new jobs \nthat can attract and retain talent and vitality in those small towns. \nWhat is more, raising Federal tax rates would stunt the positive ripple \neffect that occurs in the local economy and in the local tax base when \nsmall businesses are able to grow and expand their sales output and \nprofits.\n  Raising taxes sets the stage for paralyzing setbacks for small \nbusiness. So we should not forget that many small business owners are \nsubject to the highest marginal tax rates and Federal estate taxes. I \nhave worked for a long time for tax policies that give small business \nowners the freedom and opportunity to hire, expand, and grow their \nbusinesses without having profit-burning taxes and overly burdensome \nregulations get in the way of getting ahead and living the American \ndream and creating those jobs. Marginal tax rate increases are \nespecially harmful to small businesses because small businesses are \ntypically organized as flow-through entities. Since small businesses \ncreate 70 percent of the new jobs\n\n[[Page S2411]]\n\nand unemployment, at 8.8 percent, remains historically high, it doesn't \nmake sense to raise taxes on small businesses.\n  Supporters of the tax increases for those earning $250,000 a year \nwould like to camouflage the tax hit on small businesses, but their \nattempts to mislead cannot withstand an honest examination. The \nmarginal tax rate hikes would directly target flow-through businesses \nthat employ 20 million American workers. It is a waste of resources for \nWashington to recycle tax dollars through the public sector when small \nbusinesses can do more good and get more bang for their own buck and \ntaxpayers, in general, deserve more bang for their buck.\n  I have a chart that shows my colleagues an analysis by the \nCongressional Budget Office, the official nonpartisan scorekeeper for \nCongress. In its January 2011 ``Budget and Economic Outlook'' report, \nCBO reports that taxes have averaged 18 percent of the gross national \nproduct from 1971 to the year 2010. So this is the historical average. \nWhat is very significant about an average going back to 1971--is it \nseems to me a level of taxation the people of this country have not \nrevolted against. It is a level of taxation that has not been harmful \nto the U.S. economy, as we have seen great growth during this period of \ntime.\n  So here is where we are. Beyond the very negative impact of tax \nincreases, there is no evidence that tax increases lead to deficit \nreduction. In fact, if history is any guide, Washington will simply \nspend the money.\n  I often quote a Professor Vedder of Ohio University who has studied \ntax increases and spending for more than two decades. This is the very \nsame study I was referring to as I started my remarks today. ``Over the \nentire post World War II era through 2009, each dollar of new tax \nrevenue was associated with $1.17 in new spending.''\n  So it is akin to a dog chasing its tail. It is never going to catch \nit. If we raise $1 and it doesn't go to the bottom line, and Professor \nVedder says it doesn't go to the bottom line, it is a license to spend \n$1.17. How do we ever get ahead? Then we have people who want to \nincrease taxes because another dollar coming in is going to lead to \n$1.17 of spending. It would be one thing for me to vote for a tax \nincrease if it went to the bottom line. It is another thing to vote for \na tax increase that just allows more spending and raises the deficit \ninstead of getting the deficit down. People in my State of Iowa don't \ntell me they are undertaxed. They know all too well the problem is that \nWashington overspends.\n  Before this chart is taken down, just so my colleagues can \nunderstand, there is no reason to raise taxes above this historical \naverage to bring in more revenue because we can see the projection by \nCBO. The existing tax rates are going to bring in more revenue without \nincreasing tax rates just because of the economy growing.\n  With the existing tax rates, revenues coming in will return to the \nlevel we had after the 2001 tax bill--that bill reduced taxes by \nproviding the biggest tax decrease in the history of this country. We \nbrought in additional revenue with reduced rates--more revenue than \nwould come in by raising marginal tax rates. That ought to be \ncalculated. You should not do anything that is going to destroy this \nsituation.\n  Some are proposing eliminating the cap on wages for social security \ntaxes. This would result in a huge tax increase of 6.2 percent on \nincome over $106,800. Both employees and employers pay these taxes. \nThose in favor of this will argue that it is needed to protect benefits \nfor social security beneficiaries. We have been down that road before. \nWe raised the tax rate in the 1980s. This was supposedly also to \nprotect benefits, but look where we are now. There is no guarantee that \nraising taxes in that way will guarantee benefits.\n  Referring to this chart again, to be specific on this growth out \nhere, CBO projects that taxes will average 19.9 percent of gross \nnational product from 2010 to 2021, rising to 20.8 percent of GDP by \n2021. If we increase taxes, I think it will put that economic growth in \njeopardy.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from \nInvestors Business Daily.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From Investors.com, Apr. 11, 2011]\n\n                   Tax the Rich? Good Luck With That\n\n                          (By Walter Williams)\n\n       I've often said that I wish there were some humane way to \n     get rid of the rich. If you asked why, I'd answer that \n     getting rid of the rich would save us from distraction by \n     leftist hustlers promoting the politics of envy.\n       Not having the rich to fret over might enable us to better \n     focus our energies on what's in the best interest of the \n     99.99% of the rest of us. Let's look at some facts about the \n     rich laid out by Bill Whittle citing statistics on his \n     RealClearPolitics video ``Eat the Rich.''\n       This year, Congress will spend $3.7 trillion dollars. That \n     turns out to be about $10 billion per day. Can we prey upon \n     the rich to cough up the money?\n       According to IRS statistics, roughly 2% of U.S. households \n     have an income of $250,000 and above. By the way, $250,000 \n     per year hardly qualifies one as being rich. It's not even \n     yacht and Learjet money.\n       All told, households earning $250,000 and above account for \n     25%, or $1.97 trillion, of the nearly $8 trillion of total \n     household income. If Congress imposed a 100% tax, taking all \n     earnings above $250,000 per year, it would yield the princely \n     sum of $1.4 trillion. That would keep the government running \n     for 141 days, but there's a problem because there are 224 \n     more days left in the year.\n       How about corporate profits to fill the gap? Fortune 500 \n     companies earn nearly $400 billion in profits. Since leftists \n     think profits are little less than theft and greed, Congress \n     might confiscate these ill-gotten gains so that they can be \n     returned to their rightful owners.\n       Taking corporate profits would keep the government running \n     for another 40 days, but that along with confiscating all \n     income above $250,000 would only get us to the end of June. \n     Congress must search elsewhere.\n       According to the Forbes 400, America has 400 billionaires \n     with a combined net worth of $1.3 trillion. Congress could \n     confiscate their stocks and bonds, and force them to sell \n     their businesses, yachts, airplanes, mansions and jewelry. \n     The problem is that after fleecing the rich of their income \n     and net worth, and the Fortune 500 corporations of their \n     profits, it would only get us to mid-August.\n       The fact of the matter is there are not enough rich people \n     to come anywhere close to satisfying Congress' voracious \n     spending appetite. They're going to have to go after the non-\n     rich.\n       But let's stick with the rich and ask a few questions. \n     Politicians, news media people and leftists in general \n     entertain what economists call a zero-elasticity view of the \n     world. That's just fancy economic jargon for a view that \n     government can impose a tax and people will behave after the \n     tax just as they behaved before the tax, and the only change \n     is more government revenue.\n       One example of that vision, at the state and local levels \n     of government, is the disappointing results of confiscatory \n     tobacco taxes. Confiscatory tobacco taxes have often led to \n     less state and local revenue because those taxes encourage \n     smuggling.\n       Similarly, when government taxes profits, corporations \n     report fewer profits and greater costs. When individuals face \n     higher income taxes, they report less income, buy tax \n     shelters and hide their money. It's not just rich people who \n     try to avoid taxes, but all of us--liberals, conservatives \n     and libertarians.\n       What's the evidence? Federal tax collections have been \n     between 15% and 20% of GDP every year since 1960. However, \n     between 1960 and today, the top marginal tax rate has varied \n     between 91% and 35%.\n       That means whether taxes are high or low, people make \n     adjustments in their economic behavior so as to keep the \n     government tax take at 15% to 20% of GDP. Differences in tax \n     rates have a far greater impact on economic growth than \n     federal revenues.\n       So far as Congress' ability to prey on the rich, we must \n     keep in mind that rich people didn't become rich by being \n     stupid.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. According to this article, even if the government \nconfiscated all of the income of people earning $250,000 a year, the \nmoney would fund the Federal Government today for a mere 140 days. CBO \nstatistics tell us that the top 5 percent of households earn 29 percent \nof the income and pay 43 percent of the income tax collected by the \nFederal Government. This chart here shows that these 5 percent of \nhouseholds have seen their taxes go up or hold steady while the other \n95 percent of households have seen their taxes go down.\n  We are in a situation where people are talking about increasing taxes \non higher income people because, supposedly, they can afford it--and \nprobably they can afford it. But I get sick and tired of the \ndemagoguery that goes on in Washington of taxing higher income people. \nThis group of people is already paying 43 percent of all of the income \ntax coming in to the Federal Government, while 47 percent of the people \nin this country don't pay any income tax whatsoever. How high do taxes \nhave to go, generally, to satisfy the appetite of the people in this \nCongress to spend money? And particularly, how high do marginal tax \nrates\n\n[[Page S2412]]\n\nhave to go to satisfy those clamoring for higher taxes that the \nwealthiest in this country are paying enough money?\n  In addition to the CBO statistics on households, IRS statistics show \nthat 1 percent of the wealthiest people make 27 percent of the income \nand pay 40 percent of the income taxes. If it be 41 or 42 percent, \nmaybe we can look at it. But I never get the sense from anybody who is \nproposing these higher marginal tax rates on upper income people that \nthey are ever going to be satisfied that those people are paying enough \ntaxes. So I will get back to what I said. You could confiscate all the \nincome earned by people that make over $250,000 a year but you are only \ngoing to run the government for 140 days. What do you do for the rest \nof the year if you only want the wealthy to pay all the taxes?\n  We ought to have some principles of taxation that we are abiding by. \nI abide by the principle that 18 percent of the GDP of this country is \ngood enough for the government to spend. That leaves 82 percent in the \npockets of the taxpayers for them to decide how to spend. Because if \n535 of us decide how to divide up the resources of this country, it \ndoesn't do as much economic good. If the money is left in the pockets \nof the 137 million taxpayers to decide whether to spend or to save it, \nand how to save it, or what to spend it on, it responds to the dynamics \nof our economy. They would be participating in the American free \nenterprise system in a way that the 535 Members of Congress don't know \nenough how to do. If we relied upon the 535 of us to decide how to \nspend more resources of this country, we would not have the economic \ngrowth we have. We would be Europeanizing our economy, and we know that \nis bad.\n  This principle of 18 percent of gross domestic product is good and it \nhas been consistent throughout recent history. This chart here shows \nthat it is not a straight line, but it is pretty even over a 50-year \naverage. I think it averages out at about 18.2 percent. You have the \nmarginal tax rates going back to 93 percent during World War II and \nstaying there until, as I said, Senator Kennedy becomes President and \nhe decides the marginal tax rate is too high for the good of the \neconomy and he reduces it. I am told because of the Vietnam war, it \nwent up. It stayed even at 70 percent until President Reagan. Then it \ngoes down to a 50 percent marginal tax rate. Then it stays there a \nwhile. In 1986, it goes down to 28 percent. Then we have the promise of \nno new taxes when President Bush reneged on that promise, and it went \nback up to almost 40 percent. Then they went up again here and stayed \nhere, and then we had the tax decrease of 2001.\n  Do you know what this shows? Everybody has an idea that if you raise \nthe marginal tax rates, you will bring in more revenue. But the \ntaxpayers, workers, and investors of this country are smarter than we \nare. We have had a 93-percent marginal tax rate--then 70 percent, 50 \npercent, 28 percent, and now a 35-percent marginal tax rate. But, \nregardless of the rate, you get the same amount of revenue, because \ntaxpayers have decided they are going to give us bums in Washington \njust so much of their money to spend, and it works out to be about 18 \npercent of gross domestic product.\n  So we have a President who will probably give a speech today and say \nwe are going to raise taxes on higher income people because, like him, \nthey ought to pay more money. What do you get out of it? You can mess \nwith these marginal tax rates all you want to, but you will bring in \nabout the same amount of revenue. Why? In part because people have \ndecided that, if we are going to tax them to death, they are going to \ntake more leisure and they are going to invest in nonproductive \ninvestments. Bottom line--increasing taxes doesn't bring more revenue \ninto the federal Treasury.\n  You have to keep marginal tax rates low so you can expand this \neconomy. As we have seen, when taxes go down, unemployment goes down; \nwhen taxes go up, the incentive to employ is gone. So here we are.\n  The national debt poses serious risk to the long-term economic health \nof the United States. It puts a heavy burden on taxpayers who will have \nless take-home pay to save, spend and invest if they have to send more \nmoney to Washington.\n  Washington needs to champion policies that grow the economy and \ncreate jobs, and in turn, increases revenue to the federal Treasury, \nenabling deficit and debt reduction, not defend ways that grow the \ngovernment.\n  The President and 535 Members of Congress collectively represent many \ndifferent constituencies across the ideological, political, geographic \nand demographic spectrum. Although representing many, we can work as \none to make America an even better place for posterity. If we continue \nto live beyond our means and get in the way of job-creating economic \nopportunity, we will push future generations over a fiscal cliff of no \nreturn. That is why Washington must clamp down on new spending and \nshrink the national debt.\n  I hope we have a President who is willing to look at history and \nlearn from history in his speech today.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, last week America's government was \nbrought to the brink of a shutdown, and the shutdown was avoided \nliterally at the eleventh hour just last Friday. The same day, the \nPresident called Speaker Boehner to try to advance the talks. According \nto Politico, the President told Speaker Boehner, ``We are the two most \nconsequential leaders in the U.S. Government.'' The President was \nright, so why was only one of those two leaders actively trying to lead \non the issue of the day? Speaker Boehner was trying for weeks to put \ntogether a deal that could serve the American people, but right up \nuntil the end, the President was missing in action. Even Senator \nManchin, a member of the President's own party, said the President had \n``failed to lead this debate.''\n  Now the President is finally saying he wants to talk about what steps \nour country needs to take to get our fiscal house in order. I really do \nhope the President is serious, but I have my doubts. This is a line we \nhave heard from the President before. Back in February 2009, the \nPresident called experts to the White House for what he called a fiscal \nresponsibility summit. In his opening remarks, the President said this:\n\n       Contrary to the prevailing wisdom in Washington these past \n     few years, we cannot simply spend as we please and defer the \n     consequences to the next budget, the next administration, or \n     the next generation.\n\n  That was February 2009. For the last 2 years of this administration, \nall the President did was add trillions of dollars to that debt.\n  Late last year, the President's debt commission released their report \non America's fiscal situation, and the findings were sobering. \nAccording to the report, they said the problem is real, the solution \nwill be painful, there is no easy way out, everything must be on the \ntable, and he said Washington must lead. The President ignored the \nreport.\n  America is done waiting for him to take this issue seriously. Last \nweek, the House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan put forward the \nfirst concrete plan to address our debt crisis. Now the President has \nsuddenly decided that crisis needs to be addressed. The President has a \nnational address scheduled for today, and maybe that will be the moment \nof truth. I hope it will not be another one of the President's recycled \nspeeches; empty words cannot fill America's pockets.\n  Last November, the American people told us they wanted the truth. \nThey wanted to know their representatives could make tough decisions. \nThat is what we heard on election day. They wanted to make sure there \nwould be a future for their families and for their children. I think \nthe American people deserve results. The President has paid them back \nwith excuses, with delays, and with business as usual.\n  Republicans have been the leaders on trying to reduce the spending. \nThe\n\n[[Page S2413]]\n\nPresident's party has only criticized, complained or, in the final \nmoments, tried to take credit. They refuse to lead and have refused to \nact.\n  Now the President's party wants us to raise the debt ceiling in what \nthey call a clean bill. That is a fancy way of saying they want us to \nborrow more money with no strings attached. The President opposed doing \nthe same thing back in 2006 when he was a Senator. This is what he said \nthen. The President, on the floor of the Senate, said:\n\n       The fact that we are on the floor today debating raising \n     the nation's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It \n     is a sign the Government cannot pay its own bills. It is a \n     sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from \n     foreign countries to finance our Government's reckless fiscal \n     policies.\n\n  I would just say that if President Obama thought raising the debt \nceiling at a $9 trillion level was a sign of leadership failure, why \nthen is President Obama asking us to raise it beyond the $14 trillion \nnow?\n  Facts are stubborn things. The numbers do not lie. Every day, this \ngovernment borrows over $4 billion. We did it yesterday, and we will do \nit today and tomorrow. Over 40 cents of every dollar Washington spends \nis borrowed money, much of it from China. Every American child born \ntoday and tomorrow and the next day owes over $45,000. Next year, \nWashington will spend 68 cents of every tax dollar on Social Security, \non Medicare, on Medicaid, or interest on the debt. If we as a nation \ncontinue on the President's path, Washington will spend all of what it \ntakes in on these items alone. Everything else, from defense to \neducation, will be paid for on a budget of borrowed money. Where is the \nmoney going to come from? A lot of it from other countries, countries \nthat do not always have America's best interests at heart.\n  John F. Kennedy once said, ``Ask not what your country can do for \nyou, ask what you can do for your country.'' In a few years, that could \nchange to, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what your \ncountry must do for China. Consider this: When John F. Kennedy was \nPresident, America only owed 4 percent of its debt to foreign \ncountries. Today, we owe half of our debt to foreign countries.\n  Debt is not just a disaster for our future; the amount of debt we owe \nright now, today, is so high that it is hurting our employment at home. \nExperts tell us our debt is costing us 1 million jobs, and the evidence \nis clear that our debt is disastrous in the present as well as for the \nfuture. A debt such as this makes it harder for American families to \nbuy cars and homes, to pay tuition for their kids to go to college, and \nthen it makes it harder to create jobs for those kids who will be \ngraduating this year and next year until we get the spending under \ncontrol.\n  The President's party simply offers more of the same old failed \npolicies that produced the problems in the first place. Some in the \nPresident's party have suggested raising taxes to make up for the debt. \nI expect the President to do that this very day in his speech.\n  The President's speech today comes just a few months after he \nsubmitted his budget. After seeing that budget, it is hard to take the \nPresident seriously. Don't take my word for it; one writer in the \nWashington Post said it already:\n\n       President Obama's budget was irresponsible, failing to take \n     on entitlements and relying on rosy assumptions.\n\n  The international magazine The Economist called the budget \n``dishonest.''\n  America needs a President who shows real leadership and a concrete \nplan. That is what the American people are expecting.\n  I will not vote to raise the debt ceiling unless some very specific \nsteps are taken. It is time we passed a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution. Many States have to balance their budgets, families \nhave to balance their budgets, live within their means. Washington \nneeds to do the same.\n  It is also time for us to place actual legal limits on what we do \nspend. A statutory limit on total government spending will force \nWashington to make the hard decisions each year to get us back on \ntrack. A hard cap on government spending will start us on the path \ntoward fiscal balance and sustained growth. Ronald Reagan used to talk \nabout starving the beast. That is what we need. Since President Obama \ntook office, the beast has only grown fatter.\n  The President's party likes to accuse their opponents of being \nantigovernment, so why didn't the President's party bother to pass a \nbudget or fund the government last year when they should have? And why \nare they driving our government further into debt, hurting America's \nstanding and our credit on the world stage?\n  The President's party likes to pretend they are standing up for the \nlittle guy. They should have listened to Ronald Reagan when he said: \n``You can't be for big government and big spending and big taxes and \nstill be for the little guy.'' The President and his party are for big \ngovernment, big spending, and big taxes, and they are not for the \nlittle guy.\n  The fact is, the President and his party are not that interested in \nsolutions. Instead of solutions, the President's party has hidden \nbehind nasty words, words like ``extreme'' and ``Draconian.'' Many \nAmerican families are living within the same budget they had in 2008, \nand Republicans believe the government should do the same. Is spending \nno more than you did in 2008 extreme or is it extreme to support \ntrillions more in wasteful Washington spending? Is tightening our belts \nlike families do Draconian or is it Draconian to spend money we don't \nhave and force our children to pay it back?\n\n  Some members of the President's party have gone even further. One \nleader of the President's party said that Republicans wanted to starve \n6 million seniors. That is a pretty disturbing claim. The problem is, \nthe Washington Post said that she made it up. This same person called \nthe Ryan plan a ``path to poverty''--a ``path to poverty,'' she said--\n``for America's seniors and children.'' The Ryan plan doesn't affect \nanyone over the age of 55. It saves Medicare for those who have not \ngotten there yet, and it stops the spending that puts every American on \nthe path to permanent poverty. Meanwhile, the President says he doesn't \nwant to point fingers. Yet so far his White House has responded to the \nRyan plan by doing nothing but point fingers. They went back to their \nsame old bag of tricks, and they tried to scare our seniors and their \nfamilies.\n  The President also accused Congress of playing games. Yet his first \nbudget was nothing but a giant game of kick the can, and his address \ntoday looks more likely to be just another campaign speech rather than \na legitimate plan for the future.\n  The time has come to lead, not sit on the sidelines. The time has \ncome for the President to act, not just to talk. As a doctor and a \nSenator, I believe our economy is in need of critical care. Our budget \nis hemorrhaging. There is not a quick or easy fix. A bandaid will not \nhelp this patient. Treatment cannot be delayed. The time to act is now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, as ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, I am concerned about where we are as a nation, as we \nstruggle to get our house in order. The chairman and cochairman of the \nDebt Commission, Erskine Bowles, Senator Alan Simpson, have told us we \nare facing the most predictable financial crisis in our Nation's \nhistory. When asked when we could have a financial crisis, we are \ntalking about another recession, a double dip, or maybe worse, maybe a \nworldwide cataclysm from excessive debt--hopefully not--but that is \nwhat they told us we are facing, the most predictable crisis in \nhistory.\n  We have gone 714 days in this Congress without passing a budget as we \nare required to do. The Budget Act requires Congress to pass a budget \nby April 15, and we have not achieved that. That is particularly \nproblematic at a time of national crisis.\n  I see my colleague Senator Corker from Tennessee here, who has worked \nvery hard with some constructive bipartisan efforts to do something \nabout the debt trajectory we are on. But I\n\n[[Page S2414]]\n\nguess I want to first ask him, as a highly successful mayor of \nChattanooga, received great plaudits around the country and within the \nState for his leadership, he had to deal with real numbers, real \nexpenditures, and real budgets. As a very successful businessman, he \nhas had the same challenge. So I guess I would ask him for his \nperspective, having been in the Senate now several years, what he \nthinks if we as a corporation, a mayor, or a nation, facing the most \nsevere debt crisis perhaps in its history, that we have not had a \nbudget and do not have a plan. I guess my first question, Senator \nCorker is, how, from a businessman, a former mayor who had to run a \ncity and balance your budget, what is your perspective?\n  Mr. CORKER. I was on the floor last week as we talked about the \ncontinuing resolution. I said that the most frustrating thing to me \ncoming to this body--I have been here now 4 years--is we never know \nwhere we are going.\n  It is an amazing thing to have 535 people serving in Congress, and \nthere is no roadmap whatsoever as to what we are going to do. I think \nit is pretty evident, by the time we have this debt ceiling vote--that \nI think most people perceive to be the real line of demarcation--I \nthink it is evident we are not going to have a budget passed again even \nfor that.\n  So I have been working with the Senator and the other Senators on the \nfloor and people on the other side of the aisle. I think one thing I \ncan say is that, on this issue and candidly on every issue, I have no \ndesire to message. I want to solve this problem as you do. I know you \nhave been a leader on this fiscal issue, as have Senators Isakson and \nBarrasso and others.\n  I want us to solve this problem. I think if you have not even had a \nhearing yet on the budget, it is likely that we will not have a budget \nthis year, which is pretty amazing. So what I am trying to do is put in \nplace something called the CAP Act. I have worked with a number of \nSenators on that, where what we will do is take where we are spending, \nour national spending relative to our economy, and we will take it down \nto the 40-year average of 20.6 percent in the post-entitlement period.\n  If we do that, we can save our country 7.6 versus existing policy \nover the next decade, which goes a long way toward solving the problem. \nIt totally reverses the amount of indebtedness we are accumulating as a \ncountry. So I am working--since I do not think we are going to have a \nbudget, which is pretty amazing--working on another route so we \nactually know where we are going.\n  Generally to the American people, they have to watch us and think, \nwhat in the world is going on in this dysfunctional body. We have got \n$3.7 trillion being spent, $2.2 trillion coming in. There is no plan \nwhatsoever to deal with that. We are going to have to create other \nvehicles to deal with that. So I am generally working with people on \nboth sides of the aisle to come to that end.\n  I thank the Senator for his efforts on the budget, but I will say to \nyou and say to the American people, as I have said many times, I have \nnever been in a place that is more dysfunctional. No matter what the \nAmerican people think about the way we handle their money, I promise \nyou it is even worse. And I do hope--I am glad the President, by the \nway, is going to address this issue at 1:35 today. I know that Paul \nRyan has put forth a budget which is a roadmap, and I appreciate so \nmuch his effort.\n  But as a country, I think we all know we have to deal with this issue \nin a serious way. Spending is at all-time highs. We have not been here \nsince 1945, on Federal spending relative to our economy. I know others \nwant to speak and have other appointments and I will stop. I thank the \nSenator for his leadership. This is the No. 1 issue for Americans. It \nthreatens our national security. It threatens our economic security. \nAnd between now and the time we vote on the debt ceiling increase, it \nis my hope we will solve this problem and move into a different \ndirection.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator for his work. I think the \nlegislative statutory cap on spending is something I have worked with \nSenator McCaskill on, you have worked with her on, and has potential to \nhelp us deal with the crisis we are in.\n  I will agree with the Senator, and I truly feel the American people \nhave a right to be angry with Congress, because Congress has run up the \nlargest deficits in history. We are on a trajectory that every witness \nwe have had before the Budget Committee, and some fabulous witnesses \noutside of the government, all say it is an unsustainable path that \nplaces our Nation at risk. We have no real plan to deal with it. We \nshould never have been in such a deep hole. So I think people have a \nright to be upset with us.\n  Senator Isakson, I know, is one of Georgia's most successful and \neffective businessmen. He has been involved in running the Education \nDepartment in the State of Georgia. I guess I would ask the Senator as \na businessman, and as an American citizen, how do you feel about where \nwe are? Do you think we are in a serious crisis that requires us to \nalter our business-as-usual approach, do we have to take tough \ndecisions, or is it something we sort of hold off and maybe things will \nget better in the future?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank the Senator from Alabama for the question. I \nwill tell you this, I was in the real estate business for 33 years. \nLeverage is essential in real estate. You have to borrow money and put \nin equity as well to make a real estate transaction work. You cannot \njust do it for all cash. But too much leverage will destroy you. \nAmerica has just been through a period where many American homeowners \nwere destroyed by too much leverage. They borrowed more than they could \nafford to pay in order to borrow for a house.\n  The United States of America is at the point where we have too much \nleverage. We have too much debt. Our deficit continues to escalate, \nadding to that debt. I tried to think--when I thought about what I \nwould say this morning, I did not know you would ask the questions you \nasked. But it is appropriate that you did.\n  I was trying to think of an example we could put forward of a leader \nin the private sector who addressed a tremendous problem America faced \nand solved it. You know who that leader was? Lee Iacocca. I do not know \nhow many of you will remember it, but in the 1970s Chrysler was busted. \nThe cars did not work, people did not buy them, they were going broke, \nthey had too much debt. They hired a guy named Lee Iacocca, brought him \nup from the ranks and said: Lee, we need to fix this company or we are \ngoing broke. Lee Iacocca as a leader put everything on the table: \nbenefits, how they made their cars, discipline, rules, everything. He \nbrought everybody to the table, the labor unions, the workers, the \nadvisers, the economists, and the board of directors.\n  He said: Look, we do not even care who takes credit, we need to fix \nthe Chrysler Motor Corporation. In a short period of time, Chrysler \nwent from the worst rated consumer satisfaction to the best. They \nraised the guarantee on their product. They reduced their debt by \nefficiencies, and they became the most productive automaker of their \ntime in the 1970s.\n  America has the ability to return to our productive times but only \nthrough leadership. I am looking forward to the President's remarks \ntoday. I hope he will be a Lee Iacocca. I hope he will not take things \noff the table. I hope he will not play politics with where we go. All \nof us have to decide to put everything on the table and make sure we \nprioritize America's future and get our debt and deficit under control.\n  I just had the Georgia Hospital Association leave my office. I will \ntell you the last thing I told them. They were talking about, please \nmake sure we do not cut this, that, and the other. I said: You know, \nmedicine is 17 percent of gross domestic product, but it is about 80 \npercent of our challenge in terms of Medicare and Medicaid with the \nfuture years of the debt and the deficit. We are going to have to put \neverything on the table. We are going to have to make sure we rein in \nour expenses while not destroying 17 percent of the private sector.\n  Quite frankly, I fear the health care bill that passed in December of \n2009, and was signed last year in March, is a bill that is overly \nprescriptive, overly regulatory, and disincentivizes competition in \nterms of health care.\n  I hope the President will be open to suggestions in terms of bringing \nabout\n\n[[Page S2415]]\n\ncompetition, making our citizens consumers, making sure we are price \ncompetitive in the delivery of the best health care in the world, not a \ngovernment that tries to manage everything and be so prescriptive.\n  Yes, we have a problem, but we are a great country where Republicans \nand Democrats need to sit down at their kitchen table like the American \npeople and make decisions that are in the best interest of their \nfuture.\n  I commend Senator Corker on the CAP Act. It is the right way to go. I \nalso want to bring up the biennial budget. I know the Senator from \nAlabama is the ranking member of the Budget Committee, and I have \ntalked to Chairman Conrad about this. We have an example that works, \nand that is to change the way we do our business.\n  In the last 3 years we have had 4 hours of debate on spending $10 \ntrillion. That is not the way to run a railroad. We need to change our \nprocess from an annual appropriation to a biennial appropriation where \nwe appropriate money in odd-numbered years and we spend in even-\nnumbered years, which are election years, looking for savings and waste \nand reprioritizing the way we spend money.\n  I know this must be true for the Budget Committee, and I know myself, \nif I am given the time and the task of finding savings or \noverexpenditures, if I am given the charge of doing so, I can do it. \nBut if I am told to come in January, raise my right hand, and then by \nOctober pass as much spending as I can, I will spend too much money. It \nis human nature.\n  The American people ask of us only to do what they have to do. They \ndon't have the luxury of too much leverage. If they borrow too much, \nthey go bankrupt. We need to empower the American people by the \nCongress doing what the American people have to do.\n  The biennial budget, the CAP Act, and then Senator Hatch, with a \nnumber of Senators in this body, have introduced the balanced budget \namendment--those are three components that change the paradigm, the \nprocess, and I guarantee will change the result.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I couldn't agree more. I have been a long supporter of \nthe biennial 2-year budget. I do believe it can work. It has a large \namount of bipartisan support in the Congress. It can help us. I see \nSenators Blunt and Barrasso. I believe Senator Blunt was here first. He \nhas been involved in the leadership of the House of Representatives for \nmany years. He is already showing himself to be a very wise and \nvaluable contributor to our debate.\n  First, I would like to ask him, does he think the American people \nhave a right to be unhappy with their leadership when they wake up and \nfind that we have had $1 trillion deficits for 3 years in a row and \nwill virtually average a $1 trillion deficit for the next 10 years and \nthere is no plan in the Senate except the President's budget that he \nsubmitted to us, that has the deficits increasing in years 7, 8, 9, 10 \nto $1.2 trillion in the tenth year? Is this an unsustainable path? \nDon't the American people have a right to be upset with us and demand \nthat we stop business as usual?\n  Mr. BLUNT. I thank the Senator. Of course, they have every right to \nbe mad. They have every right to be as frustrated as we are that the \nwork in which the Senator from Alabama is so involved as the leading \nRepublican on the Budget Committee hasn't been able to produce a \nresult. We are unlikely to have a budget again this year.\n  I was just asked by a reporter walking over here--and, yes, I was in \nthe House for some time before I came to the Senate--for somebody like \nyou who has been in Washington, wasn't the tea party a big challenge?\n  I said: No, the tea party was not a big challenge. They were a great \nopportunity for us to have someone out there talking about getting this \nspending under control. And I listed the struggle we were involved in \nbefore Senator Barrasso got to the Senate, where we actually took on \nentitlement spending in 2005. As I recall that effort, I got lots of \ncalls on entitlement spending reforms, where we cut entitlement \nspending the only time in a decade by $40 billion. I got lots of calls, \nand not one of them was supportive of cutting spending. As far as I \nknow, every phone I had rang everywhere I had a phone for 100 days, as \nfar as I know, all the time. No matter how early we came in or how late \nwe were leaving, those phones were all ringing. Every call was: Don't \ncut my program.\n  As Senator Isakson said, as he was talking to the friends we are \nseeing today from hospitals around the country, the ones from Georgia, \nwe have to look at everything. We have to look at ways to produce \nbetter results. The government is the last place left in America--and \nthis relates to government at almost every level and almost every \ngovernment at every level--where we measure how much we care about \nsomething based on how much we spend on it instead of the results we \nget.\n  Everybody else, 20 years ago, made the decision if they were going to \nbe competitive they had to produce a better product, a better result, \nand spend less money producing that better result. Only the government \nstill thinks the other way--and we do this without a plan, apparently. \nThe Senator can correct me if I am wrong because the Senator is a \nstudent of the budget in ways that are not exceeded by anybody in the \nSenate, but we are still trying to finish last year's work. I think it \nis the only time in the history of the Budget Act where neither House \nof the Congress passed a budget. There have been times when both of \nthem passed them and couldn't agree. There have probably been times \nwhen somebody didn't pass one but never a time when nobody passed a \nbudget. Nobody passed a single one of the 12 appropriations bills it \ntakes to run the government. How irresponsible can we be?\n  Now we have this situation where we are spending so much more money \nthan we are taking in, and the numbers are so big it is hard to be as \nafraid of them as we should because who knows how much money $3.8 \ntrillion is. It is not just Senators and House Members; I don't think \nthe Secretary of the Treasury really knows how much money that is. But \nwe are spending way more than we are taking in.\n  Have we ever had a time before when neither House of the Congress \npassed a budget?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am not aware of it. We are now 715 days without a \nbudget. This is particularly problematic since we are facing such an \nacknowledged debt crisis. The Secretary of the Treasury Geithner came \nbefore the Budget Committee. I asked him a number of questions. I asked \nhim about the Rogoff and Reinhart study that says when our debt reaches \nover 90 percent of our economy, 90 percent of GDP, it causes the \neconomy to slow down, be dragged down by that debt 1 percent of GDP. So \nif it was going to increase it 3 percent, it would increase it 2; and \nthis amounts to, another study says, 1 million jobs. One percent of GDP \ngrowth is 1 million new jobs added. So it is very serious.\n  I asked him was that true. By the way, I think my colleagues are \naware that we are past 95 percent of GDP today. We are over the 90 \npercent mark, and by September 30, we are projected to be 100 percent. \nSo we are well above the number. The true number is not the public debt \nbut the gross debt, and the gross debt would be 100 percent by the end \nof September.\n  Mr. Geithner said, yes, he agrees with the study that shows it pulls \ndown the growth, and added: It is in many ways more serious than that \nbecause it could lead to a debt crisis, the kind of thing Erskine \nBowles, the President's choice to head the debt commission, has warned \ncould happen. We have a responsibility to lead the Nation that avoids \nus undertaking a crisis that we can see coming. We have a clear and \npresent danger to the American Republic, this debt.\n  Mr. Bowles, a businessman, President Clinton's Chief of Staff, the \nchoice to head the debt commission by President Obama, told us we are \nfacing the most predictable debt crisis in our history, and it could \nhappen within 2 years. I think this is really serious.\n  We have to change business. I think the momentum from the American \npeople in this past election was basically a statement saying, we don't \nknow what the problem is; it is all convoluted. But I believe as the \nSenator indicated at the beginning, the American people have a right to \nsay: Get it together and fix this problem.\n  Mr. BLUNT. If the Senator will yield for another moment, while we \nhave a hard time dealing with these big numbers--and I think they \napproach now\n\n[[Page S2416]]\n\n$3.8 trillion in spending and $2.2 trillion in money coming in--we are \nadding $4 billion a day. We are borrowing $4 billion a day. So in the \ntime we had a continuing resolution for 10 days to try to decide how we \ncut spending, we borrowed more money in that 10 days than we saved.\n  Then people said: That is Draconian. It is terrible. We can't spend \nthis much money and continue to do it.\n  If your family was bringing in $22,000 a year and spending $38,000 a \nyear, and you had already borrowed way more money than any bank should \nlend you, as you just suggested, you would know that was a problem you \ncouldn't sustain very long. If your business was bringing in $2.2 \nmillion a year and spending $3.8 million a year, you would know you are \nnot going to be in business very long. Those are the kinds of real-\nworld situations we have multiplied by thousands of times, but it has \nto be solved. The blueprint to solve that is the budget. We don't have \none.\n  The Senator's responsibility for the country is to be in that budget \nfight. I know the Senator is there. I know he is frustrated we don't \nhave a blueprint, but we need a blueprint. Then we need to spend lots \nof time on this floor and in committees figuring out how we produce a \nbetter result and spend less money and what the Federal Government is \ndoing that just simply isn't well done, and shouldn't be done, and \nconstitutionally there is no authorization to do and stop doing that.\n  I am pleased to be in this fight with the Senator from Alabama and \nwith the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It is a very serious crisis. The President submitted a \nbudget to the Congress 2 months ago. I am hoping and expect that if he \nmakes big changes in his plan for the future, we will see that in real \nnumbers and not just a vague vision. A vision gets too close to being a \ndream. It gets too close to being of vapors. We are in a real situation \nwith real money.\n  I have been a very aggressive critic of the President's budget. I \nbelieve it is the most irresponsible budget ever presented to Congress. \nWe are facing a systemic, deep, long-term crisis. Everybody knows it. \nHis budget raised taxes $1.7 trillion. His spending was even more. In \nthe net projection over 10 years, he would increase the debt of America \n$3 trillion more than the current trend we are on. Instead of taking us \noff the trend, it accelerates the trend. It was a stunning development.\n  For example, at a time when inflation is 2 percent or so--according \nto the experts, at least, low inflation--he is proposing in his budget \nthat the State Department have a 10.5-percent increase, an 11-percent \nincrease for education, a 9.5-percent increase for the Energy \nDepartment, and a 60-percent increase in the Transportation Department \nto fund high-speed rail with no money to back that up. It is stunning \nto me that we could have those kinds of increases proposed in a formal \nwritten document--four volumes--that the President is required to \nsubmit that I have on my desk back in the office. And he makes no \nprojections in that document to change any of the unsustainable \nproblems we have with Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid--zero reform.\n\n  I understand he may talk about that this afternoon. I hope he will. \nBut I believe he should go further--if he is going to propose changes--\nin that we need a new budget. We need to see what the numbers are. That \nis what Congressman Ryan and the House Republican Budget Committee have \ndone. They have produced a real budget that can be analyzed and scored, \nas we call it, by the Congressional Budget Office.\n  If he is going to make changes in his plans for the future, I truly \nbelieve the President should talk more than about vision and dreams for \nthe future but give us real numbers.\n  Senator Barrasso, an orthopedic surgeon, has served in the \nlegislature in Wyoming and has been a tremendous advocate on many \nissues, none more important than the health care debate we had.\n  I say to Senator Barrasso, as someone who has not been too long in \nWashington and has already been elected to the leadership in the \nRepublican Party--well deserved as a result of your proven acts--how do \nyou feel we are handling the American people's money? What thoughts \ndoes the Senator have?\n  (Mr. FRANKEN assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Well, it is my impression that in so many ways \nWashington gets it wrong. The Senator is correct. I appreciate his \nleadership.\n  I did have the opportunity to serve in our State legislature in \nWyoming for 5 years. The constitution in Wyoming says you have to \nbalance your budget every year.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, did you do that?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. We balanced our budget every year, just like the \nfamilies in Alabama or Wyoming have to balance their budget every year \nand have to live within their means. That is what we do. You take a \nlook at the revenue, and then you do not spend any more than that. You \nlive within your means. That is what families do. It is what the State \ndoes. That is why I was so proud to stand with the Senator as one of \nthe cosponsors of the balanced budget amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution. I think this country has to balance its budget and do it \nevery year.\n  The President's spokesman yesterday--kind of the word of the day at \nthe White House seemed to be ``vision.'' He kept saying the President \nis going to give his ``vision.'' The day before, the word was \n``balance.'' In his press conference, he kept saying the word \n``balance.'' I would like to hear a vision that we have to balance the \nbudget of the United States. That is what I want to hear from the \nPresident today when he gives his speech at 1:30 this afternoon. I do \nnot want to hear some recycled speech about, well, raise taxes, but \nthat is what I am anticipating from the President.\n  I have talked to people in Wyoming after church on Sunday morning, \nand they have seen you, I say to the Senator, on Sunday morning talk \nshows--I think last week with Bob Schieffer; ``Meet the Press'' the \nweek before that.\n  They say: Do you know that Senator?\n  I say: Yes, I do.\n  They say: Well, he makes us proud because he talks about the kinds of \nvalues we have--living within our means, balancing our budgets, not \nleaving our children or our grandchildren with mountains of debt.\n  They agree with the Senator when he makes his statement about--I \nthink the Senator quoted someone from the budget commission about this \nis a predictable crisis that is coming.\n  Mike Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, said the greatest \nthreat to our Nation's security is the debt. And look how much we owe \nto foreign countries, significant amounts to China. You cannot continue \nto be a great nation with a debt like that to foreign countries, often \nmoneys owed to people who are not our friends, who do not necessarily \nhave our own best interest at heart.\n  So it is incumbent upon us as a nation to get this spending under \ncontrol. That is what I see as the main issue. Hearing Senator Isakson \non the floor and Senator Blunt and others talking about this, it is why \nall 47 Republican Senators together unanimously endorsed the idea and \ncosponsored a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, because we \nknow that is the responsible thing to do.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I agree with the Senator, that is common sense.\n  Alabama Governor Dr. Bentley, a fine physician, announced that we are \ngoing to have to cut through the rest of the year in the discretionary \nspending 15 percent because we have a constitutional amendment that \nsays the budget has to be balanced. Of course, we do not have that in \nWashington. But what would the Senator say if someone--the American \npeople--asked you: Well, Senator, I hear the President is proposing an \n11-percent increase in education, a 10-percent increase in the Energy \nDepartment, a 10-percent increase in the State Department, $60 billion \nfor the Transportation Department, at a time when we are going broke \nand spending money the likes of which we ought never to have spent \nbefore? How would the people in Wyoming react to that?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Well, they would want to know if whoever would say such \na thing was actually still connected to the reality of the real world \nand trying to live within our means. You cannot do that. You cannot do \nthat for very long at all.\n  When you look at the President's budget, when you look at the \nspending that has come out of this administration and you look at the \ndebt our country has accumulated since the time\n\n[[Page S2417]]\n\nGeorge Washington became President, what you see is that from the time \nGeorge Washington became President until the time George W. Bush left \nthe White House, this President, through his spending and his budgets, \nhas doubled the national debt in 5 years and tripling it in 10. That is \nwhat this budget he had submitted to the Congress just not that long \nago--a couple months ago--has done.\n  Now we are going to hear a new--I am not sure what we are going to \nhear today. Are we going to hear him standing behind the budget? The \nPresident put together a debt commission to take a look at this. I am \nstill not sure where he stands on his own commission--the President's \nown commission--what his position is on that, because they have taken \nsome strong positions, where he is in relationship to the reality we \nare facing today with this predictable crisis coming. So it will be \ninteresting to hear what the President says this afternoon and what his \nnew vision might be.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think that is right. We are talking about, is this a \nhuge reversal from what we got just 2 months ago because it did not \naddress Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security that now we hear he might \nbe addressing.\n  The Senator mentioned the debt commission. They spent most of the \nlast year studying and hearing experts, becoming exceedingly concerned \nabout the future. Mr. Erskine Bowles, who was chosen by President Obama \nto head that commission, when he first saw the President's budget, \nsaid: It is nowhere near what is necessary to avoid a fiscal nightmare.\n  This is really serious. The budget the President submitted here was \nrejected by his own Chairman, saying: It is nowhere near what is \nnecessary to avoid a fiscal nightmare. Since then, he has followed up \nto say: This is the most predictable crisis the Nation has ever faced. \nHe said: Not just for our grandchildren, it could impact us now.\n  So I ask the Senator: Don't you think, if the President is going to \nmake a speech and announce a change in his policy, he should--as the \nHouse budget people have done--submit a budget to the Congress that can \nbe analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office, scored, and we can \nactually use it as part of the discussion about how to bring debt under \ncontrol?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. My impression is that he should have a responsibility \nto do that and do it for Congress.\n\n  Last week, there was going to be a major speech--last week or the \nweek before--on energy at a local university. He went and made a speech \non energy, and the headline was that it was the same old speech on the \nsame old issues, and very little new was there. So the concern today \nis, we are not hearing anything in front of Congress. It is a speech at \na local university. I am hoping to hear what a real vision is. What is \nthe roadmap and the specifics?\n  The other Chairman of the debt commission--you mentioned Erskine \nBowles--the other was Senator Al Simpson from Wyoming. He was quoted \ntoday to say: We need specifics. If the President just talks in \ngeneralities, that is not going to go very far.\n  I think specifics is what the Senator just outlined. As the ranking \nmember of the Budget Committee, you would actually like to see numbers \non a piece of paper that can be scored, and we can go look through it \nand say: Will this work? Will this not work? How do the numbers add up? \nLet's get into the specific details because that is what we are looking \nat. When you have a nation that is spending $3.8 trillion or $3.7 \ntrillion and only bringing in $2.2 trillion, the problem is we are \nspending too much.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Absolutely. I just have to say, let's be frank about \nit. We had one budget submitted to both Houses of Congress from the \nPresident just 2 months ago, and it was very irresponsible and has \ngotten no support that I can see anywhere. But the House is on track, \nit looks like, to pass a budget this week that will be forward-looking \nand substantive and alter the debt trajectory we are on, put us on a \npath to prosperity, because the biggest and really, to me, only real \nthreat to our economic vitality and our ability to bounce back from \nthis recession is the debt we are carrying.\n  But I have to acknowledge the Senator's former colleague, Senator \nSimpson, and Erskine Bowles said this about Paul Ryan's proposed budget \nin the House: that it is ``a serious, honest, straightforward approach \nto addressing our nation's enormous fiscal challenges''--our ``enormous \nfiscal challenges.''\n  All right. They go on to say this, and I think it is relevant, as the \nSenator suggested, to the President's speech this afternoon. They go on \nto say: Going forward, anyone who issues an alternative plan to \nChairman Ryan's should be held to the same standard when offering their \nown solutions. We simply cannot back away from these issues.\n  I know that is a firm, strong statement. I know it is probably \ndifferent from what we are going to hear from the President, which is \n``speech'' and ``vision'' and ``hopes.'' But doesn't the Senator think \nwe do have a right? Aren't they correct--this bipartisan commission, \nappointed by the President--aren't these leaders correct to say: We \nexpect you, Mr. President, to fulfill your statutory duty to submit a \nreal budget, and if you have changed it from the one you submitted \nearlier, submit us a new budget.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I think that would be the only responsible thing to do \nbecause right now the Congress is dealing with the budget that was \nsubmitted a couple months ago. That is the confines in which we are \nworking. So it will be interesting to hear what the President says a \nlittle further down the line from now.\n  I see Senator Coats from Indiana is joining us on the floor. He knows \nthat in Indiana, families who are trying to live within their means and \nmake ends meet and paying more for gasoline now due to the President's \nenergy policies--about $700 more per family a year for gasoline. If \nthey are trying to deal with bills and the mortgage and kids, it makes \nit that much harder. So families get it. Families know what happens \nwhen there is a squeeze, and they cut back on their spending for other \nthings. That is what this country needs to do right now. That is what \nwe need to do as a nation.\n  I am so glad Senator Coats has returned to the Senate because he had \nbeen here previously and has now returned to join us to give us some of \nhis sage advice and recommendations, and it is really wonderful to work \nwith him.\n  I say to the Senator from Alabama, I know you welcome him as well. \nBut with that, let me say thank you so much for your leadership. As I \ntold the Senator, the people of Wyoming after church say: Do you know \nthat guy who was on television this morning? He sure did express the \nvalues we all have.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think the American people get it. I think the \nAmerican people understand that the driving issue of our time is the \ndebt that threatens every good and hopeful wish we have for the future \nof our country.\n  Senator Coats, who is one of our finest Members of the Senate--he \nleft us, served as Ambassador to Germany, spent a number of years in \nEurope, and then came back and has been reelected.\n  Let me ask him, fundamentally, this question. Pete Domenici--you \nserved with Pete--served with a Democratic wise lady, Alice Rivlin, on \nanother debt commission. He testified before the Budget Committee \nrecently: I have never feared more for my country. That was a deep, \npersonal statement from Pete Domenici, who chaired the Budget Committee \nin the Senate previously. I ask the Senator, what are you hearing from \nyour constituents, and what is your belief at this time in history \nabout the dangers we face?\n  Mr. COATS. Well, it is interesting that the Senator asks that \nquestion because I just left my office and a meeting with Pete Domenici \nliterally 15 minute ago.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Really?\n  Mr. COATS. Because he came in to express that same urgency and \nburden. As former chairman of the Budget Committee here for so many \nyears, he certainly understands the current fiscal situation. His views \necho the voices and views of people across this country--from \neconomists, whether they are liberal or conservative, whether they are \nfrom Harvard or Indiana University, the whole spectrum--saying this is \nan emergency, this is an urgent fiscal crisis we face. The time to \naddress this crisis is now, not later. This has to rise above political \nconsiderations for 2012 because our country is on the precipice, and \nunless action is taken now, it may very well be too late.\n\n[[Page S2418]]\n\n  We have had a number of these sessions as a caucus, and we have even \nhad some meetings with our colleagues from the other party, where \nexperts have come before us--again, not carrying any kind of \nideological bent on this thing but basically saying: Look at the \nnumbers. Do the math. By the way, it is not calculus, it is third grade \nmath. When we spend $3.7 trillion and our revenues are only $2.2 \ntrillion, we have a huge $1.5 trillion deficit, and this has happened \nyear after year after year. Cumulatively, we are well over $4 trillion \nin debt over just the last 3 years, and this is going to skyrocket from \nhere. So it is not as if we are at the peak. With the aging population \nand the increase in mandatory spending coming down faster than we can \ndeal with it, we are in a dire situation.\n  Here is the reason I came back to the Senate. People ask all the \ntime: Why in the world, after a lot of years of service in the House of \nRepresentatives and in the Senate, as an ambassador overseas--you are \nof retirement age--why don't you enjoy the fruits of your labors? Why \nwould you want to throw yourself back into the arena, particularly at \nsuch a critical time when the decisions you are going to have to make \nare not going to always be popular and when the requirements of what we \nare going to have to engage in to do what we need to do are going to be \nvery demanding? The answer is, for the sole reason that I also have \nthis great fear within me that we are seeing a country that has been \nthe most prosperous free country in the history of civilization about \nto unwind. We have spent ourselves into a situation where we are \nliterally at the crisis point.\n  So I came back for one primary reason. As much as I enjoy seeing my \nformer colleagues and being in the business of being a Senator and \nrepresenting the people of Indiana, I came for one reason only; that \nis, I have such a concern about the future of this country. I have \nthree children and eight grandchildren now, another one just born \nrecently. But it is not just my grandchildren, it is America's \ngrandchildren and America's children whom we are loading debt onto that \nthey are not going to be able to dig out of. It is going to deny them \nthe opportunities we have had in our generation--to save money so we \ncan go to college and get a good education, so we can get married and \nhave a family and afford to buy a home, so we can enjoy the \nopportunities that freedom and prosperity have brought to us as a \nnation.\n  It not only affects us domestically, but it affects our role on the \ninternational scene. Already, NATO is saying we can't do this alone in \nLibya. We need America. I am not getting into the issue of whether we \nshould be engaged in Libya. That is not the point. The point is that be \nit a tsunami or a nuclear accident or a flood or a disaster anyplace in \nthe world, who is the first to show up and the only one with the \ncapacity to deal with it? The United States--the U.S. Navy, the U.S. \nMarines, U.S. troops not carrying guns but carrying water, carrying \nfood, bringing aid, first aid ships. Whom does the world turn to in \ntimes of distress and disaster? It is America. America has been a \ngenerous nation because we have had the capacity to be a generous \nnation. All of that is at risk. So whether it is domestic or whether it \nis international, we are at risk.\n  We know we cannot solve this problem unless we can work together. We \ndon't control two of the three thirds of government. We control the \nHouse of Representatives, and we have seen what Paul Ryan and others \nhave done there, including John Boehner, to get us started on this \nprocess of what we need to do. But we have not done that yet in the \nSenate. We are trying to work with our colleague so we can. But in the \nend, if the President of the United States does not engage in this \neffort, we will not succeed. We can talk all we want. We can present \nall the plans we want, but until the President gets engaged, we are not \ngoing to succeed because he is the one who ultimately has to sign this \nbill. He is the one who ultimately has to sign off on it.\n  Currently, and for the last 3 months, he has been totally AWOL, off \ndoing other things, at a time while the house is burning down. I am \nhopeful that, in just 1 hour and 10 minutes or so, the President will \ncome forward not with nice phrases, not with generalities, not with \nfluff that we heard in the State of the Union Address--some nice \nsounding things but no backup--but with specifics: Here is what his \nplan is. I hope what I hear from him is: I, the President of the United \nStates, Barack Obama, want to sit down and get in the arena with \nRepublicans and Democrats in the House and in the Senate and work \ntogether to avoid this potential crisis; and I agree this is not \nsomething we can do in 2013. This is not something we can play politics \nwith. This is not something we can defer. We must do it now.\n  I believe the American people--I can speak for Hoosiers in Indiana; I \ncan't speak for other States, but I believe the people in Indiana, and \nI think this is true across America--understand this better than a lot \nof the politicians do. They understand this because they are part of \nfamilies that have to meet budgets. They are businesses that have to \nput the payroll to pay their employees. They cannot allow themselves to \nget so drastically in debt that they are not going to be able to \nrecover. So they are asking us to take leadership, to step up and do \nit, make decisions not for one's personal political future but for the \nfuture of America. The President needs to join us in that effort.\n  I am hoping and praying that in 1 hour and 10 minutes, as the \nPresident finally presents to the country, he will do two things. No. 1 \nis to say: I am ready to engage and engage fully because this is the \nNo. 1 issue facing the future of America. All is on the line. No. 2, \nhere are my specifics in terms of what I will support or what I will \nwork with. I hope he will say, as we have said: This isn't set in \nconcrete. Let's work together to see what works and what will address \nthe crisis we are facing.\n  So I thank the Senator for his leadership as head of the Republican \ncaucus on the budget side. He has been out front. The Senator from \nAlabama has been out front from day one. I thank my colleague, Senator \nIsakson, whom I think will engage here next, as well as Senator \nBarrasso, who said some nice words about me. But I think we are here \nfor one reason and one reason only; that is, America is in trouble and \nwe need to step up and do what we can, everything we can, to get us \nback on a path to fiscal health. It will not happen overnight, but if \nwe can certify that we have a plan in place and that we are going to \nstick with it, we can save this situation and turn it around.\n  So I thank the Senator for his time and for allowing me to get in my \n2 cents' worth. I am here to make the tough decisions and for no other \nreason.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Indiana. I \nguess I have been critical of the President. Many people say it is \npolitical. I feel as though any President should look the American \npeople in the eye at this point in history. I called on him before the \nState of the Union Address, over 2 months ago now, that he should tell \nthe American people we are in this financial crisis, and that--the \nreason we are talking about reducing spending is because we have no \nchoice. We can't spend $3.7 trillion and take in $2.2 trillion. We \ncannot sustain the debt course we are on, as every witness, Republican \nand Democratic, has told us. But I do believe it is a responsibility \nfor the President of the United States, who can see this clear and \npresent danger to our future, to at least join in and say we have to do \nsomething about it. He didn't do that at the State of the Union. He \nhasn't done it since. So maybe today that will be a big change, if we \nget that.\n  I do believe the Senator from Indiana is exactly right. He has the \nresponsibility under the Budget Act to send us a responsible budget \nthat changes what we are doing and puts us on the right track. If he \nwants to do it all by even more tax increases than he submitted \nalready, which was $1.7 trillion in his budget proposal, so be it. Put \nit out there. Let's talk about it. But don't deny we are in a crisis.\n  Senator Isakson understands finance better than anybody in this \nSenate. He lived through and provided leadership during the huge \nfinancial crisis. It looks as though we have moved debt from the \nprivate sector to the sovereign government sector, and that is why we \nare being warned we could have a similar type crisis, which is what I\n\n[[Page S2419]]\n\nunderstand Secretary Geithner to have meant and Erskine Bowles and Alan \nSimpson to have meant.\n  I thank the Senator from Georgia for his leadership. I know he wants \nnothing more than what is best for America. I would be glad to have the \nSenator share his thoughts at this time.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I appreciate the compliment. It is \nprobably overstated, but it is an honor and a privilege to serve with \nSenator Sessions as well as with Senator Coats.\n  I wish to reflect on something we shared this morning. Senator Coats \nand myself and others were with Senator Akaka for breakfast this \nmorning. He talked about 1941, living on Hawaii, the youngest of eight \nchildren. The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and America went to war in \nthe Pacific and in Europe. Sixteen million Americans of that generation \nwent to the Pacific and Europe, fought and died. Some came back to this \ncountry and, because of the GI bill, 8 million of them went to \nuniversities and got bachelor's degrees and started the small \nbusinesses and the industries that took the U.S. economy to dynamic \ngrowth and opportunity for every generation that has succeeded them, up \nuntil now.\n\n  Senator Sessions and I and Senator Coats and Senator Akaka, who is a \ngreat American, a Democratic Senator from Hawaii who is retiring next \nyear, we are all part of a generation that will, at some time, leave a \nlegacy to our children and our grandchildren. The Senator from Alabama \nhas children and grandchildren, I have them, and Senator Coats does as \nwell. I don't want to be the first generation since World War II to \nleave my children and my grandchildren worse off than every generation \nbefore left their children and grandchildren.\n  This economic war we have on spending and debt is every bit as \ndamaging as a war with bullets and bombs. Because with too much \nleverage, with an inability to pay our debt, we have what happened to \nus once before in the last 65 years, and that was the early 1980s when \nwe had the misery index: double-digit unemployment, double-digit \ninterest rates, double-digit inflation. I remember the days when I ran \nmy business when the prime rate was 21 percent. I remember when \nunemployment was 14 percent and inflation was 12 percent. It was called \nthe misery index. What happened is, America started borrowing too much, \nspending too much, and business contracted.\n  We need to make sure we don't let that happen again because the \ngreatest economic threats to the security of America are runaway \ninterest rates, runaway inflation, and runaway unemployment. We don't \nwant to be the cause of that. We want to be the platform that allows \nfree enterprise and American business to come back, the American \neconomy to come back, reduce our deficit over time, and reduce our debt \nover time. We don't have to pay it all off, but we have to stop the \nincrease. We have to begin to get back in order so we are not an \noverleveraged Nation.\n  I pledge this, as Senator Coats did, and I know the Senator from \nAlabama did as well: I will not leave my grandchildren and my children \nworse off than I was left by my parents and my grandparents. We have \nthe greatest Nation on the face of this Earth. Democrats and \nRepublicans, the President, Congressmen, and Senators need to sit down \nat the American kitchen table and do what we have asked of the American \npeople: get our spending in order and look to a brighter, more \nprosperous future for those who will succeed us.\n  I thank my colleague for the time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, let me ask the Senator one more \nquestion. Let's take the Ryan budget. I think it is far more realistic. \nIt is the one that is, as was referred to by Erskine Bowles and Alan \nSimpson, a serious, honest, straightforward approach to addressing our \nNation's enormous fiscal challenges. It is long term. It deals with \nMedicare, Social Security, discretionary spending.\n  I am optimistic about the future. If we were to put ourselves on that \ncourse and send the word to the American people, the American business \ncommunity, the world financial community that we have gotten our house \nin order, is that the kind of budget that could unleash growth that we \nhaven't seen in years now?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Well, it is, because it will instill a degree of \nconfidence that we have finally been willing to deal with our long-term \nproblem of debt and deficit, with our entitlements but also with our \nspending.\n  But I want to refer back to a statement the Senator made in his \nprevious remarks before he recognized me, when he was challenging the \nPresident to bring forward a budget in this speech he will make in an \nhour or so. He should bring it and put it on the table, along with \nputting Paul Ryan's recommendations on the table, putting the deficit \ncommission's recommendations on the table, and putting the group of six \nwho are working on another document on the table--let's don't rule \nanybody out--and sit down and one by one go through them and find out \nwhat is the best answer and the solution for America.\n  It is time to stop the political job of picking and choosing for \npolitical purposes. We need to pick and choose for the American people. \nIf we put everybody's ideas on the table, and they are genuine about \ntheir interests to solve the problem, we can do it, and we can begin \nthis afternoon.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think the most important thing--and I don't want to \nbe too negative--is to tell the American people the truth that every \nexpert we have asked has said you could have a crisis sooner than you \nthink. We should avoid that.\n  Congress and the President should acknowledge it and say that we \nunderstand it and we are going to take steps to avoid it. But I have a \nsense that the United States is still a productive nation. The Senator \nfrom Georgia is attuned to the business community in Atlanta. They are \nstill willing to work hard and invest and take risks to be more \nproductive and create jobs. But this confidence the Senator mentioned--\nif we restore that confidence, is the Senator optimistic we can bounce \nback?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Absolutely. With all due respect, I think the last \ncouple years the government has tried to eliminate risk with \noverregulation of almost everything. If you eliminate risk, nobody gets \nout of bed in the morning and figures they are protected. We need to \nmitigate this and allow people to take a risk in order to get a reward. \nWe can give them a platform of confidence and predictability so they \nwill deploy capital, invest money, and employ people. The interesting \npoint is, the byproduct of that is you have higher revenues. When you \nhave a productive America on a progressive tax system, you get higher \nrevenues. If people are more satisfied, they are more happy and more \nproductive. There is less productivity when there is overregulation and \nunderconfidence. We need to restore the confidence and have fair but \nequitable regulations and we need to empower the American investor to \ninvest their capital and we will improve employment, improve revenue, \nand improve the future of the United States.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, our country requires us to stand and be counted. \n``Nothing comes from nothing,'' as Julie Andrews sang in that wonderful \nsong. Things have to be paid for. When you borrow money, you pay \ninterest on it. Interest under the budget the President has sent to us \nlast year was $200 billion--$207 billion, I think. In the 10th year, \nthat budget, as scored by the CBO, is imposing on the American economy \na $940 billion, 1-year interest payment. I know the Senator is familiar \nwith Georgia. Alabama's general fund is less than $2 billion. Our \neducation budget is less than $8 billion. We are talking about imposing \non the American people an annual interest payment of $940 billion. The \nFederal highway fund is $40 billion, and Federal aid to education is \n$70 billion. This is going to crowd out everything.\n  That is why we are on an unsustainable path. We need the President to \nengage, and I hope today he will initiate his engagement, in which he \ntells the American people we can't continue this way. Would the Senator \ncare to close it out?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I will close by just saying amen.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, there has been a lively debate on the \nfloor\n\n[[Page S2420]]\n\nconcerning our 2011 budget. Now we are starting to talk about the 2012 \nbudget. I think it is important to point out what I hope is the \nobvious, which is that the budget of our Nation represents our vision \nfor our future. It is a policy document that speaks to what our \npriorities will be. It provides the financial tools for us to be able \nto meet those objectives.\n  I know we are in very difficult fiscal times, but this is not the \nfirst time in the history of America. I remind my colleagues that in \nthe 1990s we were confronted with a large budget deficit. I happened to \nhave been in the House of Representatives during that time. We saw, \nthrough the leadership of President Clinton, that we were able to bring \nour budget into balance, and we did that from large deficits. We did it \nin a way that maintained America's priorities and maintained the \npriorities for our children and our future because we continued to fund \nthose essential programs that allowed our Nation to grow.\n  As a result of what we did in the 1990s, we saw unprecedented growth \nin our economy because we did our budget the right way, speaking to \nAmerica's future and to our priorities, and doing it in a fiscally \nresponsible way. I think President Obama was correct when he stated in \nhis State of the Union Address that America will meet the challenges of \ninternational competition, and we will do that by outeducating, \noutinnovating, and outbuilding our competitors.\n  That requires a budget that speaks to those priorities, that speaks \nto educating our workforce, to provide the type of climate where \nAmerica can continue to lead the world in research and innovation, that \nwe pay attention to our infrastructure, whether it is transportation, \nwater infrastructure, energy infrastructure, so we have the capacity to \nbe able to compete internationally and that we can create the jobs that \nwill be critically important for America.\n  We need more jobs and we need good-paying jobs. That is what \nPresident Obama's vision is about, and our budget needs to underscore \nthat vision. Yes, we need to do it in a fiscally responsible way but in \na way that allows America's future to be secure. That is why I so much \nopposed the budget that was sent over to us from the House of \nRepresentatives, the 2011 budget, H.R. 1, before the ability to reach a \ncompromise. I did that because when you look at what H.R. 1 would have \ndone--particularly in light of the budget agreement we have now reached \non the 2011 budget--you cannot help but notice a huge difference \nbetween our visions for America. We all agree we have to have a \nworkforce that can compete.\n  Look at the stark differences between the budget agreement and the \nHouse-passed budget. In NIH research--and I take pride in this, since \nNIH is headquartered in Maryland--most of the funding for basic \nresearch, which is critically important for innovation--you cannot get \nto the applied research unless you have the basic research, and you \ncannot get good high-tech jobs unless you invest in basic research. \nThanks to the budget agreement we reached, most of the funding will be \nable to be maintained for the basic research at NIH. If the House \nbudget would have become law, it would have been $1.4 billion less. \nThat would have been a huge hit on America's ability to be able to \ncompete in this global marketplace. You also need to have a trained \nworkforce. You need job training and Job Corps programs. Most of the \nfunding has been maintained in this budget agreement for our job \ntraining and Job Corps programs; whereas, if you look at the House-\npassed budget, they eliminated all funds for job training and a 40-\npercent reduction in the Job Corps program. That was restored under the \nbudget agreement that allows America to have the competitive workforce \nit needs to meet future challenges.\n  Perhaps the area that I think people in Maryland and Minnesota may \nrecognize the most is what happens to Pell grants. Most students cannot \nmake it today, unless they have help in higher education. It is too \nexpensive to be able to afford without the help of programs such as \nPell grants. You need to have education beyond high school if you are \ngoing to be competitive today. Well, the House-passed budget would have \nreduced Pell grants by 15 percent. I can assure you that tuition isn't \ngoing down by 15 percent this year. Tuition at colleges and \nuniversities is going up and up.\n  I am proud we were able to, in the budget agreement, maintain the \nmaximum Pell grants at $5,550. We maintain funding for Race to the Top \nfunds because we want excellence in K-12. The House-passed budget would \nhave zeroed out the Race to the Top funds.\n  To me, if you talk about a budget that speaks to America's values, to \ngive young children the chance to succeed in school, Head Start has \nnever been a partisan program. It has been supported by Democrats and \nRepublicans because there are proven results in Head Start. People who \nparticipate in Head Start will do better. We have those results, so it \nis in our economic interest.\n\n  The Republican-passed budget in the House would have knocked 218,000 \nchildren off the Head Start Program. It would have reduced 55,000 \nteachers and aides from Head Start Programs around our Nation. I am \npleased to see that the agreement we will be voting on shortly restores \nall the funds for the Head Start Program, so our children can get the \nHead Start they need to succeed in K-12.\n  The budget speaks to our energy policies and transportation policies. \nIt is interesting to look and see that the agreement reached by our \nnegotiators restores more than $268 million in renewable energy and \nalternative energy sources. If we are going to be able to be \ncompetitive, we need an energy policy that makes sense. If we are going \nto keep jobs in America, we need an energy policy that makes sense. If \nwe are going to be secure, we have to get ourselves off foreign oil. We \nneed alternative energy sources.\n  The compromise restores a lot of the funds that were not in the \nHouse-passed budget document. I might talk about one issue that is very \nimportant to the people living in this region. We made a commitment \nyears ago that the Federal Government would participate with the \nsurrounding jurisdictions in the funding of the Nation's transit \nsystem, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit System, which is \ncritical to getting Federal workers to work and to our Nation's \nCapital. Our government committed $150 billion a year to modernize that \nsystem. Taxpayers of Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia \nare contributing also to the modernization of a system that is aged and \ncritically important. We live in the second most congested area in the \nNation, as far as commutes are concerned. The House of Representatives, \nin the Republican-passed budget, took out that $150 million--took it \nout. I am proud the compromise reached restores that $150 million.\n  Our budget speaks to our health and our environment. The Health \nResources Services Administration was severely cut in the Republican-\npassed budget. It would have affected care in each one of our \ncommunities. Our negotiators restored $900 million to that budget. What \ndoes that mean? It means the 11,000 community health centers, located \nin all our States, will be able to continue the services they are \ncurrently providing.\n  I took the floor before and talked about the Greater Baden Center, \nlocated just a few miles from here, and how they have expanded service \nthis year to deal with prenatal care. In Maryland and in America, our \ninfant mortality rate is too high. For a wealthy nation and State to \nhave the type of infant mortality rate we have is inexcusable. It is \nbecause we have low-birth-weight babies. Some die and others survive \nand have complications and have a tough time in life and they are very \nexpensive to the health care system. In our health centers, we are \ndoing something about that. At the Greater Baden Center, they are now \ngoing to provide prenatal care so pregnant women can get the attention \nthey need and can deliver healthier babies. Under the House-passed \nbudget, they would not have done that.\n  The math is simple. We invest in the health of Americans. We \nunderstand that. That is our budget. The Republican-passed House budget \nwould have cut off those funds. The affordable care act will be able to \nimplement it. We are not going to be stopped by the effort made in the \nRepublican-passed budget.\n  As far as the environmental protection riders we have talked about, \nthese\n\n[[Page S2421]]\n\nare the policy riders. I know this is confusing to people listening to \nthis debate, and they understand that the House-passed budget by the \nRepublicans had a lot of policy issues that had absolutely nothing to \ndo with the budget. They blocked the Environmental Protection Agency \nfrom protecting the environment. Let me say that again. They blocked \nthe Environmental Protection Agency from protecting the environment. \nThey couldn't enforce the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act. For the \npeople of Maryland and this region, that means blocking the enforcement \nof the Chesapeake Bay Program--a program that enjoys broad support from \nthe people not only of our region but the Nation.\n\n  Well, I am pleased to say the budget we will be voting on later this \nweek eliminates those restrictions. All of them are out. Thank goodness \nthey are because they should never have been in the budget document to \nstart with.\n  I will make it clear, Mr. President. I am very disappointed by many \nof the provisions included in this compromise. It is a true compromise. \nIt is not what the Democrats would have written, I can assure you of \nthat, and it is not what the Republicans would have written. It is a \ntrue compromise, and that is what we had to go through, I understand, \nbut I feel compelled to at least let the people of Maryland know the \ncost of the compromises.\n  For example, the General Services Administration will have $1 billion \nless to deal with government construction. What will that mean? Well, \nat White Oak, MD, we have the FDA's expansion. That will be put on \nhold. That will not only affect my community, but it will affect our \ncountry because we are talking about public health and food safety.\n  There is a rider that was attached that did survive that deals with \nthe delisting of the great wolf under the Endangered Species Act. That \nis not how we should be acting. There is a remedy for dealing with the \ndelisting. There is a process we go through. We shouldn't go down a \ndangerous precedent that starts congressional or political action on \ndelisting species that are included under the Endangered Species Act.\n  The cuts for the community development block grant are much more than \nI would like to see. These are programs that are important for our \nurban centers. During these times, when their budgets are being hit the \nhardest, I think it is very unfortunate to tell them we are just going \nto add to their challenges. We should be helping them during these \ntimes. We shouldn't be taking resources away from them.\n  The Federal Transit Administration has a major cut in this budget. I \nfind that regrettable, particularly as it relates to their new start \nbudget. I come from a State that has major new transit projects we want \nto get moving--the purple line to connect our suburban areas around \nWashington, the red line in Baltimore, Carter City's transit way to \nconnect the 270 corridor for high-tech jobs. All those depend upon us \ncontinuing to move forward with sensible transit projects that, quite \nfrankly, I think are in jeopardy as a result of the compromises that \nwere needed to be made.\n  Teach for America is eliminated. The Federal participation in that is \neliminated. On Monday I had a chance to teach for Teach for America. I \nwas in a high school in Baltimore with some very dedicated young people \nwilling to give up their lives so America can compete in the future. We \ncertainly should have continued the Federal partnership in Teach for \nAmerica.\n  I talked about the Environmental Protection Agency, but I didn't \npoint out that the Republican budget in the House cut that agency by 30 \npercent--30 percent. We restored half of those funds, but the cut is \nstill going to be pretty severe.\n  So I just wanted my colleagues to know that, whereas I am very \npleased that many of the decisions made in this compromise for the 2011 \nbudget will allow us to be able to move forward as a nation for \nAmerica's vision--being able to out-educate, out-innovate, and out-\nbuild our competitors--there are challenges as a result of the \ncompromise that have to be faced. Mr. President, these discussions will \ncontinue now to the 2012 budget.\n  We are already seeing that happen. In the House they are already \nstarting to act on what is known as the Ryan budget, which we think is \npretty much inspired by the tea party. It is pretty extreme. It is \npretty radical. It is not a credible plan, in my view. It is not a \ncredible plan to reduce the Federal deficit.\n  Now, why do I say that? Well, the Ryan budget concentrates on \ndomestic spending. It doesn't touch military spending, and it doesn't \ntouch our revenues. Let me correct that. It does deal with our \nrevenues, but it deals with it in the wrong way. It not only extends \nevery tax break that is currently available, providing tax relief for \nmillionaires, but it provides additional tax relief. It lowers the \nhighest rates.\n  Now, how is that going to be paid for? Well, they are expecting they \nare going to take more out of middle-income families. That is bad for \nmiddle-income families, but my guess is they will not even be able to \nreach those targets, and we will have huge deficits as far as the eye \ncan see. It is not a credible plan.\n  The deficit commission taught us if we are to have a credible plan to \ndeal with the deficit, we have to deal with domestic spending. We have \nto deal with military spending. We have to deal with mandatory \nspending. And we have to deal with revenues. We have to deal with all \nof them. The Ryan budget does not.\n  It is going to be hard for middle-income families, it protects \nAmerica's wealthiest, and it attacks our seniors--attacks our seniors. \nThe Ryan budget would turn Medicare into a voucher program.\n  Now, I can tell you what that means in dollars and cents. It means \nour seniors, who currently have--currently have--the largest out-of-\npocket costs for health care than any other age group of Americans, \nwill see their health care costs go up dramatically--double. Some of us \nremember how it was for seniors to get health care before we had \nMedicare. We had to fight with private insurance companies. Private \ninsurance companies are not interested in insuring people who make a \nlot of claims. Guess what. As you get older, you make a lot of claims.\n  What the Republican budget would do is tell our seniors: We are going \nto give you a voucher. It is a limited amount of money. Now you go find \na private insurance plan out there. Whatever it costs, you are going to \nhave to fill up the difference. We know it is going to cost a lot more \nthan the voucher we are giving you.\n  That is what they are doing. They are making it more expensive for \nour seniors to afford health care where they are asking us to reduce \ntheir costs, not make it more expensive.\n  Then the Ryan budget goes further by block-granting the Medicaid \nProgram. That means, quite frankly, Medicaid will not survive. We can \ntalk about the hardships it will have on providing health care in our \ncommunity, how it will have more and more people using the emergency \nrooms rather than using preventive care or seeing doctors, and that is \nall going to absolutely happen if we ever block-grant Medicaid.\n  Let me follow up on our seniors. Many of our seniors depend upon the \nMedicaid system, and their families depend upon it for long-term care--\nnursing care. That will not survive if we block-grant that to our \nStates. So the Ryan budget not only is not credible as it relates to \ndealing with the deficit, it also is very punitive against our seniors.\n  What I find probably the most disappointing is where I started this \ndiscussion, saying our budget is our vision for our future, that it \nspeaks to our priorities for our future. The Ryan budget leaves our \nchildren behind. If we are going to succeed, we have to take care of \nour children. They are our future. We have to deal with their education \nand with their health care. The Ryan budget puts them in severe \njeopardy. It is a philosophical document that I don't think represents \nthe values of America. I think our values are in our children and in \nour future and in our ability to meet those economic challenges.\n  I think there is a better way. President Obama is calling for a \ncomprehensive progrowth economic strategy that will invest in winning \nthe future. I would hope all of us could embrace that. Don't we want a \ncomprehensive progrowth economic strategy that invests in winning in \nthe future, that invests in our children, that invests in education and \nin innovation?\n\n[[Page S2422]]\n\n  As President Obama says, he wants to meet our values for the dignity \nof our retirees. Think about that for one moment. How we treat our \nretirees speaks to what we are as a nation--the dignity of our \nretirees. Think about a retiree trying to find an insurance company \nthat will take care of their insurance needs because we dumped the \nMedicare system. We can't let that happen. We can't let that happen.\n  There is a better way. Sixty-four of us in the Senate have said there \nis a better way. We have said: Look, it is time for us to be serious \nabout a credible plan for our deficit, and we are prepared--64 of us: \n32 Democrats, 32 Republicans--to not only cut our domestic spending, \nbut we will look at bringing down mandatory spending, and we will look \nat military, and we will look at revenues. There is a better way to do \nthis. I think we can represent the best of America's future in our \nbudget by providing education, innovation, job growth, health and \nenvironment policies that make sense, and we can do it with fiscal \nresponsibility. That is our mission.\n  So I know a lot of my colleagues come down to say we have to take \ncare of the deficit--do the deficit--and I agree with that. But, \nremember, our budget document is our statement about America's future. \nIt is our policy document, and America needs to stand up for quality \neducation, for the best health care in the world, and for encouraging \ninnovation that will give us the jobs of the future so that America can \ncontinue to lead the world. I think America deserves nothing less, and \nI intend to continue to fight for that type of vision for America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the Democratic women of the Senate are \non the floor today to talk about the three votes that will occur \ntomorrow: one, the passing of the continuing resolution, which I \nreluctantly support because of the many cuts in it, but also the two \nriders, one defunding the health care bill and the other defunding \nPlanned Parenthood.\n  My gosh, how outrageous that we have to vote on these two riders. \nThese two riders absolutely do not affect our deficit and our debt. In \nfact, the health care reform that we passed, by the CBO's own estimates \nand by independent evaluators, says we will actually reduce health care \ncosts because of what we have done.\n  What are the consequences of what they are talking about? The \nrightwing is trying to change the conversation away from, how do we \ncreate jobs in this country, how do we authentically reduce deficit and \ndebt, into socially provocative riders that literally wage war against \nwomen. The extreme rightwing campaigned against the health care. They \nsaid they were going to repeal and replace. All they want to do is \nrepeal. They have no idea for replacing. Let's talk about what they \nwant to repeal. Let's talk about the war they are waging against women.\n  If you repeal or defund health care, it will have a Draconian impact \non American women, make no mistake about it. In the health care bill, \nwe ended gender discrimination in health insurance. No longer could \ninsurance companies charge women 30 to 40 percent more than men of \nequal age and health status for the same coverage. The other thing we \nended was denying women health care on the basis of a preexisting \ncondition. We were horrified to learn that in 8 States, women were \ndenied health insurance access simply because they were victims of \ndomestic violence. They were beaten up in their homes, they were beaten \nup by insurance companies, and now they want to beat them up on the \nSenate floor and beat them up in the Senate budget.\n  We are going to stand up. We are not going to tolerate women being \npushed around and made targets of this war. No longer can women be \ndenied coverage because they had a C-section or because they had a \npremature baby. We fought for preventive services. We fought for \nmammograms and for Pap smears. We fought not only for ourselves, we \nfought for men too, which included their screening.\n  If you defund health care, make no mistake--and every woman in \nAmerica should know this--they are going to take the funding for \nmammograms away from you. They are going to take away the preventive \nhealth amendment that allowed you access to preventive screening at no \nadditional copays or deductibles. Do we really want that? Oh, sure, you \nare going to be able to have your mammogram, but you are going to dig \ndeep in your pocket.\n  We also wanted to end gender discrimination. We wanted to end the \npunitive practices of insurance companies toward women on the basis of \npreexisting conditions. We also wanted to have preventive care. One of \nthe greatest preventive-care-giving agencies is Planned Parenthood. It \nis the single most important health care provider, particularly to \nyoung women, in America. If we lose Planned Parenthood, 8,000 Maryland \nwomen will lose Pap smears and 7,500 women will lose access to breast \ncare exams. Many of them will lose access to health care generally.\n  Just because the Republicans live in the Dark Ages doesn't mean \nAmerican women want to go back. That is why we, the Senate Democratic \nwomen, will be voting against these two riders. Women must be clear: \nDefeating this amendment is a way to end the war against women. There \nwill be many fights ahead of us. We are under attack. We women are \nunder attack, at all ages. The Paul Ryan budget particularly attacks \nsenior women. We are going to fight this. We are suited up. We squared \nour shoulders. We put our lipstick on. This is not about gender, this \nis about an American agenda, and we will fight, and we will make our \nfight a victory.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank all of my Democratic women \ncolleagues for coming today and speaking so passionately, as the \nSenator from Maryland has just done, on issues we feel so deeply about. \nYou will be hearing from all of us because we are outraged that the \nprice tag for a vote on the continuing resolution is to attack votes on \nwomen's health.\n  I yield to the Senator from California for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senators Mikulski and Murray, \nSenators Cantwell and Shaheen and Stabenow and Landrieu--I am going to \nreally name every single Democratic woman. They have been unbelievable.\n  Since the beginning of this budget battle, our Republican friends in \nthe House have insisted that this debate is about spending. I have to \ntell you, we went all the way to them--about 70-plus percent--on \nspending cuts. We understand we have to cut, but we are not going to \ncut foolishly, we are not going to cut into the heart and soul of our \ncountry. That includes women's health programs, title X, Planned \nParenthood funding. For every dollar of taxpayer funds for title X, the \nyield is $4. That is how great the prevention is.\n  Yet what do they want to do? We see these two riders, these two votes \nwe have to have before they will allow us to have a vote on keeping the \ngovernment open. They pounded the table and said: We have to have two \nriders. What was it? Was it some big budgetary item that maybe we \noverlooked? Was it some move that would say that taxpayers who are not \npaying their taxes due, like some of the big corporate giants that hire \nenough lawyers that they don't pay--no, it was not about that. Was it \nabout some scandal they uncovered that they said could save us money? \nNo. The two votes they want are about giving the shaft to women, women \nand their families. The two votes are about health care which primarily \nimpacts women--by the way, also men, but primarily impacts women.\n  If that is the kind of budget war they are engaged in, they have met \nus on the battlefield. We have decided we will remain on that \nbattlefield, which is this Senate floor, as long as we have to. We will \ngo to the galleries, we will go to the press as long as we have to. We \nwill fight it in our cities, we will fight it in our counties. We will \nfight\n\n[[Page S2423]]\n\nit. We believe at the end of the day people will see who is fighting \nfor them--who is fighting for them.\n  I am going to read a couple of letters from my State. My State is the \nlargest State in the Union. Planned Parenthood provides care for more \nthan 750,000 women.\n  Listen to this woman.\n\n       Planned Parenthood is the only health care I have ever \n     used.\n\n  ``Ever,'' she says.\n\n       I don't have health insurance. So when I get sick, I get \n     over it as soon as possible so I can go back to work. Planned \n     Parenthood has provided me with the only health care coverage \n     I can afford, pelvic exams, STD testing, birth control. It \n     isn't much, but can you imagine the millions of people who \n     rely on Planned Parenthood suddenly living their lives \n     without these basic services?\n\n  She answers her own question: ``It is shameful.''\n  It is shameful. That is a letter from Sonja Kodimer. I have other \nletters from women in my great State.\n  Three million Americans get care at Planned Parenthood. Three-\nquarters of them have income below 150 percent of the Federal poverty \nlevel. They rely on Planned Parenthood--many of them do--as their own \nonly health care.\n  By the way, the other rider we have to vote on is to defund health \ncare reform. My colleagues have said it. Senator Mikulski worked night \nand day with the late and great and extraordinary Ted Kennedy to get us \nto the point where finally we are telling the insurance companies: No, \nyou cannot charge women thirty, forty, fifty percent more for the same \ncoverage as a man. By the way, being a woman is not a preexisting \ncondition. And you cannot deny a woman who had a Caesarian health care \ncoverage.\n  If you are a victim of domestic violence, that is not a preexisting \ncondition.\n  That is what we repaired in the bill in addition to many other things \nwe did. They want to give the shaft to women and their families, and we \nare not going to stand for it.\n  Barbara Haya from Oakland wrote to me. She said that when she was a \nstudent with limited funds, she was denied health insurance because of \na preexisting condition. Planned Parenthood was Barbara's only source \nof basic health care services. When she needed cancer screening, \nPlanned Parenthood was there. She says please don't cut any funding to \nPlanned Parenthood because without them she would not have her health \ncare.\n  Let's be clear. Nationwide, 97 percent of the services Planned \nParenthood provides have nothing to do with abortion. They do not use a \ndime. It is illegal. It has never happened for that 3 percent, that is \nprivate funding. So don't stand up and say this is about abortion. It \nhas nothing to do with it.\n  As a matter of fact, if they have their way--this is a fact--and \nwomen do not get birth control, we will see more unintended \npregnancies. We will see more abortions. That is just the fact.\n  So anyone who votes to defund Planned Parenthood, A, is denying \nessential health care services to women and their families, and, B, \ntheir policy will lead to more unintended pregnancies and more \nabortions.\n  So, yes, we stand here strong. Maybe some of us are five feet or \nunder even in a couple of cases, but that belies our determination and \nour strength. We stand here united. And we say to the people of this \ncountry, you can count on us because we will be here as long as it \ntakes to protect women and their families, and we will not allow women \nand their families to be held hostage. It is over. It is over.\n  I thank Senator Murray and Senator Mikulski.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I want to thank my colleague from California for her \ngreat statement, and the Senator from Maryland. And you will hear more \nof us.\n  Frankly we are here today because we are outraged. We strongly oppose \nthe resolution on the floor that slashes health care for women and \ngirls and middle-class families. I have to say as a woman and as a \nmother, I am angry that women's health care is even up for debate right \nnow. Middle-class families in this country are struggling. When I go \nhome to my State of Washington, I hear about people who are worried \nabout getting a pink slip or how they are going to put food on the \ntable, whether their job is going to be there for them, and if we are \nmaking sure our economy is working for them and their children. That is \nwhat I hear about. I do not hear about, when are you going to slash \nhealth care for women. Not once.\n  We have seen a smokescreen. That is why we are here. Last week under \nthe continuing resolution that was being negotiated between the House \nand the Senate and the White House, one remaining open item: \neliminating title X funding for women's health care. It was not about \nbudget deficits; it was not about the debt; it was not about jobs or \nthe economy. It was about an ideologically driven attack on women's \nhealth care.\n  We were able to keep that out of the continuing resolution that we \nwill vote on tomorrow. But the pricetag the Republicans in the House \ngave us to get to a vote to keep government open and to move our \ncountry forward is two votes: one that defunds Planned Parenthood, and \none that defunds health care. Both of those are extreme attacks on \nwomen's health care.\n  My colleagues have spoken eloquently about Planned Parenthood. This \nis not about abortion. Federal funds cannot go to abortion. We are \nfrankly tired of having to correct the untruths that continually come \nout about this funding. But we are not going to give up and we are \ngoing to keep fighting and we going to keep correcting them.\n  Planned Parenthood is about providing Federal funds for care, such as \nmammograms, and cervical cancer screenings, and prenatal care, and \nfamily support and counseling. This is about preventive health care \nservices for women, and we take it as a direct attack on every woman in \nthis country and her ability to get the health care she needs.\n  The second vote is an attack to dismantle health care. Well, let's \nremind all of us why health care finally became an issue that we were \nstrong enough to deal with in this country. I will tell you why. \nBecause women finally said, we have had enough. Let's face it, women \nare the ones who take their kids to the doctor, they are the ones who \nsee the bills coming in, and they are the ones who fight insurance \ncompanies on a daily basis.\n  They said, we have had enough. So we went through a long process here \nto make sure that we passed health care in a way that protected women. \nIt was women who were denied health care coverage because of \npreexisting conditions time and time again. We said ``no more.'' Now \nthey want to vote tomorrow to put that back into effect. We heard from \nwomen who were denied coverage for health care because they were a \nvictim of domestic violence. We said ``no more.'' Now they attack that \nagain.\n  There are so many reasons why this is the wrong approach. But I will \nlet all of our colleagues know, we are going to defeat these amendments \ntomorrow. We are going to move on. But the Democratic women of the \nSenate are now vigilant, and we are here, and we are not going to allow \nthe 2012 budget or further discussions as we go along to be a smoke \nscreen to cover up a real agenda, which is to take away the access for \nhealth care and basic rights that women have worked long and hard and \nfought for in this country.\n  I want you to know you will be hearing more from us, but we are not \ngoing away. We are going to defeat these amendments tomorrow, and we \nare here to fight them until they stop being offered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. It is my great pleasure and honor to be here with my \nfriends and colleagues who have all fought so long and hard to make \nsure that women's voices and experiences are represented in the \ndecisions we make here in the Senate and in Washington on behalf of all \nof the families we represent.\n  I have to say that people in Michigan, my family, friends, everybody \nacross Michigan, are shaking their heads right now trying to figure out \nwhat the heck is going on. All of this is a diversion from what we want \nto be talking about and doing something about; that is, jobs, putting \npeople back to work, making sure people have money in their pockets to \nbe able to\n\n[[Page S2424]]\n\npay their bills, and that they can tackle their house that very well \nmay be under water right now, and how they are going to pay for gas \nwith prices going through the roof, and how they are going to be able \nto take care of their kids and make sure they can have the \nopportunities to go to college that they want for them. All of the \nthings we all want for our families, that is what families want us to \nbe talking about right now.\n  I also have to say the people in my State are finding that the \ndollars they earn right now are hard to come by. These dollars are \nprecious, and we need to be holding every program accountable, we need \nto get results for every dollar is spent, and make decisions that if \nsomething does not work, we need to stop doing it. We need to focus on \nthings that do.\n  We know the whole deficit discussion is very critical for us, and \nthat we need to be smart about the way we do things. That is not what \nthis debate is about at the moment, certainly not only women's health \ncare. But we understand that we need to be serious about this. \nCertainly in my role as chairing the Agriculture, Nutrition and \nForestry Committee, we take that very seriously, and we will be doing \nthat in the context of our responsibilities moving forward.\n  But I also know, and the people of Michigan understand more than I \nthink anybody else across the country, that we will never get out of \ndebt with more than 15 million people out of work, which is why we want \nto focus on jobs. They also know that women of all ages, seniors, \nmiddle-class families, did not cause the deficit hole we are in, and \nthey should not be responsible for the sacrifice and burdens on their \nbacks only in order to move us out of deficit.\n  We certainly are not going to allow a thinly veiled threat to women \nin general to become part of a debate about how we balance the budget \nand eliminate the deficit, which is a very real issue. The fact is, in \norder to get the budget completed for this year, women--women's health \ncare--was held hostage. We were able to separate that, because the \nwomen came together in the Senate and said, there is no way we are \ngoing to allow this whole debate to become some political debate about \nwhether women should get breast cancer screenings or cervical cancer \nscreenings or blood pressure checks. So we separated that now from the \nagreement for the rest of the year. I am proud to have stood with women \nfrom all over this country to say no, we are not going to let you play \npolitics with the women of this country and our health care. But now we \nhave in front of us two different votes. This was the price we had to \npay. And we are willing to stand here and make the case for why people \nneed to vote no. But it is also deeply concerning that we have to be in \na situation to debate whether women should get breast cancer screenings \nand cervical cancer screenings, and whether we should have access to \nhealth care as a part of the price to be able to come together on a \nbudget agreement. That is exactly where we are.\n  The majority of the funds from what is called title IX for preventive \ncare goes to health departments. By the way, I helped be able to \nsupport, when I was a county commissioner years ago, the Ingham County \nHealth Department, setting up their preventive care center for women, \nhealth care screenings for women.\n  All across Michigan, 70 percent of the funds under something called \ntitle X go to health departments. There is a small amount that goes to \nPlanned Parenthood. That is being very politicized now, because of the \nother side's wish to politicize women's health care. But in 2009, those \ncenters provided 55,000 cancer screenings. We had almost 4,000 women--\n3,800 women--who got back an abnormal result on a cancer screening. \nBecause they had a chance to get that screening, they then had the \nopportunity to do something about it, and lives were saved. Moms are \nalive today to be able to care for their children, and watch them grow \nup because they found out they had breast cancer early. Grandmas are \nalive and well today to be able to play with their grandkids and their \ngreat-grandkids because they found out early they had breast cancer or \ncervical cancer or some other health care challenge. I think we ought \nto celebrate that as the best of who we are and our values in this \ncountry.\n  The other piece we have in front of us will be to defund health care \nin general. We know, first of all, that women are health care \nconsumers. Usually in families they are making the decisions about \nhealth insurance, if you are able to have health insurance, or how to \npurchase it or what will be covered and certainly caring about our \nfamilies. We usually are the last ones to take care of ourselves. I \ncertainly can speak to that myself as maybe other colleagues can, that \nwe tend to make the decisions first for our children, our families, and \nnot take care of ourselves as we should.\n  But we made a very strong statement, and I think a valued statement, \nin health care reform, to say that we want to make sure women have \naccess to health care and that they can afford to get it, and that they \nare not penalized, we are not penalized as women, and that we are not \ngoing to have to pay more.\n  Right now, prior to health care reform, any woman purchasing health \ninsurance on her own was paying more, sometimes up to 50 percent more, \nor more, for the same health insurance as a man, or even less health \ninsurance, because she was a woman, because she may be of childbearing \nyears, because of whatever the reason.\n  Women have traditionally paid more for the same insurance. That is no \nlonger the case. Now, for the same coverage, the same medical \ncircumstances, women cannot be discriminated against. That is a good \nthing. I think that is something we should be proud of that we have \nbeen able to do, to make sure insurance companies cannot charge women \nmore just because they are women.\n  We have also made clear that preventive care is an essential part of \nbasic health care. I will always remember the debate I had as a member \nof the Finance Committee with a colleague on the other side of the \naisle over whether maternity care is a basic part of health insurance \nand health care.\n  Of course, I think it is hard for people in Michigan to understand \nwhy we would even have to have that debate, because prenatal care, \nmaternity care, certainly is a basic, not just for the women involved \nbut for the baby, for the family. But we stood together and we said, we \nare going to make sure that maternity care is part of the definition of \nbasic health care.\n  So there were a number of things that we did together, the women of \nthis Senate, to make sure that over half the population, the women of \nthis country, have access to quality, affordable health care for \nthemselves so they can continue to care for their families and be a \nvery important part of who we are in contributing to America.\n  We are here because tomorrow the question will be, should women's \npreventive health care services be allowed to continue as part of our \nframework in terms of health care funding, both broadly in health care \nreform, and narrowly under title X and family planning for the country?\n  We will say no to efforts to defund women's health care.\n  I hope going forward, as we tackle huge issues for the country around \nbringing down the debt and balancing the budget and growing the economy \nand creating jobs and looking to the future, that we will not see, once \nagain, something as important as women's health care put on the \nchopping block as part of the debate. That is the message all of us \nhave and the message we will be sending tomorrow, that women across the \ncountry need to know they are valued, that we want them to be healthy, \nthat we want them to be able to afford health insurance, that we want \nthem to get cancer screenings, that we value their lives. We don't \nbelieve folks should continue to play politics with their health care.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I thank Senators Murray and Mikulski for \ngathering with us today and all of my colleagues who are here. I am \nproud to join them.\n  Tomorrow we expect to vote on House proposals to defund Planned \nParenthood and the Affordable Care Act. These resolutions have been \noffered not because anyone argues they create jobs or improve health \ncare but\n\n[[Page S2425]]\n\nbecause House Republicans were willing to shut down the Federal \nGovernment if they did not receive a vote on Planned Parenthood and \nhealth care. That is right. Even though shutting down the government \nwould have meant furloughing 800,000 people, including members of the \nmilitary, they were willing to shut down the government.\n  This kind of a threat, especially in a recession, is irresponsible. \nPlanned Parenthood is a critical provider of women's health care, \nespecially to low-income individuals. Mr. President, 1.4 million \nMedicaid patients around the country--mostly women but not all--depend \non Planned Parenthood as their main source of primary and preventive \nhealth care. They depend on Planned Parenthood for contraceptives, \nscreenings for sexually transmitted diseases, and for screenings for \nbreast and cervical cancer. In some parts of New Hampshire, Planned \nParenthood is the only provider of preventative services for low-income \nwomen. It serves almost 16,000 patients annually. In a time of economic \nhardship, we should not be taking steps to reduce access to health \ncare.\n  Let's be clear. This vote has nothing to do with abortion. By law, \nPlanned Parenthood cannot use Federal funds for abortions. Moreover, \nPlanned Parenthood provides family planning services that greatly \nreduce the occurrence of unplanned pregnancies. It is ironic that many \nof the most ardent opponents of abortion are the very people who want \nto shut down the family planning services that prevent unplanned \npregnancies.\n  This vote is also not about deficit reduction. Despite what some \nMembers of the Senate have claimed, 97 percent of the reproductive \nhealth services provided by Planned Parenthood in New Hampshire--and \nthroughout most of the country--are preventive care. Over 90 percent \nare for preventive care. As we all know, preventive health care lowers \nhealth care costs and saves lives. Detecting cancer early through \nregular screenings greatly increases a patient's quality of life and \nchances of survival. In the long run it is vastly cheaper for patients \nin the health care system, and the Federal Government, for diseases to \nbe prevented or treated early.\n  One of my constituents from Rochester, a mother of two, told me about \nher oldest daughter who works for a small restaurant. Her daughter \ncan't afford health insurance, and it is not provided where she works. \nFor her regular checkups and preventive care, she relies on Planned \nParenthood. Because of the history of cervical cancer in her family, \nher daughter was regularly screened, and it was Planned Parenthood that \nfirst diagnosed her daughter with cervical cancer. Because of that \nearly diagnosis, her daughter was able to obtain successful lifesaving \ntreatment. There are countless stories such as this. We heard some of \nthem this afternoon.\n  I also wish to address the other House proposal we have been \ndiscussing this afternoon. It is a proposal that would also hurt \nwomen's health care. That is the pending resolution to deny funding for \nhealth care reform. Already the Affordable Care Act is working for \nwomen across the country. As of last year, it is illegal for insurance \ncompanies to require women to obtain preauthorizations or referrals to \naccess OB/GYN care. But there is a lot of work that still has to be \ndone.\n  Currently, women in the individual health care market pay up to 48 \npercent more in premiums than men. Beginning in 2014, this kind of \ndiscrimination, because of the new health care law, will be outlawed. \nIssuers will be banned from issuing discriminatory gender ratings to \ncharge women and small businesses with predominantly female workforces \nmore for the same coverage.\n  In the same year, 2014, health care reform also makes it illegal for \ninsurers to deny health care coverage on the basis of preexisting \nconditions, designations which have often been used to discriminate \nagainst women. Many women across the country today are denied coverage \nfor preexisting conditions such as breast or cervical cancer, having \nhad a C-section, or even just being pregnant. Some women have even been \ndenied coverage for having sought out medical care for domestic or \nsexual violence. It is critical that we ensure low-income women have \naccess to health care in these difficult times and that we ensure that \nall women have access to health care.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against these two provisions tomorrow, \nthese ideological attacks on women's health care. Let's get back to the \nbusiness of creating jobs and dealing with this country's debt and \ndeficit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I join my colleagues to talk about \ntomorrow's votes on two different amendments and to say that I am proud \nto join my female Senate Democratic colleagues in this effort and to \nspeak out about this important issue.\n  To me the American people have sent us a clear message. They want us \nto focus on job creation, promoting innovation, and putting Americans \nback to work. But instead tomorrow we will be on the Senate floor \ntrying to defend access to health care for women. We will vote tomorrow \non whether to defund Planned Parenthood, an agency that serves hundreds \nof thousands of people in my State on important exams such as breast \nexaminations and helping to prevent infections and various things.\n  Just a few weeks ago I talked about one of my constituents, a 22-\nyear-old woman from Seattle who was diagnosed with an abnormal growth \non her cervix at Planned Parenthood and received lifesaving treatment. \nShe was uninsured, and without Planned Parenthood she would not have \nbeen able to get that kind of treatment. Certainly, her health would \nhave been in major danger in the future.\n  I tell that story to emphasize the importance of Planned Parenthood \non prevention and that they are centers of prevention for many women \nwho have no other access to health care. We cannot jeopardize the \naccess to that preventative health care at a time when it is so \nimportant for us to reduce long-term costs.\n  In fact, even in the investment area, every dollar invested in family \nplanning and publicly funded family planning clinics saves about 4.2 in \nMedicaid-related costs alone. So preventive health care is good for us \nin saving dollars, and it is certainly good for our individual \nconstituents who have a lack of access to health care. That is why I am \nso disappointed in the situation we have now, where colleagues are \nsaying to us: You can get a budget deal, but you have to defund women's \nhealth care access to do so.\n\n  The avoidance of a government shutdown has also brought on a \nchallenge on the backs of women in the District of Columbia because it \nincluded a provision denying DC leaders the option of using locally \nraised funds to provide abortion services to low-income women. For \nthose who argue against big government, this is a contradiction because \nthis is a real imposition on the ability of elected officials in the \nDistrict of Columbia to decide what to do with their locally raised \nfunds. I know, because I am in the Hart Building, what the mayor and \nothers on the council had to say about this. This is an imposition on \nthe health services of low-income women in the District of Columbia and \ncertainly has gone almost unnoticed in the eleventh hour and sets a \nprecedent for a dangerous slippery slope with what we are telling local \ngovernments to do.\n  It is time for us to focus on our budget, living within our means, \nand getting back to work, but certainly not to try to do all of that on \nthe backs of women. It is not time to shut down access to women's \nhealth care.\n  Republicans in the House have decided to wage war and to say women \nshould be a bargaining chip. The American people have sent us a clear \nmessage. They want us to get back to work, and they support Planned \nParenthood and efforts of Planned Parenthood on preventive health care \nand health care delivery services.\n  A recent CNN poll showed that 65 percent of Americans polled support \ncontinued funding of Planned Parenthood. I know my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle would like to say that these funds are used in \nfunding organizations that may be involved in doing full reproductive \nchoice services. But I ask them to think about that issue and that \nlogic. Where will they stop? It is Planned Parenthood today, but are \nthey going to stop every institution in America from receiving Federal \ndollars? It is illegal for Planned\n\n[[Page S2426]]\n\nParenthood to use Federal dollars for full reproductive choices, \nincluding abortion. It is illegal. They cannot use those funds. Yet the \nother side would like to say that this is an issue where they would \nlike to stop Planned Parenthood today, and then they will try to stop \nother organizations in the future. It is time to say no to this \namendment tomorrow and to say no on trying to pull back from the full \nhealth care funding bill at a time when we need to implement the \nreforms to keep costs down and to increase access for those who \ncurrently don't have access to health care and return to the system \nwith much more expensive health care needs in the future.\n  I am disappointed that at the eleventh hour of a budget debate that \nis about living within our means, about how we take the limited \nrecovery we have had and move it forward economically, instead we are \nsaying that we can't move forward on a budget and a recovery until we \ntake everything that we can away from women's access to health care.\n  We will fight this tomorrow. I am proud to be here with my colleagues \nto say we will be the last line of defense for women in America who are \ngoing about their busy lives right now, taking their kids to school, \ntrying to juggle many things at home and work. They are every day, as \nthe budget people within their own homes, trying to figure out how to \nlive within their means. The national budget debate has broken on this \npoint: We can only have a budget agreement if we defund women's full \naccess to health care. That is wrong.\n  We will be here tomorrow to fight this battle and speak up for women.\n  I wish to point out to my colleague from New York that I remember in \n1993, in the year of the woman, when so many women got elected to \nCongress, it was the first time in the House of Representatives we had \na woman on every single committee. The end result of that is we had an \nincrease in funding for women's health research. So much of the \nresearch had been up until that point focused on men. Why? Because \nthere wasn't anybody on the committee to speak up about how women had \nuniquely different health care needs and deserved to have a bigger \nshare of funding for health care needs than were currently being \nfunded. That is what we get when we get representation.\n  Women Senators will be here tomorrow to fight to say that women \ndeserve to have access to health care through Planned Parenthood and \ntitle X. Please, for those working moms who are out there juggling, \ndealing with children and childcare, dealing with their jobs, dealing \nwith pay equity at work, dealing with all of these other issues that \nwomen are struggling with--that they don't have to be a pawn in the \ndebate on the budget, that there are people who believe, just like the \nmajority of Americans do, that we should move forward with this kind of \npreventive health care for women in America.\n  I see my colleague from New York who has been a staunch supporter of \nPlanned Parenthood and women's health care choices, and I thank her for \nthat leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I commend my colleague for her \nextraordinary remarks and her leadership in fighting for these issues.\n  It is a privilege to be in the Senate today to listen to the remarks \nof all of the Senate women colleagues who care so deeply about women in \nAmerica and how they are literally being used as a pawn in a debate \nabout the budget.\n  These women have drawn a line in the sand, a line in the sand that we \nwill not let you cross. You may not balance the budget on the backs of \nwomen, period.\n  It is very simple. The election last November was not about a mandate \nfor these social issues. It was about the economy. It was about, How \nare we going to create jobs? How do we get a body of representatives to \ncome together, work together across party lines, to come up with \nsolutions? That is what the election was about.\n  The American people voted overwhelmingly for a vote and a discussion \nof issues relating to jobs. How do we create jobs? How do we create the \natmosphere and the landscape so our small businesses can grow?\n  But that is not what the House of Representatives has focused on. No. \nThey have created an entire agenda around an assault on women. Women's \nsafety nets, women's health care, protections for women and children, \nearly childhood education, prenatal care, Pap smears--you name it--this \nis what they are beginning to focus their attention on.\n  Millions of Americans depend on reproductive services. Millions of \nwomen depend on prenatal care, on early cancer screenings, breast \nexams--all of the types of preventive health care that families rely \non. In fact, in New York, there are over 200,000 New Yorkers who rely \non this preventive care.\n  For my friends and colleagues, this is a factual statement: Current \nlaw already prevents Federal money from paying for abortions. This has \nbeen the law of the land for over 30 years.\n  Shutting down the government to fight a political argument is not \nonly outrageous, it is irresponsible. The price for keeping the \ngovernment open is this assault on women's rights, equality, access to \nhealth care, access to preventive care.\n  Women shoulder the worst of health care costs, including outrageous \ndiscriminatory practices that we worked so hard during health care \nreform to fix.\n  The National Women's Law Center tells us that under the previous \nhealth care system, a 25-year-old woman would have to pay 45 percent \nmore to get basic health care than a male her same age. Some of the \nmost essential services required by women for their basic health were \nnot covered by many insurance plans, such as prenatal care, Pap smears, \nor mammograms or preventive screenings, including postpartum \ndepression, domestic violence, and family planning.\n  The institutionalized discrimination in our health care system is \nwrong and it is a tax on women and their families. What we did in \nhealth care reform was to begin to address these issues to make sure \nthe inadequacies of our current system could be addressed, safeguarding \nwomen's health, and making sure this institutional discrimination no \nlonger exists.\n  Yesterday was Equal Pay Day. Women all across America earn 78 cents \nfor every $1 their male colleagues earn for doing the exact same job. \nYesterday was the day it would take a woman to work all of last year \nand this year to earn exactly what that male colleague earned in 1 \nyear.\n  Well, who does that affect? It affects families. It affects every \nfamily in America who has a working mother who is bringing money home \nto pay for her children, for her family, for their well-being.\n  So when we should be talking about the economy and issues about how \ndo we have equal pay in this country, the Republican House is talking \nabout how to continue this rhetoric and assault and negative effects on \nwomen and their families and what they need to protect themselves.\n  The votes we are going to have tomorrow to defund Planned Parenthood, \nto repeal health care--American women, make no mistake about it, this \nis an attack on you. It is an attack on every preventive health \nservice, every safety net, everything you care about, whether it is \nearly childhood education, Pap smears, mammograms, or prenatal care \nwhen you are pregnant. That is what their efforts are all about, and \nyou should just know you have women of the Senate who will stand by \nyou. We have drawn this line in the sand, and we will not allow them to \ncross it. We are your voice in Washington, we are your voice in \nCongress, and we will protect you and the basic safety nets and \nequality you should expect out of the U.S. Government.\n  Since I am the last speaker, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, you may not know it from the weather in \nWashington, but spring has finally arrived.\n\n[[Page S2427]]\n\nEven though it is cold and rainy outside, there is no mistaking the \nchange of seasons in Washington. Every spring, the congressional office \nbuildings are busy with people who want to visit their representatives.\n  I look forward to many of these visits. I look forward to seeing \nfamilies who have traveled all the way from Utah to see for themselves \nand to show their children the Capitol, the White House, the \nDeclaration of Independence, and the monuments to many of our Nation's \ngreatest heroes.\n  But we truly know it is spring in Washington because the Halls of \nCongress are filled with people here for one purpose; that is, to ask \nfor more money. When budget season hits, interest groups descend on the \nCapitol with one-track minds. Like the swallows to Capistrano, they \nreturn to the same spot each year to ask for more dough. The message is \nalways the same: Their issue or their program is always critical, \nalways essential.\n  Liberals like to beat up on businesses and demand their shared \nsacrifice. Translation: You better pony up. But the interest groups \nthat thrive on taxpayer dollars always seem to be exempt from this \nrequired sacrifice. Somehow I don't think this is what the Founders had \nin mind when they guaranteed individuals the right to petition the \ngovernment. Petitioning the government for more cash is somehow less \ninspiring than petitioning the government for redress of grievances.\n  I appreciate the sentiments of a new Member of the House of \nRepresentatives who hung a banner in his office that read: If you are \nhere to ask for money, you are in the wrong place.\n  The fact is, Washington has an enormous spending problem. Washington \nis addicted to spending. The first step toward recovery is \nacknowledging that you have a problem. I suppose we can take some \nsolace in the fact that few persons in a position of responsibility now \ndeny that our deficits and debt are a problem.\n  Facts have gotten in the way. This morning, the Financial Times had \nan above-the-fold headline that read: ``U.S. Lacks Credibility On Debt, \nIMF Says.'' No kidding.\n  Our total debt is now over $14 trillion, with no end in sight. The \nadministration is now asking the Finance Committee and Congress to \nraise the debt ceiling by $2.2 trillion just to get this country \nthrough next year. The President's first two budgets were a tragedy. \nBut when the United States was staring down the barrel of a third \nstraight $1 trillion-plus deficit, his fiscal year 2012 budget morphed \ninto parody.\n  Recognizing the shellacking his party took over the issue of big \nspending, the White House had to talk a big game about deficit \nreduction, but their numbers never added up. This is how the Washington \nPost described the impact of the President's budget: After next year, \nthe deficit will begin to fall ``settling around $600 billion a year \nthrough 2018, when it would once again begin to climb as the growing \nnumber of retirees tapped into Social Security and Medicare.''\n  Americans quickly saw this budget for what it was--business as usual, \nspending as usual.\n  Today, the President tried a do-over. He was going to give a big \nspeech. That seems to be his go-to move. This time, he was going to \nconvince Americans that he is very serious about deficit reduction. \nUnfortunately, he bricked this shot as well.\n  We are approaching a debt crisis, but the President seems willing to \nrun the clock until the next election. This is a very dangerous game.\n  I think we need to be clear about how precarious our Nation's fiscal \nsituation is. The fact is, we could be closer to a debt crisis than \neven the most pessimistic accounts. Because of this administration's \ndramatic ramp-up in Federal spending, Americans are deep in Federal \ndebt.\n  Currently, Federal debt held by the public equals a modern record of \nabout 69 percent of the Nation's economy--known as the gross domestic \nproduct. The Congressional Budget Office reports that current tax-and-\nspending law takes that figure to 76 percent of GDP over the next 10 \nyears.\n  To put that number in perspective, consider the following statistic: \nAt the end of fiscal year 2008, as the George W. Bush administration \nwas winding down, the debt held by the public reached about 41 percent. \nThat is less than 2\\1/2\\ years ago, in contrast with 69 percent of the \ndebt. As bad as the 76-percent figure is, it gets worse under the \nPresident's fiscal policies.\n  President Obama's third budget was released on Valentines Day this \nyear. If Americans were expecting some love and concern from our \nPresident, they sure didn't get it. The administration's figures \nclaimed that the President's budget would raise debt held by the public \nto 87 percent of GDP. That is the administration's figures.\n  I have a chart that shows the growth in the debt--the national debt \nas a percentage of GDP. The current policy happens to be the red, the \nObama 2012 budget is the blue. As you can see, by 2021, the national \ndebt will be 76 percent of our GDP.\n  On Friday, March 18, 2011, CBO released its estimates of the \nPresident's budget. These estimates showed that debt held by the public \nwould grow to 87 percent of GDP in 10 years, just like it says on the \nfar right of the chart. That alarming figure is there on the chart.\n  Let me put this another way. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, if we continue current tax policy, don't raise rates, fix the \nAMT, provide estate tax relief, and provide for a fix to the physician \npayment system or the SGR as it is known--policies supported by a clear \nmajority of Americans--by 2021, the debt held by the public will reach \n97 percent of GDP.\n  For those watching C-SPAN, whose jaws just hit the floor, I hate to \ntell you, but the news might even be worse. As bad as these numbers \nare--and they are very bad--they could be dramatically understating the \nfiscal consequences of our current deficit spending policy. This is \nbecause we face a hidden potential for even greater levels of \nadditional Federal debt. We may be in the middle of a debt bubble. The \nstated current level of debt may grow astronomically without any policy \nchanges. Let me say that again. If we do nothing to our current policy \nand continue to spend, the debt we currently hold may prove disastrous.\n  Here is what I mean by a bubble. I will use an example we are all too \nfamiliar with. An economic bubble can be described as significant trade \nvolume in different products or assets with inflated values. Interest \nrates affect everything in our economy, from the monthly payments we \nmake on a new car or home to the amount we are able to save at a local \nbank. Interest rates during both the dot-com bubble and the housing \nbubble were driven by policies at the Federal Reserve. During 2001, the \nFederal Reserve lowered the Federal funds rate from 6.25 percent to \n1.75 percent. The Fed further reduced the rate in 2002 and 2003--there \nis the Federal funds rate--to around 1 percent.\n  These low rates had a substantial effect on the growth of mortgage \nlending between 2001 and 2004. The share of new mortgages with \nadjustable rates, which was around 20 percent in 2001, was more than 40 \npercent by 2004--adjustable rate mortgages.\n  Currently, just like at the beginning of the last decade, interest \nrates are very low. Ten-year Treasury rates are currently around 3.5 \npercent. During the past 2 years, this administration has spent \nrecklessly, raising the total debt from $10.6 trillion to over $14.2 \ntrillion. We are currently spending 40 cents of every $1 on interest, \npaying China and others who hold our debt. But what will happen when \ninterest rates rise? Under projections from the CBO, 10-year Treasury \nnote rates are expected to rise from current levels to 5.3 percent in \n2016.\n  What happens if interest rates rise to levels seen during the 1980s \nor the 1990s? During the 1980s, rates on 3-month Treasury bills and 10-\nyear notes rose to over 8 percent and 10 percent, respectively. During \nthe 1990s, rates on 3-month and 10-year notes rose to 5 percent and 6.6 \npercent, respectively.\n  Exactly like the housing bubble, as a nation, we are falling into a \nnational debt bubble. We continue to spend on our national credit card \nwhile interest rates are low. Just as many purchased homes with \nadjustable rate mortgages, eventually the adjustment kicked in, the \nlow-rate bubble popped, and many Americans found themselves facing \nhigher mortgage payments that were unaffordable.\n  We are exposing ourselves to more debt than we should. The cost of \nthat\n\n[[Page S2428]]\n\ndecision is severely understated. That cost, as laid out by CBO, could \nbe astronomical. Under President Obama's 2012 current budget, the CBO \nprojects deficits for each of the next 10 years, resulting in an \nestimated $10 trillion being added to the public debt, a 100-percent \nincrease.\n  Under the scenario where interest rates rise to the historical \naverage of the 1990s, the public debt is projected to grow an \nadditional $8 trillion or a 77-percent increase. Under the scenario \nwhere interest rates rise to the historical average of the 1980s, the \npublic debt would grow to $12.1 trillion, doubling in size.\n  It is right here on this chart. You can see it. This is a chart \nshowing the public debt over the next 10 years, from 2011 to 2021. You \ncan see the green on the far right of each column is the 1980s interest \nrate, the blue in the middle of each column is the 1990s interest rate, \nand the red happens to be the current baseline estimates, which almost \neverybody who looks at it seriously would say are too low.\n  If the interest rates return to the levels of the 1990s without any \npolicy changes, the debt, as you can see, grows significantly, \naccording to this chart. If we return to the 1980s interest rates, we \nwill hit a 116-percent increase. If interest rates return to the 1980 \nlevels, boy, are we in trouble.\n  Those who argue against spending restraints now are akin to the \nbubble inflators of the housing industry, encouraging more and more \nspending and consumption, never considering what will happen when the \nrates adjust.\n  This is why it is urgent, I would say imperative, that we cut \nspending now. Not after the next Presidential election. Not next year. \nNot next month. Immediately.\n  We cannot afford either the short or the long term effects of this \ndangerous spending addiction. American taxpayers understand what \nWashington has to do. It is time to cut the national credit card and \nstop this reckless spending.\n  Unfortunately, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and \ntheir liberal progressive base, keep urging for more taxes. I don't get \nthis. I don't think Americans have been sitting at home thinking: You \nknow what this debate over government spending has been missing? A \nproposal for a giant tax increase.\n  But to borrow from Bruce Dickinson, Democrats have a fever. And the \nonly prescription is more taxation.\n  When it comes to dealing with our budget deficits and our exploding \ndebt, Democrats have a one-track mind. They claim that they are serious \nabout spending. The White House is touting reforms to Medicare and \nMedicaid to get spending under control. But ObamaCare is not Medicare \nreform. And real Medicare reform will entail repealing ObamaCare.\n  The health care bill took a half a trillion dollars out of Medicare \nto finance $2.6 trillion in new government spending. And instead of \ntaking responsibility to ensure the long-term viability of Medicare, \nthe President did what he seems to do best. He punted decisionmaking to \na board of unelected bureaucrats.\n  ObamaCare is not Medicaid reform either. States are already facing a \ncrushing collective deficit of $175 billion. But instead of helping the \nStates to lift this burden, the President's health care bill larded on \na $118 billion Medicaid expansion on the States. That is about $300 \nbillion.\n  The White House has circulated a factsheet on the President's attempt \nat deficit reduction. It claims $340 billion in savings over 10 years--\n``an amount sufficient to fully pay to reform the Medicare Sustainable \nGrowth Rate, SGR, physician payment formula while still reducing the \ndeficit.'' However, the President's budget estimated the cost of a 10-\nyear doc fix at $380 billion. Assuming Congress utilizes the \nPresident's proposed savings to fund a doc fix, the net deficit \nincrease from the White House's health proposals will be at least $40 \nbillion.\n  With due respect, when the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund, \nwhich our seniors depend on, is scheduled to be insolvent in 9 short \nyears, that is totally inadequate.\n  So what are we really looking at in this vaunted deficit reduction \nplan? Yesterday, in anticipation of the President's remarks on deficit \nreduction, his spokesperson gave it away when he said, ``[t]he \npresident believes there has to be a balanced approach.''\n  Translation: You better check your wallet.\n  The Wall Street Journal said that tax increases are on the table.\n  But Americans know that for Democrats tax increases are never off the \ntable. Most Americans understand that they are the centerpiece of \nDemocratic policy.\n  America was waiting for the President to propose something new today. \nInstead, he dusted off his proposal to end the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts \nfor households and businesses earning over $250,000 a year.\n  Citizens wanted something innovative--maybe a little hope and change \nfor a change.\n  But instead they got the fiscal policy of Walter Mondale and Michael \nDukakis.\n  Under the President's proposed failsafe for deficit reduction, \ntaxpayers who use their own dollars to deduct mortgage interest, make \ncontributions to charities, save for education, or save in a pension \nplan, will be treated the same as spending for Nevada's Cowboy Poetry \nFestival.\n  To me they are not the same. But to the President they are. David \nPlouffe, the President's senior adviser and former campaign manager, \nhad this to say about the President's proposal:\n\n       People like him . . . who've been very fortunate in life, \n     have the ability to pay a little bit more.\n\n  Well, that's big of him. We hear this quite a bit from rich \nDemocrats: Please tax us more, they say.\n  Well, as the ranking member on the Senate Finance Committee, I feel \nobligated to inform Mr. Plouffe that the President, and all of those \nrich liberal Democrats who are eager to pay higher taxes, can do just \nthat. They can write a check to the IRS and make an extra payment on \ntheir tax returns to pay down the Federal debt. The option is right \nthere at the bottom of their tax return.\n  America awaits these checks. This might be a good talking point. I am \nsure it has polled well. But I have yet to hear the economic or fiscal \nrationale for raising taxes on small business creators and American \nfamilies. It is certainly not deficit reduction.\n  Raising taxes might be politically necessary for Democrats. But it \nwill do little to reduce the deficits and debt that are at their root \nspending problems.\n  An article from the Tax Policy Center shows just how delusional it is \nto try and balance the budget through tax increases. In an article \ntitled, ``Desperately Seeking Revenue,'' the authors laid out what \ntypes of tax increases would be necessary, absent spending changes, to \nreduce Federal deficits to 2 percent of GDP for the 2015 to 2019 \nperiod.\n  This is a remarkable article. Its authors concluded that tax \nincreases consistent with the President's campaign pledge not to raise \ntaxes on individuals making less than $200,000 or families making less \nthan $250,000 would require the top two rates to go from 33 percent to \n85.7 percent and 35 percent to 90.9 percent.\n  This article makes clear, yet again, that we have a spending problem, \nnot a revenue problem. We are not going to make meaningful deficit \nreduction--we are not going to get the debt under control--by taxing \nthe so-called rich. Taxing citizens and businesses more is not going to \nfix what is essentially a spending problem.\n  Consider this chart. The top red line is the CBO baseline, the middle \nblue line is the President's budget plans. The bottom orange line is to \nextend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts and index the AMT, the Alternative \nMinimum Tax.\n  You can see here that under the President's budget plans, under the \nCBO baseline, and under the Republican position, individual income tax \nrevenues as a percentage of GDP are going up. Tax revenues are already \ngoing up, and they are not getting us where we need to be as a nation. \nYet in his remarks today, the President's landmark proposal is little \nmore than tax increases. I suppose we shouldn't be surprised.\n  When the Drudge report announced yesterday that the President was \ngoing to recommend tax increases, it did not even merit a flashing red \nlight. Drudge just pushed it to the side, because it is really no \nlonger news to anyone that Democrats want to raise taxes.\n\n[[Page S2429]]\n\n  The real news would have been if the President stood up to his \npolitical base and made meaningful recommendations for entitlement \nreform.\n  The people of Utah, and taxpayers around the country, would have \nstood up and listened if the President backed a serious rollback of \ndomestic non-defense discretionary spending, which has exploded on his \nwatch.\n  Instead, they got the economic philosophy of President Carter. Maybe \nthat statement isn't fair to President Carter. I don't know. It seems \nlike it has all the elements of fairness.\n  Ultimately, this spending crisis cannot be ignored, and both voters \nand markets will respond to the leaders who take this issue on in a \nserious way.\n  One of the problems with our colleagues on the other side and their \nwonderful desire to increase taxes on everybody is that those tax \nincreases would not go toward paying down the deficit. They would go \nfor more spending. That has been the case for all my 34 years in the \nSenate. Every time we have raised taxes, over the long run it has not \ngone toward bringing down the deficit. It has gone for more spending.\n  We Members of Congress have all kinds of ways of spending money, and \nour Father in Heaven knows we get a lot more credit for spending in \nthis country up through the years than we do for conserving. On the \nother hand, I don't think there is much credit coming today. I think \nmost everybody in America, including all those Democratic millionaires \nwho supported the President last time--maybe not all of them but a good \npercentage of them--are saying: Enough is enough.\n  I am hoping the President will give a speech someday that will make a \ndifference on spending because that is clearly the problem. It is not \ntax revenues, it is spending. I think we have had enough of that. I \nthink the American people, whether they be Democrats or Republicans, \nhave had enough of that. Even though we wish we could do more, we wish \nwe could help more people, we wish we could provide a new car for \neverybody in America, I am sure, but that is not reality. It is time to \nface up to reality and get this government spending under control.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are continuing to work on an agreement to \nmove ahead on small business. We have three main amendments--I should \nnot say ``main,'' but I think they are the ones on which we are \nfocused. One is an amendment by Senator Cornyn, one by Senator \nHutchison, and one by Senator Sanders. There are others who now have \ncome into the fray, and it is making it very difficult to get votes on \nthese three amendments, but that is where we are.\n  It is unfortunate. I think each of these amendments were offered in \ngood faith. We should be able to have a vote on them even though they \nhave virtually nothing to do with the small business bill, but I am \ngoing to continue to work to see if I can get universal agreement to \nget these amendments disposed of either by passing or bringing them up \nand moving toward completion of this bill. We should have been able to \ndo something in the last 2 days, but that is where we are.\n  Overhanging all this is the continuing resolution which we need to \nwork on tomorrow. If people have any feelings about that, I wish they \nwould come to the Senate floor to discuss it.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I watched with great interest President \nObama's speech about our spending and debt crisis. That is what I would \ncall it. He did not use as stark terms, unfortunately, but it is a \nspending and debt crisis.\n  First of all, I am at least a little encouraged that he is finally \nbeginning to enter the debate about this crisis. It is headed to a \ncrisis. It is the greatest domestic threat we face as a nation. At \nleast this speech acknowledges it is a huge threat and that his own \nbudget submitted a few months ago was a pass on all of those big issues \nand he needed a redo.\n  This is a great threat to all of our futures and prosperity. Let me \ntry to put it in a little bit of perspective.\n  Borrowing right now is at least 40 cents out of every $1 we spend. So \nfor every $1 the Federal Government spends, 40 cents of that--over 40 \ncents--is borrowed money. We are spending $3.7 trillion a year, but we \nare only taking in $2.2 trillion. Because of that, we have recently \nbeen racking up over $4 billion of new debt every day. So every day: \nnew debt of $4 billion a day. And a whole lot of that we owe to the \nChinese, more than $1 trillion. That eventually has very serious \nconsequences in terms of our prosperity, our future, the sort of \ncountry and vision and future we can leave for our kids.\n  As interest rates go up--which they inevitably will if we stay on \nthis path--that downright costs jobs. When interest rates go up 1 \npercent, Federal debt goes up $140 billion because the debt is so much. \nWhen those interest rates eventually go up, it makes it harder for all \nof us and our families to buy cars and homes, to pay tuition, to create \njobs if we are a small business.\n  ADM Mike Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said:\n\n       Our national debt is our biggest national security threat.\n\n  The highest ranking person in uniform in charge of our national \nsecurity says our biggest security threat is not Iran or North Korea or \nanyone else; it is actually this domestic debt issue. Debt at current \nlevels--which is 94 percent of GDP--economists say that is already \ncosting us about a million jobs because our debt level is so great.\n  Again, at least the President, in his speech today--which is \nessentially a do-over of his budget from a few months ago--at least the \nPresident is beginning to acknowledge that fundamental threat, and that \nis good. But we need more than a speech, we need more than a vision. We \nneed a real action plan, a detailed plan from the President, and we did \nnot get that today.\n  So my first reaction to the speech was that it was just that: It was \na speech. It was a nice sounding speech. It had a lot of nice themes. \nBut it was a speech. If the President, who is so quick to criticize \nCongressman Paul Ryan's budget--if he wants to enter the debate, he \nneeds to enter it on a par with that level of detail, that level of \nspecifics that Congressman Ryan and House Republicans gave. So the \nPresident needs to submit a new budget, a new detailed proposal, not \njust give a speech. Then we need to engage in a real debate and come up \nwith a plan, an action plan, to tackle this spending and debt issue. \nAnd we need to do that before we vote on any debt limit increase.\n  Speaking for myself, I am not going to consider increasing the debt \nlimit, which the President wants all of us to do, unless and until \nthere is tied to it a real plan to deal with this spending and debt \ncrisis. So this speech today, perhaps, was a start. But my general \nreaction is, we need more than a speech. We need specifics. We need a \nnew budget submission. Then we need to engage in a bipartisan \ndiscussion and negotiation. But we shouldn't wait until May, as the \nPresident suggested. That should start immediately--tomorrow--because \nwe need to hammer out meaningful details before any proposal comes to \nthe floor for votes to increase the debt limit.\n\n  In terms of the general themes the President struck, I have to say I \nwas\n\n[[Page S2430]]\n\ndisappointed because, to my ears, it was the same-old same-old.\n  The first theme was increasing taxes. He has been at that theme over \nand over again, and that was absolutely the first theme he hit in his \nspeech--increasing taxes. The problem is, if we look at the level of \ntaxation we have, it is not extraordinarily low, it is not somehow way \nbelow normal historical averages. What is way above normal historical \naverages is spending. So if we just look at the data compared to \nhistory, we have a runaway spending problem; we don't have a taxation \nproblem.\n  The second big theme the President hit was cutting defense spending. \nAgain, coming from a liberal, this is just the same-old same-old--a \ntraditional, predictable theme to cut defense. I don't think that is \nreally a new approach or a new discussion from the President.\n  The third big theme was to cut tax expenditures. A lot of folks, at \nleast in Louisiana, won't know what the heck that means, so let me \ntranslate. Cutting tax expenditures means increasing taxes. It means \ndoing away with certain deductions and certain credits. It means your \ntax bill goes up. I am all for Tax Code simplification. I think we need \nan enormously simplified Tax Code. I do think we need to get rid of a \nlot of deductions and credits, but that should be used to lower the \noverall rate, particularly rates such as the corporate tax rate, which, \nin the United States, is the highest of any industrialized country in \nthe world.\n  In terms of the theme of real cutting, that theme was very short on \nspecifics but very long on general statements, including that \nentitlement spending--things such as Medicare--would not be covered in \nreform in any way.\n  So when we look at these broad themes--and that is all there was, \nbroad themes, not specifics--it was, quite frankly, sorely \ndisappointing. But perhaps at least it is a start. As I said at the \nbeginning of my remarks, I hope it is a meaningful start, but to be a \nmeaningful start and to produce fruit, we need to go from a very broad, \nvery general speech to a detailed submission.\n  The President needs to resubmit his entire budget. This is a do-over, \nso he needs to resubmit a detailed budget which matches Congressman \nRyan's proposal in the level of detail, in the level of specifics the \nBudget Committee chairman in the House has provided. Then we need to \nimmediately get to a bipartisan discussion and negotiation. We \nshouldn't wait until May. That should start immediately for one simple \nreason: I don't think there is any chance of passing any increase to \nthe debt limit without having attached to it major reform, major \nstructural reform that ensures we are on a new path of lowering \nspending and lowering debt. Of course, I can only control one vote, but \nspeaking for myself, I will say that I won't even consider those \nproposals to increase the debt limit unless and until there is a \nproposal that passes the Congress to actually decrease the debt.\n  Ultimately, the problem isn't the debt limit; the problem is the \ndebt. When an individual has a spending problem or a credit card \nproblem, the solution isn't getting a higher limit on his credit card; \nthe solution is to deal with the spending and the debt problem, which \nis the underlying, core problem. The same here.\n  So we need to do that as we move forward in this debt-limit \ndiscussion. I hope we will all do that. I hope we will come together in \na meaningful, bipartisan way to do that--to actually attack the \nproblem, which is spending, which leads to the second problem, which is \ndebt, and actually propose and pass real structural reform before we \neven have any vote on increasing the debt limit. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to work constructively in that regard. I hope the \nPresident's speech is a start toward that, but, of course, time will \ntell, and actions versus words are what ultimately matter.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today more than 47 million Americans rely \non Medicare for their health care. For more than 45 years, seniors have \nhad access to the affordable, dependable health care Medicare provides.\n  We all recognize the cost of health care. We know it is growing and \ngrowing too rapidly. The landmark health reform law we passed recently \ntook bold steps to rein in costs, and I am eager to work with my \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle to further reduce health care \ncosts, increase efficiency, and root out the fraud and waste.\n  Last week, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, Congressman \nPaul Ryan, proposed a plan that would end Medicare as we know it. \nRather than providing affordable health care paid for by Medicare, as \nis the case today, under the Ryan plan, seniors would receive a voucher \nto purchase private health insurance--again, not health care benefits \nprovided for under Medicare but, rather, receive a voucher to purchase \nprivate health insurance from private health insurance companies.\n  Unfortunately, this voucher would fall far short of covering health \ncare costs for seniors. According to the independent Congressional \nBudget Office, under the Ryan plan, ``Most elderly people would pay \nmore''--I might add, much more--``for their health care than they would \npay under the current Medicare system.'' How much more? CBO says that \nunder the Ryan plan, the average 65-year-old would have to pay $12,000 \na year to receive the same level of benefits Medicare offers today--\n$12,000 a year. That is more than double what a senior would have to \npay under today's Medicare. So the Ryan plan would double the payments \nseniors have to make and the benefits would be reduced.\n  Under the Ryan plan, there would be no guaranteed benefits, which are \nprovided under Medicare today. As a result, private insurance companies \nwould dictate what care a senior received, ending the current doctor-\npatient relationship.\n  Our deficit, of course, is serious. It is very serious. It must be \naddressed. While we need to look for more ways to reduce our deficit, \nwe need to do so in a balanced and fair way. For starters, we shouldn't \nbalance the budget on the backs of seniors. We will not allow Medicare \nto be dismantled--not on our watch. Yesterday, Senator Bill Nelson and \nI introduced a sense-of-the-Senate resolution stating that ``Medicare \nshould not be dismantled and turned into a voucher or premium-support \nprogram.''\n  Deficit reduction should not simply shift costs to seniors, and that \nis exactly what the vouchers in the Ryan budget would do. A voucher \nsystem does nothing to lower health care costs. It does not guarantee \nthe benefits Medicare offers today. It does not provide access to \naffordable health care. Seniors deserve much better.\n  I listened closely to my colleague from Louisiana a few moments ago. \nFrankly, I am somewhat heartened. I heard from him that he wants to \nmove forward and that he would, he said indirectly, vote to increase \nthe debt limit if there is a credible plan to reduce deficits and our \nnational debt. I think that is a proposal with which the vast majority \nof Members of this body agree. Of course, the proof is in the pudding. \nIt is, what is that credible plan, what is that mechanism, what is that \nassurance that we are going to reduce the budget deficits prior to a \nvote to increase the debt limit?\n  It is very important that a vote to increase the debt limit occur \nwithout brinksmanship. We had far too much brinksmanship in the lead-up \nto the continuing resolution. It was just a matter of $2 billion or $3 \nbillion in the last eleventh hour.\n  The vote to increase the debt limit is a far more important vote. The \nstakes are much, much higher. The dollar amount is much greater. The \nfinancial markets will be watching very closely. And we, as Members of \nCongress, working with the President, must find a way to get the debt \nlimit increased but with assurance that we are going to get deficits \ndown and the debt down in a credible way, in a proper period of time so \nwe don't have to push up to that final moment, the final minute before \nthe vote on the debt limit occurs.\n  As I listened to my colleague from Louisiana, I sensed that he wants \nto find some way--and I think we all do; that is our challenge; that is \nour charge over the next couple of months--find that mechanism, find \nthat process that is credible, that makes sense, and that both sides \ncan buy into, not knowing exactly what the final result will be but \nknowing we are starting down a road to get the budget\n\n[[Page S2431]]\n\ndeficit under control in a balanced and fair way.\n  I do not mean to sound critical, but I don't think the Ryan budget \nproposal is balanced. I don't think it is fair. But I do think the vast \nmajority of the Members of the Senate do want to find a fair and \nbalanced solution, and it is up to us to find that before a vote on the \ndebt limit occurs.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, this afternoon, after a few days of \ngreat anticipation, the President laid out his version for long-term \ndeficit reduction and dealing with our long-term debt. Now that we have \nheard from him, I am afraid we are left with more questions than \nanswers.\n  Let me be clear. I welcome the President to the debate. I think it is \na positive sign. There is no more pressing issue for us to address than \nour dire fiscal situation and our economic challenges; both are \nintertwined. We are not going to be able to move the economy until we \ndeal with our impending debt crisis, and we cannot deal with fiscal \nproblems without growing the economy.\n  There has been a lot of good discussion about the unique dangers we \nface if we don't address our massive deficits and our debt which has \nnow accumulated to over $14 trillion. That amount, by the way, is equal \nto the entire size of the U.S. economy, making this the first time \nsince World War II that we have had a debt of that level. It is also a \nlot different now than it was then.\n  During World War II our debt was driven primarily by defense spending \nwhich would be quickly curtailed. We weren't looking at the incredible \nunfunded obligations, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security \nthat we have today. That is an unfunded obligation of over $100 \ntrillion. So we are in uncharted territory, unprecedented times. It is \nharming our economy today and, of course, it will devastate it in the \nfuture if we don't take action.\n  Economists tell us that with a debt of 90 percent of GDP we will \ntypically lose 1 point of economic growth. Again, this year our gross \ndebt is 100 percent of our GDP. By the way, a 1-percent reduction in \nour GDP in America means about 1 million jobs. So, already, with a \ngross debt of 100 percent of GDP, we have foregone jobs that we need in \nOhio and around the country.\n  This high indebtedness also comes with significant interest payments. \nOf course, even with interest rates being near zero today, the \nmagnitude of the U.S. debt still requires a debt service this year of \nover $200 billion. By the way, under the President's budget that number \nincreases to almost $1 trillion 10 years from now based on the CBO \nanalysis. That is $1 trillion a year just in interest payments on the \ndebt.\n  What concerns me is that interest rates could well go up given this \nclimate. A 1-percent increase in interest involves another $130 billion \nof interest payments. Think about that. Just a 1-percent increase in \ninterest rates means another $130 billion in interest payments. \nObviously, inflation would be causing additional damage to an already \nprecarious budget situation, and that is another great risk that we \nface.\n  Our current deficits are also increasingly financed by foreign \nholders of U.S. debt. At present, nearly half of U.S. publicly held \ndebt is held by foreign investors. As U.S. deficits are increasingly \nforeign-financed, of course, our interest payments are leaving the \ncountry. It is estimated that in 2010 interest payments to foreign \nentities and foreign individuals amounted to over $140 billion. That is \nbased on the new data from the Department of Commerce. It is not just \nabout these high debt payments, it is the fact that a lot of it is \ngoing overseas.\n  Our persistent deficits and pending debt crisis also introduces a lot \nof uncertainty into our economy. Some immediate evidence of this effect \nappears on the balance sheets of America's businesses, which shows $1.9 \ntrillion in liquid holdings. That means money is sitting on the \nsidelines rather than being invested in jobs, plants, and equipment. \nResolving the uncertainty surrounding future deficits will induce \ngreater investment as companies can plan more effectively.\n  We are already seeing these concerns manifest themselves in our \neconomy today. Capital markets are responding as investors, such as \nPIMCO, the largest holder of U.S. Treasuries, is out altogether, \ntelling us they no longer trust U.S. debt. What will happen if we don't \naddress these challenges is even more daunting.\n  According to the CBO, assuming the continuation of many current \npolicies, debt held by the public as a share of our GDP is projected to \nreach an implausibly high 947 percent of GDP by 2084. Of course, that \nwon't happen. The United States will face a debt crisis long before \nthat, but that demonstrates the unsustainability of the current fiscal \nsituation. No economic model could tell us what the economy would look \nlike in the future because by then these models will essentially fall \napart.\n  Over time the accumulation of debt increases the cost of debt \nservice, consuming a greater share of revenues, limiting budgetary \nresources for other priorities or for meeting unforeseen emergencies, \nsuch as a natural disaster or a war.\n  As time progresses a fiscal crisis resulting from high indebtedness \ncould occur rapidly as investors lose confidence in U.S. Treasuries. \nAbsent immediate policy changes, the United States would have to pay \nhigher yields on its own debt to roll over existing debt and avoid \ndefault. We are going to have to pay higher interest rates to attract \ninvestors to our country. In addition to the cost of an increase in \ninterest expense, higher interest rates, of course, would be \ndevastating for American families. Think about it. As interest rates go \nup, because Treasury rates go up, this means home mortgages go up. This \nmeans college loan payments go up. This means interest rates on car \nloans go up and on credit card activity and other loans. The economy is \ntough enough. We don't need higher interest rates, but that is upon us \nunless we act now.\n  The magnitude of the debt crisis would escalate as higher interest \ncosts require additional borrowing at high rates to continue to make \ninterest payments, which would ultimately grind the economy to a halt \nas investors lose confidence in the ability of the United States to \nrepay. The global impact of a U.S. debt crisis would be far reaching \nand truly unprecedented. We just went through a tough recession. We \ndon't need to relive that.\n  All things being equal, debt financing of current consumption \nnecessarily imposes future obligations on subsequent generations either \nin the form of higher taxes or reduced consumption of government \nservices. To avoid a debt crisis, any policy changes must begin sooner \nrather than later to minimize those effects that are, unfortunately, \nlikely to happen even if we act.\n  Given the threats and the crisis described, there is no doubt that \nAmerica needs real leadership to address this fiscal threat. While we \ncan debate some of the specifics in Congressman Ryan's budget, there is \nno doubt that the House Republican plan demonstrates necessary \nleadership on the severe fiscal challenges our country faces. This is \nin contrast to the plan President Obama sent to the Congress just 2 \nmonths ago. It not only rejects the serious recommendations from his \nown fiscal commission, but, unfortunately, as Erskine Bowles, the \nDemocratic cochair of the President's Commission said: ``It goes \nnowhere near where they will have to go to resolve our fiscal \nnightmare.''\n\n  Unfortunately, the President's speech today provides no specifics as \nhow to resolve that fiscal nightmare.\n  More spending, more borrowing, and more taxes are not a prescription \nfor spending constraint and economic growth. Since President Obama took \noffice, we have seen trillions in new spending and record deficits. The \nFebruary budget I talked about just locks that new spending in place, \ndoing nothing to pull back from this dangerous spiral of debt.\n  Let us be clear, this is not just a budget issue, it is an economic \nissue, and it is definitely a jobs issue. Not only will debt and \ndeficit have a long-\n\n[[Page S2432]]\n\nterm impact on our children and grandchildren who will have to foot the \nbill for today's spending, but we are beginning to see this immediate \nimpact on economic stability and job growth as the cost of our debt \nbegins to crowd out private sector investment. We have to move quickly \nto substantially reduce the debt and deficit to strengthen our fiscal \nhouse and, in doing so, foster job creation in States such as mine--\nOhio--and around the country.\n  The Commission's plan that the President rejected in December cuts \ndeficits by about $4.1 trillion compared to the baseline of current \npolicy over a 10-year period. It brings our deficits to 1.2 percent of \nour economy by 2020. Compare that to today, where we are at almost 10 \npercent of our economy. So it sets a standard--over $4 trillion in \nreductions in the deficit and an annual deficit that is 1.2 percent, \nwhich incidentally is where our budget deficit was about 4 years ago. \nCongressman Ryan's budget got there by bringing deficits down by about \n$4.2 trillion by 2021, as compared to a comparable baseline, to the \nCommission's report--so $4.1 trillion, $4.2 trillion--and the deficit \nis about 1.5 percent of GDP.\n  The President's own budget, again submitted here to Congress about 2 \nmonths ago, is very different. His budget merely gets one-quarter of \nthe way there--$1.1 trillion--and that assumes all the administration's \nclaimed savings occur and it assumes, frankly, there is a higher rate \nof economic growth than the Congressional Budget Office thinks there \nwill be, which actually wipes out the deficit savings the President \nclaims.\n  So we have very different visions, don't we? We have the fiscal \ncommission on the one hand and the Ryan budget in the $4 trillion range \nand then a plan by the President that does not get us moving forward in \nterms of deficit reduction--in effect, doubles the debt in the next 10 \nyears.\n  Evidently, after seeing Republicans move forward last week and now \nthis week in the House and after seeing how, on a bipartisan basis and \naround the country, people reacted to his budget, President Obama has \nrealized he needs to move forward with a new proposal. In a sense, he \nis asking for a mulligan, and I think that is good. I think it is good \nhe has acknowledged this problem is deeper and more serious than his \nbudget proposal indicated, and we need to move forward together.\n  Unfortunately, again, the President did not offer specifics today, \nunlike the Ryan budget, which takes some bold and courageous and tough \nsteps but does offer specifics. The President chose instead to squander \nhis opportunity to offer a real way forward on tackling our structural \nfiscal problems. He did talk about $4 trillion in deficit reduction--\nand I appreciate that--but again did not offer a way to get there. The \nnational commission he formed, and which reported in December, told the \nPresident there was a way to get there, and I hope the President will \nrelook at his own Commission and other proposals, such as the Ryan \nproposal.\n  As the President made clear, we have been debating just 12 percent of \nthe budget. He is right about that. There is some defense spending that \nis involved, but for the most part it is a very small part of the \nbudget. So what does his proposal do to address these additional \nchallenges? I didn't hear anything today about serious proposals to \naddress the entitlement programs, which are incredibly important \nprograms but on an unsustainable footing.\n  On Medicare, the President proposed delegating future unspecified \nsavings to a government board--unelected and unaccountable. On \nMedicaid, the President seems to be delegating responsibility to the \nNational Governors Association. On Social Security, the President told \nus today it doesn't contribute to our deficit, despite the fact the \nprogram is in cash deficit this year by $45 billion--$45 billion less \nin payroll taxes than the payments going out.\n  The President proposed $4 trillion in deficit reduction. Yet he has \nshrunk, at this point, from the responsibility of telling us how he \nwould achieve it, except that he would leave the challenge largely to \nothers, while pursuing tax increases that I fear would harm the little \nrecovery we see coming out of this deep recession.\n  So I look forward to working with Members on both sides of the aisle \nand the President to address the serious challenges we have talked \nabout today. I wish we had seen more specifics today, but I am \nencouraged to see that at least the President is engaging in the game. \nI welcome his involvement because it is too important for us not to \nhave involvement from both sides of the aisle. Without White House \nleadership, we cannot move forward.\n  As the President so often says, let's get focused not on the next \nelection but on the next generation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, the Senate will have before it today or \ntomorrow, depending upon the flow around here, two very misguided \nbills. This will come about when we have our budget come up for a vote. \nUnder an agreement to get that budget up, we are going to have a vote \non two separate bills. One bill would totally repeal and defund the \naffordable care act--the health care reform bill we passed--and the \nother one would prevent funding for Planned Parenthood. So I wish to \ntake a few minutes on the floor of the Senate to speak about how \nmisguided these two bills are.\n  First, let me talk about the bill that would defund the affordable \ncare act. This bill we will be voting on will prohibit any funds \nappropriated this year and any funds appropriated in any prior year \nfrom being used to carry out the affordable care act. This would remove \nthe engine from health care reform while the train is steaming down the \ntrack.\n  So, again, why are we voting on this? The reason is, Republicans have \ntried a frontal assault on the affordable care act--a debate on the \nmerits--and they failed. This body voted down Senator McConnell's \namendment to the FAA authorization bill that would have repealed health \nreform in its entirety. But I guess what we can't do directly, we try \nto do indirectly. So now the Republicans are trying to undermine health \nreform by other means, such as defunding it.\n  Well, this strategy only makes sense if you are absolutely obsessed--\nobsessed--with tearing down health care reform. Make no mistake about \nit, this bill is the equivalent of repeal. By depriving the bill of all \nfunding, it would turn back the clock on all we have accomplished over \nthe past year.\n\n  It would take us back to the bad old days, when insurance companies \nwere in the driver's seat, telling us what kinds of health care we are \nentitled to and when we are entitled to it.\n  Instead of protecting all Americans against arbitrary limits on \ncoverage, repeal would take us back to the days when insurance \ncompanies could turn off our coverage just when we are the sickest. \nThat would hurt families such as the Grasshoffs from Texas, who \ntestified before my committee earlier this year. They were unable to \nfind coverage that would pay for their son's hemophilia treatment until \nthe affordable care act banned lifetime limits.\n  Instead of allowing young people starting a new job or a new business \nor going off to school to stay on their parents' insurance until age \n26, repeal would make them fend for themselves in a chaotic market that \noffers too little coverage for too much money. That would hurt folks \nsuch as Emily Schlichting, who suffers from a rare autoimmune disorder \nthat would make her uninsurable in the bad old days. But because of the \naffordable care act, she is able to stay on her parents' policy until \nshe is 26. Yet at a HELP Committee hearing in January--this is Emily, a \nwonderful young woman--she said:\n\n       Young people are the future of this country and we are the \n     most affected by the reform--we're the generation that is \n     most uninsured. We need the Affordable Care Act because it is \n     literally an investment in the future of this country.\n\n  It would also hurt folks such as Carol in Ankeny, IA, whose 19-year-\nold daughter was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes 9 years ago. Thanks to \nthe affordable care act, Carol doesn't have to worry about her \ndaughter's preexisting condition, disqualifying her for insurance \ncoverage, and she can stay on her parents' health insurance coverage \nafter college.\n  Carol also doesn't have to worry about the cost of her daughter's \ncare running up against the lifetime cap that would be imposed by an \ninsurance\n\n[[Page S2433]]\n\ncompany. Health care reform banned those limits. Carol wrote me a very \nnice letter to say thank you for doing the right thing.\n  Instead of protecting nearly half of nonelderly Americans who have \npreexisting conditions--such as high blood pressure, diabetes or heart \ndisease--from denial of coverage, repeal would put insurance companies \nback in the driver's seat, picking and choosing whom to cover.\n  Instead of helping small businesses, struggling in this recession \nwith the cost of insurance premiums, repeal of the affordable care act \nwould take away $40 billion in tax credits that reduce premiums for \nsmall businesses.\n  Instead of helping all Americans prevent illness or disease by \nproviding free preventive services such as mammograms and \ncolonoscopies, repeal would allow insurers to charge expensive copays \nfor these important services, thus discouraging people from getting \ntheir colonoscopies or mammogram screenings.\n  If we pass this bill--this bill to defund the affordable care act--\nCongress will turn its back on America's seniors, tossing our hard-won \nimprovements in Medicare benefits and damaging the program's fiscal \nhealth. It would reopen the Medicare Part D doughnut hole, exposing \nmillions of seniors to the full cost of drugs when they need the most \nassistance. Repealing the affordable care act would increase seniors' \ndrug prices, on average, by more than $800 this year and $3,500 over \nthe next 10 years.\n  Repeal would roll back the unprecedented investment the affordable \ncare act makes in Medicare fraud prevention. Turning back the \naffordable care act would hurt seniors' access to health care in rural \nareas by eliminating incentive payments that are in the affordable care \nact paid to rural primary care providers.\n  Repealing--or defunding, as this bill would do--the affordable care \nact would roll back improvements to Medicare payment policy, \ncoordination, and efficiency that extends the life of the Medicare \ntrust fund by a decade. In addition, Secretary Sebelius has informed us \nthat payments to Medicare providers would be significantly disrupted by \nthis bill, which again will defund the affordable care act.\n  Finally, we come to the part of this debate even Alice in Wonderland \nwould have a tough time understanding. The House Republicans have \nplayed the Washington stage for all it is worth over the last few \nweeks, making great solemn speeches to the balconies and to the \naudiences about the deficit and the debt. But as a condition for \nagreeing to fund the government for the remainder of this year, what \nare they demanding? They want to defund and, thus, repeal the \naffordable care act--one of the best and biggest deficit-reducing \nmeasures in decades.\n  The Affordable Care Act reduces the deficit by $210 billion in the \nnext 10 years, more than $1 trillion in the next 10 years. Again, here \nis a chart that shows that. In the next 10 years, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, the Affordable Care Act will reduce the \ndeficit by $210 billion. Therefore, if you repeal it you would increase \nthe deficit by $210 billion.\n  Here is where the real savings come. In the next decade the \nCongressional Budget Office says the Affordable Care Act will reduce \nthe deficit by $1 trillion. So if you defund it, as this bill would do, \nyou will increase the deficit by $1 trillion. That is what the \nRepublicans want, they want to absolutely increase the deficit. They \nmust, because they want to do away with the Affordable Care Act.\n  Let me get this straight. The Republicans are proposing to reduce the \ndeficit by--increasing the deficits? As I said, somehow I have a \nfeeling when I hear that, we are not in Kansas any longer. This is \n``Alice in Wonderland'' kind of thinking.\n  We have to stop the silly game. This debate is not about deficit \nreduction, it is about tearing down health reform, no matter what. No \nmatter if it does increase the deficit, get rid of it, get rid of \nhealth reform. It is about giving control back to wealthy, powerful \nhealth insurance companies that can raise your rates, deny you \nbenefits, and make increasingly more profit.\n  Nothing makes the nature of the agenda of my friends on the \nRepublican side more clear than the 2012 proposed budget released by \nthe Republican House Budget Committee chairman last week. The \nRepublican budget plan is very simple: a massive transfer of wealth \nfrom low-and middle-income Americans to the wealthiest in our country. \nTwo-thirds of the budget savings in the Republican budget proposal come \nfrom drastically cutting programs that serve those with modest means, \nwhile permanently extending President Bush's tax cuts for the rich.\n  How is this massive wealth shift paid for? They would repeal the \nmajority of the Affordable Care Act, taking coverage away from more \nthan 32 million Americans who would be covered under current law. \nStarting in 2022, the Republican budget proposal eliminates Medicare as \nwe know it, turning over the program to private health insurance \ncompanies. Instead of enrolling seniors in Medicare, the Republicans' \nplan would give them a voucher to go out and buy private insurance \ncoverage on the open market. Since the voucher would not keep up with \nrising medical costs, seniors would fall farther and farther behind.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has said this would more than double \nout-of-pocket costs for seniors entering the program in 2022; it would \ntriple the costs by 2030. Where would that money go? To the private \nhealth insurance industry. That sounds kind of familiar, doesn't it?\n  The Republicans' obsession with repealing the new health reform law \nis not based on budgetary considerations. It is based strictly on \nideology. In 1965, President Johnson and this Congress passed Medicare, \nensuring seniors access to decent health care. Republicans fought it \nbitterly then and 45 years later they are still trying to undo it. Here \nthey go again. The choice before us is to go forward or to be dragged \nbackward. Let us come together as a united American people, create a \nreformed health care system that works not just for the healthy and the \nwealthy but for all Americans.\n  There is a second bill we will be voting on in conjunction with the \nbudget. The Republicans insisted on this in order to have a vote on the \nbudget. It is equally as misguided and as dangerous, I think, as the \nother bill. This second bill would prohibit a law-abiding and \nextraordinarily successful organization from participating in fair \ncompetition for Federal funding. This entity would, of course, be \nPlanned Parenthood.\n  Again, let's be clear what this bill is not about. It is not about \nthe need to prevent Federal funds from being used to pay for abortions. \nLongstanding rules under the title X program already strictly prohibit \nthe use of taxpayer dollars to fund abortions. What is more, every \nappropriations bill for the last two decades has stated that no funds \ncan be used for any abortion.\n  This bill is not about abortion. It is about banning a specific \norganization from even competing for Federal funds, simply because some \npeople don't agree with that organization. This would create a very \ndisturbing and dangerous precedent. When Congress creates a program, it \ntypically specifies rules or criteria for participation in that \nprogram. Anyone who or any organization that agrees to play by these \nrules and criteria is eligible to compete. Planned Parenthood is \nplaying by the rules. That is one reason it is one of the most widely \nrespected health care providers in the United States.\n  Of 5.2 million women served every year by the title X program, 1 out \nof 3, 31 percent, receive care at Planned Parenthood health centers. If \nsomeone can show me a specific clinic that is not following the rules, \nby all means take away their funding. But that is not what this bill \ndoes. This bill says Planned Parenthood as an entity would be banned \nfrom even competing to provide services under title X, despite the fact \nthat they conform to all of the rules of the program.\n  It doesn't only ban Planned Parenthood from offering family planning \nservices. That is one aspect of what Planned Parenthood does. But this \nbill would turn away nearly 1 million women a year who receive cervical \ncancer screenings through Planned Parenthood clinical services, as well \nas 830,000 women every year who get breast exams at Planned Parenthood \nclinical services. They would turn away countless hundreds of thousands\n\n[[Page S2434]]\n\nof women and men who receive physical exams and immunizations at \nPlanned Parenthood clinical services.\n  My office has been deluged by e-mails and phone calls from Iowans and \nother Americans who oppose this misguided effort to ban Planned \nParenthood from receiving funding under title X. I stand with them in \nsupport of the important services these clinics provide to women and \nmen throughout the country.\n  A constituent of mine writes:\n\n       Dear Senator Harkin,\n       I want to let you know that cutting funds to Planned \n     Parenthood will jeopardize the lives of many of the women and \n     some of the men who go there for basic reproductive health \n     screenings. I say this with confidence, as Planned Parenthood \n     was the only clinic I could afford 10 years ago, to obtain \n     yearly Pap smears. It was Planned Parenthood that found my \n     cervical cancer and referred me to a specialist for \n     treatment. Due to the existence and actions of Planned \n     Parenthood, I am alive today as a healthy and contributing \n     member of society. I work with undergraduate and graduate \n     students, and several of them have mentioned that Planned \n     Parenthood was their only option for affordable screenings. . \n     . . Please ensure that government funding will be allocated \n     to Planned Parenthood. Please do not have young or \n     socioeconomically strapped women potentially lose their life \n     over a cancer that is remedied when caught in its early \n     stages.\n\n  That was the end of her letter. We need to listen to voices such as \nthis. We need to listen to the women of America who rely on Planned \nParenthood.\n  Finally, I believe this bill goes to the heart of whether we can \nreach common ground on something on which we should all agree, the need \nto find ways to reduce the need for abortions in America. Let me say at \nthe outset I strongly believe that we must preserve the right of every \nwoman to her own reproductive choices that exist under the Supreme \nCourt's decision in Roe v. Wade. But to reduce the number of abortions \nwe must prevent unwanted pregnancies, just as we must also support \nwomen who want to carry their pregnancies to term. That is precisely \nwhat title X funding accomplishes. Family planning services at title X \nhealth centers, including Planned Parenthood, prevent an estimated \n973,000 unintended pregnancies a year and this in turn obviates what a \nwoman might turn to in desperation, for hundreds of thousands of \nabortions every year.\n  Unfortunately, during the debate on Planned Parenthood in recent days \nwe have heard many wild and inaccurate claims about the work of this \ndedicated organization. On that score, I have always agreed with my \nformer colleague, the late Senator Pat Moynihan, who said, ``People are \nentitled to their own opinions but they are not entitled to their own \nfacts.'' Last week our distinguished colleague, the junior Senator from \nArizona, stood here on the floor of the Senate and stated that abortion \n``is well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does.'' He stated \nit right here on the Senate floor, the junior Senator from Arizona.\n  Of course that is grossly inaccurate. Planned Parenthood spends the \noverwhelming majority of its resources keeping women healthy and \npreventing the need for abortion in the first place. The fact--the \nfact--is that just 3 percent of Planned Parenthood services are related \nto abortion.\n  When news organizations asked the office of the Senator from Arizona \nfor evidence of his claim, a spokesperson bizarrely stated: ``His \nremark was not intended to be a factual statement.'' What was it \nintended to be? The floor of the Senate is not the place for \ndestructive and false assertions, especially when used to argue that an \norganization should be redlined and singled out for discrimination.\n  For the record, Planned Parenthood is one of the most respected \nwomen's health organizations in the United States. It courageously \ndefends the right of women in America to make informed, independent \ndecisions about their health and family planning. By providing women \nwith counsel and contraception, Planned Parenthood prevents countless \nunwanted pregnancies and thereby reduces the number of abortions in \nthis country. Lest there be any misunderstanding, I intend this as a \nfactual statement.\n  Let me conclude by making clear that the one certain impact of this \nbill, if it were passed, would be to increase the number of abortions \nin America. This bill would dramatically erode the effectiveness of \ntitle X in preventing unintended pregnancies, preventing sexually \ntransmitted infections, detecting cancers early, keeping people healthy \nthrough quality preventive care. It would have this impact because this \nmisguided bill would ban an extraordinarily successful organization, \nPlanned Parenthood, from providing these services.\n  On this bill we have to say no to unintended pregnancies and \nunnecessary abortions; say no to this misguided and counterproductive \nbill.\n  We will have this vote on the budget but then we have these two side \nvotes, one that would defund the Affordable Care Act and send us back \nto the bad old days of health insurance companies deciding who gets \nwhat when at insanely big profits to them; second, it would ban Planned \nParenthood from even applying to be a provider of health resources and \nservices to 5.2 million women every year in this country.\n  I hope that Congress, the Senate, will rise above these misguided \nbills, will rise above unfactual assertions made on the floor of the \nSenate no matter how they were intended, and that we will make sure \nPlanned Parenthood can continue to provide the vital services it does \nin this country.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, after much drama and anticipation late \nlast Friday night, literally minutes before the government was \nscheduled to shut down, as we all know, a deal was struck to pass a \nweeklong continuing resolution and keep the government operating. That \nwas the seventh continuing resolution we have passed since the start of \nthe fiscal year last October.\n  Now we are appearing to consider the eighth and final continuing \nresolution to fund the government for the remaining 5 months of the \nfiscal year. Amazing. Eight continuing resolutions were necessary to \nfund the government for 1 year because my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle neglected to bring a single one of the annual appropriations \nbills to the floor for consideration last year.\n  As my colleagues know, in addition to continued funding for all \ngovernment operations, the measure we will consider tomorrow includes \nappropriations for the Department of Defense for the remainder of the \nfiscal year. Unfortunately, on top of the typical run-of-the-mill \nWashington budget gimmickry, this agreement also contains a gross \nmisallocation of imperative defense resources.\n  The Defense Department funding portion of this bill proposes $513 \nbillion for the routine operations of the Department of Defense and \napproximately $17 billion in military construction, for a total of $530 \nbillion. This amount is $19 billion less than the President's fiscal \nyear 2011 budget request for the Defense Department and its related \nmilitary construction projects and $10 billion less than the $540 \nbillion the Secretary of Defense had testified was the minimum amount \nthe Department needed to execute its national defense mission.\n  In addition, this bill also funds an additional $157.8 billion for \noverseas contingency operations, or war funding, to support our troops \nin combat, consistent with the President's budget request.\n  I might add that the amounts Secretary Gates described as essential \nin January did not foresee that the United States would expend more \nthan $650 million enforcing the no-fly zone in Libya, an amount that \nwill most likely increase over the remaining months of the fiscal year.\n  While this may seem like a defense funding level that we can live \nwith in a tough fiscal climate bill, the bill is not what it appears to \nbe on the surface.\n  As the Secretary of Defense pointed out last week, funding to support \nthe warfighter is degraded in this bill because billions in the war-\nfunding accounts--my staff has estimated close to $8 billion--have been \nallocated by the Appropriations Committee for new spending not \nrequested by the administration or transferred to pay items\n\n[[Page S2435]]\n\nthat were originally requested in the base budget for nonwar-related \nexpenses. For instance, the bill shifts $3.2 billion in nonwar funding \nto the war-funding account to artificially lower defense spending for \nday-to-day operations but by doing so reduces funds for the warfighter. \nHere is an example. The appropriators have added $495 million for nine \nadditional F-18s and funds them as part of the war-funding budget even \nthough we have not lost any F-18s in the current conflicts.\n  Additionally, the appropriators added $4.8 billion in unrequested \nfunding to the war-funding part of the Defense bill for programs and \nactivities that the President and Secretary Gates did not seek. For \nexample, $192 million was added for additional missile defense \ninterceptors. There was no administration request for these funds. And \nmissile defense expenses are in no way related to the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  So this bill uses gimmicks and shell games to artificially lower the \ndefense base budget rather than playing by the rules and actually \ndemonstrating our commitment to fiscal responsibility. By doing so, it \ntakes away billions of dollars that were originally requested for \nongoing combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to support our troops \nwhere it is most needed.\n  Within the $19 billion lower top line of the base defense budget, \nthis bill continues business as usual with cuts exceeding $5 billion to \nthe amounts the President and Secretary Gates requested for critical \ndefense programs in order to pay for over $3.7 billion in unjustified \nand unexplained increases to other accounts.\n  In addition to these shifts away from the Department of Defense \npriorities, this bill also adds over $1.4 billion for projects that \nwere not requested by the Department and are not considered core \nactivities of the Department of Defense.\n  Let me give you examples of those misallocated resources. It includes \n$473 million in non-Department of Defense medical research not \nrequested in the President's budget; $227 million in other medical \nresearch related to Department of Defense fields but not requested by \nthe Pentagon; $550 million for local roads and schools not requested by \nthe administration. It adds an additional $3.7 billion in program \nincreases not justified by an unfunded request by the service chiefs or \nby the administration; adds unrequested funds for the Red Cross, $24 \nmillion; Special Olympics, $1.2 million; youth mentoring programs, $20 \nmillion. These are good programs, but they have no place in the \nDepartment of Defense. They should be in other areas. It cuts about $1 \nbillion in military construction requested in the President's budget, \nincluding $258 million for projects in Bahrain, the headquarters of the \nNavy's Fifth Fleet. It adds a reporting provision designed to be the \nfirst step in forcing the National Guard to buy firefighting aircraft \nrather than lease commercially available aircraft. It authorizes a \nmultiyear procurement of Navy MH-60 helicopters.\n  I want to be clear here. I know that cancer research is a popular \ncause on a bipartisan basis and that it has value in the larger scheme \nof things. I am not against funding for medical research to fight the \nscourge of cancer and other diseases. I support funding for these \nprograms that are requested by the administration for the Department of \nHealth and Human Services. But this sort of general medical research \nfunding has no place in a defense bill. Placing it there, which the \nappropriators have done year after year, undercuts the fiscal \nresponsibility and prioritization process we expect our Federal \nagencies to undertake when allocating scarce resources.\n  So the Department of Defense is not only getting a significantly \nlower amount in its 2011 budget--$19 billion below what it asked for to \nsupport its routine operations and carry out its day-to-day national \nsecurity mission and $10 billion below what Secretary Gates said in \nJanuary was essential for the Department's ability to continue \nto function, but it is also being directed to spend about $8 billion in \nfunding for items that do not directly support the men and women in the \nmilitary.\n\n  Let me point out one more disturbing aspect of the DOD portion of \nthis bill. I understand from an exchange between my staff and the staff \nof the Senate Appropriations Committee that the committee is \nappropriating only ``top-line dollar amounts'' in this bill and not \nproviding the customary tables, which is the description for each \naccount, which outline the specifics of what is being funded. Instead, \nI have learned that the committee plans to communicate directly with \nthe Office of the Secretary of Defense on funding levels in specific \nitems.\n  I do not have a problem with the Appropriations Committee providing a \ntop-line dollar amount to the Pentagon and allowing the Secretary of \nDefense to fund our national security priorities as he sees fit. I am \ndeeply concerned about the lack of transparency associated with this \nplan. I hope it is not a way to get around the earmark moratorium \ncurrently in place in both Houses. If a Member of Congress is \ndictating, through the Appropriations Committee, the use of scarce \ndefense funds, it is an earmark, even if it was done over the phone. I \nurge the Department of Defense to not view such communications as law \nor a mandate.\n  As I noted earlier, in addition to the misallocation of defense \nresources, this so-called deal uses typical Washington smoke-and-mirror \ntactics to achieve savings. According to expert analysis and numerous \npress reports, the agreement reached by negotiators last week used some \nof the same budget tricks and gimmickry that have helped us to \naccumulate our current deficit of $1.4 trillion and a debt of over \n$14.3 trillion.\n  Yesterday, in an article by Andrew Taylor of the Associated Press, it \nwas reported that details of last week's hard-won agreement to avoid a \ngovernment shutdown and cut Federal spending by $38 billion were \nreleased Tuesday morning. They reveal that the budget cuts, while \nhistoric, were significantly eased by pruning money left over from \nprevious years using accounting sleight of hand and going after \nprograms President Obama had targeted anyway. The article also noted \nthat details of the agreement ``reveal a lot of one-time savings and \ncuts that officially score as cuts to pay for spending elsewhere, but \noften have little or no impact on the deficit.''\n  Additionally, an editorial appeared in today's Wall Street Journal \ntitled ``Spending Cut Hokum: GOP leaders hyped their budget savings.'' \nIn part, the editorial states:\n\n       After separating out the accounting gimmicks and one-year \n     savings, the actual cuts look to be closer to $20 billion \n     than to the $38 billion that both sides advertized. But the \n     continuing resolution also saves money on paper through \n     phantom cuts. The whopper is declaring $6.2 billion in \n     savings by not spending money left from the 2010 Census. \n     Congress also cuts $4.9 billion from the Justice Department's \n     Crime Victims Fund, but much of that money was tucked away in \n     a reserve fund that would not have been spent this year in \n     any event.\n       The budgeteers claim $630 million in cuts from what are \n     called ``orphan earmarks,'' or construction that never \n     started, and $2 billion more for transportation projects, \n     some of which were likely to be canceled. The Associated \n     Press reports that $350 million in savings comes from a 2009 \n     program to pay diary farmers to compensate for low milk \n     prices. Milk prices are higher this year, so some of that \n     money also would never have been spent.\n       An estimated $17 billion comes from one-time savings in \n     mandatory programs. The cuts are real, but the funding gets \n     restored by law the next year, which means Republicans will \n     have to refight the same battles. States lose some $3.5 \n     billion in bonus money to enroll more kids in the Children's \n     Health Insurance Program, but many states failed to qualify \n     for that extra funding. These cuts don't reduce the spending \n     baseline, so there are no compound savings over time.\n       None of this is enough to defeat the budget at this point, \n     but it is infuriating given the GOP leadership's flogging of \n     that $38 billion top-line figure.\n\n  Is that the best we can offer the American people right now? In these \ntough economic times, with record debt and deficits and 8.8 percent \nunemployment, we give them smoke and mirrors, budget gimmickry, and \naccounting sleight of hand. Our government is bloated and precious \ntaxpayer dollars are squandered in nearly every agency. You can't pick \nup a newspaper or go online without seeing reports of waste and \nduplication throughout Federal bureaucracies. I am pleased some real \ncuts have been made, but we need to do much more. This deal does little \nto address the very serious fiscal issues we face as a nation.\n  I hope as we address the next crisis, which will be, obviously, as we \nreach the debt limit, that we will have more\n\n[[Page S2436]]\n\nserious plans. I also believe it is vitally important, before we raise \nthe debt limit, that we can put this Nation on a path to a balanced \nbudget. We cannot afford to continue to borrow 40 cents out of every \ndollar we spend in Washington. We cannot afford, as the commercial that \nmany of us have seen on television, to have the Chinese own America's \nmoney, and the United States be in such debt that China has an \nincreasing and unhealthy influence on the United States.\n  I intend to vote for this agreement. I believe we could have done a \nlot better, but it is a step in the right direction. It is the first \ntime we have made serious efforts to reduce spending in quite a number \nof years around here. I hope it will serve as something that the \nAmerican people can support and spur us on to greater efforts in the \ncoming weeks and months.\n  I notice the presence of the majority leader, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as the country learned today, certainly we \nlearned in Nevada, there was a terrifying close call at the Reno \nairport last night. It is a miracle that everyone is OK today, and we \nare grateful they are.\n  This is what happened. Only one air traffic controller was in the \ntower during last night's overnight shift. Medical aircraft carrying a \ncritically ill passenger couldn't land because the controller fell \nasleep on the job. We now know that the pilot circled several times. We \nnow know that he tried to call the tower not once, not twice, but seven \ntimes. The controller slept through every one of the calls. He slept \nthrough the circling of the aircraft.\n  More than 15 minutes later, with the passenger critically ill in the \nairplane, minutes during which no one could reach the air traffic \ncontroller while this critically ill passenger suffered in that \naircraft, the pilot landed without any guidance from the airport.\n  The Reno airport is situated right below the great Sierra Nevada \nMountains. It is an extremely difficult place to land. Those of us who \nhave been landing there for all these years know how terribly rough it \nis many times coming out of there with the winds coming off the \nSierras. To think this pilot was forced to land without any control on \nthe land is very scary.\n  This should not happen in Nevada. It should not happen anywhere in \nthe country. It shouldn't happen in any airplane, and it certainly \nshouldn't happen to an air ambulance.\n  Just a short time ago, I spoke with Secretary of Transportation Ray \nLaHood. I am very happy he is acting, and acting quickly, to make sure \nthis never happens again in Reno or anywhere else. We know we had an \nexperience a few weeks ago right here in Washington, DC, the same type \nof situation.\n  Why did it happen? Reno was one of 27 airports across the country \nthat sometimes had only one air traffic controller on the overnight \nshift. Because of Secretary LaHood's quick action, there will now be \nzero--effective immediately, every airport will have at least two air \ntraffic controllers in the tower at any given time.\n  As I indicated, I have flown into and out of that airport many times. \nIn October I was there for a celebration. We were opening a new control \ntower. It was very badly needed. From the old one, you couldn't see \nparts of the runway. When Reno's old control tower was built, Dwight \nEisenhower was President and the Dodgers were in Brooklyn. In the half \ncentury since, the area's population has more than tripled. So it was \nfitting, we said at the time, that the airport open a control tower \nthree times as tall as the old one.\n  Last night's near tragedy reminds us that state-of-the-art structures \nand the best technology work only as well as the people operating them. \nIf these people fall asleep on the job, literally, they risk the lives \nof millions of Americans flying into and out of airports every day.\n  Secretary LaHood and Randy Babbitt, FAA Administrator, are doing \ntheir jobs. I appreciate their responsiveness and share their outrage \nthat this ever happened, but Congress also has a key role to play. We \nhave to do our jobs.\n  The Senate passed a bill in February to modernize America's air \ntravel. With that legislation we created or saved 280,000 jobs. It \nwould improve aviation safety and protect travelers, and that is an \nunderstatement. It would even help reduce delays, improve access to \nrural communities, and it would do all this while creating jobs.\n  The Republican House also passed a companion bill a few days ago, but \nthe House bill is almost the opposite of ours. It is dangerous. It \ndoesn't protect passengers, it imperils passengers. The Republican bill \nwould cut the modern navigation systems at our Nation's airports. It is \nhard to comprehend--an FAA bill, to which we have had to give short-\nterm extensions--I don't know exactly the number of times but like 14 \ndifferent times--now we are going to try to pass a bill that doesn't \nmodernize our navigation systems at our airports. That would be wrong.\n  The FAA said the House bill would force it to furlough safety-related \nemployees--not just any employees but those whose primary job is \nkeeping air travel safe. That doesn't make any sense. It would also \nkeep airports from making the infrastructure improvements they need and \nwould completely end the program that ensures rural communities--in \nsmall towns such as Ely, NV--have air service.\n  The Senate-passed bill and the House-passed bill are now in \nconference to work out the differences. Clearly, there are a lot of \ndifferences. The conferees have some choices to make, and they are \nimportant, but they need to make them quickly so that both Houses can \npass this bill and send it to the President, and do it quickly.\n  This bill passed on a huge bipartisan vote. Again, we are grateful \neveryone in Reno is OK, but the next time we may not be so fortunate. \nLet's make our airports and our travel as safe as possible as soon as \npossible so the next time we don't have to rely on luck. That is what \nit was.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I suppose I and a lot of my colleagues \nhad an opportunity to hear the President's speech this afternoon. It is \nvery nice that the President is being engaged for the first time in the \nbudget debate and the long-term fiscal problems of this country, and \nthe deficit problems of this country. It is good he is following on \nwith some of the recommendations of his own deficit reduction \ncommission. We have to remember a little less than a year ago he \nappointed a deficit reduction commission. They reported on December 5. \nIt seems as though they had broad bipartisan support because the four \nSenators on the commission--two Democrats and two Republicans with \nprobably very different political philosophies of the four--have \nendorsed it. Then, all of a sudden, since December 5 until today, there \nhas been a lot of quiet on the part of the President of the United \nStates about whether he\n\n[[Page S2437]]\n\nlikes what his deficit commission suggested.\n  I don't know the details of where he is coming from, whether he \nagrees with every detail that is in the deficit reduction commission \nrecommendations, but at least he is getting on board along the lines of \nwhat 64 Senators--32 Republicans and 32 Democrats--said in a letter \nabout a month ago to the President: We are ready to start tackling some \nof these big problems, but we need leadership. Maybe this speech today \nis an answer to that leadership. Or, if I want to be cynical about it, \nI could say maybe the President gave his speech today because of the \nvery positive comments that Congressman and Chairman Paul Ryan got for \nhis budget ideas that he released last week.\n  But the President also took advantage to renew the class warfare--the \ndemagoguery of taxing the wealthy. It doesn't contribute much to the \ndebate. In fact, I think it makes it very difficult to bring people \ntogether. Or, if I want to be cynical, I could say this is maybe the \nPresident's first speech about his reelection. But either way, I think \nthere is analysis that we have to look at very carefully and see if it \ndoes the economic good that is intended in the speech, even though it \nis welcome that the President is being engaged at this time.\n  So I would give some reaction to some of the things the President \nsaid, but I want this as background: From World War II through 2009, \nevery dollar of new Federal tax revenue coming into this Treasury \nresulted in $1.17 of new spending. Think of that: Every new dollar \ncoming in wasn't a dollar that reduced the deficit, it was a dollar \nthat resulted in $1.17 of additional spending. That is like a dog that \nchases its tail and never catches it. So we are sending a new dollar to \nWashington to do something about the budget deficit and nothing happens \nas a result of that, except more deficit.\n  The President made the point that tax reductions in 2001 and 2003 \nadded tremendously to the deficit he inherited or the part of the \ndeficit that now exists. But, in fact, the tax reductions of 2001 and \n2003 resulted in more revenue to the Federal Treasury. The expanding \neconomy, spurred by the Tax Relief Acts of 2001 and 2003, helped to \nreduce the annual budget deficit from $412 billion in 2004 to $160 \nbillion in 2007, not because we taxed more but because we taxed less \nand we had more economic activity as a result. That brings me around to \nthe principle of deficit reduction. Obviously, when I say a dollar of \nadditional taxes doesn't go to the bottom line, that doesn't do \nanything about the deficit. But on the expenditure side, reducing that \nand the economic growth that comes from it is what reduces the \ndeficit--more economic activity.\n  Even the most sincere arguments that raising taxes would reduce the \ndeficit and the debt do not have history to back them up. Outside of \nWashington, it is obvious to people the problem is not that people are \nundertaxed but Washington overspends. The voters said this so loudly \nand clearly in the last election, and elections are supposed to have \nconsequences. I think the budget agreement of midnight Friday night is \nevidence of words from the grassroots of America getting through to \nWashington, DC. I think most people at the grassroots are cynical \nwhatever happened, and I suppose we have to do a lot more to prove to \nthem there might be a different day in Washington. But it was pretty \nloud and clear the results of the last election and the message sent to \nWashington.\n  Government spending increased by 22 percent during the last 2 years, \na nonsustainable level of increased expenditures. If we follow the \nbudget proposed this year by President Obama, we would add another $13 \ntrillion to our national debt over the next decade. This debt gets in \nthe way of economic activity that creates jobs, and it is a terrible \nburden to leave to future generations. We talk dollars and cents when \nwe talk about the deficit and the debt, but it is a moral issue of \nwhether those of us of our generation ought to live high on the hog and \nleave the bill to young people such as these pages here who have to pay \nfor it. It is a moral issue as much as it is an economic issue.\n  This trillions of dollars of debt gets in the way of economic \nactivity that creates jobs, and it is a terrible burden on future \ngenerations. Washington needs to get behind policies that clamp down on \nspending and, as a result, we will grow the economy. Increased economic \nactivity increases revenue to the Federal Treasury, enabling deficit \nand debt reduction. We know that to be a fact, because from 1997 to the \nyear 2000, we actually, because of the growth of the economy, paid down \n$568 billion on the national debt during that period of time. The \nanswer is not ways to grow government. We need to grow the economy, but \nwe don't grow the economy by growing government.\n  Getting back to the issue of the President making a big deal in his \nspeech about the 2001 tax cuts being a major cause of the budget \ndeficit, and probably the implication of the unfairness of it because \nthere weren't higher taxes on higher income people, I would suggest \nthat the President is wrong in both regards.\n  In 2001, the tax cut included an across-the-board income tax \nreduction and reduced the tax rates on the lowest income people from 15 \npercent to 10 percent. It resulted in removing millions of low-income \npeople from the Federal income tax rolls entirely. It increased the \nchild tax credit from $500 to $1,000. The legislation included marriage \npenalty relief and the first-ever tax deduction for tuition.\n  Two years later, after 9/11, the 2003 dividends and capital gains tax \nrate cuts spurred economic growth and created jobs.\n  The result was more revenue to the Federal Treasury, not less. The \nexpanding economy helped reduce the annual budget deficit--and I am \nrepeating these numbers because they are significant--from $412 billion \nin 2004 to $160 billion in 2007.\n  I know it is counterintuitive to a lot of people to hear a Member of \nthe Senate say if you reduce marginal tax rates, you are going to bring \nrevenue into the Federal Treasury, because the obvious common sense \ntells people that if you increase taxes, you are going to bring in more \nrevenue. As I said earlier in a speech today, it doesn't work out that \nway because some people in this country can decide I have paid enough \ntaxes, I am not going to pay any more. So they disincentivize to be \nproductive, probably do leisure or invest in nonproductive activity. \nWhen you lower marginal tax rates, it encourages those people to be \nproductive and, at the same time, creating jobs, growing the economy, \nand bringing more money into the Federal Treasury.\n  When you look at the sources of the deficit, contrary to the \nPresident's claim, tax relief has been a small part. Unprecedented \nspending contributed much more to the deficit than the tax relief did \nand particularly in the last 2 years--a 22-percent increase in \nexpenditures on top of the $814 billion stimulus.\n  Here is something that probably is counterintuitive as well and \nprobably something the President misses from his analysis of the 2001 \nand 2003 tax relief bills, which he blames the big budget deficit on. \nThose reductions actually ended up with taxes being more progressive. \nThe effective Federal tax rate on the top 1 percent of households is \nmore than seven times the rate paid by the bottom 20 percent of \nhouseholds. That is up from less than five times as much in the year \n1979.\n  If tax relief enacted since 2001 is allowed to expire in a little \nmore than a year and a half--because last December we only extended the \nexisting tax policy until December 31, 2012--if that happens at that \ntime, a family of four with two kids who earns $50,000 today would see \na $2,155 increase in their tax bill. More than 6 million low-income \npeople who currently have no Federal income tax liability would be \nsubject to the individual income tax, and that would be at a rate of 15 \npercent instead of the current 10 percent.\n  Washington needs to learn that leaving more money in the pockets of \nthe taxpayers unleashes a positive chain reaction in our economy. On \nthe other hand, government spending doesn't create wealth because \ngovernment is not an institution that can create wealth. Government is \nan institution that can only provide an environment for people outside \nthe government to create wealth. In fact, what the government does is \nit consumes wealth and, as a result, doesn't generate a stronger \neconomy.\n  Instead of growing the government, Washington needs to focus on \nhelping\n\n[[Page S2438]]\n\ncreate private sector jobs. The President's new plan will reduce the \ndeficit by $4 trillion over 12 years. He does that by reducing spending \nby $2 trillion but raising taxes by $1 trillion, and, thus, lowering \ninterest payments by $1 trillion. The President has again failed to \nrealize that we don't have a revenue problem, we have a spending \nproblem.\n  At least a couple times since I have been in the Senate, I have heard \nthis argument: Let's increase taxes $1, and we will reduce expenditures \n$2 or $3 or $4--sometimes it is $2, sometimes $3, and sometimes $4 \nbehind those ideas. That sounds very good, doesn't it? But here is why \nit doesn't work and why bringing in $1 in new taxes actually leads to \nspending of $1.17. I often quote Professor Dave Vedder of Ohio \nUniversity, who has studied tax increases and spending for a long \nperiod of time. In fact, you increase taxes until you decide to do \nsomething else with the taxes. But appropriations are reviewed annually \nand, for some reason or other, after that first year, appropriations \ntend to creep up and up and up. Consequently, the well-intentioned \nraising of taxes $1 and reducing expenditures by $3 or $4--as well \nintended as it is, it gradually is eroded on the expenditure side--that \nhalf of that proposition--so you end up not reducing expenditures as \nyou have originally indicated.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, may I address the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we have come through a crisis. \nIt is not over yet because we don't have a law that has been passed by \nboth Houses averting the shutdown of the government, and once it has \npassed both Houses--which we anticipate tomorrow--then it will be \nsigned into law by the President, and we will avert the shutdown.\n  Had there been a shutdown or, in the alternative, had a law proposed \nin the House of Representatives, H.R. 1, been law, what we would have \nseen is a number of the hunger programs we have being savaged. There \nwould have been a huge savaging of the feeding programs around the \nworld--USAID, an arm of the State Department, which saves untold \nthousands, if not millions, of lives, particularly of children. They \nhave a program right now in Africa, for example, of just providing \nmosquito netting, which cuts malaria by 30 percent. But also, USAID \nuses a lot of American agriculture to help feed hungry populations. \nThose programs would have been cut significantly had H.R. 1, the House \nof Representatives' appropriations bill, been the final decision.\n  Fortunately, it wasn't and, fortunately, for the hunger programs, \nboth abroad and at home, the least among us will not have to suffer \nthose cutbacks to the budget for the duration of this fiscal year--for \nthe next 6 months.\n  Even so, there were some significant cuts in what has been agreed to \nin the funding for hunger programs here in America. There was a $500 \nmillion cut in the Women, Infants, and Children Program, otherwise \nknown as WIC, the Federal health and nutrition program for women, \ninfants, and children. We will have to deal with this, as we are now \nputting together the mathematics in building the next budget for 2012.\n  I decided to come over and talk because I wish to talk about one of \nmy closest personal friends, former Congressman and former Ambassador, \nTony Hall of Ohio, who started a fast 16 days ago. That fast he is \ngoing to continue, only having water. He is going all the way through \nEaster, which is another week and a half away. The duration of that \nfast will be somewhere around a month.\n  You can imagine what happens to your body when you don't take in any \nnourishment other than water for 30 days. That is what Tony Hall is \ndoing. It is very interesting that people are joining him. Some 35,000 \npeople nationwide have joined Tony in a fast. It may not be a complete \nfast such as he is doing, with only water, and it may be just that they \nare doing a fast 1 day a week. It is interesting that 30 Members of the \nHouse of Representatives have joined their former colleague, \nCongressman Tony Hall, in this fast, and that includes--as just \nannounced--14 U.S. women lawmakers who plan to protest the deep cuts in \nthe programs that help the poor and battle hunger in the United States \nand overseas.\n  In conclusion, you can tell a great nation by how it takes care of \nthe least of those among us. It is certainly a part of our Judeo-\nChristian heritage, throughout the Hebrew Scriptures and the New \nTestament, that, over and over, the most referenced part of the \nScriptures is the obligation of a society to take care of the least \nprivileged among us.\n  Back in the old days, some 2,000 years ago--and even before--they had \na social security system in that agricultural economy of the time \ncalled gleaning. Those who owned the wheat fields would go in and reap \nthe wheat, but it was the standard practice of the day that they would \nleave enough wheat on the stalks so the poor could come in and glean \nthe fields in order that they would have sustenance. That was their \nsocial security system of the day. Our systems of aiding the poor are \nmuch more sophisticated and include the programs of USAID, and here at \nhome a lot through the Department of Agriculture. But as we have to cut \nthe budget, we must constantly remind ourselves, as Ambassador Tony \nHall is reminding us right now with his fast for a month, that it is an \nobligation of all of us to take care of the least among us.\n\n  I will close by quoting that passage from Matthew 25: When you did it \nfor the least of these, my brothers and sisters, you were doing it for \nme.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Before my friend leaves the floor, I had the good fortune \nto serve in the House, as my friend did, with Tony Hall, a very \ndedicated, thoughtful man. I wasn't aware of his doing this fast. That \nis a real fast. It shows how strongly he feels and has felt for many \nyears about this. So it is nice my friend from Florida brought this to \nthe attention of the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/13/senate-section/article/S2438-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, later this week, we will consider a \nspending measure to fund the United States Government through the \nremaining 6 months of this fiscal year. While the majority leader is on \nthe Senate floor, I want to thank him, as well as Appropriations \nChairman Inouye and Senator Patty Murray, for their hard work in \nnegotiating an end to the budget stalemate and preventing the \nthreatened government shutdown.\n  The battle over that spending measure brightly illuminated the \ncontrast between the priorities of the two parties. The priorities of \nthe House Republicans, I believe, are completely upside-down. In the \ndebate over the spending bill, they fought to cut programs that helped \nthe middle class and for extreme tea party policy riders that had \nnothing to do with the budget. These included a prohibition on funding \nfor women's health and eliminating the Environmental Protection \nAgency's ability to protect us against carbon and other pollution.\n  At the same time, the House Republicans refused to even consider \nraising revenue by closing tax loopholes, for instance--not one. They \nrefused to entertain ending even one corporate tax giveaway or one \nspecial treatment for wealthy taxpayers.\n  If that debate didn't make the contrast between the two parties \ncrystal clear, the House Republican budget for 2012--the so-called Ryan \nbudget--sure did. In his budget, Congressman Ryan proposes privatizing \nMedicare and requiring seniors to pay the majority of their health \nexpenses with their own money. They would get a voucher, which actually \nwould go to the insurance company, and the difference would be up to \nthem. In the same document in which Congressman Ryan would decimate \nMedicare, he would cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires by \ntrillions of dollars.\n  Now, one major factor that contributed to our budget deficit is the \neconomic crisis that we recently weathered. It is amazing the amnesia \nwe can have in Washington. We are not even through the recession that \nhas been so painful for so many families in Rhode Island, and yet we \nseem to have forgotten that economic crisis. Well, those of us who were \nhere ought to remember the desperate urgency that was displayed by \nTreasury Secretary Hank Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben \nBernanke as they, having looked into the economic abyss, came to this \nbuilding--to the LBJ Room right here in the Senate--to plead with us \nfor help to save the world economy. These are not two easy men to \nfrighten, and they were very frightened.\n  We are now past the worst depths of the financial and economic \ncrises, and as this chart shows, the economic recovery measured in jobs \nis proceeding, although all too tentatively and all too slowly in Rhode \nIsland. We are still at 12 percent unemployment in the Providence \nmetropolitan area and over 11 percent statewide. Now that we are \nfinally creating jobs--but very few compared to the job losses of the \ncrisis--now that we are finally at least on the good side of the \nequation, House Republicans have proposed yanking government support \nfor the recovery and jeopardizing many of the jobs that are on this \nchart.\n  Their spending proposal, H.R. 1, would have cut spending so severely \nthat former McCain Presidential campaign economic adviser Mark Zandi \nestimated it would cost as many as 700,000 jobs.\n  Just look at our job gains: For February, 222,000; for January, \n68,000; for December, 167,000; and for November, 128,000. We would wipe \nout months and months of job gains with a 700,000 job loss.\n  Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street investment bank, said this bill--H.R. \n1--could reduce the growth in our annual gross domestic product by two \nfull percentage points over the rest of the year. We were only \nexpecting about three percentage points of growth, so to knock off two \nof them is a big hit on jobs.\n  So I will begin by pointing out that as we deal with the debt and \ndeficit, we cannot forget about jobs. It is growth, ultimately, and a \nrecovering economy that will help reduce our national debt.\n  As you will recall, the Republicans also resisted any efforts to \nclose any corporate tax loopholes. Corporations, our Republican friends \ncontend, are overtaxed, and any closing of a loophole would amount to \nan unacceptable tax hike. So let's look for a minute at the actual \nstate of things. Let's look at the facts for a minute.\n  This is the actual state of corporate tax payments in America. In \n1935, for every $1 an American individual contributed to our revenues, \nAmerican corporations also contributed $1. By 1948, American \nindividuals were contributing $2 for every $1 that corporate America \ncontributed. By 1971, it broke through 3 to 1. In 1981, it broke \nthrough 4 to 1. And in 2009, we broke through 6 to 1, with American \nindividual taxpayers contributing every year to our annual revenues six \ntimes as much as American corporations.\n  So we have gone, in a lot of people's lifetimes--you have to be \npretty old, but there are plenty of people who remember 1935--from, \nbasically, even-Steven between corporate America and individual \nAmericans, with individual Americans carrying six times the tax burden \nof corporate America. So when people say how overtaxed corporate \nAmerica is, it is worth looking at this history of ever-diminishing \ncorporate contributions to our Nation's revenues.\n  Let's look now at one of the factors that is driving the erosion of \ncorporate tax revenues. This is an interesting house--a building \nlocated down in the Cayman Islands. It is not particularly large, kind \nof nondescript. Our Budget Committee chairman, Kent Conrad, uses this \nphotograph quite often.\n  This building may not look like a beehive of economic activity, but \nover 18,000 corporations claim they are doing business in this \nbuilding. That is correct; 18,000 corporations claim to be doing \nbusiness in that little building. It gives a whole new meaning to the \nphrase ``small business'' when you think of trying to pack 18,000 \ncorporations into that little structure.\n  Well, as Chairman Conrad has pointed out, the only business being \ndone in that building is funny business or monkey business with the Tax \nCode. Tax gimmickry. This nonsense is estimated to cost America as much \nas $100 billion every year. For every one of those dollars lost to the \ntax cheaters, honest taxpaying Americans and honest taxpaying \ncorporations have to pay an extra dollar or more to make up the \ndifference.\n  Now, let's go to another building that has a tax story to tell. This \nis the Helmsley Building in New York City. It is a nice-looking place. \nThe building is big enough to have its own Zip Code. That means the IRS \nreports of tax information by Zip Code can tell us a lot about this \nbuilding. Here is what this building tells us from actual tax filings \nand actual tax payments.\n  The well-off and very successful, indeed, admirable occupants of that \nbuilding paid a lower tax rate than the average New York City janitor. \nThe average tax rate of a New York City janitor is 24.9 percent. The \naverage tax rate of a New York City security guard--I am sure the \nHelmsley Building has security guards--is 23.8 percent. But the average \ntax rate actually paid by the occupants, the successful, capable, but \nwell-compensated occupants of that building, is 14.7 percent, about \nthree-fifths of the rate that their janitors and security guards are \nlikely paying.\n  So that seems as though it must be extraordinary, but, believe it or \nnot, that is no fluke. The IRS reports the tax rate that is actually \npaid by the highest earning 400 Americans. They have to go back a few \nyears to do the calculations, but here is their most recent \ninformation, and the story is the same. The highest earning 400 \nAmericans each earned on average more than $344 million--more than $1/3 \nbillion in 1 year--and the average tax rate those 400 high-income \nearners actually paid was 16.7 percent.\n\n[[Page S2440]]\n\n  I applaud their success. It is the American dream writ large when \nsomebody can make $1/3 billion in a single year. But when they only pay \n16.7 percent, it makes you wonder. You might wonder, for instance, at \nwhat wage level does a regular single working person start paying 16.7 \npercent in total Federal taxes? If you are a single filer without \ndeductions, you hit 16.7 percent of your salary going to the Federal \nGovernment in taxes at $18,650 in salary.\n  So what does that equate to for jobs? The Bureau of Labor Statistics \ncalculates that in my home State, in the Providence labor market, a \nhospital orderly is paid on average $29,000 a year. That means that the \n400 biggest income earners in America, each earning on average $1/3 \nbillion, are paying the same tax rate as the hospital orderly pushing \nthat cart down the linoleum hallways of the Rhode Island Hospital at 2 \no'clock in the morning. That is the way the code actually works. There \nare a lot of people in between that and making what a hospital orderly \nmakes, and they pay a lot more in taxes than 16.7 percent. But when you \nget to the very high end, when you get to the occupants of the Helmsley \nBuilding, when you get to the people making $1/3 billion a year, those \ntax rates actually paid go down to the point where they are paying the \nsame rate as the janitor--less than the janitor--and the same rate as \nthe hospital orderly.\n  I have heard my colleagues say that rates go up the higher income you \npay, and nominally they do. But when you look at what is actually paid, \nwhen you look at what goes through our contorted Tax Code system, out \nthe back end come these extraordinarily low actual tax payment rates \nfor the most well-off and well-compensated Americans.\n  If you go to the corporate Tax Code, that makes little more sense. \nDecades of lobbyists have carved our corporate Tax Code into a Swiss \ncheese of tax loopholes, of tax earmarks for the rich and powerful. The \nresult? We have a nominal corporate tax rate of 35 percent. But here is \nwhat the New York Times reported recently. General Electric, one of the \nNation's largest corporations, made profits of over $14 billion last \nyear and paid no U.S. taxes--none. Indeed, it actually received a $3.2 \nbillion refund from the American taxpayer.\n  I read recently that Goldman Sachs in 2008 reportedly paid income \ntax, Federal tax, of 1 percent. Maybe those were 1-year anomalies, but \nif you look at a previous analysis by the New York Times, of 5 years of \ncorporate tax returns, consolidated, that analysis found that \nPrudential Financial only paid 7.6 percent--less than our hospital \norderly; Yahoo, 7 percent; Southwest Airlines, 6.3 percent; Boeing, 4.5 \npercent; and what looks to be our tax avoidance champion, on $11.3 \nbillion of income, the Carnival Cruise Corporation paid less than 1.1 \npercent in Federal taxes averaged over those 5 years. One recent paper \nactually calculated Carnival Cruise Lines' effective tax rate at 0.7 \npercent on $11.3 billion in income. Carnival Lines doesn't just take \nyou for a cruise, they are taking all of us for a ride. Good, honest \nCVS, a corporation in my home State, pays full freight. Why should they \npay 30 times the tax rate of Carnival Cruise Lines? It makes no sense.\n  But wait, there is more. Don't forget that we make the American \ntaxpayer subsidize big oil to the tune of at least $3 trillion a year, \nand big oil has made $1 trillion in profits this decade. They hardly \nneed to raid the pockets of the American taxpayer, but on an effective \ntax rate basis, the petroleum-gas industry pays the lowest rate of any \nindustry.\n  I think these are all noteworthy landmarks of where we are in our \nbudget and debt and deficit discussion. But the big landmark, what I \ncall the Mount Everest of landmarks that casts its shadow over the \nentire budget discussion, is health care. Representative Ryan's health \ncare budget proposal is radical and would create terrible harm for \nseniors. But I do agree with Representative Ryan on his statement that \nsays the following:\n\n       If you want to be honest with the fiscal problem and the \n     debt, it really is a health care problem.\n\n  He is right, and the landmark feature of this landmark problem is \nthis: The health care cost problem is a health care system problem. Our \nnational health care costs are exploding. The health care system is \ndriving up the costs of Medicare. The health care system is driving up \nthe costs of Medicaid. The health care system is driving up the costs \nof private insurance--of BlueCross, of United. The health care system \nis driving up the cost of the military's TRICARE system and the VA \nsystem. No one is exempt. It doesn't matter who your insurer is, the \nhealth care system is what is driving the costs in public and in \nprivate programs alike.\n  We have to address the health care system problem if we are going to \nget our health care costs under control. Simply going after one manner \nof payment, such as the Medicare system, misses the real target and \nwill cause us to fail at our endeavor.\n  Instead of tackling this vital problem of the underlying growth in \nhealth care costs, the Ryan budget would end Medicare as we know it. \nJust look at these numbers. I was born in 1955. It was at $12 billion, \nthe entire national health care system. By 1979, it was up to $219 \nbillion; by 1987, $512 billion; by 1992, $849 billion; and from 1992 to \n2009, it has soared to $2.5 trillion. This is a rocket every insurer is \non, and you can't just throw the Medicare people off of their health \ncare and pretend you are going to do anything about bringing down that \naccelerating curve. But instead of tackling the underlying growth, the \nRyan budget would end Medicare as we know it. That would be a tragedy \nand a mistake.\n  Medicare, along with Social Security, is one of the most successful \nprograms for human well-being in the history of the world. It allows \ntens of millions of older Americans to enjoy their golden years with \nminimal concern about paying for health care. Paired with Social \nSecurity, Medicare guarantees American seniors the freedom to retire \nwithout fear of privation or destitution. As with Social Security, \nAmerican workers pay for this privilege through payroll taxes, and they \nhave a right to the retirement benefits that they have been promised \nand that they have earned.\n  The House Republican budget drafted by Mr. Ryan would break our \npledge with Americans who have been paying Medicare payroll taxes by \nending Medicare as we know it and replacing the single-payer system \nwith vouchers for private care that will not come close to paying the \nfull cost of insurance. Indeed, that may be an understatement. \nAccording to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the Ryan plan \nwould leave the average senior with over $12,500 in out-of-pocket \nexpenditures that they would have to pay by 2022. That is nearly as \nmuch as the average Rhode Islander gets from Social Security now.\n  The current Medicare system is projected to cover 68 percent of a \nsenior's health care costs in 2012, and the Ryan plan would only cover \n25 percent. Three-quarters of a senior's health care responsibility \nwould be on them, and Medicare would only pick up 25 percent. That is \nan unaffordable and a indefensible burden that destroys the freedom and \nthe security Medicare provides to seniors and provides to their \nchildren as well.\n  Don't forget that we all enjoy the freedom of knowing our parents \nwill be taken care of no matter how dread the disease they suffer, and \nwe do not have to compromise our choices in life in order to hedge \nagainst the fear that our parents will suffer such an indignity, such a \nterrible result. It helps all Americans to have that freedom in our \nseniors' hands, to have that fear lifted from their and our hearts.\n  The Ryan plan is 180 degrees from where we should be on health care \nreform. It would greatly increase costs. Costs go up because of how \ninefficient private insurance is--for the average senior, from a \nprojected $14,770 under current policy to $20,510, a 39-percent \nincrease in the underlying cost--in other words, a huge giveaway to the \nprivate health insurance industry that would get these vouchers. It \nwould ignore the potential for tremendous savings in delivery system \nreform and saddle seniors with enormous out-of-pocket expenses.\n  As I said, rising Medicare costs are not driven by Medicare. Every \ninsurer has their costs going up like a rocket on that chart I showed. \nWe have to get at the problem of the underlying cause.\n\n[[Page S2441]]\n\n  How do we do this? We actually have a pretty good health care toolbox \nthat has five major tools in it. One is quality improvement. Quality \nimprovement saves the cost of errors, of missed diagnosis, of \ndisjointed care, and so forth. For example, hospital-acquired \ninfections alone cost about $2.5 billion every year, and they are \nvirtually entirely avoidable. They should be and could be ``never'' \nevents. That alone would save $2.5 billion, and quality improvement can \nextend far beyond just the realm of hospital-acquired infections.\n  Two is prevention programs. Prevention programs avoid the cost of \ngetting sick in the first place. More than 90 percent of cervical \ncancer is curable if the disease is detected early through Pap smears. \nThree, you pay doctors for better outcomes rather than for ordering \nmore and more tests and procedures. That will save money while \nimproving outcomes for Americans.\n  Four is a robust health information infrastructure which will save \nbillions of dollars a year and open exciting new industries once it \ntakes life. We are approaching that tipping point now, I am glad to \nsay.\n  Finally, five, the administrative costs of our health care system are \ngrotesque. The insurance industry has developed a massive bureaucracy \nto delay and deny payments to doctors and hospitals. So the doctors and \nthe hospitals have had to fight back and hire their own billing \ndepartments and their own consultants.\n  I visited, a little while ago, our little Cranston, RI, community \nhealth center. They told me there that half their staff is dedicated \nnot to providing health care but to fighting to get paid. On top of \ndedicating 50 percent of their staff to trying to get paid, they have \nto spend another $200,000 a year on fancy consultants. All of that, the \nentire war over payments between insurers and hospitals, adds zero \nhealth care value.\n  We have heard that on the private insurance side, anywhere from 15 to \n30 percent of the health insurance dollar gets burned up in \nadministrative costs. We know we can do better because the cost of \nadministering Medicare is closer to 2 percent of program expenditures.\n  So you add up all of this, all those five strategies, the numbers are \nenormous. The President's Council of Economic Advisers has stated that \n5 percent of GDP can be taken out of our health care system costs \nwithout hurting the health care we receive. That is about $700 billion \na year.\n  The New England Health Care Institute says it is $850 billion a year. \nThe well-regarded Lewin Group has estimated the probable savings at $1 \ntrillion a year, a figure that is echoed by former Bush Treasury \nSecretary O'Neill.\n  Those are very big numbers, but not only are they big numbers, they \nrepresent results that are a win-win. Remember the five strategies: \nhigher quality care with less errors and infections; prevented \nillnesses so you do not get sick in the first place; secure, complete \nhealth records that are there when you need them electronically, so \nyour doctors, your lab, your pharmacy, your hospital, your specialists \nall know what everybody else is doing; payments to doctors and \nhospitals based on keeping you well and getting you well, rather than \non giving you more procedures and more tests; and, finally, not so much \nof that infuriating insurance company bureaucracy hassling both \npatients and doctors.\n  Those are not bad outcomes even without the savings. So what do we \ndraw from this if we keep all these landmarks in mind, landmarks of \nwhere we are as we approach this budget debate? Well, our colleagues on \nthe other side, particularly our House Republican colleagues, say they \nare determined to reduce our annual deficit on our national debt. That \nis their top priority.\n  But they only want to seem to address 12 percent of the budget, the \nnonsecurity discretionary spending, and examine no savings at all on \nthe revenue side. If we are serious about deficit and debt reduction, \nwhy risk destroying 700,000 jobs, when job destruction only adds to the \ndeficit and to our debt through lost economic activity and lost \nrevenue?\n  If we are serious about deficit and debt reduction, why is there not \none corporate tax loophole--not one--on the chopping block? Why is the \nentire Tax Code off limits in this discussion as it burns up 6 billion \nhours that Americans spend every year--6 billion hours that Americans \nspend every year--complying with its contorted requirements.\n  Why must that hospital orderly, pushing his or her cart down the \nlinoleum hallway at midnight, pay a higher tax rate than some of the \nmost fortunate and able Americans making hundreds of millions of \ndollars each in a single year? If we are serious about this, if \ndeficits and debt are the most important thing we face, why no \ndiscussion of corporate America's ever-diminishing contribution as a \nshare of our Nation's revenue? Should that not be something we at least \nconsider?\n  If we are serious, why is there no plan for even one of the 18,000 \ncorporations in that phony-baloney headquarters in the Cayman Islands \nto pay its proper taxes? If we are serious, why is there so much pure \npolitical nonsense about ObamaCare and socialized medicine, instead of \na mature discussion about using and improving the tools in the health \ncare bill to address our grave national health care system problem.\n  Why has Representative Ryan proposed taking a sledgehammer to \nMedicare, instead of making thoughtful and efficient investments to \nimprove the way we deliver health care?\n  It seems to me that until one corporate tax loophole is on the table, \nuntil one subsidy to big oil is on the table, until one subsidy to big \nagribusiness is on the table, until we are even beginning to talk about \nbillionaires contributing Federal revenue beyond the share of their \nincome that hospital orderlies contribute, until we are not so casual \nabout threatening 700,000 jobs and perhaps $20 billion in related tax \nrevenue that job loss would cause, until then, it is still politics as \nusual and it is not a sincere desire to tackle our debt.\n  I have always found that you get a better read looking what people \nactually do, rather than just believing whatever they say. If you look \nat what Republicans made their priorities on the CR debate and in the \nRyan budget, look at what they do. It is the same old Republican \nagenda: attacking programs that help the poor, attacking women's right \nto choose, attacking national voluntary service, helping polluters get \naround public health measures, reducing the share of revenues paid by \ncorporations, and very high-income individuals. It is the same old \nsong.\n  Most important, the problem is that if you go that road, it is not \nadequate to meet the serious problems at hand. We need to look \nthroughout the budget and across all our opportunities to bring down \nour Nation's deficits and to bring down our Nation's debt. Everyone \nneeds to participate, including our corporate community, including our \nwealthiest, most talented and most fortunate, everyone. We cannot--we \nsimply will not--get out of the debt and deficit problem we have if we \nput the whole load of that on the backs of the American middle class.\n  I look forward in the months ahead to a serious, fair, and sensible \ndiscussion, a mature discussion of how to reduce our deficits and our \ndebt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to speak to the war on women's \nhealth and Planned Parenthood.\n  To be clear, to end Federal funding for Planned Parenthood is to stop \nproviding critical health care to millions of Americans, the majority \nof them who are poor and simply cannot afford services anywhere else.\n  This effort will strip the poor and middle classes of their right to \npreventive healthcare.\n  Through 800 nationwide locations, Planned Parenthood provides cancer \nscreening, HIV and STD tests, contraceptives, education and \nempowerment.\n  Planned Parenthood estimates it prevents over 620,000 unintended \npregnancies and 220,000 abortions each year.\n  Seventy-five percent of its clients are at or below the poverty line. \nAbortions account for just 3 percent of its overall activities.\n  What House Republicans seem to have forgotten is that by existing \nlaw, taxpayer funding cannot be used for abortions except in cases of \nrape, incest, or if the woman's life is in danger.\n  A ban on Federal spending for abortions has been in place since 1976. \nThat is 35 years this ban has been in place.\n\n[[Page S2442]]\n\n  Yet today House Republicans continue to try to strip Planned \nParenthood of its Federal funding and continue to use this issue as a \nbargaining chip in a debate over the budget.\n  But the vote the Senate will have to take is clearly not about the \nbudget, it is a war on women's health. This effort would essentially \nturn back the clock on women's health.\n  I said this last week, and I will say it again. This is simply an \nopportunity for the right wing in the House to really sock it to \nAmerican women.\n  Let's talk about the facts.\n  Over 90 percent of care provided by Planned Parenthood is preventive. \nPlanned Parenthood provides care to almost 3 million patients \nnationwide every year, many of whom have no other place to go.\n  Only 3 percent of Planned Parenthood's total services are abortion \nservices. And that 3 percent is not made up of Federal funds.\n  Every year, Planned Parenthood provides affordable contraception for \nnearly 2.5 million patients, nearly 1 million cervical cancer screens, \n830,000 breast exams, and 4 million tests and treatments for sexually \ntransmitted infections, including half a million HIV tests.\n  These critical preventive services include annual exams, flu \nvaccines, smoking cessation, and well baby care.\n  Planned Parenthood helped to prevent 612,000 unintended pregnancies \nin 2009 alone. Every dollar invested in helping women avoid unintended \npregnancies saves $4 in public funds.\n  And House Republicans want to eliminate Federal funding for this \nprogram?\n  These cuts are biased, politically motivated, and hurts women--\nparticularly low-income women.\n  Seventy-five percent of Planned Parenthood's clients have incomes at \nor below 150 percent of the Federal poverty level.\n  In California alone, Planned Parenthood serves over 750,000 patients, \nover 680,000 of them through federal funds.\n  This program is necessary, effective, and oftentimes a last resort.\n  Let me share a story from one woman from my home State of California.\n  Mary couldn't afford annual visits to her regular OB/GYN office \nduring college. So a friend suggested she visit Planned Parenthood for \na free exam.\n  Mary said, ``After some hesitation I went. Thank god that I did. \nDuring my visit they found that I had the first signs of cervical \ncancer. I was 19 and terrified.\n  ``The staff at Planned Parenthood was so supportive and \nunderstanding. One doctor in particular was amazing, I wish I could \nfind her and thank her personally. She went out of her way to call and \ncheck up on me once a week until I had recovered completely from the \nprocedure that got rid of the cancerous cells.''\n  Six years later, Mary is still healthy and still so grateful for the \nexcellent and compassionate care she received at Planned Parenthood.\n  There are thousands of other stories like Mary's. I have heard from \nthese young women who went to Planned Parenthood for STD screening and \nbirth control, when they had no other place to go.\n  I have heard from women pleading with me to preserve Federal funding \nto Planned Parenthood; telling me that the cancer screenings they \nreceived saved their lives.\n  The House Republicans also want to defund the Affordable Care Act, \nand block critical consumer protections in the law.\n  This too targets women. House Republicans want to go back to the days \nwhere women could be denied insurance coverage for the ``preexisting \ncondition'' of being pregnant.\n  They want to reinstate gender rating, where insurance companies \ncharge women higher premiums simply because of gender.\n  House Republicans want to remove maternity care as an essential \nhealth benefit. Currently only 12 percent of health plans in the \nindividual market offer any maternity coverage.\n  So you see, defunding Planned Parenthood and the Affordable Care Act \nis not about reducing the deficit or balancing the budget. It is about \nharming women.\n  We need to look carefully at our spending and we need to make cuts, \nbut not at the expense of the women in our country.\n  It is a shame that the budget debate has turned into an ideological \nwar.\n  It is a shame that funding for health care and family planning is \nconsidered ``government waste'' by some Republicans.\n  When in reality, it is an ideological assault on women's health.

Sidney Harman led a life of passion and commitment, the kind of \nexistence that most of us aspire to. His interests were vast and varied \nand his sense of possibility unparalleled. With business acumen equal \nto his mastery of the sciences and his love of the arts, Sidney \nembraced challenges and faced life head on.\n  I had the pleasure of knowing Sidney throughout his career as a \nbusinessman, entrepreneur, public servant, and philanthropist. He left \nhis distinctive mark on every project he involved himself with and \nbrought his progressive ideas to bear at a critical time in our \nnation's history. His ability to innovate never waned, creative \nsolutions were a forte of his and he applied them with confidence. His \nmost recent endeavor, to purchase Newsweek and merge it with the online \npublication the Daily Beast less than a year ago, was initially met \nwith trepidation by print news professionals but has since led to \ngrowth for both publications, a typical outcome for a venture \nchampioned by Sidney.\n  Sidney's commitment to the betterment of young lives and society as a \nwhole was evident in his philanthropic pursuits and his involvement \nwith institutions of higher education. In recent years he taught \nclasses in medicine, law, economics, and various other disciplines at \nthe college level. Over the course of his life he supported educational \norganizations with generous donations. He understood that education is \nthe foundation of a prosperous society and that the enlightenment of \nyoung minds is crucial to the success of a nation such as ours.\n  Along with his wife Jane, Sidney made a home and life here in \nWashington, DC, and devoted himself to the city and its legacy. A \ngenerous supporter of the National Symphony Orchestra, the Folger \nShakespeare Library and the Shakespeare Theatre Company, Sidney had a \nsignificant impact on the vibrant cultural and artistic scene in the \nNation's Capital.\n  My greatest sympathies are with Jane, his children Barbara, Daniel, \nand Justine, and all of Sidney's extended family. Sidney touched the \nlives of many and there is no doubt he will be long-remembered for his \ninnovative mind, his good humor, his energetic outlook, and his years \nof service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/13/senate-section/article/S2442-2", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2442-S2443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              RECOGNIZING THE EAT'N PARK HOSPITALITY GROUP\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nextend my congratulations to the Eat'n Park Hospitality Group upon \nreceiving the prestigious 2011 Restaurant Neighbor Award from the \nNational Restaurant Association. Every year, the National Restaurant \nAssociation honors restaurant companies that have gone above and beyond \nin giving back to their communities through philanthropy and service. \nThis year, Eat'n Park has been deservedly recognized for their \ncharitable efforts on behalf of local children's hospitals.\n  Eat'n Park restaurants have been a staple in my home State of \nPennsylvania for over 50 years. From their humble beginnings as a \nsingle carhop restaurant in Pittsburgh, the Eat'n Park chain has grown \nto include 76 restaurants throughout Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West \nVirginia, employing over 8,000 hardworking people, many of whom are my \nconstituents. Over the past six decades, their delicious food and \nfriendly service have soothed many\n\n[[Page S2443]]\n\na weary traveler along the Pennsylvania turnpike; and today, their \niconic Smiley Cookies can be found in my front office every Wednesday, \na welcome offering from home for visiting Pennsylvanians.\n  Eat'n Park does more than provide an endless supply of delicious \nSmiley Cookies for my constituents, however. More importantly, they \nhave made taking care of their community the centerpiece of their \ncorporate culture through philanthropy and service. Since 1979, Eat'n \nPark has raised more than $7.5 million through their annual Caring for \nKids Campaign, which benefits local children's hospitals in the \ntristate area. In 2010, the 32nd Annual Caring for Kids Campaign raised \n$341,365 for 13 area children's hospitals. This money is used for \neverything from pre- and neo-natal care, toys and events for the sick \nchildren and, in some cases, even a fund for families who would \notherwise be unable to afford to stay in the area during their child's \ntreatment. These charitable efforts have allowed Eat'n Park to touch \nthousands of lives, and make a positive impact on children and \nfamilies, throughout Pennsylvania through more than just their food.\n  It is hard to imagine an organization enjoying such remarkable and \nsustained philanthropic success without the hard work and dedication of \nthe individuals it employs. Eat'n Park is a case in point. While it \nwould be impossible to detail the individual contributions of the more \nthan 8,000 members of the Eat'n Park family, today I would like to \nspecifically recognize two important contributors to this year's Caring \nfor Kids Campaign: Linda Mayou and Gloria Rack.\n  Linda Mayou has been a team member of the Monogahela Eat'n Park for \n24 years, and has been Chairwoman of the Monogahela Caring for Kids \nCampaign for the past nineteen. Under Linda's leadership the Monogahela \nEat'n Park has reigned as the top fundraising restaurant in the chain \nfor the past 13 years, alone raising more than $400,000 for the \nChildren's Hospital of Pittsburgh.\n  Gloria Rack has been part of the Eat'n Park team for an impressive 41 \nyears and has been an important part of the Caring for Kids Campaign \nsince its inception. Currently a server at the Library Road restaurant, \nshe is Eat'n Park's all-time Top Car Raffle Ticket Seller, having \nindividually sold an estimated 30,000 car raffle tickets, raising \n$60,000 for the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Linda and Gloria's \naccomplishments are a testament to the hard work and dedication they \nhave shown throughout their careers to Eat'n Park's philanthropic \nefforts.\n  Again, I congratulate Eat'n Park Hospitality Group on receiving this \naward. Their commitment to local communities truly serves as an \nexemplary model for all Pennsylvanians. I applaud their efforts and \nwish them another six decades of continued success in all their \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/13/senate-section/article/S2443-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN DAVID LANG\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Captain \nDavid Lang for his outstanding service to the people of Hampton, NH.\n  For the past 30 years, Dave has worked to protect his community \nthrough his faithful service with the Hampton Fire Department. As he \nretires from the department, I applaud him for his longstanding service \nand dedication to the people of Hampton.\n  Captain Lang first joined the Hampton Fire Department in December \n1979 as an on-call firefighter. Due to his eagerness, hard work, and \nreliability, Dave rose through the ranks from permanent firefighter, to \nEMT, to lieutenant, and for the last 4 years has served as captain.\n  During his tenure, Captain Lang consistently prioritized the needs of \nthe community over his own, in particular during the Old Salt fire in \n1999 and the A Street block fire in 2009. He has been credited with the \nsuccessful resuscitation of a patient in cardiac arrest and the rescue \nof several trapped civilians. For this outstanding service, Captain \nLang has been recognized by the New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of \nPolice as Law Officer of the Year for Fire Service and has received the \nNew Hampshire Fire Academy's prestigious Academy Award.\n  Dave's commitment to fire safety in Hampton did not stop with his \nservice in the field but carried over into professional leadership \nroles. Throughout his career, he participated in the Professional Fire \nFighters Association of New Hampshire and for the past 16 years has \nserved as its president. I am pleased that even as Dave retires from \nthe Hampton Fire Department, he continues to serve as President of the \nProfessional Fire Fighters.\n  Dave is a native of New Hampshire and has lived in Hampton for over \n30 years. I have known him personally and professionally for over 20 \nyears and can attest to his commitment to public service, to his \ncommunity, and to his family. Dave has been married to his wife Karen \nfor 35 years and they have two beautiful daughters, Emily and Molly. \nHis strong character and generous spirit touch upon all aspects of his \nwork and family life, and his dedication and leadership in the \ncommunity distinguishes him as an extraordinary public servant. New \nHampshire is truly lucky to have him as a native son.\n  On a personal note, I am grateful to Dave for his support and counsel \nduring my years in public office. I could always count on Dave's advice \nabout issues ranging from firefighting and emergency response to \ncollective bargaining. Whenever I needed Dave's assistance in any \ncapacity, he was always there, willing to help.\n  As Captain Lang prepares for a well-deserved retirement, I wish to \nthank and honor him for his service to the people of Hampton.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/13/senate-section/article/S2443-2", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING RUTH HUMPHREYS BROWN\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today we recognize the \nlife of Ruth Humphreys Brown, a remarkable Coloradan who dedicated \nherself to a life of service and good will and a woman who was deeply \ntied to the American West. Ruth passed away on December 30, 2010, at \nthe age of 90.\n  Ruth led a life full of courage and giving, and our country is \nindebted to her for her service. In 1943, at the age of 22, she \nanswered our nation's call and was among the first women accepted to \nfly American military aircraft in the Women Airforce Service Pilots. As \na young pilot stationed in Texas, her efforts prepared our bombardiers \nand ground artillery units to fight and win in World War II, and \nCongress rightfully acknowledged her heroic contributions by awarding \nher a Congressional Gold Medal in 2010.\n  I knew Ruth to often work behind the scenes, but she never lacked in \nambition. Ruth's service extended to countless projects that continue \nto improve the health and activity of Colorado's communities. She took \npart in starting the first Outward Bound Program in the country. I am \npersonally grateful to Ruth for her efforts to start this program, \nhaving made it my career for 20 years. Coloradans and adventurers \nacross the continent benefit from Outward Bound's strength in training \nleaders and building community--two ideals to which Ruth contributed \ntremendously. Her love for the outdoors, from whitewater rafting and \npicnicking to swimming and skiing, carries on through the mission of \nOutward Bound.\n  Ruth gave to improve her community and never asked for the credit. \nBut many agree she deserved it. One of her well-known and early \ncontributions was committing the money to clear a new run on Aspen \nMountain in 1949. Skiers have since come to love Ruthie's Run, aptly \nnamed after its originator, in much the same way that so many of us \nadmire Ruth.\n  She grew up in Denver, worked and played on her family's Wagon Wheel \nRanch in Southern Colorado, and was fundamental in making Aspen a \nthriving mountain town and wonderful place to live. Ruth's touch \nspanned the State and never failed to reach a person or community in \nneed.\n  A veteran, entrepreneur, philanthropist, and mother, Ruth was a truly \naccomplished and inspirational Coloradan. Today we pause to honor her \nlegacy and her welcomed contribution to Colorado's rich \nheritage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/13/senate-section/article/S2443-3", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2443-S2444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING DAVE GENOVA\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, last year we lost a \ngreat man and leader whom I knew well, Dave Genova. On March 28, 2010, \nDave passed away at the age of 67.\n  From my days as an educator and guide in the Outward Bound Program, I\n\n[[Page S2444]]\n\nknew Dave to be a remarkably talented and committed individual with a \ngift for leadership.\n  Dave spent 32 years with Outward Bound, a program that uses the \noutdoors as a classroom to inspire service to others and to coach \nleadership skills, oftentimes to underprivileged youth. Having taught \nsome 2,000 students, he had an incredible enthusiasm for bringing \npeople together to overcome challenges in ways they never thought \npossible.\n  Throughout his tenure in the North Carolina Outward Bound, Dave \nplayed an invaluable role as an educator, but he was also an innovator. \nIn 1999, he started the Unity Project, which is designed to break down \nbarriers of social and economic inequality. His efforts have enabled \nnearly 1,000 young leaders to become agents of social change in their \nlocal schools and communities, and the program continues to educate and \ntrain future leaders today.\n  Dave once said of the Outward Bound School, ``Compassion is the well-\nspring from which we derive our relevance.'' These words should serve \nas a guiding compass for us all. Dave taught from a place of \nunderstanding, and he sought to ensure every one of his students came \naway with a greater appreciation for others and the knowledge that, in \nhis words, ``We're all in this together.'' He used the great outdoors \nto build a sense of community among adventurers, but more important, he \ntaught them how to carry on his work to build bridges between people. \nNeighborhoods, cities, and States have been touched by Dave's work, and \nwe can all be grateful for his contribution.\n  A longtime outdoorsman myself, I appreciate and admire Dave's passion \nfor our wild lands and the lessons they can teach us. Always a bold \nleader, scaling the toughest of life's mountains, Dave's extraordinary \ncharacter exemplifies an ideal to which we all should strive. He is \nmissed by many, but his memory continues to guide me and all his \nstudents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/13/senate-section/article/S2444-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:57 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill and joint resolution, without amendment:\n\n       S. 307.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio requesting the National Museum \n     of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force \n     Base be selected to display one of the space shuttle orbiters \n     at the conclusion of the space shuttle program; to the \n     Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 2\n\n       Whereas, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     (NASA) intends to select a limited number of museums for the \n     display of the space shuttle orbiters that will be retired at \n     the conclusion of the space shuttle program. The National \n     Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air \n     Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, would be an excellent choice \n     for the display of a space shuttle orbiter; and\n       Whereas, the Museum, the world's oldest and largest museum \n     of aviation, is the depository for the Air Force's National \n     HistoricalCollection and features more than 400 aerospace \n     vehicles, includingMercury, Gemini, and Apollo space \n     capsules. With 1.3 million visitors each year, the Museum is \n     the most visited free tourist destination in Ohio and is one \n     of the most visited in the country; and\n       Whereas, the Museum is ready to accommodate a space shuttle \n     orbiter with one million square feetof climate-controlled \n     exhibit space and an adjacent runway that is approved for a \n     landing of the shuttle carrier aircraft with a shuttle. In \n     addition, the Museum employs professional aerospace vehicle \n     restoration staff who are experienced in working with \n     hazardous aerospace materials such as those found on the \n     shuttle and who will ensure the preservation of the shuttle \n     to the highest museum standards; and\n       Whereas, the Museum is located near Dayton, Ohio, the \n     birthplaceof aviation and the home of the Wright Brothers, \n     and in the NationalAviation Heritage Area, an area designated \n     by Congress that includes the Armstrong Air and Space Museum, \n     Dayton Aviation Heritage NationalHistorical Park, and \n     National Aviation Hall of Fame. Finally, the Museum is easily \n     accessible from major population centers and is within a 600-\n     mile radius of 61% of the United States population; and\n\n[[Page S2446]]\n\n       Whereas, the Department of Defense, especially the \n     Department of the Air Force, collaborated extensively with \n     NASA's space shuttle program, including influencing the basic \n     shuttle design, providing many highly skilled shuttle \n     astronauts, and saving the program in lean budget years \n     during its development; and\n       Whereas, The Secretary of the Air Force has requested that \n     the NASA Administrator transfer a space shuttle orbiter to \n     the Air Force for placement in the Air Force's National \n     Historical Collection through interagency transfer using \n     existing statutes and regulations. This transfer will ensure \n     that a taxpayer-funded space shuttle arbiter will be kept \n     under the ownership and stewardship of the United States \n     government and the American people; Now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the 129th General \n     Assembly of State of Ohio, conclude that it is in the \n     interest of the American people for a retired space shuttle \n     orbiter to be preserved and exhibited at the National Museum \n     of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force \n     Base near Dayton, Ohio; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the 129th General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio, urge the President of the \n     United States and the Administrator of the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) to honor the \n     request of the Department of the Air Force, for an \n     interagency transfer of an operational space shuttle orbiter \n     so that it can be displayed at the National Museum of the \n     United States Air Force as a national tribute to the American \n     spirit of space exploration and to the indelible partnership \n     between NASA and the Department of the Air Force which helped \n     make the space shuttle program possible; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit duly \n     authenticated copies of this resolution to the President of \n     the United States, the Administrator of the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Speaker and Clerk \n     of the United States House of Representatives, the President \n     Pro Tempore and Secretary of the United State Senate, the \n     members of the Ohio Congressional delegation, and the news \n     media of Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/13/senate-section/article/S2446-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXECUTIVE REPORT OF COMMITTEE\n\n  The following executive report of a nomination was submitted:\n\n       By Mr. LIEBERMAN for the Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs. *Rafael Borras, of Maryland, to be \n     Under Secretary for Management, Department of Homeland \n     Security.\n\n  *Nomination was reported with recommendation that it be confirmed \nsubject to the nominee's commitment to respond to requests to appear \nand testify before any duly constituted committee of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/13/senate-section/article/S2446-2", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. INHOFE:\n       S. 802.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to allow \nthe storage and conveyance of nonproject water at the Norman project in \nOklahoma, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the Senate's \nattention The Lake Thunderbird Efficient Use Act of 2011.\n  This bill allows the Central Oklahoma Master Conservancy District to \nimport and store non-project water into Lake Thunderbird, if the \nSecretary of the Interior determines there is enough capacity to do so. \nAllowing additional water to be stored at Lake Thunderbird would help \nincrease municipal and industrial supplies for the cities served by the \nDistrict, which include Norman, Midwest City, and Del City.\n  There is no cost associated with this bill. Any additional \ninfrastructure needs will be the responsibility of the non-Federal \nestablishment contracting with the Secretary.\n  This legislation does not change the capacity of Lake Thunderbird and \nwill help increase water supplies in a growing metropolitan area. Over \nthe last decade, the Norman area grew by 15 percent making it one of \nthe fastest growing areas in the State. As the area continues to grow, \nand as Tinker Air Force Base requires a growing water supply, there \nwill be a greater need for access to the water supplies of the Lake \nThunderbird reservoir.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Tester):\n  S. 806.

A bill to authorize the Department of Labor's voluntary \nprotection program and to expand the program to include more small \nbusinesses; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with \nSenator Landrieu known as the Voluntary Protection Program Act. This \nbill will codify the Voluntary Protection Programs, or VPP, expand it \nto include more small businesses, and incorporate recent GAO \nrecommendations for program improvements.\n  No program has been more successful in creating such a culture of \nsafety in the workplace than VPP. Since it was created in 1982, \nRepublican and Democrat administrations alike have fostered its growth \nto more than 2,500 worksites, a quarter of which are unionized, and it \ncovers approximately one million employees. The bipartisan support for \nVPP continues into this Congress. Last year, the Senate Budget \nCommittee unanimously approved an amendment to preserve VPP budget \nauthority and I have been pleased to work with the Chair of the Senate \nSmall Business Committee, Senator Landrieu, on this bill again this \nCongress. Our bill is also drawing bipartisan support in the House of \nRepresentatives. Congressmen Tom Petri and Gene Green are introducing \ncompanion legislation today and 1 thank them for their strong support \non this important issue.\n  Worksites that pass the rigorous evaluation process and become VPP \nsites have an average Days Away Restricted or Transferred, DART, case \nrate of 52 percent below the average for its industry. In recent years, \nsmaller worksites have made significant strides in VPP, increasing from \n28 percent of VPP sites in 2003 to 44 percent in 2010.\n  The innovative program doesn't just keep employees safer; as I have \nnoted, it also saves both the VPP companies and the taxpayer's money. \nIn 2007, Federal Agency VPP participants saved the government more than \n$59 million by avoiding injuries and private sector VPP participants \nsaved more than $300 million. The Department of Defense has estimated \nthat it saves between $73,000 and $8.8 million per site because of VPP. \nAdditionally, when workplaces make the significant commitment to safety \nrequired by VPP, it allows OSHA to focus its resources where they are \nmost needed. VPP Participant employers contribute a great deal to the \nVPP program expenditures. VPP participants have assigned approximately \n1,200 of their own employees to act as OSHA Special Government \nEmployees, SGEs, who conduct onsite evaluations for OSHA.\n  Despite the strong bipartisan support for VPP and its very positive \nresults, the need for this legislation has become painfully clear. Last \nyear, the administration's fiscal year 2011 Budget Request proposed \neliminating the small amount it takes to administer VPP--$3.125 \nmillion--and sought to transfer the 35 FTE it takes to run the program \nto other functions. The failure to complete the appropriations process \nlast year thwarted that plan, and the administration did not renew the \nrequest in their fiscal year 2012 budget proposal. I hope that \nDepartment of Labor officials will note the bipartisan support VPP has \nand maintain support for the program. Surely, this proven life and \ncost-saving program is something we can all get behind.\n\n[[Page S2449]]\n\n  I would like to thank Senator Landrieu for working with me on this \nimportant legislation and add the following Senators as original \ncosponsors: Sen.

A bill to provide high-quality charter school options for \nstudents by enabling such public charter schools to expand and \nreplicate; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \ndesigned to improve educational opportunities for struggling students. \nThe All Students Achieving Through Reform Act, or All-STAR Act, would \nprovide Federal resources to the most successful charter schools to \nhelp them grow and replicate.\n  Across the nation, public charter schools are achieving extraordinary \nresults in low-income communities. I have been particularly impressed \nby the Noble Street schools in Chicago. Since opening its first campus \nin 1999, Noble Street has expanded to 10 charter high schools educating \nover 13,000 students in some of Chicago's most difficult neighborhoods. \nNoble Street has achieved phenomenal results. Even though more than 75 \npercent of students enter the schools below grade level, Noble students \nhave the highest ACT scores among Chicago open-enrollment schools. \nEvery year, more than 99 percent of Noble Street's seniors graduate and \nmore than 85 percent go on to college. I see this success in action \nwhen I visit Noble Street schools. As soon as you walk in the door, you \ncan tell that everyone in the building is focused on academic success. \nThe students are actively engaged in their learning. Their teachers and \nprincipals are demanding and inspiring. Noble Street would like to \ncontinue to grow and educate more students in Chicago.\n  Not all charter schools are excellent. Poor-performing charter \nschools should be closed. But we also need to replicate and expand the \nones that are beating the odds, and we need to learn from their \nlessons. We need more excellent charters, like the Noble Street \nschools, in Illinois and around the country.\n  The bill I am introducing today would help make that possible. \nCurrently, Federal funding for charter schools can only be used to \ncreate new schools, not expand or replicate existing schools. My bill \nwould create new grants within the existing charter school program to \nfund the expansion and replication of the most successful charter \nschools. Schools that have achieved results with their students will be \nable to apply for Federal grants to expand their schools to include \nadditional grades or to replicate the model to a new school. Successful \ncharters across the country will be able to grow, providing better \neducational opportunities to thousands of students.\n  The bill also incentivizes the adoption of strong charter school \npolicies by states. We know that successful charter schools thrive when \nthey have autonomy, freedom to grow, and strong accountability based on \nmeeting performance targets. The bill would give grant priority to \nstates that provide that environment. The bill also requires new levels \nof charter school authorizer reporting and accountability to ensure \nthat good charter schools are able to succeed while bad charter schools \nare improved or shut down.\n\n[[Page S2450]]\n\n  This bill will improve educational opportunities for students across \nthe nation. Charter schools represent some of the brightest spots in \nurban education today, and successful models have the full support of \nthe President and Secretary Duncan. We need to help these schools grow \nand bring their best lessons into our regular public schools so that \nall students can benefit. Supporting the growth of successful charter \nschools should be a part of the conversation when we take up \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I thank \nSenator Kirk, Senator Landrieu, and Representative Polis in the House \nfor joining me in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 809\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit the conducting of invasive research on \ngreat apes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nend the use of Great Apes in invasive research and urge my Senate \ncolleagues to support the Great Ape Protection and Cost Savings Act.\n  The Great Ape Protection and Cost Savings Act would prohibit invasive \nresearch on all Great Apes, including gorillas, orangutans, and \nchimpanzees--who are the primary Great Apes used in research today. The \nbill would also require the immediate retirement of 500 federally-owned \nchimpanzees to great ape sanctuaries.\n  Today about 1,000 chimpanzees--half of them federally owned--languish \nat great taxpayer expense in eight research laboratories across the \nNation.\n  These chimpanzees are being held or used for invasive biomedical \nresearch, research that may cause death, bodily injury, pain, distress, \nfear, and trauma. Invasive research practices include techniques such \nas injecting a chimpanzee with a drug that would be detrimental to its \nhealth, infecting a chimp with a disease, cutting a chimp or removing \nbody parts, and isolation or social deprivation.\n  The vast majority of these animals--between 80 and 90 percent--aren't \nactually being used in research, but instead are warehoused, simply \nwasting away in these facilities. For example, approximately half of \nthe government-owned chimpanzees are being held in a facility in New \nMexico where no research is being conducted.\n  Some chimpanzees have been in labs for more than 50 years, confined \nin steel cages for most of their lives and enduring sometimes painful \nand distressing experimental procedures.\n  The fact that the vast majority of federally-owned chimpanzees are \nnot being used in active research, but instead are warehoused in labs \nat the taxpayer expense, underlines the futility of their continued \nconfinement.\n  For a single chimpanzee, lifetime care in a research facility can \ncost over $1 million, compared with $340,000 for superior care in a \nsanctuary. Ending invasive research will mean a savings of more than \n$25 million per year for the American people.\n  Chimpanzees are poor research models for human illness, and they have \nbeen of limited use in the study of human disease. Despite how similar \nthey are to us, significant differences in their immunology and disease \nprogression make them ineffective models for human diseases like HIV, \ncancer, and heart disease research.\n  For example, research published in the Journal of Medical Primatology \nin 2009, on hepatitis C indicates that use of chimpanzees has produced \npoor results. And the National Center for Research Resources under the \nNational Institutes of Health has prohibited breeding of government-\nowned chimpanzees for research. In effect, NIH has already decided that \nthe chimpanzee is not an essential animal model for human medical \nresearch.\n\n  Significant genetic and physiological differences between great apes \nand humans also make chimpanzees a poor research model for human \ndiseases. We have spent millions of dollars over several decades on \nchimpanzee-based HIV and Hepatitis C research with no resulting \nvaccines for those diseases. Chimpanzees largely failed as a model for \nHIV because the virus does not cause illness in chimpanzees as it does \nto humans.\n  These are very social, highly intelligent animals--with the ability, \nfor example, to learn American Sign Language. Their intelligence and \nability to experience emotions so similar to humans underscores how \nchimpanzees suffer intensely under laboratory conditions.\n  Their psychological suffering in laboratories produces human-like \nsymptoms of stress, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder \nafter decades of living in isolation in small cages.\n  Given their social nature and capacity for suffering and boredom due \nto lack of stimulation, the 500 privately-owned chimpanzees and 500 \nfederally-owned chimpanzees being held in research laboratories would \nbe better off in sanctuaries. And by doing so we would save more than \n$25 million taxpayer dollars each year. This is because the cost of \ncaring for a chimpanzee in a sanctuary is a fraction of the cost of \ntheir housing and maintenance in a laboratory. And many in the \nscientific community believe this money could be allocated to more \neffective research.\n  In my home State of Washington, I am proud that we have Chimpanzee \nSanctuary Northwest. Chimpanzee Sanctuary Northwest provides \nsustainable sanctuary for seven chimpanzees retired in 2008 from \ndecades in research facilities.\n  The United States is currently behind the rest of the world in \noutlawing this sad practice.\n  Australia, Austria, Belgium, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, \nSweden, and the United Kingdom have all banned or severely limited \nexperiments on great apes. And several other countries and the European \nUnion are considering similar bans as well.\n  We are the only country--besides Gabon in West Africa--that is still \nholding or using chimpanzees for invasive research. It's past time for \nthe United States to catch up with the rest of the world by ending this \nantiquated use of this endangered species.\n\n[[Page S2454]]\n\n  We are lagging behind in action, but the desire to end invasive \nresearch on Great Apes has been present for more than a decade. In \n1997, the National Research Council concluded that there should be a \nmoratorium on further chimpanzee breeding. And the National Institutes \nof Health (NIH) has already announced an end to funding for the \nbreeding of federally-owned chimpanzees for research, but this should \nbe codified.\n  Government needs to take action to make invasive research on \nchimpanzees illegal.\n  That is why today I am introducing the bipartisan Great Ape \nProtection and Cost Savings Act, along with my colleagues Senators \nSusan Collins, Bernie Sanders and Joe Lieberman.\n  The Great Ape Protection and Cost Savings Act is a commonsense policy \nreform to protect our closest living relatives in the animal kingdom \nfrom physical and psychological harm, and help reduce government \nspending and our federal deficit.\n  Specifically, this bill will phase out the use of chimpanzees in \ninvasive research over a three-year period, require permanent \nretirement to suitable sanctuaries for the 500 federally-owned \nchimpanzees currently being warehoused in research laboratories, and \ncodifies the current administrative moratorium on government-funded \nbreeding of chimpanzees.\n  We have been delaying this action for too long. It is time to get \nthis done and end this type of harmful research and end this wasteful \ngovernment spending.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/13/senate-section/article/S2454-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 144--SUPPORTING EARLY DETECTION FOR BREAST CANCER\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S.

Res. 135\n\n       Whereas, on April 10, 2010, the President of the Republic \n     of Poland Lech Kaczynski, his wife Maria, and a cadre of \n     current and former Polish statesmen, military officers, \n     family members, and others departed Warsaw by plane to travel \n     to the Russian region of Smolensk;\n       Whereas the purpose of the delegation's visit was to hold a \n     ceremony in solemn remembrance of the more than 22,000 Polish \n     military officers, police officers, judges, other government \n     officials, and civilians who were executed by the Soviet \n     secret police, the ``NKVD'', between April 3 and the end of \n     May 1940;\n       Whereas more than 14,500 Polish victims of such executions \n     have been documented at 3 sites in Katyn (in present day \n     Belarus), in Miednoye (in present day Russia), and in Kharkiv \n     (in present day Ukraine), while the remains of an estimated \n     7,000 such Polish victims have yet to be precisely located;\n       Whereas the plane carrying the Polish delegation on April \n     10, 2010, crashed in Smolensk, tragically killing all 96 \n     persons on board;\n       Whereas Poland has been a leading member of the \n     transatlantic community and the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO), an Alliance vital to the interests of \n     the United States, and Poland's membership in the Alliance \n     has strengthened NATO;\n       Whereas the Polish armed forces have stood shoulder-to-\n     shoulder and sacrificed with airmen, marines, sailors, and \n     soldiers of the United States in Iraq, Afghanistan, the \n     Balkans, and around the world;\n       Whereas Poland has been a leader in the promotion of human \n     rights, not just in Central Europe, but elsewhere around the \n     world; and\n       Whereas the deep friendship between the governments and \n     people of Poland and the United States is grounded in our \n     mutual respect, shared values, and common priorities on \n     nuclear nonproliferation, counterterrorism, human rights, \n     regional cooperation in Eastern Europe, democratization, and \n     international development: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) remembers the terrible tragedy that took place on April \n     10, 2010, when an aircraft\n\n[[Page S2458]]\n\n     carrying a delegation of current and former Polish officials, \n     family members, and others crashed en route from Warsaw to \n     Smolensk to memorialize the 1940 Katyn massacres, killing all \n     96 passengers;\n       (2) honors the memories of all Poles executed by the NKVD \n     at Katyn, Miednoye, Khakriv, and elsewhere and those who \n     perished in the April 10, 2010, plane crash;\n       (3) expresses continuing sympathy for the surviving family \n     members of those who perished in the tragic plane crash of \n     April 10, 2010;\n       (4) recognizes and respects the resilience of Poland's \n     constitution, as demonstrated by the smooth and stable \n     transfer of constitutional authority that occurred in the \n     immediate aftermath of the April 10, 2010, tragedy; and\n       (5) requests that the Secretary of the Senate transmit an \n     enrolled copy of this resolution to the Ambassador of Poland \n     to the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/13/senate-section/article/S2458-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF DAVID COHEN\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.
