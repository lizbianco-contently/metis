Mr. President, in the weeks since our country voted to \nreturn President Obama to the White House and a Democratic majority in \nthe Senate, I have spoken often about compromise. I remain optimistic \nthat when it comes to our economy, when it comes to protecting middle-\nclass families from a whopping tax hike come January 1, Republicans and \nDemocrats will be able to find common ground.\n  President Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican, once said:\n\n       People talk about the middle of the road as though it were \n     unacceptable. . . . There have to be compromises. The middle \n     of the road is all of the usable surface.\n\n  So said Dwight Eisenhower. Too often Republicans and Democrats in \nWashington face off from our entrenched positions, never realizing the \nsolutions to this country's problems rest not on one side of the aisle \nor the other but somewhere in the middle.\n  However, as we continue negotiating a responsible path forward, I \nremind everyone within the sound of my voice of one fact: This Congress \nis already one vote away from avoiding the fiscal cliff for middle-\nclass families and small businesses. We could solve the greatest \neconomic emergency facing the Nation today if only the House would \nconsider the Senate-passed bill freezing tax rates for 98 percent of \nAmerican families and 97 percent of small businesses.\n  As Thomas Jefferson said, ``We should not put off tomorrow what we \ncan do today.'' Our legislation would give economic certainty to the \nmiddle class, protect important tax deductions for families and \nbusinesses, and restore\n\n[[Page S6878]]\n\nbalance by asking the most fortunate among us to pay a little extra to \nreduce the debt.\n  It is also the only bill with a chance of being signed into law by \nPresident Obama. I was dismayed to hear Speaker Boehner once again urge \nthe Senate to take up the House-passed bill extending more tax breaks \nfor millionaires and billionaires. The Senate has already considered \nthat bill. We rejected it on a bipartisan basis.\n  So for the Speaker to say, bring it up, we already have. It was voted \ndown in this Congress. The Senate has spoken. President Obama has \nspoken. He has promised he will not sign any bill that mortgages our \nfuture to pay for handouts for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans.\n  I only hope the House Republicans have been listening. I also hope my \ncolleagues, Republican and Democratic Members of the House and the \nSenate, used the Thanksgiving break not only to give thanks but also to \nreflect on the monumental tasks ahead. I hope they took time to \nreflect, too, on the effort it will take to complete these tasks.\n  As President Eisenhower said, there will have to be compromises, and \nseeking the middle of the road is not just acceptable, it is the only \nway forward.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  Mr. President, let me say a few words about the schedule. Discussions \ncontinue on the Defense authorization bill. I just finished a \nconversation with the chairman of the committee, Senator Levin. \nRepublican Senators have been having disagreements among themselves on \nwhat they want to do on the Defense bill. Thus, while these discussions \nare going on, I intend to move to proceed to the Carcieri decision \naffecting Native Americans. I will file cloture on the motion to \nproceed on the motion to invoke cloture on Wednesday.\n  Tomorrow, I intend to move to proceed to executive session to \nconsider the disability treaty. We will seek a reasonable agreement on \namendments to this matter. If on Wednesday cloture is not invoked on \nthe Carcieri matter, I would intend to figure out some way, with the \nhelp of Senator McCain and others on the other side, to return to the \nDefense bill under the tentative agreements we have had on that before. \nIt is up to Senator Levin and Senator McCain to figure out a way \nforward on that. I am willing to work with them as to what is \nreasonable this late in the game.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/26/senate-section/article/S6878-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as most Americans know by now, the next \nfew weeks are critically important in the life of our Nation. Unless \nthe President leads and Congress acts, the combination of automatic tax \nhikes and spending cuts will go into effect that could have a \ndevastating effect on our national defense and on an already painfully \nslow economy.\n  What is more, the Nation's finances are teetering on the edge, \nthreatening even greater hardship for literally millions unless we \nbring Federal spending into balance. The question is, What are we going \nto do about all of this? How do we face up to the fiscal \nirresponsibility and can kicking that got us here and finally do what \nis right for the country?\n  I do not think it is a secret that for our part the Republicans have \nshown a clear willingness to make tough choices in order to find a \nsolution to the trillion-dollar deficits of the last 4 years. We have \nbeen open to revenue by closing loopholes, as long as it is tied to \nspending cuts and progrowth tax reform that broadens the base and \nlowers rates.\n  This is the model laid out by the Bowles-Simpson Commission, and it \nis a model both parties should step forward and embrace. Without \ncompromising our principles, we have put skin in the game and \nrecognition of that while Democrats do not run this town, neither do \nwe. We have been responsible even as we have remained firm on this \npoint: No tax increases now for promised spending cuts that will not \nmaterialize later. The American people have seen that game before and \nthey will not be fooled again.\n  The only balanced approach is one that includes real and lasting \nreforms. So Republicans have stepped out of our comfort zone. We have \nbeen clear about what we will do and what we will not. Yet we remain at \nan impasse, leading us to ask why. Because a vocal minority on the hard \nleft continues to argue to leaders of their party, from the President \non down, that Democrats in Washington should do absolutely nothing \nabout short-term or long-term spending problems.\n  This is the ``Thelma and Louise'' crowd, the ones who dream about \nhigher taxes and the bigger government it will pay for, regardless of \nthe impact on jobs or the economy or America's standing in the world. \nThese are the ones who recklessly ignore the fact that we cannot \ncontinue running trillion-dollar deficits every year and throw a \ntantrum if somebody suggests that maybe the taxpayers should not keep \nsubsidizing every last program Washington ever dreamed up.\n  Their reckless and ideological approach threatens our very future. \nAnyone who is serious about solving the problems we face should ignore \nall that, starting with the President. The election is over, but the \neconomy and fiscal problems of the past several years have only gotten \nworse. It is time for the President to present a plan that rises above \nthese reckless and radical voices on the hard left, that goes beyond \nthe talking points of the campaign trail, and that has a realistic \nchance of passing the Congress. The time, in other words, for \ncampaigning is over. It is time for the President to lead.\n  A little over 1 week ago, I attended a meeting with the President \ndown at the White House. It was positive and productive and afterward I \nwas confident that all sides were eager to figure out a solution to the \npresent challenges that respects our respective principles. But as I \nhave said repeatedly, the only person in America who can make or break \nit is the President himself.\n  He is the only one who can lead his party to do something they would \nnot ordinarily do, to do what is actually needed now. That is why he is \nthe one who has to present a plan for success. So we will continue to \nwait on the President and hope he has what it takes to bring people \ntogether and forge a compromise. If he does, we will get there. If he \ndoes not, we will not. It is that simple.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/26/senate-section/article/S6878-3", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6878-S6884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CHANGING SENATE RULES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to turn to another issue \nthat does not grab as many headlines as these others we have been \nfocused on these last few days but which is critically important since \nit relates to the mortal threat that has been quietly gathering against \none of the most cherished safeguards of our government.\n  I am referring to the latest effort by some on the other side, most \nof whom have never served a day in the minority, to force a change in \nSenate rules at the beginning of the new year that would fundamentally \nchange the character of the Senate. This is no exaggeration.\n  What these Democrats have in mind is a fundamental change to the way \nthe Senate operates for the purpose of consolidating their own power \nand further marginalizing the minority voice the Senate was built to \nprotect.\n  In the name of efficiency, their plan is to use a heavy-handed tactic \nthat would poison party relations even more. In the name of efficiency, \nthey would prevent the very possibility of compromise and threaten to \nmake the disputes of the past few years mere pillow fights. To \nunderstand why, let me explain in a little more detail what is being \nproposed.\n  What this small group of primarily Senate sophomores is now proposing \nis that when the Senate gavels in at the beginning of the new Congress, \na bare majority of Senators can disregard the rule that says changes to \nthe Senate rules can only be approved on the same broad bipartisan \nbasis we reserve for approving treaties and overriding Presidential \nvetoes, a supermajority plus.\n  Lyndon Johnson once said of the 67-vote threshold for changes to the \nrules that it ``preserves indisputably the\n\n[[Page S6879]]\n\ncharacter of the Senate as the one continuing body in our policy making \nprocess.''\n  Senator Reid himself once described changing the Senate procedure by \nmajority fiat as ``breaking the rules to change the rules.''\n  What is being proposed now would undermine the very purpose of the \nSenate as the one place in our system where minority views and opinions \nhave been respected and heard and, in most cases, incorporated into \nlaw.\n  Until now, you could say that protecting the rights of a political \nminority has always been the defining characteristic of the Senate. \nThat is why Members of both parties have always defended it whether \nthey were in the majority or minority, because they knew the Senate was \nthe last legislative check against the kind of raw exercise of power \nmajority parties have always been tempted to wield.\n  The Congressional Record contains literally mountains of reverential \nstatements by Republicans and Democrats extolling the near-sacred \ncharacter of the Senate as the one legislative body on Earth that \nprotects minority views from majority rule, and it requires \nsupermajorities for anything significant to become law.\n  Why is that? So that majorities can't simply roll over those who \ndisagree with them, and, just as important, so majority parties are \nforced to resolve the great issues of the moment in the middle, \nensuring their stability and their permanence. It is this mechanism \nthat has so frustrated majority parties over the years but which has \nensured, at least most of the time, that our laws are stable and not \nsubject to change every time the parties change power. This is what \nmakes the Senate different. This is what makes this body great.\n  Up until recently many of those who now want to change these rules \nagreed with what I just said. Just a few years ago, as I have already \nindicated, the majority leader was one of the staunchest defenders of \nthe Senate's protection of minority rights for all of the reasons I \nhave mentioned. Yet now he finds himself frustrated with those rules he \nonce championed. He is prepared to recklessly throw those rules away \nand his own solemn pledges to defend them.\n  On December 8, 2006, the majority leader made a public pledge to \nfight all efforts to change all rules protecting the minority once he \nbecame the majority leader. It is a pledge he repeated during another \nproposed rules change 2 years ago. I wish to quote in full what the \nmajority leader said that day because in light of his words, it is hard \nto believe what he is proposing to do now.\n  Here is what he said:\n\n       As Majority Leader, I intend to run the Senate with respect \n     for the rules and for the minority rights the rules protect. \n     The Senate was not established to be efficient. Sometimes the \n     rules get in the way of efficiency. The Senate was \n     established to make sure that minorities are protected. \n     Majorities can always protect themselves, but minorities \n     cannot. That is what the Senate is all about. For more than \n     200 years the rules of the Senate have protected the American \n     people, and rightfully so. The need to muster 60 votes in \n     order to terminate Senate debate naturally frustrates the \n     majority and oftentimes the minority. I am sure it will \n     frustrate me when I assume the office of majority leader in a \n     few weeks, but I recognize this requirement is a tool that \n     serves the long-term interest of the Senate and the American \n     people and our country. It is often said that the laws are \n     ``the system of wise restraints that set men free.'' The same \n     might be said of the Senate rules. I will do my part as \n     majority leader to foster respect for the rules and \n     traditions of our great institution. I say on this floor that \n     I love so much that I believe in the Golden Rule. I am going \n     to treat my Republican colleagues the way that I expect to be \n     treated. There is no ``I've got you,'' no get even. I am \n     going to do everything I can to preserve the traditions and \n     rules of this institution that I love.\n\n  That is the end of the quote from my friend, the majority leader, \njust a few years ago. He acknowledged that ``the Senate was not \nestablished to be efficient,'' but rather ``to make sure that \nminorities are protected.'' With this fundamental purpose of the Senate \nin mind, he pledged he would do everything he could to preserve the \ntraditions and rules of this institution that he loves.\n  It is hard to imagine a clearer pledge than that, and I am afraid \nthat going back on it now would have such a corrosive effect on comity \nthat it would threaten our ability to get anything accomplished around \nhere.\n  Let's be clear: The rules change that is being proposed is not an \naffront to me or to the Republican Party. It is an affront to the \nAmerican people. It is an affront to the people who sent me and the \nother 46 Republicans here to represent them in the Senate, but these \nvoices would be shut out if the majority leader and this cohort of \nshortsighted Senate sophomores have their way and permanently change \nthis body.\n  At the moment Republicans represent the voters of 31 States, \nrepresenting a total population of more than 180 million Americans. \nShutting off our right to express the views of our constituents, as is \nbeing proposed, would effectively shut these people out of the process. \nWhat the majority leader and his cohort of Senators, who don't seem to \nunderstand what the Senate was intended for, are proposing would \nguarantee that the one sure means our constituents now have of being \nheard in Washington would be gone.\n  If a bare majority can proceed to any bill it chooses, and once on \nthat bill the majority leader, all by himself, can shut out all \namendments that aren't to his liking, then those who elected us to \nadvocate for their views will have lost their voice in this legislative \nprocess. This is something the majority leader used to understand. He \nused to understand that protecting the rights of the minority party \nmeant protecting the rights of the people who sent us here to be heard \nin Washington. He understood the importance of defending the minority \nview when he was in the minority. Now that he has been in the majority \nhe seems to have conveniently forgotten all of that.\n  The people of Kentucky elected two Republican leaders to the Senate. \nDoes the majority leader think the views of the people of Kentucky \nshouldn't be heard? Does he think Nevadans who sent Senator Heller to \nthe Senate shouldn't be heard? Does he believe that on the day he finds \nhimself in the minority once again that he should no longer be heard? \nOr does he think that Democrats will remain in the majority from now \nuntil the end of time?\n  For the past several years many of us on the Republican side have \nraised loud objection to the diminished rights of the minority to \nparticipate in the legislative process around here. Democratic leaders \nhave tried in more ways than one to silence those with whom they \ndisagree. They have blocked Members, including their own committee \nchairmen, from expressing themselves in committee through unprecedented \nuse of Senate rule XIV, which allows them to bypass committees \naltogether.\n  They have blocked Members from expressing themselves through an \nunprecedented use of filling the amendment tree, which prevents the \nSenate from considering amendments the majority leader doesn't like. No \namendments in committee, no amendments on the floor.\n\n  The majority leader made this clear to Senator McCain in a remarkable \nmoment of candor when he bragged that the ``amendment days are over.'' \nHe has preferred to write legislation in the confines of his conference \nroom rather than in the public eye, as he did most famously with the \ndrafting of ObamaCare.\n  I say to everyone: If you want more legislation around here the way \nthat bill was crafted, then you ought to be pretty enthusiastic about \nwhat the majority leader is proposing because that is where this is \nheaded, more authoritarianism, more secrecy, and even less input from \nrank-and-file Members on both sides of the aisle.\n  As I said, we have protested all of this and have spoken out loudly \nagainst the abuses of the Senate. But now the majority leader wants to \ngo even further. He doesn't propose to simply abuse the rules, he wants \nto break the rules and his own very public pledge to defend those rules \nat all costs. Make no mistake, what the majority leader is proposing is \na Senate where the only rule is his whim; where the rest of us are \nbystanders, including the Members of his own party.\n  Do the Democrats really want to go down this road? Do they really \nthink they are going to be in the majority forever? We have Members \nfrom both parties who used to serve in the House of Representatives, \nDemocrats and Republicans, who said to me they thought the Senate was \ndifferent.\n\n[[Page S6880]]\n\n  I don't care whether you are a Republican or whether you are a \nDemocrat, you came to the Senate because you knew that here you could \nmake a difference for your constituents; here you would be heard; here \nyou could offer amendments; here the minority was protected; here the \nmajority leader had to work with the other side.\n  What even Senate Democrats have discovered over the past few years is \na very different place--a place where committees no longer matter, \nwhere Members of both parties are shut out of the debate and where \nbills are drafted behind closed doors, where politicians trade favors \nin secret instead of exchanging ideas in public just to get legislation \nacross the finish line.\n  When I come to the Senate every day I know I work in a body of people \nwho have different views than I do about the role of government and the \nbest solutions to the problems we face. But I know the price of \nbelonging to this place is having to hear them out and to vote on their \nideas, and the price of belonging here is that they have to do the \nsame.\n  The American people need to know what is going on here, and that is \nwhy I hope Republicans and many Democrats who care about this \ninstitution, rather than some temporary exercise of raw partisan \npolitical power, will come forward over the next few weeks and speak \nout against this naked power grab. When they do, I hope they will be \nguided by the words of another former Democratic Senator who said the \nfollowing about the Senate and its uniqueness. This is what this former \nDemocratic Senator said:\n\n       The American people sent us here to be their voice. They \n     understand that those voices can at times become loud and \n     argumentative, but they also hope we can disagree without \n     being disagreeable. At the end of the day, they expect both \n     parties to work together to get the people's business done. \n     What they do not expect is for one party, be it Republican or \n     Democrat, to change the rules in the middle of the game so \n     they can make all the decisions while the other party is told \n     to sit down and keep quiet. The American people want less \n     partnership in this town, but everyone in this chamber knows \n     that if the majority chooses to end the filibuster, if they \n     choose to change the rules and put an end to democratic \n     debate, then the fighting, the bitterness, and the gridlock \n     will only get worse.\n\n  That Senate Democrat was President Obama. I don't often agree with \nPresident Obama on matters of policy, and the issue he was referring to \nhere was different than this one. But the principle he expressed in \ndefending his position then is one that I believe in wholeheartedly.\n  Let me sum it this way: For the sake of this institution and the \nfuture of the country, I implore Members on both sides to oppose this \nnaked power grab strenuously and loudly. It may be the most important \nthing they ever do because the debates of the moment are passing, but \nthe Senate must endure and nothing less is at stake.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. The one thing the Republican leader said that is absolutely \ntrue is I follow the Golden Rule, and it is very clear what has \nhappened during this Congress. We can go over all the numbers--and I \nthink they project what has happened--about the hundreds and hundreds \nof times that we have been forced to file cloture on relatively \nmeaningless things.\n  My friend the Republican leader claims changing the rule to make the \nSenate more efficient is an assault on minority rights. In fact, it is \na response to the abuse of the filibuster by Senate Republicans. He \nkeeps talking about getting rid of the filibuster. I and no one on the \nDemocratic side have proposed getting rid of the filibuster, but we \nhave proposed making this place more efficient.\n  We had a run at this 2 years ago. We had a so-called gentleman's \nagreement that the motion to proceed would be filibustered rarely. We \nfilibustered almost every time a bill came up, so that simply didn't \nwork. I am not proposing that we get rid of the filibuster, just that \nwe do away with filibusters on the motion to proceed, period.\n  To the average American, reforms are just common sense, Mr. \nPresident. Americans believe Congress is broken. Once again, the only \nones who disagree are Mitch McConnell and Republicans in Congress. The \nAmerican people know, Democrats and Republicans, that this place isn't \nworking and there needs to be some changes so we can proceed to get \nsome legislation passed. We know that during the same time frame as \nLyndon Johnson's 6 years--and I will have 6 years in the same position \nat the end of this year--I have faced 386 filibusters. It keeps going \nup because we had a couple more very recently. Lyndon Johnson had one. \nToday it takes more than a week--in fact, it takes about 10 days--to \neven begin considering a bill, before we are even on the bill, let \nalone trying to pass that legislation.\n\n  So it is time to get the Senate working again, not for the good of \nthe current Democratic majority or some future Republican majority but \nfor the good of the country. And as for these plaintive cries that we \nare getting rid of the filibuster, it simply isn't true. I believe in \nthe filibuster. I believe in it. I believe in minority rights. The \nfilibuster is not part of the Constitution. It is something we \ndeveloped here to help get legislation passed, but now it is being used \nto stop legislation from passing.\n  So we are going to continue moving forward to make the Senate more \nefficient. Does that mean it will be really efficient? No, because we \nare changing one aspect of the filibuster rule. And what is that? We \nare going to change it so that it doesn't take us 10 days to simply get \non a bill before we can start legislating. The American people know \nthis is the right way to go. The only people who would think the Senate \nis working now with its obstruction at every step of the way are the \nRepublicans.\n  Mr. President, I have said this before: Any change that has been \nsuggested in these rules that we believe need to be changed wouldn't \naffect me if I were in the minority. I would have many opportunities to \ntake care of the sparsely populated State of Nevada and take care of \nthe other issues I want to defend. But we believe there should be one \naspect of the Senate to change, and that is that the motion to proceed \nshould be a nondebatable motion to proceed. It is as simple as that.\n  The American people agree. I repeat: The only ones who disagree, who \nthink this Senate is working well, are the Republican leader and those \nRepublicans in Congress.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I hope the majority leader will stay on the floor \nhere.\n  I gather the way the majority leader proposes to effectuate this \nrules change is to violate the current rule of the Senate; in other \nwords, to do it with a simple majority. You didn't address that issue.\n  Mr. REID. Of course his statement is untrue and I don't accept that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I believe I have the floor.\n  That is the point. What the majority leader is saying is he will \nbreak the rules of the Senate in order to change the rules of the \nSenate. It has been the case in the past that it took a supermajority \nof 67, which of course meant most rules changes occurred because the \ntwo leaders agreed to them and were proposing them jointly. Instead, \nwhat the majority leader is saying is he will propose to change the \nrules with 51 votes, meaning his side gets to decide what the rules \nare. The danger of that, of course, is let us assume--I know the \nmajority leader thinks he is going to be the majority leader forever; \nhe isn't. What if it is 2 years from now and what if my Members say, \nwell, if 51 Democrats can change the rules of the Senate, why can't the \nRepublicans? Why should we have to fiddle with these people in the \nminority?\n  What is the point? Why not just change the rules of the Senate and \nturn the Senate into the House?\n  That is why Lyndon Johnson felt so strongly that a rules change \nshould require a supermajority of 67, not 60, thereby virtually \nguaranteeing that any significant changes in the way the body operates \nare done on a bipartisan basis.\n  Further, the majority leader calls anything a filibuster when he \ndecides to file a cloture motion, which he routinely does on virtually \nevery bill, and then complains because we are reluctant to go to the \nbill without some assurances we are going to be able to offer \namendments.\n  So here is the way it works: The majority leader calls up a bill, he \nfiles cloture on the motion to proceed, we\n\n[[Page S6881]]\n\nenter into a discussion in order to get some understanding that we are \ngoing to have a chance to offer any amendments. And the reason we \nengage in that discussion is because throughout the last Congress \ngetting to offer an amendment was kind of an unusual thing, because as \nsoon as you get on the bill, the majority leader fills up the amendment \ntree, which means he alone gets to decide, he alone, out of 100 of us, \ngets to decide who gets to offer an amendment. In other words, he gets \nto pick our amendments for us.\n  Look, the motion to proceed has been an irritant to the majority \nleader. Had I been in his job, what I would have done is put somebody \nin the Chair, keep the person objecting here up all night and wear them \ndown. We are almost never in at night. I can't remember the last time \nwe had a vote on a Friday. It is pretty easy working in the Senate \nbecause we never use the fatigue factor to accomplish things.\n  We have actually had some examples, by the way, of doing things the \nright way. We had three bills earlier this year that, believe it or \nnot, actually came out of committee, were actually supported by \nDemocrats and Republicans in committee, who worked on the bill in \ncommittee, and they came out on the floor and were open for amendments \nand they actually passed: postal reform, the transportation bill, and \nthe farm bill. All were handled in the normal way we used to do \nvirtually every bill in the Senate. None of them were written in the \nmajority leader's office, as far as I could tell. And the thing they \nall three had in common is they actually passed the Senate and Members \nfelt as though they were invested in the process.\n  So, look, we don't have a rules problem, we have a behavioral \nproblem. When the majority leader believes he gets to decide what \nhappens on every bill, that is beyond the purview of the job he holds. \nWhat we need to do is start operating in a normal fashion which \nrespects the views and involvement of all Members of the Senate in both \nparties. Is it a little bit harder to engage in these discussions? Yes, \nit is. It is harder. But to go out and decide to break the rules to \nchange the rules because you might have to work a little bit harder to \nget where you are headed strikes me as a disservice to the institution \nand a disservice to the Senate.\n  Nobody is going to buy this notion about all these filibusters. He is \nfiling cloture on the motion to proceed on day one. And the reason he \nhas had to file cloture on the motion to proceed so frequently is \nbecause we can't get any assurance from the majority leader that we \nwere going to be able to offer any amendments. That is the problem. We \nneed to behave differently. That is the way to get this place \nfunctioning again.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I had the pleasure of serving with one of \nthe greatest Senators in the history of this country, Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan of New York. He said people are entitled to their own opinions \nbut not their own facts. And that is what my friend the Republican \nleader now has, his own set of facts which belies the record before the \nAmerican people.\n  It is ironic the Republican leader complains about those who want to \nchange the Senate rules. It is ironic because he has been at the \nforefront of abusing these rules for the past 6 years. It is ironic \nbecause when he was in the majority 7 years ago, he sought to change \nthe rules to streamline votes on judicial nominations. He was part of \nthat program. And it is ironic because he is one of a very small group \nof people who think the Senate is working just fine.\n  Rules change around here. They change. You know, it used to be to cut \noff a filibuster it took 67 votes. The Senate changed that because it \nbecame too burdensome.\n  I have said on many occasions, and I will say again here--and I have \nsaid this in public gatherings and private gatherings--these minor \nchanges I am suggesting wouldn't affect anyone who had the thought of \nmaking America better, even if I were in the minority. To stop a \nfilibuster on a motion to proceed to a bill--to take 10 days to just \nget on a bill--I don't think is good and we need to change that. So----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the majority yield on that point for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to in one second.\n  The Republican leader keeps talking about not following the rules. We \nare following the Constitution of the United States to make these \nchanges, and that is certainly appropriate.\n  Your question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If this is such a reasonable rule change, why not work \nto try to propose it on a joint basis, subject it to the 61-vote \nthreshold? That would honor the tradition that the Senate is a \ncontinuous body whose rules go from Congress to Congress. I mean, that \nis what has been unique about the way rules changes have been done \naround here.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. And one further question, in addition.\n  Mr. REID. Sorry.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. How would you feel if 2 years from now I have your job \nand my Members say, why don't we get rid of the filibuster with just 51 \nvotes?\n  Mr. REID. I think that would be wrong, but we are not trying to get \nrid of the filibuster. We are changing a tiny aspect of what goes on \naround here so that people would have to do a couple of things: One is \nto not filibuster simply getting on a bill. And also, if they want to \nfilibuster, they would have to stand and talk about it and not be in \ntheir office someplace.\n  Senator Durbin just reminded me of one Republican Senator who forced \nus to be here over the weekend and he then left and went back to a \nwedding in his State.\n  I repeat for the third time, the only people who think the Senate is \nworking really well right now are the Republican leader and Republican \nSenators because it is not working well. They have abused the process. \nThey have abused something that was set up to help legislation get \npassed--the filibuster. They have abused it and now they filibuster on \neverything.\n  They can talk all they want about filling the amendment tree and all \nthat, but that has no bearing on what is going on around here. We have \ntried to get things done. The Defense bill is a good example. I said, \nlet's move to the Defense bill and they objected to it. They have been \ntalking about it for months. I agreed to move to it, with no \npreconditions at all.\n  We have to do other things. We have a very short period of time here \nnow, and everything around here is the bill stall. He talks about \ngetting bills done. In this Congress we have gotten almost nothing \ndone. We struggled through a highway bill that took 6 weeks. We spent \nmonths of our time on that dealing with contraception. We were able to \nwork through that. We had a postal bill we spent a lot of time on here, \nand the House has put that in their garbage pile so that nothing has \nhappened with that; the farm bill, the same thing.\n  We have gotten almost nothing done. Why? Because we have spent \nweeks--weeks--simply getting on a bill so we can start legislating. So \nif the Republican leader thinks things are going well here, he is in a \ndistinct minority because things aren't going well around here. And I \nthink an example, I repeat, is Lyndon Johnson's 1 cloture and Harry \nReid's 386. That says it all.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, when I quote the Democratic leader, I \nuse his exact words--his exact words--which I did throughout my \ncomments. Yet he makes up words for me. I have never said the Senate is \nworking fine. I think the Senate has been disastrously run for the last \n2 years--disastrously run not because of the rules but because of the \noperation. And it is certainly not the fault of the Republicans.\n  Take the budget, for example, which can be done with a simple \nmajority. We haven't had a budget in 3 years. The law says we are \nsupposed to pass a budget. It doesn't say don't pass the budget if we \ndon't want to; don't pass the budget if we might have to offer \namendments. It doesn't say don't pass a budget if we might have to \nnegotiate with the Republican House. It says, pass a budget. We also \nhaven't called up a single appropriations bill.\n  Look, if one Senator has a problem going to a bill, file cloture on \nthe motion to proceed. Had the majority leader done that on the Defense \nbill, it would have been approved overwhelmingly. He could have done \nthat on a\n\n[[Page S6882]]\n\nFriday and it would have been approved on a Monday. The obstructionism \nhe complains about is pretty easily overcome if we are willing to make \nthe place work a little bit. Most people work Monday to Friday. Not us. \nThe Senate used to be a nocturnal place because majority leaders of \nboth parties would use the fatigue factor to grind down opposition \ncoming from a few people. We almost never do that.\n  So don't get me wrong, I say to my friend the majority leader. I am \nnot defending the way this place has been run the last 2 years. I think \nit is embarrassing. I have to apologize to my constituents for the way \nthe place is run. But we had the same rules in earlier Congresses and \ndidn't have the same problem.\n  We have always had a few Members on each side who wanted to exercise \nevery one of their rights. When I first got here, Senator Metzenbaum \nfrom Ohio would stay out here on the floor and read every bill. He was \na big problem. Nobody tried to change the rules. We worked this place.\n  What the majority leader conveniently continues to leave out is that \nit is not only the rule he wants to change but the way he wants to \nchange it. He wants to establish the precedent that 51 Senators can \nchange the rules, anytime they want to, to take away the rights of \neverybody else, which will fundamentally change this institution.\n  So no Senator should buy the argument that this is just a little \nbitty change about the motion to proceed. This is about the way rules \nwill be changed in the Senate. No longer would a 67-vote threshold \nobviously bring the two leaders and their Members together to agree to \nrules changes, but anytime, on any whim, any majority leader wants to \nchange the rules, 51 votes. This is no small matter. This is a big \nissue about the future of this country and how this institution ought \nto be operated.\n  Being majority leader is a tough job. You have cantankerous Members \non both sides who want to exercise their rights. It has always been \nthat way. But the way you get past it is you work the place, you make \nit function, you talk to people, you treat them with respect. The \ncollegiality we used to have in this body has faded--faded because of \nthe arrogance of power exercised by some. All of this is correctable \nbecause we in here are all human beings trying to do our best, trying \nto leverage the place in one way or another to seek some advantage. But \nthat is the way the Senate has always been.\n  What I think we need is an attitude change. The election is behind \nus. Whatever short-term advantage the majority may have felt it had by \nprotecting its Members from voting on almost everything is over. We \ndon't need to have a perpetual election in the country. We have huge \nissues before us here at the end of the year, many of which will \nprobably carry over into next year. It is a time that we ought to be \nbuilding collegiality and relationships and not making incendiary moves \nthat are damaging to the institution and could have serious \nramifications on our ability to work together here at the end of the \nyear.\n  So I would encourage my friend the majority leader to think \nthoroughly through whether this is the direction he wants to take this \nbody. I believe it is a huge mistake. The American people sent us here \nto solve big problems, and we ought to be concentrating on trying to \nbring everybody together behind an agreement that hopefully could be \nreached before the end of the year to do really important work for the \nAmerican people.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the election is over, and the American \npeople listened to what we had to say, and they acknowledged without \nany question that the message we delivered is valid: The Senate is a \ndysfunctional body, caused by the Republicans. Democrats picked up \nseats in this Senate. The President was reelected by 2.5 million votes. \nWe have an obligation to the American people to proceed and to get some \nthings done.\n  My friend the Republican leader talks about the Golden Rule. I do \nbelieve in that. And I believe 2 years ago there were efforts made to \nchange this body so we could get some things done. We were given the \nassurance that the motion to proceed would not be used in the way it \nhas been used this time.\n  Any suggestion of changing the rules is within the framework of what \nwe do here in the Senate and our Constitution. We have an obligation to \ncontinually update this body so that it becomes more efficient. That is \nthe history of this country. And I think my friend the Republican \nleader has to acknowledge that things haven't been going very well. He \njust did that. The election is over. We need to proceed to get things \ndone.\n  Incendiary moves? I have been facing incendiary moves for 2 years. We \ncan't get anything done around here because of the Republican \nobstructionism. The American people recognize that. As I have traveled \nthis country, people have said: Do something to change the Senate so we \ncan get things done. And we are making a minor change to stop the \nmotion to proceed that we were told 2 years ago they wouldn't use \nanymore. So we are going to change this rule so the Senate can become \nan effective body.\n  We have a bicameral legislature, and no one should suggest I don't \nunderstand that, and no one should suggest I don't understand the \nfilibuster rule. I think I understand as well as anybody who serves in \nthis body and perhaps, with the exception of Senator Byrd, anybody who \nhas served in this body. If Senator Byrd were here, I would suggest to \neverybody here that Senator Byrd wouldn't like what is going on here, \nand he would work with us to get these rules changed, and that is why \nthey need to be changed.\n  We can't continue like this. We took people's word that they would \nhelp us get things done here, and they rejected that. It was simply \nuntrue. It was a falsehood. I know what I have said in the past, and I \nknow what I have done in the past, and I think what we are doing is a \npositive step forward to do away with the motion to proceed so that \nthey can't filibuster a simple motion to proceed, stopping us from \ngetting on a bill, taking us 10 days to do that. That is wrong.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it doesn't take 10 days to get on a \nbill. And what the majority leader has repeated now is that he is going \nto break the rules to change the rules, which is a wonderful way to \nstart off the new Congress.\n  At a time when the American people would like for us to work together \nand to solve the huge issues that lie before us, the majority leader \nhas chosen instead to break the rules to change the rules because he \nhas had difficulty getting on bills. It is a sad commentary about where \nthe Senate stands these days. I had hoped that going into the lameduck \nsession, we would have an entirely different view of how to bring this \nplace together and begin to solve the problems. So it is a sad day for \nthe Senate. We will go forward as best we can under this extraordinary \nset of circumstances.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, no matter how many times my friend the \nRepublican leader says ``break the rules to change the rules,'' it \ndoesn't make it true because it is not true. We are going to follow the \nrules.\n  I would also say this: I was stunned by reading in a couple of the \nnewspapers that a couple of Republican Senators said, paraphrasing: We \nare going to make things really tough around here. We are going to make \nthings so bad if they take away our motion, causing me to file cloture \non a motion to proceed. We are going to make things really difficult.\n  Really difficult, when the Republican leader said his No. 1 goal in \nthis Congress was to defeat President Obama? And that is how they have \nlegislated. Everything was to the effort of making sure Barack Obama \ndid not serve again. There are a myriad of examples. Take this one. \nThis is great to show how hard they worked to put the country on the \nright track. With about 1 million firefighters, police officers, and \nschoolteachers being laid off, we thought: We have had some decent--not \nwonderful--growth in the private sector and have gotten back millions \nof jobs. We decided, let's do something in the public sector that would \nreally help stimulate the economy. So we decided to move to a bill that \nsaid that what we want to do is rehire those firefighters, police \nofficers, and teachers,\n\n[[Page S6883]]\n\nand we are going to pay for it--no more deficit spending--we will pay \nfor it by having a surtax on people who make more than $1 million a \nyear, and that surtax is three-tenths of 1 percent. They stopped it. \nThey stopped it dead in its tracks. Every Republican voted against it. \nThat is the way they have legislated this entire year. And by our \ngetting rid of the motion to proceed, that we are turning the country \nupside down is ridiculous. It is not true.\n  They have legislated with the effort to defeat Obama. He won by 2.5 \nmillion votes, 327 electoral votes--overwhelmingly--even though they \ndid everything they could to stop him from being reelected. Everyone \nknows what a failure this Congress has been because of what the Senate \nhas done, and that is nothing. Nothing. No job creation--they didn't \nwant that. If we had had the ability to create jobs, it would have \nhelped Obama and it would have helped the country, but, no, that wasn't \nwhat they wanted to do. And a terrible day for them several months \nago--can you believe the Supreme Court declared ObamaCare \nconstitutional? I mean, talk about a disappointment. This whole year \nwas a disappointment for them because they weren't able to stop Obama \nfrom being reelected even though they did everything they could to \nprevent him from being reelected, and then ObamaCare was declared \nconstitutional.\n  No, we are not going to break the rules to change the rules. We are \ngoing to follow the rules to make a couple of minor changes to make \nthis place more efficient. That is what the Senate has always been \nabout, is revising itself to become more efficient. And the threats \nthat come from the other side: We are going to make you Democrats \nsuffer more; if you do this, it is going to be terrible--What more \ncould they do to us?\n  It is pretty simple. The math isn't that difficult. Get the bill on \nthe calendar, file cloture on a Tuesday, have a cloture vote on \nThursday. We are finally on the bill. They get 30 hours for that. I \nmaybe exaggerated a day or two, but it puts us way into next week \nbefore we even get on the bill.\n  So we are doing what is right for the country because the American \npeople want us to do what is right for the country. And to do what is \nright for the country is to change the rules of the Senate a little bit \nso that we can do something meaningful for the country.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have listened closely in this debate \nbecause it literally affects my career, my life, and the lives of all \nthe Members of the Senate. It is worth a minute or two to understand \nwhat we are talking about in the context of history.\n  It was President Woodrow Wilson who said to the Congress: We want to \narm the Merchant Marine of the United States, to put guns on Merchant \nMarine ships, before we were engaged in World War I, to protect those \nships from being destroyed or sunk by the warring parties in World War \nI. He sent that request to Congress, and it was stopped by one Senator. \nOne Senator in those days could stand up and say: I object. End of \nstory. But President Wilson said: That is an outrage, that one Senator \ncan say that and stop even the consideration of a measure to protect \nAmerican lives and our Merchant Marines. And he created this firestorm \nof public opinion. So they created a Senate rule called the cloture \nrule, and the cloture rule said that if two-thirds of the Senators \nvoted in disagreement with that objector, then the Senate would go to \nthe measure. So what was originally an objection by one Senator, \ncharacterized as a filibuster, could be cut off and the Senate could \nresume its activity and its business by a two-thirds vote.\n  That was passed by the Senate in 1917, almost 100 years ago. Over the \nspan of time since, there have been some changes in that. In the 1960s, \nduring the civil rights debate, it was decided to reduce that number \nfrom two-thirds of the Senate--67 in those days--to 60. So 60 votes \nwere needed in order to successfully file a cloture motion to end the \nfilibuster. It was an interesting exercise but one that happened very \nrarely. I asked the staff to send me a list of all the cloture motions \nthat were filed to stop filibusters since 1917. In the first 50 years \nafter 1917, there were about 50 cloture motions--50 years, 50 motions, \naveraged about one a year. What has happened in the most recent years? \nIn the 2007-2008 Congress, there were 139 cloture motions in that 2-\nyear period; the next 2-year period, 2009-2010, 137 cloture motions; \nand in this current session, 2011-2012, 110. So what used to happen \nonce a year is now happening over 120 times a year on average. What \nused to be a rare occurrence has become commonplace, and it is \ndestroying this institution.\n\n  I am told people across America who have cable television and who \nhave C-SPAN of the Senate are calling the cable operators asking for a \nrefund because nothing is happening on the Senate channel. They are \nhearing the melodious, mellifluous voice of the great clerk of the \nSenate reading Senator Akaka's name every once in a while in a quorum \ncall, and they are wondering: Why am I paying a cable TV carrier for \nthis? Why isn't the Senate working? Why aren't they doing something?\n  It is because we are stuck in a filibuster--time after time after \ntime.\n  I go home, and I bet the Senator does, too, when he goes home to \nDelaware, and they say: What about that Jimmy Stewart movie, ``Mr. \nSmith Goes To Washington''? I saw that movie. Didn't that poor man have \nto stand at his desk and hold the Senate floor until he crumpled in \nexhaustion? Why don't we see that anymore?\n  The honest answer is there was some artistic license in that movie. \nThe more honest answer is we have reached the point now with the \nfilibuster where one Senator can stand and object to what is about to \noccur in the Senate and stop the Senate from what it is doing for at \nleast 30 hours until there is a vote to resume business.\n  Let me give two examples in my recent memory of how this played out. \nIt was only a couple of years ago when we were closing a weekly session \nand a last-minute request was made to extend unemployment benefits to \nmillions of Americans. We thought we had an agreement, Democrats and \nRepublicans. We were ready to leave town.\n  The junior Senator from Kentucky--not the majority leader, Senator \nBunning--stood when this measure came up to extend unemployment \nbenefits and said ``I object.'' By saying ``I object'' he stopped the \npayment of unemployment benefits to millions of Americans.\n  At that point I came to the floor and said: Explain it.\n  He said: I just don't think we should do it.\n  I said: Shouldn't we just go to a rollcall and you can vote no?\n  No, I object to it.\n  And they were about to expire over the weekend.\n  So I said to the Senator from Kentucky: I am staying on the floor, \nand I am going to keep renewing the request, and you better stay, too, \nbecause when nobody is here to object we are going to extend those \nunemployment benefits.\n  Members came to the floor to support me. At one point, late in the \nevening, the Senator said: It is 10 o'clock. I want to get home and see \nthe University of Kentucky Wildcats basketball game. Why do you keep me \nhere?\n  It is true. Check the Record.\n  Another time, a Republican from South Carolina, a Republican Senator, \nsaid: I object going to a vote on the Senate floor--forcing us to stay \nin session through Friday and vote on Saturday morning. This was \nThursday night.\n  I don't disagree with the Senator from Kentucky. There is nothing \nwrong with our working 6 days a week and working nights too. So we did. \nWe stuck around.\n  Then came the Saturday vote, and we looked for the objector, and the \nSenator who objected did not return for the vote. He said he had to \nstay home, that there was a wedding he had to attend. So the rest of us \nhad to stay and show 60 votes.\n  One of the rules changes that Senator Reid is proposing would \nbasically eliminate that. Here is what it boils down to: If you think \nit is important enough to stop the business of the Senate, if you think \nyour objection is sufficiently serious to stop the business of the \nSenate, park your fanny on the floor of the Senate and object and don't \nget up and go out to dinner, don't get up and go to a basketball game, \nand don't go home for a wedding. Stick around and show us how serious \nyou\n\n[[Page S6884]]\n\nare about this. If it is not worth your time, then it is not worth it \nfor the Senate to stop its action and its business.\n  The talking filibuster rule says if the majority of the Senators vote \nto go forward with the debate, but it does not hit the 60-vote level, \nthen if you are the objector, stay on the floor. If it is important \nenough for you to stop the Senate, stay here or get an ally, a \ncolleague, to stay with you to cover the floor because when you leave \nwe are going to renew the request to go back to that measure. If it is \nnot worth staying on the floor to object, then it is not worth stopping \nthe business of the Senate.\n  I think that is pretty reasonable. Yes, I would say to the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, I would live by that rule in the minority, which would \nmean I would not object unless it really meant something, unless it \nwere worth my time and the time of the Senate to stop that action.\n  That is what this is about. How mindless it has been to watch this \nSenate lurch from one cloture vote to another, from one filibuster to \nanother, 386 times in the last 6 years. What a colossal waste of time \nand energy and talent.\n  I am one of those Senators who believes that I came here to debate \nand vote, even to vote on tough amendments. I think that is part of the \njob. I often quote a former Congressman and great friend of mine, Mike \nSynar from Oklahoma, who used to say: If you don't want to fight fires, \ndon't be a firefighter; and if you don't want to vote on controversial \nissues, don't run for the Senate.\n  That is what this is about. I agree with him. But for goodness' sake, \nlurching from one tedious, mind-numbing filibuster to the next is no \ndemonstration of the strength of this Constitution and the value of the \nSenate.\n  Yes, we need to change the rules. We need to change the rules so \nthere is more accountability, so that those who would stop the Senate \nand force a filibuster would at least have the decency and courtesy to \nstay on the floor and state their case and not believe they can do this \nin absentia. That is what this is about. I think it is important.\n  I have a bill called the DREAM Act. Some people have heard of it. I \nintroduced it 11 years ago, I say to the Presiding Officer. I think it \nis one of the most important things I have ever tried to do. But I have \nnever passed it. I called it two or three times on the floor of the \nSenate. Every time I got a majority, every time I got a majority, \nalways a bipartisan majority, but it never passed. Why? It was being \nfilibustered. A Republican filibuster required 60 votes. So for 11 \nyears literally millions of young people across the country have had \ntheir fate unresolved because of this Senate procedure.\n  I think at some point a majority of the Senate should speak on this \nissue and that should decide the law of the land. The House passed it 3 \nyears ago. We should pass it here too. The filibuster has stopped it \nover and over.\n  Let me make one more point. I see two of my colleagues on the Senate \nfloor. The Senator from Kentucky came to the floor and talked about the \ndeficit that we face and the issues that challenge us with the fiscal \ncliff. I see the Senator from Virginia. Senator Warner and I have spent \nmore time together in his office sitting around a bowl of popcorn with \nsome Diet Cokes talking about this deficit and what we can do about it \nthan I can even total. I have no idea of how many hundreds of hours we \nspent together in a bipartisan meeting, four Democratic Senators, four \nRepublican Senators. We have tried to take the Simpson-Bowles \nCommission, on which I served, and their basic idea and turn it into an \nagreement that we can enact into a law to avoid the fiscal cliff.\n  We have come close. We have not closed the deal, I am sorry to say. \nWe have come close. There is a feeling on both sides, as the Simpson-\nBowles Commission said:\n\n       Everything should be on the table, revenue, taxes--I can \n     say taxes; they can't say that on the other side of the \n     aisle--revenue, taxes. That accounted for 40 percent of \n     deficit reduction in Simpson-Bowles--40 percent. What we are \n     talking about is making sure any deficit reduction package \n     going forward has a substantial portion of revenue and taxes \n     in it. But we cannot tax the wealthiest people in America and \n     balance the budget. I know that is true. There have to be \n     spending cuts. There also have to be changes in entitlement \n     programs.\n\n  I happen to agree with the majority leader. Social Security does not \nadd a penny to the deficit--not one penny. It is a separate trust fund. \nBut it only has about 22 years of life left in it. That is pretty good \nby Washington standards, but we can do better.\n  I think many of us agree on a bipartisan basis we should make some \nsmall changes in Social Security today to guarantee it will be here for \n50 years or 75 years. We can do that, but that is a separate debate. \nThe debate on the fiscal cliff is about entitlement programs.\n  I watched some of my friends on the left, on the Democratic side, \nsay: Don't touch the entitlement programs. They are ignoring the \nobvious. Medicare untouched, unchanged, unamended, runs out of money in \n12 years. I plan on being around for 12 years. A lot of folks who are \nseniors do too, and a lot of folks who anticipate retirement expect it \nto be there beyond 12 years. We have to do something. To say we are not \ngoing to touch Medicare is to ignore the obvious.\n  I don't want to go the Paul Ryan voucher route, voucherizing it, \nmaking it so expensive seniors cannot pay for it. But if we do not put \nour best talents together and make Medicare a program that lasts more \nthan 12 years, we are not meeting our obligation to the offices for \nwhich we ran.\n  The last point: Medicaid. What is Medicaid? Insurance, health \ninsurance for the poor. One out of three children in the State of \nIllinois, their only health insurance is Medicaid. For more than half \nof the births in Illinois the prenatal care and well-baby care is all \npaid for by Medicaid. But that is not the majority of what Medicaid is \nspent on in my State. Sixty percent is spent on the frail elderly and \nthose with mental and physical disabilities who are in institutional \nsettings and they are broke. They have Social Security, Medicare, and \nMedicaid to keep them alive.\n  When the Paul Ryan budget suggested cutting 37 percent out of \nMedicaid, my question to him is, Which group are you going to cut, \nPaul? The children, the mothers having babies, or the frail elderly?\n  Yes, we have to look at this program and find ways to save money so \nit is there when we need it--and we do need it. That needs to be part \nof this discussion.\n  I was heartened over the weekend--I will close with this--on a \ntelevision show with Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina who said \npublicly: Regardless of this Grover Norquist pledge, my pledge is to \nthe people--I am paraphrasing--my pledge is to the people of America. \nWe are going to solve this problem. We need more on both sides of the \naisle to step up in that spirit to avoid this fiscal cliff. We can. \nWith the President's leadership and the cooperation of the Speaker, we \ncan get it done.\n  For 10 days not much has happened. There has been a big Thanksgiving \nbreak, a lot of turkey and stuffing, but now let's get back to \nbusiness. We are back in session, House and Senate. Let's roll up our \nsleeves. Let's get it done. We can address this fiscal cliff and set up \na plan with the President that is reasonable. We need to do that on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/26/senate-section/article/S6884-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons).

For the information of the Senate, the pending \nbusiness is S. 3525, which the Senate is considering postcloture. The \nSenator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will take a couple of brief moments. \nFirst, let me thank my friend, the Senator from Illinois. No one has \nspent more time and also, candidly, taken a more courageous position in \nthese discussions around avoiding this fiscal cliff.\n\n[[Page S6885]]\n\nFor some, for political or other reasons, these are challenging \ndiscussions. But no one more than the Senator from Illinois has been \nwilling to put more on the line, has been willing to take more heat and \nhas more represented this whole notion of putting country first on an \nissue that I think is the defining moment of our time.\n  I thank my friend, the Senator from Illinois. I appreciate all he has \ndone. I think history will actually show in many ways that the original \nframework of the so-called Gang of 6--I think it is only in Washington \nwhere when people try to work together they are immediately designated \nas gang members--but particularly the low-income protections the \nSenator of Illinois made sure we had in our bipartisan agreement that \nreduced the deficit by more than $4 trillion will stand as the high \nwater mark. I commend him for his work.\n  I want to say as a relatively new Senator and one who is still trying \nto learn the rules and procedures, I also always thought that if \nsomeone filibustered a bill they had to stay on the floor and make that \ncase. As someone who was never a legislator before I came to this \nposition, I look forward to working with him and reasonable Members \nfrom both sides of the aisle to make sure we have rules reforms so the \nSenate can get back to doing the people's business and not be involved \nin procedural matters.\n  With that, I wish to speak very briefly about the issue before us. It \nis hunting season in Virginia--I am sure it is in Delaware as well--so \nit is timely that this current bill is before us. I wish to take a \nmoment to voice my support for the Sportsmen's Act of 2012, a bill I am \nproud to cosponsor. I applaud the hard work my good friend from \nMontana, Senator Tester, has done in moving this bill forward through a \nnumber of challenges. He has put so much time and effort into pulling \nvarious pieces together, building support, and balancing different \ninterests. I am confident that, with his leadership, we have put \ntogether a very strong piece of legislation.\n  The Sportsmen's Act of 2012 is a compilation of nearly 20 different \nbipartisan bills that are important to sportsmen and conservation \ncommunities across America. It focuses on the conservation of wildlife \nhabitat and improved access for recreational hunting and fishing.\n  Sportsmen cite the loss of access as the No. 1 reason why they have \ngiven up on hunting or fishing. Currently, 35 million acres of public \nland are either restricted or provide no access. This bill allows the \nacquisition of more easements and rights of way to improve access to \npublic land for hunting and fishing. The Sportsmen's Act of 2012 \nincreases access to public lands for millions of Americans and \nVirginians who participate in hunting and fishing and other outdoor \nrecreation, while also supporting the very important conservation of \nwildlife habitat.\n  This legislation promotes our recreational hunting, fishing, and \nshooting heritage. It also continues a number of key initiatives and \npublic-private partnerships to support conservation of fish and \nwildlife populations.\n  This bipartisan bill is consistent with my long-term personal and \npolicy commitment to provide more opportunities for outdoor recreation, \nto restore critical landscapes, and to support a robust outdoor \neconomy.\n  It is also important to note that in the midst of our important \ndebate about getting our fiscal house in order, this bill does not add \none cent to the deficit. This CBO has concluded that it actually saves \n$5 million over 10 years.\n  Finally, and perhaps more telling than anything else, is the amount \nof support this bill has garnered from outside groups. Over 50 national \nconservation and wildlife groups support the bill. The National \nWildlife Federation supports it, the NRA supports it, and President \nObama supports it. That shows the breadth of support this legislation \nhas. With such a broad spectrum of support, passing this bill should be \na no-brainer.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in another strong show of support for \nour sportsmen by voting yes on final passage.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/26/senate-section/article/S6885-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6885-S6887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGET ACT VIOLATION\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the budget portion \nof this bill. I share Senator Warner's support for the bill. I believe \nfundamentally it is a good series of policy initiatives that will help \nsportsmen in the long run. However, I am the ranking member of the \nBudget Committee and this bill violates the deemed spending levels \nagreed to in the Budget Control Act. Senator Warner is a member of the \nBudget Committee. Senator Warner is a member of the Gang of Six that is \nworking so hard to develop a plan that we are supposed to trust will be \nexecuted if their plan were to be effected. It doesn't look as if they \nare making a lot of progress, but who knows? I salute their effort.\n  The question is, if we lay out a plan to address our fiscal issues, \nwill we adhere to it? Will we follow it? So I am a little bit taken \naback that my colleagues seem oblivious to the idea and the concern \nthat, plainly, the Sportsmen's Act legislation violates the Budget Act. \nThe staff of Senator Kent Conrad--our Democratic chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, who is retiring--has concluded and certified that it \nviolates the budget because it spends more money than we agreed to \nspend on this item 15 months ago when the Budget Control Act was passed \nin order to raise the debt ceiling in America.\n  I wish to tell my colleagues that I worry about things around here \nand about what kinds of agreements may be reached in the middle of the \nnight--Christmas Eve, December 31st--to fix the fiscal cliff. We will \nhear: Don't worry, we have taken care of it. That is what they said \nwhen they passed the Budget Control Act August a year ago. I didn't \nfeel good about it then, although it made some progress and it did have \nsome limits on spending in various areas. So we did pass the Budget \nControl Act, and this will be the fourth time in 15 months we have had \na bill on the floor that violates it.\n  Senator Durbin earlier talked about the Simpson-Bowles Commission on \nwhich he served. Forty Percent of the revenue they raised was taxes. \nThey said it was about 3-to-1 spending cuts to revenue increases when \nthey were telling us about it. As I recall, they said it was 3-to-1 in \nspending cuts for every dollar in tax increases. But my Budget \nCommittee staff and I looked at it, and I think it is closer to 1-to-1: \n$1 of spending cuts for every $1 in tax increases.\n  It was a tax-and-spend bill, really. I wish it were better. It wasn't \nas good as people suggested. At some point before the election \nPresident Obama suggested we should have $1 in tax increases for every \n$4 in spending cuts. Now we see that Simpson-Bowles proposed a ration \nof almost 1-to-1: $1 in tax increases for every $1 in spending cuts.\n  I am going to put out a statement today, but I wanted to correct \nsomething Senator Reid said and Senator Durbin said Sunday on the talk \ninterview programs. Senator Durbin said Social Security does not add 1 \npenny to the debt--not a penny. I think that is pretty close to a \ndirect quote. But that is not correct. Social Security is already in a \nsituation where the amount of revenue from people's withholding is less \nthan the amount of money being paid out to the recipients. We have now \nspent $27 billion more than we have collected in payroll taxes in the \nlast 2 years. So where does the money come from? It is borrowed by the \nUnited States Treasury to pay for Social Security spending. Why? \nBecause the U.S. Treasury borrowed the money. They took the surpluses \nthat had been in existence until 2 years ago and spent them. But the \nSocial Security trustees asked for the money they loaned the Treasury, \nin order to pay our retirees. They have debt instruments to establish \nthe debt that they loaned to the Treasury. They didn't give it to the \nTreasury. It was the money of the Social Security recipients. That is \nwhose money it was. So it was loaned to the government, their debt \ninstruments showing the debt, and the Treasury pays the interest to the \nSocial Security trustees. Now, for the first time, instead of having a \nsurplus, which the Treasury can spend and buy votes with, we have a \ndeficit, and boy, it is just beginning. It is already on a path to \nsurge out of control and threaten the future of Social Security. How \ndoes the\n\n[[Page S6886]]\n\ngovernment pay the money it owes to Social Security? It has already \nspent the money it collected in past years. It is as if we borrowed the \nmoney from the bank, we spent it, and the bank says I want to be paid \nback.\n  What happens? Well, the Federal Government borrows that money on the \nworld market, through the sale of Treasury bills, and then they get \nthat money and they pay Social Security. It is just beginning. It is \nalready in deficit. It has added not 1 penny--it has already added $27 \nbillion to the public debt of the United States of America.\n  The Sportsmen's bill is legislation I strongly support. It came out \nof committee and I supported it, but it does violate the Budget Act. It \nis quite clear that it does. We can fix it easily. If we can fix it \neasily, we should fix it easily. Senator Conrad has certified that it \nviolates the budget. Senator Reid has brought it to the floor under \nrule XIV, bypassing normal Committee procedures. The bill violates the \nspending limits we agreed to in August a year ago.\n  The BCA limited spending in various accounts as part of an agreement \nto raise the debt limit. We reached a limit on how much we could \nborrow, and the President and others wanted to keep borrowing and keep \nspending. So debt in America continues to surge out of control. But the \nRepublican leaders at the time said: No, until you agree to cut \nspending, we are not going to raise the debt limit, Mr. President. Just \nlike the kid with the credit card, you don't get to keep spending \nunless we know you have limited some spending, at least. So that is \nwhat happened. The President and the congressional Democrats resisted \nthat. They attacked Republicans as wanting to cut spending and throw \nthe country into the abyss, but they--with no choice, really--finally \nagreed to spending reductions of $2.1 trillion over 10 years. Those \nreductions were based on 2011 spending levels. Flat spending in 2011 \nwould have totaled about $37 trillion over 10 years. But the baseline \nfor spending has natural growth in it and always has, as calculated by \nthe Congressional Budget Office. CBO said that under current law, \nspending would be expected to increase to over $47 trillion over 10 \nyears--$10 trillion or $11 trillion more. So this agreement would \nsimply have reduced the amount of debt that could be added to the \ngovernment from $10 trillion to $8 trillion over the next 10 years. It \nwould reduce spending--some said it was horrible--it would reduce \nspending from $47 trillion to $45 trillion. Remember, we are spending \nabout $37 trillion now. The American people were assured that this \nsolemn agreement was a good step and Congress would follow what they \nagreed to and put into law. So another thing is that Congress cannot \ncontinue to breach even the modest spending levels we agreed to. We \ncannot breach those levels. It is a sick pattern and makes a mockery of \nlaw and responsible governing.\n  Since the Budget Control Act agreement 15 months ago, this is the \nfourth spending bill that violates the law. How? Always Congress wants \nto spend more money--money we don't have. Remember, these four \ninstances I have cited don't include the 13 appropriations bills \nbecause Senator Reid, for the first time in history--the first time in \nthe history of the Senate, we believe--did not pass a single \nappropriations bill on time. Every one of them was placed in one \ncontinuing resolution and funded forward for 6 months. So we didn't \nbring those appropriations bills up and we didn't have votes on them. \nWho knows how many more budget violations would have occurred in that. \nSo the bills we are talking about are bills such as the Sportsmen's \nbill that is before us now.\n  I will object to the legislation because it violates the 10-year \nspending limits passed into law 15 months ago. But, of course, that \ndoes not end the matter. Senator Reid--and I am sure he will, or his \ndesignee--will simply ask the Senate to override the law. They will \nmake a motion to waive the statutory spending limits and, poof, if 60 \nSenators agree, we waive it and spend the extra money. No problem, \nexcept the Budget Act will be violated once again.\n  So at a time of unprecedented spending, unsustainable debt, and low \npublic confidence in Congress, should we not adhere to even the \nsmallest spending limits that have been enacted? Should we again \nviolate the Budget Control Act for a mere $14 million a year--a mere \n$14 million a year--when this could easily be fixed? I say ``a mere $14 \nmillion'' because we deal with billions of dollars on a routine basis \naround here. So $14 million is a lot of money, but compared to what we \nspend and the ability we have to find savings in this vast government, \nit is not a lot of money.\n  And shouldn't the President, who negotiated and signed into law the \nBudget Control Act, object to his Democratic leaders' violating the \nspending limits he agreed to and negotiated last summer a year ago? \nShouldn't he make it clear that he will veto any bill that violates the \nstatutory limits we agreed to? Of course, he has not done so on this \nbill or any of the other four previous bills that would have violated \nthose spending limits.\n  The words in the Budget Control Act, I have to say, appear, in his \nmind, to be words he never agreed to in his heart. Maybe he agreed to \nthem on paper, maybe he signed the paper, but in his heart he never \nwanted to sign that agreement, so it is no problem for him to waltz in \nhere and agree to spend more than he agreed to last summer. He is \npostmodern, as you know. Words are just a momentary thing. They can be \nreinterpreted a little later to better match what we meant to say my \nheart of hearts. This is why this country is in financial trouble, in \nmy opinion.\n  Amendments my staff and I have tried to suggest that would fix this \nproblem are being rejected, and the good groups such as Ducks Unlimited \nand other groups say: No; we don't want any changes. We say: Let's see \nif we can't get the money for the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund \nthrough another way, some of the other spending in this bill or some \nother savings throughout the government. Why can't we find the money \nand help fund migratory bird conservation, which I believe in, and \nmaybe we can do that in another way without violating the budget. They \nsay no.\n  But I will say to my friends at Ducks Unlimited and other groups that \nsupport the bill, they were not here 15 months ago. They did not vote \non a bill that said we are going to limit spending to this amount. I \ndid. Every Senator here told their constituents that Congress voted to \nlimit spending to a certain amount and we would not go above it.\n  I understand Ducks Unlimited and other groups have a special interest \nand a deep concern, and I share it, to help maintain our great heritage \nof hunting and conservation in America. I understand that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is reminded we are operating under \na 10-minute time limit.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 2 additional minutes \nto wrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will just say, we have responsibilities to the \nbudget, to the Treasury. I will promise one thing: If we go back home \nand talk to duck hunters, as I do, and hunters on a regular basis, they \nthink we are spending money like crazy. They think we do not adhere to \nany agreements. So I do not think the average duck hunter would be \nconcerned if we slowed down a little bit and sent this bill back to \ncommittee and had it paid for so we did not violate the budget. In \nfact, I think most of the people I know would be very supportive of us \ndoing that.\n  This proposal is a tax plan, pure and simple. The CBO and the Office \nof Management and Budget--President Obama's Office of Management and \nBudget--say the duck stamp fee is a tax. It is a tax, and Congress has \nalways set the amount of it. This bill--I do not like this--we fixed \nthis in committee, but Senator Reid has brought up a bill without those \nfixes. The committee bill would have said Congress sets the amount of \nthe tax on the American people, not some unelected Secretary of the \nInterior. Why should he have the unilateral ability to raise taxes on \nAmericans? It has never been done before. It should never be done. It \nviolates good, sound principles of government in America and actually I \nthink it would violate the Constitution to do that. It is certified by \nOMB and CBO as a tax.\n  Also, I hear it said it would actually reduce the deficit. If we \nraise taxes by\n\n[[Page S6887]]\n\n$145 million and then we spend $140 million, we can go around and say: \nWe reduced the deficit by $5 million. But I asked Senator Warner and \nother colleagues have they researched this budget of ours to seek to \nfind an additional $140 million? If we are going to raise the duck \nstamp by $140 million, if we are going to raise it by that amount, why \nwouldn't we reduce the deficit by $140 million instead of just $5 \nmillion? Those are the decisions families and small businesses make \nwhen they deal with these challenges in their budgets. They are \nrequired to make choices. One thing this Congress seems to always want \nto avoid is making choices. Since they can find nothing else in the \nentire Federal budget that would pay for this bill, this sportsmen's \nbill, it would indicate to me it is not a very high priority.\n  But the truth is that is not exactly true. The truth is, they never \nlooked to find anything else they could cut that is wasteful or \nduplicative. In fact, there are over $900 million in existing wetlands \nconservation programs today. Nobody has sought to examine those \nprograms to see if they could be more efficiently run and probably it \nwould free up that much money right there.\n  I know the pressures. I know how this system works, but the people \nwho drafted the Budget Control Act were aware of how Congress likes to \nspend. They specifically intended not to allow us to spend more by \ntaxing more. They set explicit levels on how much we could spend. \nTherefore, this bill violates those spending levels, even though it has \ntaxes there, and, as a result, it violates the budget and should not \npass in its present form.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/26/senate-section/article/S6887-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6887-S6890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE DREAM ACT\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am honored to follow my \ndistinguished colleague from Alabama, as well as a number of my other \ncolleagues who I think have disproved, at least for this afternoon, one \nof the remarks made by the Senator from Illinois, which is that the \ncable viewers who subscribe to C-SPAN may not be getting their money's \nworth. I think the very spirited remarks made by my colleague from \nAlabama, even as I disagree with them, are a very well-stated point of \nview that deserves to be considered.\n  I am honored also to follow the majority leader and the Senator from \nIllinois and the Senator from Virginia in the remarks they made about \nthe need to change the filibuster rules, and I wish to associate myself \nstrongly with them. From the very first days I have been a Member of \nthis body, I have strongly believed the filibuster needs to be ended or \nat least greatly modified so as to permit the business of this great \nChamber to go forward. I believe the new Members who have come here \nhave heard that message loud and clear from the American people and \nthat they will vote--a majority of them--to change those rules. Because \nall of us know, having been home for a while, the American people \nbelieve strongly that we need to do better, we need to do more, we need \nto address the problems of this country through majority rule, not by \n60-vote rule but majority rule, at least at the beginning of the \nprocess, as the majority leader has suggested, not by violating the \nrules but by following the rules to change and improve those rules. So \nI will vote to support the majority leader's proposals in that regard.\n  One of the measures that has been stymied, as the Senator from \nIllinois very eloquently said, is the DREAM Act. I have been a strong \nsupporter and thank him for his leadership on the DREAM Act over many \nyears. A number of times I have come to the floor to share stories, \nspecific personal stories about those DREAMers whose lives would be \nchanged and who would so greatly enhance the life of this Nation if the \nDREAM Act were passed. I am here again to share the story of another \nDREAMer from Connecticut and to urge my colleagues to act on this \nmeasure.\n  Of course, this measure should be part of comprehensive immigration \nreform. I have believed since I arrived 2 years ago that immigration \nreform ought to be a priority. I am gratified and grateful that the \nPresident seems now to be moving in that direction and that many in \nthis body share that view. In fact, I asked to be assigned to the \nJudiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration so I could be a part \nof this debate, and I hope I will join leaders in this effort, such as \nSenator Schumer and Senator Menendez, in proposals to repair a broken \nsystem. Clearly, our immigration system is in dire need of reform, \ncomprehensive reform that will include the DREAM Act.\n  I have met and I have seen and experienced firsthand the stories of \nthese DREAMers that make the case so compellingly for the DREAM Act to \nenable them to earn their citizenship and continue contributing to the \ngreatest Nation in the history of the world, America.\n  As we return from Thanksgiving, having expressed our gratitude for \nour families, for our communities, for our country, what better time to \naddress this measure for people who appreciate, maybe more than most of \nus, the importance and value of citizenship.\n  For more than a decade, Senator Durbin has championed this measure, \nand I am honored to work with him in this effort. As attorney general, \nI advocated it at the State level. But, obviously, only the Federal \nGovernment can change the laws relating to citizenship.\n  The DREAM Act would give young, undocumented immigrants, brought to \nthis country as infants or young children, through no choice of their \nown, a chance to earn their citizenship through education or military \nservice. The young people who would benefit from the DREAM Act identify \nas Americans. This Nation is the only one they have ever known. English \nis often the only language they know. Their friends here are the only \nfriends they have. It would give them a clear path to immigration \nstatus, as well as citizenship.\n  The DREAM Act would give these young people a chance to earn \ncitizenship but only if they meet several requirements. First, they \nmust have come here as children. They have to demonstrate good moral \ncharacter. They have to have graduated from high school. They must have \ncompleted 2 years of college or military service. Then, having met \nthose requirements, they can apply for legal permanent residency and \npursue a path to citizenship.\n  The DREAM Act would enable thousands of young people in Connecticut--\nabout 2 million across the country--to leave the shadows, to leave the \nshadows of fear, of deportation from their homes and their communities, \na fear that haunts them and forces them to put their careers and their \neducation on hold, to the detriment of them and our Nation because they \nhave so much to contribute and to give back to their communities and \nour country.\n  They are well educated and ambitious, and they could enhance and \nexpand our society, our economy, our democracy if they are given the \nchance to fulfill their potential. All they want, all they ask is the \nopportunity to stay in this country and to earn citizenship in the \nplace they call home, proudly.\n  Two million immigrants nationwide would benefit from this act. Mr. \nPresident, 11,000 to 20,000 DREAMers are living in Connecticut, and one \nof them is Solanlly Canas.\n  She was born in Colombia and she is here with us in this photograph. \nShe was brought to America when she was 12 years old, living now in \nEast Haven where she has attended school. She is in her senior year of \nhigh school where she has thrived as a member of the Honor Society, the \nExecutive Board of the Student Council, and president of the Interact \nClub, the National Honor Society.\n  She has dreams and goals for the future. She is proud of being a \ngreat student contributing to the life of her school, and she hopes to \nstudy psychology some day. She wants to go to college. But her life is \nin danger of being on hold because of her undocumented status. On June \n15 of this year, Solanlly encountered the great hope that maybe all of \nher hard work would be worth it, because on that date, the Obama \nadministration announced a new policy that deferred action for \nchildhood arrivals that gave her a temporary reprieve for relief from \ndeportation. It extended for 2 years that relief. She would qualify, \nbecause those who\n\n[[Page S6888]]\n\nhave been in this country, continuously residing here for 5 years, \nbrought here as children, not convicted of a felony or significant \nmisdemeanor, currently in school or graduating from high school or \nhonorably discharged as a veteran, all would be eligible to apply.\n  But eligibility is all they receive. All they would gain if granted \nthis status is a temporary reprieve, forcing them again to risk, at the \nend of that reprieve, the potential for deportation and aggravating the \npossible fear by their having to declare their undocumented status. Her \nfate, far from being unusual, I have shown to be common to a number of \nindividuals whom I have specifically mentioned on the floor.\n  Miller Gomes, for example--I am going to have his picture be shown \nhere--brought to this country from Brazil at 5 years old. He attended \nBridgeport public schools and Fairfield University where he graduated \nsumma cum laude, and then the University of California-Berkeley where \nhe is now enrolled in a Ph.D. program, a Ph.D. program in chemistry. \nWhat does this country need if not more scientists? We say so every day \non this floor. Here is a scientist who could contribute greatly, now in \nfear of deportation simply because he was brought here at 5 years old \nand he is undocumented to this day.\n  Zuly Molina, who came here from Mexico, brought here at 6 years old. \nBy the way, she had to walk across desert-like, barren country for 15 \ndays. She was then put in the trunk of a car--6 years old. Living in \nNew Britain. She was so fearful of her status that she declined to go \nto college in Connecticut. Instead she went to Massachusetts at Bay \nPath College where right now she is pursuing a master's in occupational \ntherapy, a health care worker. At a time when we on this floor talk \nabout the need for health care skilled training, we have here someone \nwho could provide exactly that kind of contribution.\n  Finally, I have talked about Yusmerith Caguao, brought here from \nVenezuela when she was 11 years old. She went to Norwalk schools, and \ngraduated from Norwalk Community College. She worked her way through \nNorwalk Community College as a waitress, as a babysitter, as an \nemployee at a pet store. Now she is at Western Connecticut State \nUniversity pursuing a combined degree in finance and accounting.\n  For these DREAMers, a path to citizenship, beginning with legal \nstatus, is essential to their peace of mind but also to their \ncontinuing to accomplish academically and professionally what is their \ngreat potential, to give to their country the promise and fulfillment \nof that potential that this country so dearly needs. We have the \nopportunity to provide them with a pathway to citizenship. Hopefully it \nwould be part of comprehensive reform. But even as a stand-alone \nmeasure it merits approval. And as the Senator from Illinois said so \nwell, it was blocked by the requirement for a 60-vote threshold. A \nmajority voted in favor of it during this Congress. I ask my colleagues \nto give it the 60-vote threshold that it needs to pass for the sake of \nthese DREAMers and for the sake of our country.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Blumenthal pertaining to the introduction of S. \n3636 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          The Sportsmen's Act\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the bill that is going \nto be dealt with here at the bottom of the hour, S. 3525, the \nsportsmen's package. This is a landmark bill. It includes ideas from \nmembers of both parties and from both Chambers. Over 50 national sports \nand conservation organizations support this bill, ranging from the \nNature Conservancy to the NRA. Some 20 provisions included in this bill \nwill help expand access to public lands, support additional habitat \nconservation, and preserve the hunting and fishing rights millions of \nAmericans cherish. There has been much discussion about this bill, with \nmany people weighing in. The fact is that this is a responsible \nbipartisan bill that will reduce the deficit by $5 million while \nexpanding hunting and fishing opportunities for millions of Americans.\n  I appreciate the perspective of the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee on the issue of whether to raise a point of order. I know he \nhas to defend the Budget Act. However, the reality is this: This bill \nreduces the debt by $5 million over 10 years. Those aren't my figures; \nthose are the figures of the Congressional Budget Office. \nUnfortunately, a vote to sustain the point of order made by Senator \nSessions is a vote to kill this important bipartisan legislation. We \nhave had plenty of partisanship already here today on the Senate floor. \nI think it is time to do something in a bipartisan fashion and do \nsomething that is good for some 90 million Americans who consider \nthemselves hunters and anglers.\n  I urge my colleagues to waive the budget point of order and then \napprove this important bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Tester's leadership \nin putting together legislation, S. 3525, to address the priorities of \nsportsmen across the country.\n  This bill has many important provisions that I support, including \nreauthorization of highly successful conservation programs in the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee's jurisdiction, which I chair. \nThese programs restore critical wetlands, support partnerships to \nconserve wildlife habitat, and promote outdoor recreation.\n  While I appreciate Senator Tester's efforts to move this legislation \nforward, I remain deeply concerned about two provisions included in \nthis package, which I will discuss today. S. 3525 broadens an exemption \nthat prohibits the use of the Federal Toxic Substances Control Act to \naddress public health and environmental threats from dangerous \nchemicals, including lead, in ammunition and fishing tackle.\n  Some ammunition and fishing tackle contain lead that can be harmful \nto people who consume meat contaminated with lead shot. In 2008, \nMinnesota examined packages of venison and found that 22 percent \ncontained lead fragments. North Dakota has also found lead fragments in \nvenison being distributed for food.\n  The latest science shows that there is no known safe level of lead in \nchildren's blood. Because lead can damage the nervous system, including \nthe brain, children and pregnant women are especially at risk.\n  Animals can also be poisoned or die after eating ammunition that is \nshot into lakes, rivers and upland areas, or when they consume the \ncarcass of another animal that contains spent ammunition. In 2008, an \nexpert at the U.S. Geological Survey stated:\n\n       Science is replete with evidence that ingestion of spent \n     ammunition and fishing tackle can kill birds. The magnitude \n     of poisoning in some species such as waterfowl, eagles, \n     California condors, swans and loons, is daunting.\n\n  There are safe and effective alternatives, such as steel, to the use \nof lead in shot and fishing tackle. According to the State of \nWisconsin:\n\n       Steel shot actually arrives on target in a tighter pattern \n     . . . (and) penetrates game better than lead . . . Extensive \n     research, testing steel and other non-toxic shot, shows it to \n     be both safe and effective.\n\n  The Federal Government must be able to use all of the tools at its \ndisposal to protect American families from consuming contaminated food. \nTherefore, we should not create unneeded exemptions that apply to lead \nand an unknown number of other contaminants.\n  I also oppose the provision in S. 3525 that would allow sport-hunted \npolar bear trophies to be imported from Canada. This misguided \nprovision could jeopardize recovery efforts for a species that is \nlisted as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, ESA, and \nprotected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, MMPA.\n  Before polar bears received their protected status under the ESA and \nMMPA, there were extensive warnings for over a year that this \nprotection was imminent. Nevertheless, a small group of trophy hunters \nignored these warnings and went forward scheduling new\n\n[[Page S6889]]\n\nhunts, and they are now seeking an exception to allow their polar bear \ntrophies to be imported into the United States.\n  The International Union for Conservation of Nature estimates that \napproximately 20,000 to 25,000 polar bears remain in the wild. Their \nsurvival is severely jeopardized by many factors, and we should not \nprovide a loophole that encourages hunting of this vulnerable species. \nMaintaining full, consistent protections for polar bears is critical to \nthe health of the Arctic ecosystem, the Native communities who legally \nharvest these bears for subsistence purposes, and for the public at \nlarge that is working to save this iconic animal.\n  I believe this bill has many good provisions that will help preserve \nAmerica's treasured natural resources, protect fish and wildlife, and \nprovide recreational opportunities for our families. Unfortunately, the \nbill also includes two provisions that threaten public health and could \nset back wildlife conservation efforts. I filed amendments to S. 3525 \nthat would address these concerns, but if the amendments are not \nadopted and the bill remains unchanged, I will oppose S. 3525 in its \ncurrent form.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will be raising a budget point of \norder against this legislation. But I do want to thank my colleague, \nSenator Tester, for his hard work and the efforts of a lot of people to \nput this legislation together. I would hope my colleagues would listen \nto why I think it is important this bill--with a lot of good points in \nit, which I favor strongly--needs to be sent back and fixed.\n  The reason is this: The bill violates the Budget Control Act that we \npassed August a year ago. That has been certified by Senator Conrad, \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee, and his staff. It plainly, as \noften is the problem, spends more than the Budget Control Act allows to \nbe spent. Chairman Conrad, as I said, has agreed with that assessment.\n  No. 2, now this is the fourth bill brought before this Senate by the \nmajority leader in the last 15 months that violates the budget. It is \nthe fourth time. This is a time in which our country has never faced a \nmore serious systemic budget crisis. We are on an unsustainable course. \nWe know that. One of the things we need to do is figure out a way to \nconstrain ourselves, and the Budget Control Act was a step in that \ndirection.\n  To raise the debt limit in August 2011--we had borrowed all the money \nwe could borrow, and to raise the debt ceiling, the debt limit, the \nBudget Control Act was passed. It limited spending, and that was all \npart of the deal to raise the debt ceiling.\n  These violations of the Budget Control Act lower respect for the \nSenate by the American people. It hurts our Nation because it impacts \nour debt situation and our spending, and it cannot be justified. It \nshould not happen. We can avoid this.\n  I disagree with Senator Tester on this point. Of course, sustaining \nthe budget point of order will not kill this bill unless in some manner \nof pique Senator Reid were to say: I am not going to bring it up if you \ndo not pass it just like I said it ought to be passed and you will not \nwaive the budget and just violate the budget and do it like I said. I \ndo not think Senator Reid will do that. Surely, he will not do that.\n  So what would happen is it would go back to committee, and Senator \nReid would review it and see what we could do to fix it, which will be \neasy compared to some of the difficult problems we have around here. \nThe need would simply be to find $14 million a year. I have suggested a \nnumber of ways already, but those have not been used. If we would think \nabout it this way, we are talking about finding savings somewhere in \nthis monumental government of $14 million when we plan to spend \n$370,000 million this year. By Alabama standards that is a lot of \nmoney.\n  Another problem: The bill is subject to a House blue slip. Under the \nCongressional Budget Office analysis and the President's own Office of \nManagement and Budget in the White House, the duck stamp is a tax. It \nsimply is a tax. People can say it is not a tax. It is a tax. They have \ndefined it as a tax. We do not have the ability to redefine the meaning \nof words around here, and a tax cannot originate in the Senate. So the \nHouse, as it is presently written, is likely to object and will object \nto this, I am certain.\n  Another easily fixed problem in the bill is this: The Environment and \nPublic Works Committee brought up the legislation. The question of \nwhether the duck stamp tax should be set by law, by Congress, or be \ngiven to a member of the President's staff to set at whatever level he \nwants was discussed. Senator Boxer agreed with those who shared the \nview that we should not be delegating to an unelected Cabinet person \nthe power to set taxes in the United States of America. He can set the \nduck stamp under this bill at any level he wants to set it at. That is \nnot good.\n  This is a constitutional issue. I feel strongly about it. Congress \nmust never cede its power to tax to a single person not even \naccountable or any other entity, the U.N. or any other entity. The \nConstitution gives Congress the power to tax and only the Congress the \npower to tax. That can easily be fixed. There is not a problem here.\n  It has been argued that the point of order is only technical. Do not \nworry about this point of order. It is only technical because the new \nspending in it is paid for. How? By tax increases. So the Budget \nControl Act drafters, 15 months ago, and the budget rules of this \nSenate understand this argument. This is not a new argument. They knew \nthis kind of gimmick would come up under the Budget Control Act, and \nthey prohibited it. They understood it, and that is why they prohibited \nit.\n  Under the Budget Control Act, a spending limit is a spending limit. I \nknow Senator Reid seems to think if he raises taxes he can spend more, \nand he does not have to pay attention to the Budget Control Act he \nsupported and the President signed and negotiated 15 months ago. He \ndoes not have to do that because he has paid for it, he thinks, by \nraising taxes. But the truth is the Budget Control Act does not deal \nwith taxes. It deals with spending, and it prohibits more spending than \nthe amount above the EPW allocations.\n  I note my friend, Senator Tester, and my friend, Senator Warner, \nearlier--they are fine Senators--said there is no problem. OK. There is \nno problem, Sessions. It reduces the deficit by $5 million over 10 \nyears. We should not worry. So you say: OK, Sessions, why are you \ncomplaining? You are worried about the deficit. It reduces the deficit \nby $5 million. CBO says that. That may be the case. I think it is the \ncase. But what is the answer to that charge? The answer to it is simply \nthis: This legislation, as it is now written--and can be changed--\nraises taxes $145 million and spends $140 million, and they pat \nthemselves on the back and say: We pay down the deficit $5 million. \nGive me a break.\n  Think about this, though: If the spending limit of the Budget Control \nAct were complied with, we would not have a $5 million reduction in the \ndeficit. We would have a $145 million reduction in the deficit at \nleast. We would have $145 million in deficit reduction instead of $5 \nmillion. So let's ask: Has anyone looked around to see if there is any \nspending that can be reduced to pay for this? The Interior \nAppropriations bill spends $29 billion a year. We cannot find $14 \nmillion?\n  Well, the answer is, nobody has looked to save any money to pay for \nthis bill. Nobody, really.\n  Well, why not? Because it asks the Members of the House and the \nSenate--the Congress--to choose, make priority settings, and that is \nhard. We do not want to do hard things. There are over $900 million \nspent in wetlands programs like that in the bill that advance duck \ncauses and hunting and so forth, according to the Congressional \nResearch Service. Has anybody ever looked to see if that multiplicity \nof programs might be consolidated and save, out of $900 million, maybe \n$14 million right there? Plus, any other spending in this government \ncould be utilized to keep within the spending limits and not violate \nit.\n  But the fact is the Budget Control Act said we must choose. If we \nwant to\n\n[[Page S6890]]\n\nhave a new program in one of our areas of the government, fine and \ndandy, but we have to do it within the limit of spending we have agreed \nto. This bill does not do that. Under this rationale, we would have to \nassume, would we not, that the needs of this bill are so little that \nthere is not a single other program in America, not a single one, that \nis less valuable. Therefore, the only way we can proceed with this bill \nis to raise taxes, raise revenue. That is just simply not correct. We \nknow better than that.\n\n  There is no reason these problems cannot be fixed. Slowing down, \ncomplying with the Budget Control Act, not delegating to an unelected \nCabinet Member the power to raise taxes, not violating with a blue slip \nby commencing a revenue bill in the Senate, is not hard to deal with.\n  So I say to Senator Tester: Thank you for your work. I am not sure \nthe way this was done precisely was something you suggested. I believe \nwe can work this out. I have made some suggestions. I am open to a lot \nof suggestions, but I will just say to my colleagues, I will continue \nto object to any bill brought before this Congress that violates the \nsolemn agreement we made 15 months ago in the Budget Control Act. And \nthis one does. Senator Conrad has verified that. If my colleagues will \nadhere to the limits of spending that we agreed to 15 months ago by \nsupporting this budget point of order, this popular bill, with a lot of \ngood values in it, will be quickly fixed and passed--there is just no \nother way to see it--and in the future, committees and Senator Reid, \nperhaps, will stop sending budget busters to the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I was going to make the budget point of order at this \npoint, but I see Senator Tester. I do not know if he wants to speak. \nLet me say again how much I appreciate the hard work Senator Tester has \nput into this. He is a friend. I know he has worked hard, and I hate to \ncause him heartburn at this point in time, but I really would say I \nhave raised this budget point of order on other bills and it is not \nthat I am complaining particularly about his. His, in fact, will be a \nlot easier to fix than some of them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I want to thank the ranking member of the \nBudget Committee for his comments.\n  Look, folks, this is a bill about habitat. It is a bill about access. \nIt is a bill about opportunity for people who enjoy our outdoors in \nthis country. The outdoor economy is some $600 billion a year.\n  I have heard many times spoken on the Senate floor, if we are going \nto get the deficit and the debt under control, we have to grow our \neconomy. This is about growing our economy. How? By allowing hunters, \nfishermen, outdoor activists the opportunity to go out and utilize the \ngreat outdoors this country has to offer in Montana and throughout this \ncountry.\n  We are losing habitat every day. We have lost access to habitat for \nhunting and fishing and hiking. This bill will fix that.\n  I will go back to the point Senator Sessions made. When I go back \nhome, folks talk to me about the debt. They talk to me about the \ndeficit. They ask what we can do to fix it. Quite frankly, this is one \nof those things we can do to fix it. By increasing opportunities for \nour outdoorsmen and women in this country, we have the opportunity to \nincrease our economy in a very positive way.\n  Like I said, when we talk about the duck stamps, those dollars go in \nto be used for promoting opportunities in duck hunting. Those moneys \nwill not be going into funding the war in Afghanistan. The money coming \nin basically goes out for a specific purpose.\n  By the way, the folks who utilize the duck stamp want this money \nbumped up. That is why we give the Secretary this discretion.\n  With that, I yield the floor back to the Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/26/senate-section/article/S6890-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SPORTSMEN'S ACT OF 2012\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          The Sportsmen's Act\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I appreciate the vote we just \nconcluded. I think what the vote said is that we want the bill on the \nfloor to be in compliance with the Budget Control Act that was passed \n15 months ago. This bill, even though it was not a lot of money, \nviolated that. Senators have voted not to waive the budget and spend \nthe money anyway. They decided we should comply with the budget.\n  I talked with Senator Tester and Majority Leader Reid and assured \nthem that the fundamentals of this bill are good. I like what they have \nbeen trying to do with the Sportsmen's Act and I have been supportive \nof so many of the provisions in it.\n  We had several little problems. First and foremost, it attempted to \nspend more than the EKW Committee was entitled to spend under the \nBudget Control Act. Second, we have a blue slip problem with it. \nThirdly, we have given the Interior Department Secretary the power to \nraise taxes unilaterally without a vote of Congress, and I think that \nis bad policy. All of those, however, compared to the many other \nprovisions in the legislation are small, and we should be able to work \nthem out. So I hope we can, and I will be working in that regard.\n  However, I do wish to say to my colleagues, this is the second bill \nthat has had a lot of support on both sides of the aisle but has failed \nbecause they violated the Budget Control Act agreement on spending. \nSome on the other side might think they can simply say Republicans are \nobstructionists, they are killing bills just because they want to kill \nthem and they don't like them. That is not correct. Republicans want to \ndeal with many of the issues before us, such as veterans jobs, such as \nissues important to sportsmen, and we are supportive of them, but we \nwant them to be done according to the agreement we reached on spending \nlimits last year, and that can easily be done. We spend almost $3700 \nbillion a year. We ought to be able to find $14 million from waste, \nfraud, duplication--savings that can be utilized to pay for this new \nprogram.\n  What the bill suggests by the way it is written is that we have \nlooked at all of the spending in the entire U.S. Government and we \ncan't find $14 million less valuable than to spend it on migratory bird \nconservation. I think that is not true. Of course we can find waste, \nfraud, and abuse right there. We can find other ways to consolidate \nprograms to fund this. We have to honor the agreement we reached, \nbecause it looks to me as though we will soon be headed to some sort of \nlate-night, end-of-the-session monumental bill, and it will be like \nwhat we had 15 months ago when the debt ceiling was increased and \nspending was limited and we promised to raise the debt ceiling but \nlimit spending growth, basically. We voted on that. The majority voted \nfor it. The President supported it. He signed it. It became law. Here \nwe are now 15 months later, having had four bills brought to this floor \nthat violated that spending limit. So we have to be careful. The \nAmerican people are not going to be very confident, if we reach some \nsort of other spending limit agreement to avoid the fiscal cliff, that \nwe won't, before the ink is dry, start violating it. After all, it only \ntakes 60 votes.\n  I think it is a very important issue. I am the ranking Republican on \nthe Budget Committee. When we make an agreement, I think we ought to \nadhere to it, and this is why we had difficulty with the bill.\n  I enjoyed working with Senator Tester on it. I have had a good \nconversation with Senate Majority Leader Reid. Hopefully, something can \nbe worked out to fix this problem.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley).

Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the \nheroic service of SFC Ryan James Savard, who was killed in action \nOctober 13 in Kunduz Province as part of Operation Enduring Freedom in \nAfghanistan. Sergeant First Class Savard was assigned to the \nHeadquarters and Headquarters Company of U.S. Army Special Operations \nCommand out of Fort Bragg, NC. He was killed while serving a sixth tour \nof duty--a remarkable accomplishment--after completing four tours in \nAfghanistan and one tour in Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nHe was a brave patriot who served his country with honor and \ndistinction. He was a loving husband and a devoted son.\n  Ryan was born on February 27, 1983 in Salt Lake City, UT. When he and \nhis family moved to Jefferson, NH, Ryan attended eighth grade at the \nLancaster School and spent 3 years at the White Mountains Regional High \nSchool in Whitefield. After graduating from high school in Arizona, \nRyan followed in his father's footsteps and enlisted in the Army. In \nfact, he completed his very first day of basic training on September \n11, 2001.\n  Ryan began his 10 years of service repairing helicopters and then \nwent on to earn great distinction in the Special Operations Forces as a \nGreen Beret. In June 2004 he graduated from the U.S. Army John F. \nKennedy Special Warfare Center, becoming a weapons sergeant in Company \nA, Third Battalion, Third Special Forces Group at Fort Bragg. Ryan rose \nsteadily in this role, deploying three times as a senior weapons \nsergeant in 2008 and twice as a Special Operations Team Member in two \ntours beginning in 2010.\n  Ryan received a significant number of awards for his distinguished \nservice, including three Army Commendation Medals, a Joint Service \nAchievement Medal, three Army Achievement Medals, a Joint Meritorious \nUnit Award and Meritorious Unit Commendation and three Good Conduct \nMedals. In addition, he was posthumously awarded a third Bronze Star \nMedal, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal and a second Purple Heart.\n  Ryan is remembered by those close to him as a true friend with an \ninfectious laugh and an unmatched sense of humor. He was a great \nlistener and an extremely hard-working young man. Ryan knew the type of \ncommitment that was necessary to be a real friend and the type of \ncommitment that was necessary to be the best soldier possible. His \ndrive to succeed has left an indelible mark on his family, his friends, \nthe State of New Hampshire and the Nation. We are extremely proud and \ndeeply appreciative of Ryan for his willingness to serve and \nultimately, to lay down his life, like so many others before him, in \nthe defense of the freedoms that we as Americans hold dear.\n\n[[Page S6892]]\n\n  Ryan has been laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery. He is \nsurvived by his wife, Kayla, of Fayetteville, NC; his parents, SGM \nGarett Savard and Marie Savard, of Lancaster, NH; his five sisters, \nRachel, Rebekah, Virginia, Karen and Mariah; and his two brothers, \nJedidiah and Garrett. This American hero will be sorely missed.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Americans to join me in honoring the \nheroic service of SFC Ryan James Savard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/26/senate-section/article/S6892-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING OUR VETERANS\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, each year on November 11, we come together \nas individuals and as a Nation to express our heartfelt gratitude to \nour veterans for the countless sacrifices they have made over the years \non our behalf. Thanks to them, our Nation is strong and free, and our \nAmerican way of life that we are so justifiably proud of continues to \nbe protected and preserved. Although Veterans Day is over for this \nyear, our appreciation for our veterans should never be over.\n  Specifically, I wish to honor our selfless men and women in the Armed \nForces who have served and continue to serve in Operation Enduring \nFreedom. October 7th marked the 11th year the United States has been \nfighting the war in Afghanistan, and that is why the Senate recognized \nOctober 7th as Operation Enduring Freedom Veterans Day. Much has \nchanged in the world and our lives in the last 11 years, but the United \nStates remains committed to fighting for freedom in Afghanistan. More \nimportantly--our brave military men and women have maintained their \ncommitment to us. They fight to protect us, and to protect our \nfreedoms. The war in Afghanistan is so physically far away; it can be \neasy to forget and get caught up in our daily lives. I ask every \nAmerican to not forget our brave men and women are still overseas. I \nhope those courageous souls never fade from the hearts and minds of the \npeople of the United States. In order to remember and honor the \nveterans' service in Afghanistan, the United States Senate recognized \nOctober 7th as Operation Enduring Freedom Veterans Day.\n  I want to thank Andrew Koenig, a Marine and native of Casper, WY, who \nreached out to my office with this idea of how to remind Americans of \nthe war in Afghanistan we continue to fight. I thank him for his \nservice and selfless dedication to all veterans and those currently \nserving.\n  Think of both October 7th and November 11th as a refresher of what it \nmeans to be an American. As you do, remember to take the first \nopportunity you have to thank a veteran for what we have received from \ntheir efforts. No one ever gets tired of being appreciated--especially \nour veterans.\n  The work our veterans began years ago continues today as our brave \nservicemen and women serve at outposts here in the United States and \nall over the world. Stationed far from family and friends, they have \nmade a commitment to each one of us that they will do everything they \npossibly can to keep us safe and protected from harm.\n  Our country is recognized for its freedom and this is due to the men \nand women who serve in our outstanding military. They are patriotic, \ncompassionate and courageous and set an example for us all to follow. \nIn word and deed our veterans have shown their great love for our \ncountry. We are very grateful for their service. Thanks to our \ncountry's veterans, the world is a much better place. God bless you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/26/senate-section/article/S6892-2", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PROMOTION OF GENERAL DENNIS VIA\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President, I have the honor today to recognize \nthree great Americans who valiantly risked their lives in the service \nof their country. SMSgt Christopher Widener, MSgt Brandon Stuemke, and \nSSgt Aaron Parcha are members of the Air National Guard from the State \nof Alaska who served as pararescuemen within the 83rd Expeditionary \nRescue Squadron out of Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan. I'd like to tell \nyou about some of the heroic actions taken by these men between the \n12th and 14th of November 2010.\n  Senior Master Sergeant Widener, Master Sergeant Stuemke and Staff \nSergeant Parcha are assigned to an Air National Guard unit that \nspecializes in dangerous combat rescue missions. Pararescue \nspecialists, or PJs, train to be inserted into the most hazardous and \nprecarious situations to save lives. They learn to operate in extreme \ncold and harsh terrain. They train on some of the most cutting edge \nequipment and master complicated medical procedures. If that isn't \nenough, they prepare to do this job in the face of an enemy that, when \nthey are plunged into the heart of a battle, can appear from any \ndirection.\n  Their mission in the Pech River Valley of Afghanistan was to provide \nmedical support to a United States Army task force. The operation was \nentitled Operation Bulldog Bite and was aimed at uprooting a determined \nand well-equipped enemy in the Kunar Province in the northeastern \nregion of Afghanistan. After the battle began and the Army unit \nsustained casualties, the 83rd Expeditionary Rescue Squadron was sent \ninto action to help extract the wounded and dead. Each of the airmen \nwas tasked to travel by helicopter and to be inserted by hoist to \nevacuate casualties. Accompanying the dangerous task of insertion from \na helicopter came the barrage of enemy gunfire directed toward the PJs. \nEven before they touched the ground, the PJs were targeted with a hail \nof bullets. Each of these men cast away their personal safety and \npressed on with their mission. The skilled airmen arrived at the \nlocation of the wounded troops and began to triage and treat the \ncasualties. They spent several hours tirelessly preparing the severely \nwounded for evacuation and hoisting each up to a lifesaving helicopter \ntransport hovering above. After evacuating the wounded, the \npararescuemen continued their efforts by evacuating fallen warriors \nfrom the U.S. Army unit while still receiving enemy gunfire. To ensure \nsuccess, Master Sergeant Stuemke even returned fire on an enemy \nposition. Senior Master Sergeant Widener showed courage by shielding \nthe casualty on his final hoist with his own body.\n  In all Senior Master Sergeant Widener, Master Sergeant Stuemke, and \nStaff Sergeant Parcha contributed to saving over 2 dozen American lives \nand ensure the return of several bodies of fallen comrades to their \nfamilies. Their efforts ensured the United States Army unit supported \ncould complete its mission, an operation that secured large stores of \nenemy weapons and munitions and significantly disrupted insurgent \nactivity against coalition forces in eastern Afghanistan.\n  These men have been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for their \nactions. The award is the 4th highest decoration a member of our \nmilitary can receive. I wish to thank these great men for their \nselfless service and dedication to our nation. They are all my heroes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/26/senate-section/article/S6892-4", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6892-S6893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JUDGE JEANNE BURCH\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, at the end of this year the \nsmallest county in Oregon is going to lose its biggest asset. Wheeler \nCounty Judge Jeanne Burch is retiring only because of Oregon law, which \nrequires judges to retire at a certain age. In this case, the law is \ndepriving my State of an exemplary public servant.\n  When she was appointed county judge in 1994, Wheeler County was close \nto bankruptcy. Since then, thanks to her\n\n[[Page S6893]]\n\nleadership and perseverance, the county has been pulled back from the \nbrink of insolvency. The county has also renovated its beautiful and \nhistoric courthouse and built a new family services center.\n  Judge Burch helped bring cell phone service to this remote area of \nOregon. She serves on the Frontier TeleCom Network, which provides \nemergency communications for many counties in Central Oregon, and the \nTelecommunications Committee for Association of Oregon Counties. \nEarlier this year, she was appointed to the Oregon Commission for \nWomen, and is now its vice chair. She is the only member of the \ncommission from east of the Cascade Mountains.\n  Concerned about the growing epidemic of obesity, Judge Burch joined \nin an effort to make Fossil ``The Biggest Loser.'' Patterned after a \npopular television show, 20 percent of Fossil's 450 residents \ncollectively lost 600 pounds to a successful effort to become \nhealthier, eat better, and be more active.\n  On a personal note, Jeanne Burch has become a valued friend.\n  When I first ran for the U.S. Senate in 1996, I promised the people \nof Oregon that I would hold a town meeting in each of the State's 36 \ncounties every year. On a wintery day in February 1996 I began \nfulfilling that promise by holding my first town hall in Wheeler \nCounty. From that cold day 16 years ago when I arrived in Fossil until \nnow, Jeanne Burch and the people of her county have always given me a \nwarm welcome.\n  For several years after that, I made it a practice to hold my first \ntown meeting of each year in Wheeler County. A few years ago when snow \nstorms made getting to Fossil impossible, Judge Burch and the other \nmembers of Wheeler County Court gave me a special dispensation by \npassing a resolution releasing me from my commitment to hold the year's \nfirst town meeting in Wheeler County.\n  When I held my 500th town hall in 2009 it was in Wheeler County and \nJudge Burch made sure that most of the town turned out. She did the \nsame thing last year for my 600th town hall on a warm summer night on \nthe front lawn of the courthouse she helped restore.\n  For 18 years, Judge Jeanne Burch has been the steady hand of county \ngovernment, a good friend, a wise steward, and the gold standard for \nwhat a good elected official ought to be.

A bill to provide increased consumer protections \n     for gift cards; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n     Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, as consumers shop for the holidays, \nmore and more consumers are buying, giving, and receiving gift cards.\n  By one estimate, Americans spent over $100 billion on gift cards in \nthe 2011 holiday shopping season, and that nearly $2 billion of that \nvalue went unused.\n  Today I am introducing legislation to help substantially remedy that \nproblem and to ensure that consumers receive the full value that is \nstored on their gift cards.\n  Whether it is a bankrupt company that refuses to honor a gift \ncertificate, a gift card with hidden fees that slowly withers down to \nnothing, or a ``promotional'' gift card that expires in the virtual \nblink of an eye, consumers in Connecticut and across the nation are in \ndanger of seeing the value of their gift cards disappear.\n  The Gift Card Consumer Protection Act will stop these abusive \npractices.\n  This bill uses as a model or blueprint the Connecticut law that I \nadvocated and helped write while serving as Attorney General, but it \nadds to protections provided by that state law and others.\n  This new measure enhances and expands gift card safeguards, \nparticularly when gift card sellers become legally insolvent and seek \nbankruptcy status.\n  It will add strong new protections for consumers when a company goes \nbankrupt. Under this bill, a company that files for bankruptcy must \nimmediately\n\n[[Page S6896]]\n\nstop selling its gift cards and is required to honor existing gift \ncards until it goes out of business.\n  First, this bill will ban expiration dates and inactivity fees.\n  Connecticut gift card consumers have the benefit of clear and robust \nprotections: their gift cards do not expire, and they do not carry any \nnon-use or dormancy fees. These protections apply whether the gift card \nis purchased by a consumer or obtained as a rebate or bonus for the \npurchase of another product because in both situations, the consumer is \nrelying on an expectation that the funds on the card will not expire \nand will not be depleted by fees.\n  As a U.S. Senator, I have often advocated for bringing Connecticut's \nstrong consumer protection laws to the rest of the Nation, and that is \nwhat this bill does.\n  Under current Federal law, gift cards may expire after 5 years, and \nthey be charged inactivity fees after 1 year. And loyalty, award, and \npromotional cards are not covered at all.\n  This bill would eliminate expiration dates and inactivity fees for \ngift cards, and it would include those protections for loyalty, award, \nand promotional gift cards.\n  This bill will give peace of mind and security to consumers when they \npurchase gift cards. They can shop with confidence, knowing that the \nmoney on their gift cards will not expire, will not diminish over time, \nand will not be refused if a company goes out of business.\n  I am grateful that many in the industry already follow these \npractices. Best Buy, for instance, doesn't charge fees on their gift \ncards and they do not expire. When you get a bonus card for a purchase, \nthat card doesn't expire or carry fees, either. The same is true for \nBarnes and Noble, and others.\n  These practices should prevail uniformly for every company.\n  Unfortunately that is not the case. Some large companies assess \ninactivity fees after a year, others issue promotional gift cards that \nexpire very quickly, sometimes as soon as forty days from the card's \nissuance.\n  The result is confusion and a lack of consumer confidence. ``Does \nthis company's gift card have hidden fees? Does the money on this $20 \nbonus card last until I use it, or will it expire next month? This ad \nsays I get a promotional gift card when I buy a new TV: does that mean \nit won't expire for five years, or will it expire in 30 days?''\n  The Gift Card Consumer Protection Act will address and dispel such \ndoubt and confusion and make it clear that consumers who receive or buy \ngift cards whether by purchasing them directly or as part of a rebate \nor promotion need not worry about the cards expiring or being depleted \nby inactivity fees. It provides protections for gift card holders when \na company files for bankruptcy protection.\n  The Gift Card Consumer Protection Act assures that consumers get \ntheir money's worth, no matter when they use the gift card.\n  I invite my colleagues to cosponsor the Gift Card Consumer Protection \nAct and ensure that gift card consumers do not see the value of their \ngift cards disappear due to unfair fees or expiration dates or a \ncompany bankruptcy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 3637.

which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions:\n\n       Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention (referred to in this preamble as the ``CDC''), \n     nearly 26,000,000 people in the United States have diabetes \n     and 79,000,000 people in the United States have pre-diabetes;\n       Whereas diabetes is a serious chronic condition that \n     affects people of every age, race, ethnicity, and income \n     level;\n       Whereas the CDC reports that Hispanics, African-Americans, \n     Asian-Americans, and Native Americans are disproportionately \n     affected by diabetes and suffer from diabetes at rates that \n     are much higher than the general population of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas, according to the CDC, someone is diagnosed with \n     diabetes every 17 seconds;\n       Whereas, each day, approximately 5,082 people are diagnosed \n     with diabetes;\n       Whereas, in 2010, the CDC estimated that approximately \n     1,900,000 individuals age 20 and older were newly diagnosed \n     with diabetes;\n       Whereas a joint National Institutes of Health and CDC study \n     found that approximately 15,000 youth in the United States \n     are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes annually and approximately \n     3,600 youth are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes annually;\n       Whereas, according to the CDC, between 1980 and 2007, the \n     prevalence of diabetes in the United States increased by more \n     than 300 percent;\n       Whereas the CDC reports that more than 27 percent of \n     individuals with diabetes are undiagnosed;\n       Whereas the National Diabetes Fact Sheet issued by the CDC \n     states that more than 11 percent of adults in the United \n     States and 26.9 percent of people in the United States age 60 \n     and older have diabetes;\n       Whereas the CDC estimates that as many as 1 in 3 adults in \n     the United States will have diabetes in 2050 if present \n     trends continue;\n\n[[Page S6897]]\n\n       Whereas the CDC estimates that as many as 1 in 2 Hispanic, \n     African-American, Asian-American, and Native American adults \n     will have diabetes in 2050 if present trends continue;\n       Whereas, according to the American Diabetes Association, in \n     2007, the total cost of diagnosed diabetes in the United \n     States was $174,000,000,000, and 1 in 10 dollars spent on \n     health care was attributed to diabetes and its complications;\n       Whereas, according to a Lewin Group study, in 2007, the \n     total cost of diabetes (including both diagnosed and \n     undiagnosed diabetes, pre-diabetes, and gestational diabetes) \n     was $218,000,000,000;\n       Whereas a Mathematica Policy Research study in 2007 found \n     that, for each fiscal year, total expenditures for Medicare \n     beneficiaries with diabetes comprise 32.7 percent of the \n     Medicare budget;\n       Whereas, according to the CDC, diabetes was the seventh \n     leading cause of death in 2007 and contributed to the deaths \n     of more than 230,000 people in the United States in 2007;\n       Whereas there is not yet a cure for diabetes;\n       Whereas there are proven means to reduce the incidence, and \n     delay the onset, of type 2 diabetes;\n       Whereas, with the proper management and treatment, people \n     with diabetes live healthy, productive lives;
