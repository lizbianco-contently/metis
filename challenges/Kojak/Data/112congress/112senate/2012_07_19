Mr. President, I rise today to speak about today's guest \nchaplain, the Reverend Elizabeth Evans Hagan, Senior Pastor at \nWashington Plaza Baptist Church in Reston, VA. I am pleased to welcome \nReverend Hagan and her husband, Kevin, to the United States Senate \ntoday.\n  Reverend Hagan holds a degree in education from Samford University, \nand received her Master of Divinity in 2006 from Duke University. Prior \nto serving at Washington Plaza, Reverend Hagan served as Associate \nPastor for Education and Youth at First Baptist Church of Gaithersburg, \nMD, and several pastoral internships in Alabama, North Carolina, and \nWashington, DC. She is passionate about building a strong community of \nfaith, and has traveled extensively to places such as Uganda, Rwanda, \nKenya, Burma, Thailand and Argentina.\n  Since March of 2009, Reverend Hagan has led the large and growing \ncongregation at Washington Plaza, which includes a large African-\nAmerican, Chinese, and growing Hispanic representation. It is welcoming \nand affirming of all people, and a church where seekers feel at home.\n  Through the many ministries and programs at Washington Plaza Baptist \nChurch, Reverend Hagan has made a profound impact on the lives of many \nmembers of my constituency. I am certain that she will continue to \nguide her congregation for many years to come, and I look forward to \nseeing the direction of Washington Plaza under her leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/19/senate-section/article/S5169-4", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The Honorable Tom Udall  led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/19/senate-section/article/S5169-5", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              APPOINTMENT OF ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am fairly confident that S. 3401 is at the \ndesk and due for a second reading.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle for the second time.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3401) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     to temporarily extend tax\n\n[[Page S5170]]\n\n     relief provisions enacted in 2001 and 2003, to provide for \n     temporary alternative minimum tax relief, to extend increased \n     expensing limitations, and to provide instructions for tax \n     reform.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object to any further proceedings with \nregard to this bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The bill will \nbe placed on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, over the last decade, American companies \noutsourced about 2\\1/2\\ million jobs, often to countries where they can \nhire workers for half the price. And 21 million Americans, including \nnearly 7 million manufacturing workers, live with the fear their jobs \ncould be shipped overseas tomorrow. More than 130,000 of those at-risk \nworkers live in Nevada. In the Presiding Officer's home State of New \nMexico, more than 100,000 jobs in manufacturing, sales, management, the \nfinancial sector, and other industries are in jeopardy. And more than \n300,000 jobs in the State of Kentucky, the State of my Republican \ncounterpart, are also at risk. So I was surprised yesterday when the \nminority leader dismissed efforts to end taxpayer incentives for \ncompanies that outsource jobs overseas. To quote the minority leader, \nhe said:\n\n       Why aren't we doing anything? It's time to bring up serious \n     legislation that affects the future of the country.\n\n  At a time when millions of Americans are looking for work, I am not \nsure what could be more serious than protecting good-paying, middle-\nclass jobs. The Bring Jobs Home Act, the measure before this body, \nwould end tax incentives for corporations that ship jobs overseas. \nEvery time an American company closes a factory or a call center in \nAmerica and moves operations to another country, taxpayers pick up part \nof that moving bill. Hard to comprehend, but it is true. The \nlegislation before this body would end that senseless series of tax \nbreaks for outsourcers. It would offer a 20-percent tax credit to help \nwith the cost of moving production back to the United States.\n  In the last few years, major manufacturers such as Caterpillar have \nbrought jobs back to the United States from Japan, Mexico, and China. \nSmaller manufacturers such as Master Lock have moved facilities home as \nwell. Congress must do everything in its power to encourage this trend.\n  But let me remind the entire Senate that we must break a Republican \nfilibuster--a record-breaking filibuster--before we can even begin \ndebating the Bring Jobs Home Act. This obstruction is unfortunate, but \nit is not surprising. After all, the Republicans' nominee for President \nmade a fortune working for a company that shipped jobs overseas.\n  Yesterday, my friend Senator McConnell said he wants to debate \nserious legislation. If that is the case, he should urge his Republican \ncolleagues to drop their filibuster. The Bring Jobs Home Act is a \ncommonsense strategy to protect American workers. To 21 million \nAmericans whose jobs could be the next sent to China or India, it is a \nvery serious proposal. To the 2\\1/2\\ million Americans whose jobs have \nalready been shipped offshore, it doesn't get any more serious than \nthat. The only ones who aren't taking this measure seriously are the \nRepublicans in Congress.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, could I ask the majority leader one \nquestion related to the vote we are going to have later today?\n  A number of my Members are asking, in connection with voting to \nproceed to the bill, whether the bill will be open for amendments.\n  Mr. REID. The only amendments I have seen are three in number that \nthe Republicans have suggested--to do away with the Affordable Care \nAct, to reestablish the Bush tax cuts, and then the Hatch tax measure. \nAs has been the tradition with Republicans, those have absolutely \nnothing to do with outsourcing. So unless the Republicans get serious \nabout legislating on the legislation we have, the answer would be: Very \ndoubtful.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Well, I would say to my Republican colleagues, \napparently the bill will not be open for amendment, and we will take \nthat into consideration in deciding whether to support cloture on the \nmotion to proceed.\n\n\n                              Fiscal Cliff\n\n  Mr. President, earlier this week, Senate Democratic leaders made \nclear to the American people where their priorities lie. In case you \nare wondering, the middle class came in pretty low on the list.\n  At a moment when more Americans are signing up for disability than \nfinding jobs--listen to that, Mr. President, because this is where the \nAmerican economy stands today. More Americans are signing up for \ndisability than are finding jobs--Democrats said they think it is a \ngood idea to drive the country off what economists are calling \nAmerica's fiscal cliff this coming January. You might call it Thelma \nand Louise economics--right off the cliff.\n  But whatever one calls it, Democrats are evidently so determined to \nraise taxes on America's job creators that if we don't let them do it--\nif we don't let them do it--they would actually welcome an economic \ncalamity that would rock not only the American economy but the global \neconomy as well. They want to drive us right off the cliff. They would \nthreaten our own economy and the global economy as well.\n  Needless to say, this isn't a program for jobs or economic growth. It \nis an ideological crusade--an ideological crusade. Following the \nPresident's lead, Democrats are declaring ideological warfare, and the \nbanner they are marching under is emblazoned with a single word: \nFairness. Fairness.\n  Here is the problem: Fairness turns out to be a lot like hope and \nchange. Fairness turns out to be a lot like hope and change. We don't \nknow what it means until it is put into practice. But one thing \nhistory, common sense, and basic economics tell us is that it doesn't \nmean what the Democrats say it does. Because when they say tax the \nrich, we can be sure the middle class isn't far behind.\n  Just ask yourself: When was the last time a government program stuck \nto its original mission? When was the last time?\n  Federal income taxes initially were only supposed to apply to those \nwith taxable incomes above $500,000 a year, equal to about $11.3 \nmillion in today's dollars. And even then the top rate was only 7 \npercent. Today the Federal income tax starts to pinch as soon as you \nearn a dollar more than $9,750.\n  The Social Security tax started out at 2 percent. What is more, \nAmericans were told it would never rise above 6 percent. Yet today the \nSocial Security tax stands at 12.4 percent. And all other things being \nequal, it will likely have to rise above 20 percent to keep the program \nsolvent. That is the condition of Social Security today.\n  The alternative minimum tax was designed to hit 155 households back \nin 1969--155 households. Today it threatens to hit nearly 30 million \nhouseholds at the end of this year.\n  ObamaCare was supposed to tax the rich. Yet now it turns out the very \ncore of the bill includes a tax on the middle class. In my view, that \nparticular deception turned out to be the difference between the law \npassing and not passing. They said: Oh, it is not a tax. The Supreme \nCourt says it is a tax, with 77 percent of it hitting people making \n$120,000 a year and less. And it passed by just a single vote--just one \nvote. Every single Democrat who supported it is responsible for the law \nitself and the middle-class tax at the heart of it.\n  But the bottom line here is that a law we were told didn't hit the \nmiddle class, does--big time. And the same goes for the President's \nlatest proposal to raise taxes on those earning more than $200,000 a \nyear. It may be aimed at the top 2 percent now, but like every other \nprogram that is supposedly aimed at a few, very quickly this tax will \nincrease to apply to many.\n  Even the senior senator from New York has said this tax hike will hit \na lot of people who aren't rich. I agree with the senior Senator from \nNew York. After all, the revenue from the Democrats' tax increase will \nonly cover 6 percent of next year's projected budget deficit. So who is \nexpected to cover the rest? The middle class, of course.\n  That is the fine print under every Democratic proposal. They say they \nare coming after the rich, but the middle class is always next. And \nAmerica's small businesses are already on the\n\n[[Page S5171]]\n\nline. That is one reason Republicans are so adamantly opposed to these \nproposals.\n  Yes, it is a terrible idea to raise taxes in the middle of an \neconomic downturn. Yes, government is already way too big. Yes, \nDemocrats have absolutely no more intention of using this new revenue \nfor deficit reduction than they have had in the past. Yes, the \nPresident's latest proposal wouldn't even raise enough money to fund \nthe government for a week. And yes, we have no reason whatsoever to \nbelieve the President wouldn't continue his crony capitalist ways, \nspending that money on the pet projects of his political allies.\n  But the larger point is this: Not only is all this terrible \neconomics, it is completely and totally unfair. The American people \nshouldn't be on the defense when it comes to keeping what they have \nearned.\n  The President may think those who have succeeded in life haven't done \nso on their own, but anybody who has ever turned a dream into reality \nknows he is totally wrong about that. They know the sacrifices they \nhave made for their success: the hours of work they have put in, the \ntime away from family, the constant worry about whether they will \nsucceed.\n  Those who have made it know that what is unfair is being told--being \ntold--they have to now hand over even more than they already are to a \nPresident who has done nothing to show he knows how to spend it.\n  Democrats may think it is good politics to play Russian roulette with \nthe economy. They may think it helps their radical, ideological goals \nfor the country to go off the fiscal cliff at the end of the year. They \nmay look down on any enterprise that isn't controlled by the \ngovernment. But nobody--nobody--should ever attempt to pretend it is a \ngood idea for the economy or for jobs or for middle-class Americans, \nbecause it isn't. That is why Republicans think we should solve these \nproblems now.\n  That is what I have been calling for all week. It is what I and my \ncolleagues will continue to call for until Senate Democrats realize we \nweren't sent to play politics--we were sent to serve the American \npeople.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n                     Specialist Nathaniel D. Garvin\n\n  Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I rise to commemorate an \nhonored Kentuckian who has fallen in service to his country.\n  SPC Nathaniel D. Garvin of Radcliff, KY, died on July 12, 2010, in \nKandahar, Afghanistan, while in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. \nHe was 20 years old.\n  For his service in uniform, Specialist Garvin received several \nawards, medals, and decorations, including the Army Commendation Medal, \nthe Army Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the \nAfghanistan Campaign Medal with Bronze Service Star, the Global War on \nTerrorism Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, the Overseas Service \nRibbon, the NATO Medal, the Basic Aviation Badge, and the Overseas \nService Bar.\n  Specialist Garvin had the nickname ``Tater,'' given to him by his \nfather Cliff. That is because when he was born on July 4, 1989, he \nweighed a little more than 5 pounds. ``Wow,'' said Cliff to his wife, \nNate's mother Melanie, ``He is not much bigger than a sack of taters.'' \nThe nickname stuck.\n  Nate may have been on the small side, but he did not shy away from \nrisk. ``He was the daredevil of the family,'' Melanie remembers.\n\n       As soon as he was old enough to walk, he had no fears. As \n     he grew, he would climb trees to the tiptop to get on top of \n     roofs--scaring his mother, of course.\n\n  One story goes to show just how tough Nate was. When he was still \njust in grade school, Nate's shoulder blade got dislocated, and the \nschool nurse called his parents to come and pick up Nate and take him \nto the doctor. They did, but somehow in the short time between picking \nup Nate from school and driving to the doctor's office, Nate managed to \npop his own shoulder back into place. ``[He did it] showing no pain at \nall,'' says Melanie. ``The doctor was shocked, along with his dad and \nI.''\n  Nate's toughness included sticking up for his family. He grew up with \nthree older brothers and a little sister. They may have at times picked \non each other, but if someone outside the family ever picked on his \nbrothers or sister, ``Nate would say, `I am not afraid, let me handle \nit,' '' said Melanie. ``He didn't care how big the other person was; he \nwould not back down.''\n  Nate was smart, funny, loving, and loyal. ``He could say something \nthat . . . in an instant would either make you laugh or have you \nlaughing so hard you would be crying,'' Melanie remembers. Nate liked \nto fish and he enjoyed playing video games. He was so good at them, \nother people didn't want to play against him. He also could take apart \nand put back together the video game machines or almost anything else \nelectronic.\n  After Nate met and married his wife Brittany, both he and one of his \nolder brothers decided to use the buddy system and join the military at \nthe same time, following in the footsteps of another Garvin brother. \nNate felt it would be a good way to provide for not only his wife but \nalso his then-unborn child.\n  Nate entered the Army in July 2008. He scored highly enough on his \nentrance exams to have his pick of any field he wanted. Nate chose \navionics. He did his training at Fort Jackson, SC, and Fort Eustis, VA, \nand was assigned to B Company, 96th Aviation Support Battalion, 101st \nAirborne Division, based in Fort Campbell, KY.\n  Nate was able to come home from the Army for Christmas in 2008, and \nhis timing was good. On December 26, 2008, his daughter Kayleigh was \nborn. ``[That was] the happiest day in his short life. He loved her \nwith all he had,'' said Melanie.\n  In the short time they had together, Kayleigh became her daddy's \nlittle girl. Her grandmother Melanie says:\n\n       She looks so much like him at that age we say she is Tater \n     made over, just in a dress. She has his smile and her eyes \n     light up just like his did. She also has her daddy's stubborn \n     streak and smartness.\n\n  Nate would play video games and Kayleigh would sit beside him with an \nold game controller Nate gave her, pretending she was also playing the \ngame. When Nate bobbed and weaved, she did too.\n  Nate was deployed to Afghanistan for Operation Enduring Freedom in \nMarch 2010. As Melanie put it:\n\n       Tater was due to come home for his R in August 2010, but \n     unfortunately didn't make it. He lost his life one day before \n     his mother's birthday and two days before his 21st. He never \n     got to meet his son, who was born April 9, 2010.\n\n  We are thinking of SPC Nate Garvin's loved ones as I recount his \nstory for my colleagues. That would include his wife Brittany; his \nparents Melanie and Cliff; his daughter Kayleigh Jo; his son Wyatt \nBoone; his brothers, TJ, Alex, and Jeremy; his sister Whitney; and many \nother beloved family members and friends. The Garvin family is also \nthankful for the assistance given them by CPT Erik Heely during the \ndifficult events of 2 years ago.\n  The loss of SPC Nathaniel D. Garvin is tragic, and it is only \nappropriate that this Senate pause to honor his service and recognize \nhis sacrifice.\n  I hope his family, particularly his two young children, can take some \ncomfort from the fact that both the Commonwealth of Kentucky and this \ncountry are grateful for and honored by the heroism and courage Nate \nshowed, both in and out of uniform. The example he set for his loved \nones and his country will not be forgotten.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nfollowing hour will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees, with the Republicans controlling the first \nhalf and the majority controlling the final half.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with my colleagues.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an issue that is of \ndeep concern to our country, one of the greatest national security \nthreats facing our country right now; that is, what is called \nsequestration.\n\n[[Page S5172]]\n\n  To bring that down to plain terms for the American people, our \nDepartment of Defense is facing an additional $500 billion across-the-\nboard meat ax in cuts in addition to the already planned $487 billion \nin reduction over the next 10 years if we do not act as a Senate, as a \nCongress, and if the Commander in Chief does not act to come up with \nmore responsible ways to cut spending.\n  We all know we have a nearly $16 trillion debt. We all know debt \nthreatens our country not only as a national security threat but also \nas a threat to the quality of life of my children--I am the mother of a \n7-year-old and a 4-year-old--and future generations in this country. \nHowever, what we did last August was a kick-the-can exercise, where we \nleft it to a supercommittee to come up with $1.2 trillion in savings, \nrather than sitting down and coming up with the savings we should have \nat the time.\n  So where we are left is with a meat-ax, across-the-board approach, \ninstead of prioritizing our spending, and we are putting at risk the \nmost fundamental constitutional responsibility we have to the American \npeople; that is, to keep them safe.\n  Daniel Webster, who was born in New Hampshire, served as a Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, was a great statesman, said in 1834: ``God grants \nliberty only to those who love it and are always ready to guard and \ndefend it.''\n  We know from our men and women in uniform that they have been there \nfor us to guard and defend this great Nation--not only the current men \nand women who serve but generations of brave men and women have served \nour country. Where we are right now, we do a disservice to them not to \nresolve this sequestration, these across-the-board cuts, by coming up \nwith alternative spending reductions, which we can do.\n  To put it in perspective, 1 year of sequestration is about $109 \nbillion, and that also covers nondefense. If we could live within our \nmeans for 1 month with this government, we could come up with the \nspending reductions. We need to do that on behalf of our Department of \nDefense and for the American people.\n  Some of the things that have been said about the impact of these \nacross-the-board cuts:\n  Our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has said we will face the \npotential for increased conflict. He also said: ``We are living in the \nmost dangerous times in my lifetime, right now''--meaning, right now. \n``I think sequestration would be completely oblivious to that, and \ncounterproductive.''\n  We also know every leader of our military from every branch has \nspoken to both the House Armed Services Committee and the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. What they have said is shocking and should be a \nwakeup call to Members of both sides of the aisle, that we owe it to \nour military and to the American people to address it.\n  Just some of the things that have been said about sequestration:\n  The Chief of Naval Operations has said: We will do ``irreversible \ndamage'' to our Navy. ``It will hollow out the military, and we will be \nout of balance in manpower, both military and civilian, procurement and \nmodernization.''\n  The Chief of Staff of the Army has said: It ``would be catastrophic \nto the military . . . '' and we will ``reduce our capability and \ncapacity to assure our partners abroad, respond to crises, and deter \nour potential adversaries,'' while threatening our readiness.\n  The Air Force Chief of Staff has said:\n\n       We will be left with a military with aging equipment, \n     extremely stressed human resources with less than adequate \n     training and ultimately declining readiness and \n     effectiveness.\n\n  As I said yesterday on this floor, the Assistant Commandant of the \nMarine Corps has said that the Marine Corps will be unable to respond \nto one major conflict on behalf of this country.\n  There are many things we can predict. One of the things we know we \ncan predict is what is going to happen with sequestration. We know that \nif we do not address our debt now, we will be facing the fate of \nEurope. But one thing we have been very bad at predicting is where the \nnext conflict will come from for our country, where the next threat our \ncountry will face will come from. If our Marine Corps is unprepared to \nrespond to one major contingency, our country is at risk. That is why \nwe need to address this.\n  It is not only the impact on our men and women in uniform--from the \nChief of Staff, from the Commandant of the Marine Corps, of all the \nbranches that have spoken--but I had the chance to participate in a \npanel yesterday, to hear the concerns of our enlisted about this. I \nheard from the former head, the top enlisted person in the Marine \nCorps, Sergeant Major Kent. He expressed deep concern that we would be \nbreaking faith with our troops. Our military leaders have expressed \nreal concerns that we will not only undermine our national security, \nbut we will fail to keep faith with those who have sacrificed so much \nfor our country and to whom we owe everything.\n  In addition to the dire national security impacts of allowing this \nirresponsible across-the-board approach to occur in January, we also \nknow there are nearly 1 million jobs at issue. In fact, yesterday, \nbefore the House Armed Services Committee, the CEOs of some of our \nmajor defense employers testified. In fact, the CEO of Lockheed Martin \nBob Stevens said:\n\n       I have spent decades of my professional working life in the \n     national security arena and I have never been as concerned \n     over the risk to the health of our industry and our \n     Government [as now].\n\n  He said:\n\n       The effects of sequestration are being felt, right now, \n     throughout our industry. Every month that goes by without a \n     solution is a month of additional uncertainty, deferred \n     investment, lost talent and ultimately increased cost.\n\n  You see, it is not just our service men and women who keep our \ncountry safe, it is those who work to make sure we have the right \nequipment, that we have the best technology, that we have the best \ncapability of gathering intelligence to prevent future attacks against \nour country.\n  Our defense industrial base is incredibly important--not to mention 1 \nmillion jobs at issue.\n  Yesterday, Dave Hess, president of Pratt & Whitney and chairman of \nthe Aerospace Industries Association, said:\n\n       As an industry, we are already seeing the impact of \n     potential sequestration budget cuts today. Companies are \n     limiting hiring and halting investments--largely due to the \n     uncertainty about how sequestration cuts would be applied.\n\n  A small business owner, Della Williams--it is not just our large \nemployers, a lot of small businesses make parts for our weapons \nsystems, for our equipment for our military. They cannot take this \nuncertainty we have created for them in Congress, and these cuts, and \nmany of them will be forced to go out of business.\n  Della Williams said:\n\n       What is being billed as a stop-gap budget fix will have \n     lasting effects on our defense capabilities for years to \n     come. The switch will not just get flipped back on to reverse \n     that trend.\n       Moreover, the deep personnel and program cuts will threaten \n     our national security. Indeed, the United States could lose \n     our technological and strategic advantage and never get it \n     back.\n\n  This is why this is so important.\n  By the way, yesterday the CEO of Lockheed Martin had to issue--\nbelieved he had to issue a memo to his employees. In that memo his \nemployees will receive, he said:\n\n       We believe sequestration is the single greatest challenge \n     facing our company and our industry. Defense Secretary Leon \n     Panetta has said sequestration will have catastrophic \n     consequences for our nation's defense. . . . With little \n     guidance from the government on the specifics of \n     sequestration, it is difficult to determine the impact . . . \n     on our employees.\n\n  He said: We do know that we have a responsibility to tell you that \nyou could potentially be laid off and that we have a duty to issue what \nare called Warn Act notices now.\n  Under Federal law, these defense employers are going to have to, 60 \ndays before January 1, issue potential layoff notices to their \nemployees. Of course, that will also create lots of uncertainty and \nconsternation in many American families, which is unnecessary if we \nwould come to the table right now and address this issue.\n  We can find spending reductions that do not threaten our national \nsecurity. Just to put a couple of numbers in perspective, some States \njust had in job losses on this: Virginia, according to AIA--there was a \nnew report issued this week done by George Mason University--Virginia: \n136,000 defense industrial base jobs; Florida, 41,000; Pennsylvania, \n39,000; my home State of New Hampshire, just on the defense end, 3,600 \njobs.\n\n[[Page S5173]]\n\n  We owe it to the American people to act now. This is too important to \nbe used as a bargaining chip in December because people want to use it \nto put our national security at risk because of other issues they want \naddressed. We have always treated national security as a bipartisan \nissue in this Chamber. I hope we will not use our Department of Defense \nand put our men and women in uniform in this uncertain position. We \nneed to let them know we have their back. As Members of Congress, we \nshould be together right now, sitting at the table, resolving this, \ncoming up with alternative spending reductions.\n  I also call on the President as Commander in Chief of this country to \nlead that effort, to stop sitting on the sidelines. This is too \nimportant to the security of the United States of America.\n  I see my colleague from South Dakota here today, John Thune, who is a \nleader in our conference, someone who I know has been very focused on \nthis issue.\n  I ask Senator Thune, yesterday the House was focusing on this issue. \nWe know there were hearings before the House Armed Services Committee. \nIn fact, we should point out that the House, through reconciliation, \nhas already passed a bill to address sequestration, to make sure our \nnational security is protected. They have done that. It has not been \ntaken up in the Senate yet, unfortunately. I call on the majority \nleader of the Senate to act now because the House has passed something.\n  Yesterday, they also held a hearing. The House passed another measure \nby 414 to 2 that is called the Sequestration Transparency Act. It is a \ncompanion bill to one Senator Thune introduced in this Chamber. I know \nhow focused he has been on this issue. The Senate passed a similar \namendment to the farm bill.\n  One of the issues we saw from the CEOs who testified yesterday, from \nour defense industrial bases, the Department of Defense, OMB--they have \ngotten no guidance on where these cuts will be implemented. Therefore, \nI know that yesterday the House actually passed this act to address \nthat piece of it.\n  I ask, does the Senator from South Dakota agree that the Senate \nshould immediately pass the legislation he introduced, this bipartisan \nHouse bill that is coming over, a version, so that we, the American \npeople, can know right away--have the agencies tell them specifically \nwhat the impacts of sequestration are? Of course, most important, we \nneed to address this before the elections because we should not play \npolitical football with this.\n  With that, I ask the Senator from South Dakota what he thinks we \nshould do here in the Senate right now.\n  Mr. THUNE. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for yielding on \nthat point--more important, for the great work she is doing as a member \nof the Armed Services Committee. She has been a very active member of \nthat committee and a strong and clear voice for New Hampshire and for \nAmerica's national security interests.\n  I might also add that we serve together on the Budget Committee, \nwhere really this should have originated. Unfortunately, since we did \nnot pass a budget, it is very hard to have a plan for how to proceed \nwith spending the taxpayers' money, and this is what you end up with.\n  Because we have this process put in place where, if action is not \ntaken to avoid it, we have an across-the-board sequester that would \noccur at the first of next year--half of which would come out of the \ndefense budget--we need to be able to find out exactly how these cuts \nwould be implemented.\n  The thing we do not know is how the administration plans to implement \nthis. I think that is what the transparency act that passed in the \nHouse of Representatives is designed to get at. By the way, it was an \noverwhelming vote, 414 to 2. The House of Representatives, in an \noverwhelmingly bipartisan way, weighed in on the issue about whether \nthe administration ought to spell out in clear detail to the Congress \nand the American people how it intends to implement its sequestration \nplan.\n  I might say, it is going to be very difficult for us as Members of \nthe Congress to come up with an alternative replacement plan if we do \nnot know what their plan is for implementation. We know half the \nreductions are going to come out of defense--at least that is the \nplan--the other half out of nondiscretionary spending. It is clear this \nwould have a profound impact on the defense budget on top of the $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion in cuts as part of the Budget Control Act last summer.\n  I say to my colleague from New Hampshire, she has very clearly and \nwell laid out the impacts--as have been delineated and described by \nmany of our service chiefs, by many of our military leaders in this \ncountry--what those impacts would be on our national security, on our \nreadiness. Also, I think she has elaborated extremely well about the \neconomic impact, what it is going to mean in terms of jobs in our \neconomy.\n  For a moment, I want to come back to this fundamental point because I \nbelieve it is one that should not be missed by people who are following \nthis debate; that is, if the Budget Committee and the Senate had done \ntheir work in the first place and passed a budget, we would not be \nwhere we are today--if we had actually passed a budget.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire--I think this is her second year on \nthe Budget Committee. Even before she got here, we had not passed a \nbudget. I got on the Budget Committee in this last session of Congress, \nso it has been 2 years since I have been on the committee, but it is a \ncommittee without a purpose, without a mission. If you are not going to \npass a budget, I am not sure why you want to have a budget committee.\n  The other thing that is interesting about this is that we are not \ngoing to pass any appropriations bills. Not only not a budget, but in \nthe Appropriations Committee here in the Senate are usually 12 bills \nthat come across the floor. The majority leader said he is not going to \nbring appropriations bills to the floor.\n  I think the House of Representatives passed nine appropriations \nbills. They passed a budget. The Appropriations Committee here in the \nSenate has been moving and passing appropriations bills out of \ncommittee, but the leader of the Senate has said we are not going to \nmove appropriations bills this year.\n  We did not move a budget. We are not moving appropriation bills. So \nwhat you end up with is a budget control act like what we passed last \nsummer that takes these Draconian whacks out of the defense budget and \nputs America's national security interests at risk and in great peril.\n  I ask my colleague from New Hampshire, who, as I said, is a member, \nalong with me, of the Senate Budget Committee, might this situation \nhave been avoided had the Senate done its work as it is supposed to do \nin an orderly way, followed the law, actually passed a budget, actually \nworked on getting appropriations bills on the floor of the Senate? \nMight we have avoided what is before us; that is, these devastating, \ndisastrous, and what some have described as catastrophic cuts in our \ndefense budget? It seems to me at least that is where you end up when \nyou do not do your work in the first place.\n  To my colleague from New Hampshire, I simply ask her, as a member of \nthe Budget Committee, might we not be in a different situation if we \nhad passed a budget now for 3 years?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I would say my colleague from South Dakota is absolutely \nright. If we had done a budget for this country and the Senate Budget \nCommittee functioned in the way it was intended to function, then we \nwould not be in this situation in the first place. If we did regular \nbudgeting and if we did the responsible thing for our country--as every \nbusiness does, as every family does; on an annual basis we are supposed \nto do it as opposed to it being over 3 years since we have had a \nbudget--then we would not be in this situation right now where our \nDepartment of Defense is at risk. I know the Senator from South Dakota \nvoted for a budget the House passed, and I did as well. Had that budget \npassed, then the House did its job. Had we done that, we wouldn't be \nhere with sequestration today. We are doing what we owe to the American \npeople. If we can't do a budget for this country, how are we going to \nget the trillion dollar deficit in check?\n  Unfortunately, we know why we don't have a budget. The majority \nleader of the Senate has not shown the\n\n[[Page S5174]]\n\nleadership he should because he said it would be foolish for us to pass \na budget and has not allowed the Senate Budget Committee--the Senator \nis right, I am not sure why we have that committee. I have been on \nthere for a year and half. We have not marked up a budget. We have not \ndone it, and that is because the majority leader of the Senate has said \nit would be foolish for us to do a budget. Why? Because when we do a \nbudget, we do have to make choices, as families and businesses do, and \nprioritize where we are going to spend the money and the taxpayer \ndollars that are sent to Washington by our constituents, the American \npeople. Where we are today is unfortunate. Had we done that, then I \ndon't think we would be in the position we are with sequestration.\n  Mr. THUNE. I think the Budget Control Act, which passed last summer, \ncreated this process, and led us to sequestration, which is where we \nare today. This is a function and a clear outcome of having not passed \na budget. It is ironic in many respects because, as the Senator from \nNew Hampshire has pointed out, the first fundamental responsibility we \nhave as Members of Congress is to tell the American people--the \ntaxpayers who pay the bills for this government--how we are going to \nspend their money. This is now the third year in a row that the Senate \nhas failed to do that.\n  Again, I might simply add that the House of Representatives did do a \nbudget, has been passing appropriation bills, has been following the \nlaw in accordance with what has been the practice around here up until \nthe last 3 years of actually working on a budget. When we are borrowing \n40 cents out of every dollar we spend, it would strike me that it would \nbe important we go through an exercise and figure out how we are going \nto start whittling away at the deficit and get the debt at a more \nmanageable level and how we are going to spend the American taxpayers' \ndollars.\n  As the Senator from New Hampshire pointed out--again, I don't think \nwe can emphasize this enough. Last summer we already called for $1/2 \ntrillion in defense cuts, and that was half of the amount of reductions \nthat were made last summer. It was about $1 trillion, a little over \nthat, overall in spending cuts last summer. Those were immediate \nspending cuts, half of which came out of defense; $487 billion was \nalready taken out of the defense budget.\n  So what we are talking about now is another $1/2 trillion over the \nnext 10 years on top of that $1/2 trillion. In other words, $1/2 \ntrillion out of the national security budget. The President's own \nSecretary of Defense has said it would lead to the smallest ground \nforce since 1940, since before World War II, and the smallest fleet of \nships since 1915, almost a century, and the smallest tactical Air Force \nwe have had literally in the history of the Air Force. That is what we \nare talking about. That is the dimension of the problem we are \nreferring to. It completely impairs our ability to project power in \nmany of these critical areas of the world.\n  The world is a dangerous place, and it is not getting any less \ndangerous. It is getting literally more dangerous, according to the \nheadlines, every single day. Our ability to project power in the Middle \nEast, Asia, and all the areas of the world we need to keep an eye on \nwill be in serious jeopardy.\n  I want to make a serious observation about that, and it is important \nto me. My State of South Dakota is home to a bomber base. One of the \nkey ways our Nation projects power is through the use of the bomber \nfleet. Our bomber fleet is aging. Nearly half of the fleet was built \nbefore the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, if you can imagine that. So it \nis highly important we modernize our bomber fleet and Secretary Panetta \nhas stated that the development of the next-generation bomber would be \ndelayed by sequestration until well toward the middle of this century. \nSo we are talking about dramatic reductions in our ground forces, Navy, \nand Air Force. All the assets we use to protect this country and defend \nAmerica's interests around the world would be at great risk if this \nsequestration goes into effect.\n  As the Senator from New Hampshire has appropriately pointed out, the \nNo. 1 priority we have is to defend this country. If we don't get \nnational security right, the rest of this conversation, including all \nthe other things we talked about, is secondary to defending and \nprotecting America and the American people.\n  This is a very serious debate, and I would come back to the question \nthe Senator from New Hampshire posed in the first place, and that is \nyesterday the House of Representatives passed by a 414-to-2 vote a \npiece of legislation that would require the administration to tell us \nhow they intend to implement these cuts by program, project, and \nactivity level. That way we know with some detailed specificity how \nthese proposed cuts are going to take effect, and that would allow us \nto come up with an alternative plan and perhaps be able to replace and \nsubstitute other cuts elsewhere in the budget for what are going to be \ndisastrous cuts in the defense budget.\n  I introduced companion legislation here in the Senate very similar to \nwhat the House passed yesterday. I hope the Senate will pick up the \nHouse bill and move it and pass it so we can get the administration and \nthe President to engage in this discussion about what they intend to do \nin terms of implementing sequestration. Then perhaps they can work with \nus to avoid the catastrophe we are referring to and talking about. This \nhas been documented and validated by all of our military leadership and \nwould be a very serious and dangerous reduction in America's national \nsecurity resources and in our ability to keep our country ready and \nable to defend America and America's interests around the world.\n  I appreciate so much the leadership of the Senator from New Hampshire \non this issue. I know the Senator has been very active in trying to get \nthe administration to provide more information with regard to what the \nimpact should be on the defense budget as a member of the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  I also think they ought to furnish all the information on these cuts \nnot only on the defense part but the nonnational security part of the \nbudget. Defense represents 20 percent of all Federal spending, but we \nare going to get half of the cuts. The proportionality of this is a \nreal issue, in my view. That happened last summer. Half of the cuts \nmade last summer came out of defense even though it is only 20 percent \nof Federal spending. Half of the cuts in this sequestration would come \nout of the defense budget, even though it represents 20 percent of all \nFederal spending.\n  I would hope, as my colleagues here in the Senate continue to hear \nfrom people around the country who are impacted by this--not only our \nmilitary leadership but also those whose jobs are going to be impacted \nby this--that there will be a new sense of urgency, a new intensity to \ntry to resolve this issue, and that is to get the administration to \nshow how they intend to implement sequestration.\n  I look forward to working with my colleague from New Hampshire to \nmake that happen. I hope our colleagues on the other side, the \nDemocratic leadership, will agree to moving that legislation.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank my colleague from South Dakota for his leadership \non this issue, and I too hope we will get that passed immediately in \nthe Senate, and that we have clarity from our Department of Defense as \nwell as the nondefense agencies so the American people can know what \nthe real impact is; also, so we can act immediately. I can't emphasize \nenough that this needs to be done before the elections. We need to do \nit before the elections because we have already--I talked about some of \nthe testimony from the CEOs from our defense industrial base, and there \nwill be, unfortunately, layoff notices which will have to be issued \nbecause of responsibilities they have under Federal law. Let's face it, \nwe should not have this cloud of uncertainty for our men and women in \nuniform, many of whom have served multiple tours for us and defended \nour country so admirably and so courageously. That is why I think this \nis an issue that deserves action now and should not be used as a \nbargaining chip for other issues. This is an area we have always, on a \nbipartisan basis, been able to do. For example, I serve on the Senate \nArmed Services Committee. We voted out the Defense authorization bill \nunanimously. Well, this is an issue I hope we would be unanimous on and \nthat we are not\n\n[[Page S5175]]\n\ngoing to break faith with our men and women in uniform, we are not \ngoing to put our country in jeopardy, and I am hopeful we will also see \nleadership.\n  I call upon the President again to be a leader here, to be the \nCommander in Chief of this country and to call us to action to resolve \nthis before the election.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I want to speak as the chair of the \nAgriculture Committee about what is happening on the droughts across \nthe country.\n  First, I want to take a moment as the author of the Bring Jobs Home \nAct to say that this afternoon we are going to have an opportunity to \ncome together--as we did on the farm bill when we came together on a \nbipartisan basis--to focus on growing things in America and the need to \nstrengthen our economy, provide economic certainty around agriculture \nand the food industry in America. It was a wonderful opportunity for us \nto get something done.\n  This afternoon, we are going to have the same kind of opportunity to \ncome together and recommit ourselves to making things in America. The \nBring Jobs Home Act is a very simple, straightforward way to eliminate \na subsidy that should have been gone a long time ago, and that is the \ntax writeoff for shipping jobs overseas.\n  When someone is losing their job because a plant is closing to go \noverseas, to add insult to injury, as a taxpayer, they get to pay the \ncost of the moving. It is outrageous. What we want to do is stop that. \nThat is what the bill does. It gives a business tax deduction for the \ncost of bringing jobs home and then adds another 20-percent tax \ndeduction on top of it to encourage businesses to do that. We will be \ntalking more about that later, but it is very important and I hope my \ncolleagues will come together and send a very strong message about \nAmerican jobs. Let's bring those jobs home.\n\n\n                           Drought Conditions\n\n  Mr. President, I also want to talk today about the terrible weather \nconditions across the country. It started with an early spring and then \na returning frost and snow in Michigan. Areas around the country have \norchards and fruit crops that have gone from frost to an extension of a \ndrought situation that is absolutely terrible. It is a very serious \ncrisis around the country.\n  Not since the days of the Dust Bowl have we seen this lethal \ncombination of scorching heat and bone-dry weather in the production \nregions across our country. As I speak, 80 percent of the country is \nsuffering from abnormal dry or drought conditions; 64 percent is \nsuffering from moderate or severe drought. That is the highest \npercentage in 56 years.\n  As we can see on the map, any area that is in color here has had some \nkind of a drought. The black areas are the worst. Either it is from \nabnormally dry, moderate, severe, or exceptional drought in almost \nevery area of the country. This is extremely severe, and we need to \ntake action to support our growers and ranchers.\n  We have almost 1,300 counties across the country rated as drought \ndisaster areas, and that is one-third of all the counties in the United \nStates. Every day it seems the Secretary of Agriculture is adding more \nto the list. More than 75 percent of the Nation's corn and soybean \ncrops are in drought-affected areas and more than one-third of those \ncrops are now rated poor to very poor. This is devastating our crops \nand our livestock producers.\n  Only one-third of our soybean crop is considered good to excellent \nright now, which is down by about 30 percent from last year.\n  According to the Department of Agriculture's weekly progress report, \nless than one-third of the Nation's corn crop is in good or excellent \ncondition. Nearly 40 percent is rated poor or very poor. So we are \ntalking about a massive effect on farmers, on livestock producers, and \nultimately on consumers in America.\n  Facing higher food and feed costs and pastures that are withering due \nto the heat, our ranchers and livestock producers could see significant \nlosses. I had an opportunity a number of months ago with Senator \nRoberts to be in Kansas and to see what was happening then, even before \nall of this. I understand how very serious this is for our livestock \nproducers. The livestock sector could face significant declines in \nmargins, and we could see a sharp increase in consumer prices for meat \nand eggs and dairy.\n  At a time when middle-class families are still trying to recover from \nthe great recession, paying more at the grocery store is not going to \nhelp. In fact, it is going to hurt a lot.\n  The USDA has opened their Conservation Reserve Program so that land \nwill be there for grazing, but we know it is not going to be enough for \nproducers. There is no crop insurance equivalent for livestock. More \nproducers may lose their ranches because of this drought. Livestock \ndisaster assistance expired last year. We need the farm bill to become \nlaw so we can make this help available again because in the farm bill \nwe extend the livestock disaster assistance program permanently, and we \nmake it available for this year.\n  This drought is a serious problem, devastating all of our farmers, \nand will come home to families here and around the world, \nunfortunately, all too soon. We can't control the weather. We know \nthat. In fact, farming and ranching are the riskiest businesses in the \nworld. I should say even though they are the riskiest businesses, we \nhave the safest, most affordable food supply in the world, and it is \npart of our national security. We can't control the weather and the \nrisks the farmers face, but this drought underscores the need for \nimproved risk management tools and better crop insurance. It \nunderscores the need for a farm bill.\n  We need to get a farm bill done now more than ever. We have 16 \nmillion people who work in this country because of the agriculture and \nfood industries--almost one out of four in Michigan. We came together--\nand it was a lot of work, a lot of bipartisan effort, and I am very \nproud of what we did together in the Senate a couple of weeks ago--to \npass a farm bill.\n  We now have the House having acted in committee and passed a strong \nbipartisan farm bill. It is different. There are some things, \ncertainly, we need to work out in our conference committee. Our bill \nhas more reforms in it, and we certainly are concerned about the \nnutrition cuts. But I will say this: We need the House to pass their \nfarm bill so we can come together in conference committee and find the \nright balance that is good for families, consumers, farmers, ranchers, \nand businesspeople across the country. I am very confident we can do \nthat, but we need the House to act to be able to make that happen. \nWeather disasters are getting worse every day, which makes it even more \nimportant that we have our legislation and, frankly, that we work \ntogether to add some pieces to it in a conference committee so we can \naddress what is happening.\n  In our bill that passed, as I said, we extended a livestock disaster \nassistance program and made it retroactive to this year. We also \nincluded a provision for fruit commodities that don't currently have \ncrop insurance to allow them to be able to buy into a program that is \nin law. We actually strengthened it, made it better. For those who \ndon't have crop insurance, we also said they could get help this year. \nSo we do have some things in the bill we passed, and we can work \ntogether to strengthen that even more.\n  Senator Baucus, the chairman of the Finance Committee, is working, \nand we are working closely with him, on something that would be a more \ncomprehensive disaster assistance program. In order to be able to do \nthat, we have to have a farm bill.\n  This is not, as we know, a partisan issue. We came together across \nthe aisle. Consumers, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, people who \nvote, and who don't vote--people across this country--care about a \nsafe, reliable, and affordable food system, and that certainly goes for \nour farmers and ranchers and their families in communities all across \nAmerica who were hit so hard by the drought.\n  This drought is evidence that we need to come together and act. When \nwe look at this kind of weather map and what is happening and the fact \nthat the majority of communities in our country are facing disaster as \na result of the droughts and other things that happened relating to the \nweather,\n\n[[Page S5176]]\n\nwe need to act. We need to act in a responsible bipartisan manner. We \ncan do that. We did that in the Senate. The House committee did it, and \nI commend them for that. We need the support and help of the leadership \nin the House to be able to get this to the floor and get it passed so \nwe can get it done.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Let me compliment Senator Stabenow for her leadership as \nchair of the Agriculture Committee. I want the Senator to know I was on \nthe phone yesterday with our soil conservation district managers \ntalking about the provisions that are in the Senate bill, and I wish to \npersonally thank the Senator from Michigan for reaching out to all of \nus. Our negotiations were tough, but they were fair, and I believe the \nreforms the Senator has in the bill will help our region and all the \nregions of our country deal with the underlying problems of agriculture \nin America.\n  So I particularly wish to thank her for that. The process she \nfollowed is how the legislative process should work: a very open \nprocess, a very bipartisan process. We have a good product, and I hope \nthe House will bring forward a bill and get it to conference so we can \ncontinue the dialogue. It is important to give the predictability to \nfarmers that this 5-year reauthorization provides. So I thank the \nSenator from Michigan for her extraordinary leadership in this area on \nbehalf of the agricultural community of my State of Maryland.\n  I really came to the floor to talk about another one of the efforts \nof the Senator from Michigan today; that is, the Bring Jobs Home Act. I \nthank Senator Stabenow for her leadership on this bill as well.\n  Senator Stabenow understands that outsourcing is devastating to our \ncountry. Americans understand that. Marylanders understand that. When \nwe are outsourcing, we are losing jobs. Families are devastated by \noutsourcing. What is most shocking is that our laws encourage companies \nto take jobs out of America. Our Tax Code should encourage companies to \nkeep their workers in the United States. We need to make it in America.\n  I think we were all shocked to hear about the U.S. Olympic team and \nthe fact that they are going to be outfitted by clothing manufactured \nin China. That is outrageous. It never should have happened. We can \nmake it in America.\n  I must tell my colleagues, I hear from people in Maryland all the \ntime--and I am sure the Presiding Officer hears the same thing in New \nMexico, as does my colleague from Colorado as well. When we get a call \nfrom a call center, we think the person is in our neighborhood talking \nto us about a local issue. Then we discover that person is halfway \naround the world pretending to be our neighbor and friend or \nrepresenting a local business, when in reality we have outsourced that \nservice--not we, the company has outsourced it--and the worst thing is \nthey don't tell us about it. They are misleading the consumers, and I \nknow we have some legislation to correct that.\n  That is outsourcing. That is costing America jobs, and it is wrong. \nWe can compete. Americans can compete with any other workforce in any \nother country, as long as we have a level playing field. So we want to \nmake it in America. Yes, we can.\n  First, let me talk about some success stories. Not too long ago I \nvisited Marlin Steel in Baltimore City. This is a steel wire \nmanufacturer that uses raw material from America and manufactures its \nproduct in America, in Baltimore City, a high-quality wire steel \nproduct. They sell their product in America, export their product to \nother countries, and create more jobs in America. That is a success \nstory.\n  A lot of people have given up on steel. We can't give up on steel. We \nneed to make it in America.\n  Let me tell my colleagues about another success story. Tomorrow I \nwill be at English American Tailoring, which is located in Westminster, \nright near Baltimore, in Maryland. They manufacture suits in America. \nThey make it in America. We are able to do it. All they ask for is a \nlevel playing field.\n  We took some steps in the Senate Finance Committee yesterday to \nprovide that level playing field by what we call the wool trust fund, \nwhich deals with inverted tariffs. We must make sure our laws are fair. \nThe shocking thing about clothing is it actually has higher tariffs on \nthe raw material--making it impossible to manufacture in America--than \nthe finished product coming into America. We correct that with the wool \ntrust fund. We need to make sure we have a level playing field.\n  Let me tell my colleagues another success story, about Pacific Trade \nInternational. This is a success story. This company was located in \nAsia, an American company located in Asia, making candles known as the \nChesapeake Bay Candles--being made in Asia. Well, this is a success \nstory. They are back in Maryland. They are located in Glen Burnie, MD, \nin the United States of America, making those candles, selling them to \nKohl's and Target and other retailers, creating 100 jobs that are now \nin my State of Maryland as a result of this company bringing jobs back \nto America.\n  In the last 28 months alone, we have seen 500,000 new manufacturing \njobs in America. We have talked about the U.S. auto manufacturing \nindustry and how we have seen that industry take off because we can \nmake it in America.\n  That brings me to the efforts of Senator Stabenow and others on the \nBring Jobs Home Act. It is shocking--and I think the people in Maryland \nand around the Nation are shocked--to understand that our Tax Code \nactually encourages companies to take jobs overseas. American taxpayers \nare actually footing the bill because, under current law, if an \nAmerican company decides to take its jobs and export them overseas, the \nmoving costs are deductible per our Tax Code.\n  Why do we allow that? Why do we ask the taxpayers to subsidize moving \njobs overseas? Well, the Bring Jobs Home Act says: Let's get rid of \nthat tax deduction. Instead, let's make sure if companies bring jobs \nback to America, yes, we will consider those necessary expenses. We \ndon't consider it necessary business expenses to export jobs. And we \nwill give them some additional help with a 20-percent credit.\n  This is what we should be doing: creating policies that encourage \nkeeping jobs in America. Make it in America. Yes, we can.\n  We are going to have a chance to bring this bill forward, and I hope \nmy colleagues will support it. Then let's try to move this bill \nquickly.\n  This is a pretty simple bill which does three things: It eliminates \nthe deduction for moving jobs overseas, it makes sure we have that \ndeduction if companies bring jobs back home, and we provide a credit as \npart of the cost to bring the jobs back home. It is very simple. Why \ndon't we keep it that way. Why don't we just pass this bill by itself \nand do something about creating jobs in America.\n  I say to my colleagues, this shouldn't be a partisan issue. We all \nknow we have to keep jobs in America. This is a simple bill. Let's get \nit done. Let's not confuse it or mix it with other issues. Let's show \nthe American people we can act in the best interests of our country.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                         Production Tax Credit\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I wish to commend my colleague \nfrom Maryland for his singleminded and crucial focus on jobs in \nAmerica. I rise to speak about another opportunity to produce in \nAmerica, and that has to do with harvesting of wind that we can do and \nkeep jobs in America.\n  I have been rising every day the Senate has been in session to talk \nabout the necessity of extending the production tax credit for wind \npower. And every day I come to the floor of the Senate to talk about a \ndifferent State and how important wind energy is to supporting economic \ngrowth and job creation in those individual States.\n  Today marks the 11th time I have come to the floor to urge all of \nus--all of my colleagues--to act by extending the PTC for wind. Today I \nam going to talk about my 9th State out of 50, and I just want to say, \nin case anybody's wondering, I am not tired yet. I am committed to \ncoming to the floor until Congress does what our constituents expect us \nto do; that is, to extend the production tax credit. It is simply that \nimportant.\n  If we fail to extend the PTC, our economy will suffer, jobs will be \nlost,\n\n[[Page S5177]]\n\nand our clean energy leadership will truly be in jeopardy when we look \nacross the world.\n  So where are we going to travel to today? We are going to the great \nState of Georgia. The wind industry in Georgia has quickly multiplied \nover the last few years. Nearly 1,000 wind energy jobs have been \ncreated. Equally important, there is real potential for significant \ncontinued growth.\n  I want to focus on ZF Wind, which invested nearly $100 million in a \nmanufacturing plant in the city of Gainesville, GA, which is located \nnortheast of Atlanta. This new plant will manufacture gearboxes for \nwind turbines, and that will bring several hundred good-paying jobs to \nGeorgia. ZF Wind is a German-based manufacturer. They made the decision \nto invest in Georgia and in America. So I just have to ask my \ncolleagues, if a foreign company can see the potential for wind energy \nin America, why can't we in the Senate? Do we really want to turn these \njobs away? If Congress does not decide to invest in America by \nextending the production tax credit, I have no doubt these jobs will be \nshipped back overseas.\n  If we continue to support the wind energy industry, ZF's gearboxes \nwill be shipped all over our country. In fact, in the interest of full \ndisclosure, I would say ZF is a major supplier of gearboxes for Vestas, \nwhich has a large manufacturing presence in my home State of Colorado. \nThe point I want to make is this is one small example of the wind \nenergy supply chain that is being built all over our country and \nextends in every direction.\n  Let me share another example of what is happening in Georgia. There \nis the small town of Tybee Island, which is located on the northeastern \ncoast of Georgia. If I have my geography right, that would be up in \nthis area, as shown on this map I have in the Chamber. They have taken \na stand to show how important wind energy is to their future.\n  In February, their city council passed a resolution recognizing the \nimportance of Georgia's onshore and offshore wind resources. Tybee \nIsland is saying: Look, let's encourage the development of wind energy \nprojects near our community and all over Georgia. They see that Georgia \nhas enough offshore wind potential to power over 1 million homes. One \nmillion homes could be powered solely from Georgia's offshore wind \npotential. That is significant.\n  We need--all of us all across our country; all of us elected \nofficials--to stand for the future of American manufacturing in energy. \nIt is an economic and environmental imperative, and the choice, \nfrankly, is stark. If we do not act, if we do not act to extend the \nproduction tax credit, and it expires, 37,000 jobs may be lost around \nour country. However, if we extend the PTC, conservative estimates \nsuggest 54,000 jobs would be created. That is the choice: job loss or \njob creation. I can tell you what I know the answer will be in \nColorado: Extend the PTC.\n  Without the PTC, foreign countries will extend their energy advantage \nover the United States. Manufacturing jobs that could be created here, \nthat should be created here, will go instead to China and other foreign \ncompetitors. There is simply no reason to do that. Instead, we need to \nextend the PTC.\n  The PTC equals jobs. We ought to pass it as soon as possible.\n  I want to end on this note. This is not a partisan issue. The \nproduction tax credit has long been a bipartisan idea. Senator Grassley \nfrom Iowa, our colleague who has served for many years in the Senate \nwith great distinction, supports this idea and brought the idea forth \nalmost 20 years ago, along with others.\n  Now more than ever the American people are asking us to take action \nand invest in clean, renewable made-in-America energy. Let's not let \nthe production tax credit be a casualty of election-year gridlock. Now \nis the time for us to do the right thing: Extend the PTC.\n  I am going to keep coming back until we do so. I am enjoying the tour \nof our great country, the United States of America. Every State has a \nwind energy stake in the future. Let's extend the wind PTC as soon as \npossible to protect American jobs before it is too late.\n  I thank the Acting President pro tempore and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio.) Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Koch Industries\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, Koch Industries is a company which is \nheadquartered in Wichita, KS, and is an American job creator that \nemploys 2,600 citizens of my State. The corporation, a longstanding \nU.S. manufacturing company, employs around 50,000 people with good-\npaying jobs across the country, including around 15,000 employees who \nare represented by unions.\n  Depending on the year, Koch Industries is either the first or second \nlargest privately held company in America, with about $100 billion in \nrevenues. I am pleased by its presence in our State, where the company \nand its owners are respected corporate citizens.\n  The Koch family, the owners of Koch Industries, has made a statewide \nimpact through foundations and charitable work which has given millions \nof dollars to help education of the poor, at-risk youth, the arts, and \nenvironmental causes.\n  The investments they make primarily go to Kansas and to Kansas \ncitizens. I am grateful this company has chosen to invest in our \nState's economy and its people. I am pleased they are a corporate \ncitizen of Kansas.\n  During the debate this week of the DISCLOSE Act, Koch Industries and \nits owners were mentioned numerous times. While I could come to the \nfloor and complain about the lack of balance, if we are having a debate \nabout the desirability of disclosing contributions to political causes, \ncertainly the debate I heard on the Senate floor, the rhetoric, was \nabout those who contribute to what are described as conservative \ncauses, free-market causes. I could come to the floor and complain \nabout the lack of balance in that discussion. But in my view, if we are \ngoing to have a discussion about the DISCLOSE Act, what we ought to all \nstand for is the opportunity for free speech, the opportunity for those \nof a variety of political points of view to be able to express those \nviews in the political process.\n  Those positions, the ability to do that--perhaps not the positions, \nbut the ability to promote your position ought to be something defended \nby all. We need more participation in American democracy, not less. In \nmy view, the discussion we had this week was a distraction from the \nreal issues our country faces, mostly related to the economy and job \ncreation. So rather than spending our time on the Senate floor \ndiscussing the DISCLOSE Act, in my view we should be on the Senate \nfloor creating policies that put in place those that Koch Industries \nhas shown in my State to create jobs rather than arguing about \npolitical contributions of those job creators.\n  I come to the floor today to suggest that, one, Koch Industries is a \ngreat corporate citizen of the State of Kansas, contributing in many \nways to the economy and to the well-being of our citizens; to suggest \nthat if we are going to have a debate about the DISCLOSE Act there be \nsome balance, and that those who believe in free speech and \nparticipation in democracy ought to always rise to the occasion to \ndefend those who engage in the political process; and finally to \nsuggest that rather than having a debate about the DISCLOSE Act, what \nwe should be doing is finding ways to replicate what the Founders and \nshareholders of Koch Industries have done in Kansas, the United States, \nand around the globe: create jobs for Americans in our country's \neconomy.\n  We are off track here. It is time for us to get back on track and to \nfocus on what matters, a growing economy, so we can help families \nacross America put food on their family's table, save for their kids' \neducation, save for their own retirement, and promote a free-\n\n[[Page S5178]]\n\nmarket enterprise system that does just that.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Bus Safety\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, because the Senator from Ohio is in \nthe chair, I wish to say that I am very pleased we have been able to \npass a bus safety bill that was in response to two tragic bus \naccidents, one in Ohio and one in Texas, and the many other bus \naccidents that have happened, because the buses that often transport \npeople in our country are not safe.\n  I think we have strengthened those safety regulations, working \ntogether, and I appreciate very much the effort the Senator from Ohio \nmade.\n\n\n                          Looming Fiscal Cliff\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the looming tax cliff that \nwill affect every American who pays taxes at the end of this year. The \nSenate must be clear with the American people about what our priorities \nare and where ownership of the money made by hard-working Americans \nbelongs. Does the money belong to the government to decide what will be \ndone with it--except for our responsibility to add to the things the \nFederal Government should do--or should that money belong to the people \nwho earned it? I think that is one of the key issues we are facing \nright now in this Congress, and most certainly in the campaign.\n  The American dream is that anyone--anyone--who is willing to work \nhard in this country can start from nothing and, through hard work and \nsacrifice, become a success. It is the defining characteristic of our \ncountry and it is what has made us a shining example for people all \nover the world. But that dream is under threat if, at the end of this \nyear, all of a sudden, because we don't address the major tax hikes \nthat will affect all Americans, that hard work and sacrifice will \nsimply result in giving a larger portion of people's paychecks to the \ngovernment. If we do not enact relief, every single person who pays \ntaxes will face an increase on January 1--every single person. Every \nperson will move into a higher bracket and face a higher rate of \ntaxation.\n  If we do not enact relief, small businesses will be hit with higher \ntaxes, entrepreneurship will be discouraged, owners will not invest in \ngrowing their businesses, and hiring will remain in a deep freeze. And \nthere can be no argument in this country that hiring is in a deep \nfreeze. We have had unemployment rates above 8 percent over the last \n3\\1/2\\ years. That is on the path to stagnation.\n  If we do not enact relief, marriage will be penalized at a greater \nrate than it is today. The marriage penalty, which is an issue that I \nhave championed since I was elected to the Senate, pushes people who \nare working and single and get married into a higher bracket. If two \nsingle people pay taxes on their own earnings, it is at a lower rate \nthan when they get married. One of the highest priorities I have had in \nthe Senate has been to relieve Americans from this punitive burden. \nAfter years of fighting for fairness, the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts \nincluded my bill as an amendment. It made great strides toward \neliminating the marriage penalty by lowering the tax rates, doubling \nthe standard deduction--which had not been the case before--and \nsimplifying other elements of the Tax Code. Prior to this tax relief, \nan estimated 25 million couples paid a penalty for being married--let's \nuse 1999--of approximately $1,400.\n  Along with doubling the standard deduction, we have been able to give \nrelief since 2001. But if we don't do something before the end of this \nyear, the marriage penalty will return, and we will not have doubling \nof the standard deduction.\n  Let's say a Houston policeman with a taxable income of $50,000 and a \nSan Antonio schoolteacher with a taxable income of $30,000 are getting \nmarried this year. How would their taxes compare if they were filing \njointly as a married couple or as two single taxpayers? For this year, \nfiling jointly as a married couple, they would save approximately $500 \nbecause we have marriage penalty relief. However, when the relief \nexpires at the end of this year, they would pay approximately $800 next \nyear, not save $500, because they are filing jointly as a married \ncouple. This is the time when they need the money the most--they are \nstarting a family, they would like to buy a house--yet we would \npenalize them for entering the institution of marriage. In this \neconomy, every dollar matters, and many households do rely on two \nincomes. So how is it that Congress has decided that we should penalize \npeople who are working extra hours, extra hard, to begin their lives as \na family?\n  My bill, S. 11, provides permanent relief by raising the standard \ndeduction for married couples, doubling it--when two single people get \nmarried, the standard deduction should double--increasing the 15-\npercent tax bracket for married joint filers to twice that of single \nfilers. That is very key because starting next year the 15-percent \nbracket is the people making the lowest amount who are paying taxes. So \nif we double it before they have to go into the next bracket, that is \ngoing to give them significant relief. We also extend the earned-income \ntax credit marriage penalty relief.\n  I offered my bill as an amendment last week, but we were not able to \nvote on amendments. So I am going to continue to offer this as an \namendment as we consider a myriad of options for tax relief for our \ncountrymen because if we don't do something by the end of the year, not \nonly are these taxes going to go into effect but many others. I urge my \ncolleagues to work with me on extending this relief.\n  We have an outsourcing bill that is going to be coming to the floor \nfor a vote today. We must create a job creators bill, which is what \nthis bill purports to do. It is very important, though, that we look at \nsome of the major issues facing corporations and small businesses, \nwhich are our job creators in many instances, and see what they really \nneed for relief.\n  Today we have the dubious honor in America of having the highest \ncorporate tax rate in the world. We used to be second, but just \nrecently Japan changed their corporate tax rate and lowered it so that \nthey would not have the confiscatory taxes that would discourage \nJapanese companies from investing in Japan. So now America has the \nhighest corporate tax rate in the world--at 35 percent. So on top of \npunishing businesses with that high tax rate, our homefront looks even \nless business-friendly when you consider the mountain of regulations, \nthe burdens of the President's new health care mandate, and the lack of \na long-term, comprehensive tax plan.\n  The bill the Senate is now considering would be another punitive \nattack on companies and will hamper business growth. Instead, with \nunemployment rates above 8 percent for 41 straight months, we should be \ndoing everything in our power to spur hiring in the private sector.\n  We need the President of the United States, the leader of the \ngreatest Nation on Earth, to recognize, respect, and encourage the job \ncreators who are investing in our country, which helps everyone get a \nshot at success. Unfortunately, last Friday the President shocked many \nAmericans with his comment, ``If you've got a business--you didn't \nbuild that. Somebody else made that happen.'' This highlighted the \nfundamental difference in the way the President and many in Congress \nview the hard work Americans put into achieving the American dream. The \nAmerican dream is that somebody can come to this country, they can \nstart with nothing, and they can build and work and sacrifice and give \ntheir kids a better chance than they had. That is why people have been \ncoming to this country.\n  My office received calls and letters from all over Texas when they \nheard the President's comment last week. I am going to give some \nexcerpts from one small business owner in Beaumont, TX.\n\n       I have to say that I am appalled by President Obama's \n     recent statement about small businesses not being responsible \n     for their own success. I am a small-business owner, and I can \n     assure you that I built the business from nothing. I sure \n     didn't get any government help. I gave my all to grow this \n     business. I was not given the idea or the plans for\n\n[[Page S5179]]\n\n     building a successful business. An idea, a dream, and a \n     risk--that's what mine and all of America's small businesses \n     have been built on.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       I put everything on the line, including my wife's wedding \n     ring. With over 20 years of hard work, my wife and I have \n     grown the company from four employees to over 40. When we \n     first began our venture, she worked a full-time job that \n     supplemented our income, while I ran the operation, and \n     together raised our children. Nobody did that for us, we \n     worked hard. We take pride in customer service and the \n     quality of our work as well as giving back to our community. \n     This has created customer loyalty and allowed us to expand, \n     not a government handout.\n\n  Our goal should be to spur growth, encourage hiring, and support the \nmillions of small businesses that serve as the backbone of our economy, \nnot to extinguish the entrepreneurial spirit and innovation that built \nthis country. It just doesn't seem as though our President relates. \nWhat built this country is innovation, taking risk, and \nentrepreneurship. We have established an education system, and at least \nwe used to have a regulatory system that encouraged business, that \nencouraged the private sector.\n  A few weeks before the President said that these small businesspeople \ndidn't do it on their own, he said, and I am paraphrasing here, ``You \nknow, the private sector isn't in trouble. It is the government sector \nthat is in trouble.'' Oh my gosh. You just think, ``Who is he talking \nto? Who is he relating to?'' because it is small businesspeople and big \nbusinesspeople and all businesspeople who are creating the jobs that \ncreate more jobs that make a vibrant economy. It isn't government. \nGovernment sometimes gets in the way and sometimes worse--it takes away \nfrom the vibrance of our economy.\n  So it is time for the leaders of our country--in Congress and in the \nWhite House--to get a perspective on who can create a vibrant economy. \nMy definition of ``who'' is not the government; it is the business \nsector and especially the small business sector because they are \ngrowing, and if they grow, they create jobs for more people.\n  I hope that this Congress at some point will start working on tax \nreform and relief from regulations and the oppressive health care \nsystem that is going to also have a major effect at the beginning of \nnext year and say: What can we do together to spur private sector \ngrowth that will create jobs in the private sector, that contributes to \nthe economy, not withdraws from it?\n  I only hope we can all pursue the American dream and be the leaders \nwho can make it happen for everyone.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter from which I read.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  Earth Analytical\n\n\n                                                Service, Inc.,\n\n                                      Beaumont, TX, July 17, 2012.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     U.S. Senator, Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison, I have to say that I am appalled by \n     President Obama's recent statement about small businesses not \n     being responsible for their own success. I am a small \n     business owner, and I can assure you that I built the \n     business from nothing. I sure didn't get any government help. \n     I gave my all to grow this business. I was not given the idea \n     or the plans for building a successful business.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            The DISCLOSE Act\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to address \nseveral issues. First, I would like to talk a little bit about the \nDISCLOSE Act.\n  Earlier this week we had two votes on whether to end debate on \nwhether to debate the DISCLOSE Act. The DISCLOSE Act is a very simple \nconcept, and it is that folks who make very large donations to the \npolitical system disclose who they are so the citizens of America can \nknow where that money is coming from. Is it coming from this particular \nsector or that particular sector? Is the group that is posing as Blue \nSkies for a Healthier America actually working to create dirty skies \nfor a less healthy America? Is the group that says it is for clean \nstreams actually a group that is trying to weaken the pollution control \nstandards and put more pollution into the streams?\n  Citizens have a right to know where the money is coming from in a \npublic discourse, especially very large contributions, because right \nnow what we have are folks who are putting in millions of dollars. I \nask you, how many Americans can put $1 million into a campaign? In the \nworld I live in, $100 is a lot of money. People can't connect that \nthere are folks out there who are saying they are going to put in $1 \nmillion, and they certainly can't connect with the folks out there who \nare saying: I am going to put $100 million in.\n  I think the Koch brothers have been bragging across this country \nabout how they are going to buy the elections so they can control where \nthis country heads. That is perhaps the most ill-conceived notion there \nis, but at least they are willing to stand in public and say what their \nplan is. At least they are willing to say: We are not going to hide and \ndo it secretly. They are going to tell us they are putting in their \nmoney. Now, where they put their money and whom that money is used to \nattack we may not know, so even in their case we need the DISCLOSE Act.\n  It is confounding that so many Members of this body argued for the \nfact that disclosure is the disinfectant, so many Members of this body \nargued that citizens have a right to know, so many Members of this body \nsaid this is fundamental to fair debate in a democracy, and then when \nthe time came to decide whether this would happen, they said: Oops. I \nam benefiting from this a lot. I guess I will set that principle aside \nand not argue for disclosure after all.\n  So we had two votes this week in which the outcome did not reach a \nsupermajority because we had individuals in this body who objected to a \nsimple majority vote to get to the bill. So we had to have a \nsupermajority under the arcane rules of this body, and we didn't get \nthat supermajority because we didn't have bipartisan support for \ndebating this issue.\n  I must say to my colleagues who voted against it, if they believe in \nthe debate in this society, they should at least say, yes, let's debate \nthe bill. Maybe they do not like the bill at the end, maybe they want \nto filibuster the bill at the end, but at least we should be discussing \nit. It is such a huge factor in this Nation.\n  There was a time not so long ago when we had the muckraker era, and \nthere were a series of articles that were written about how Senators in \nthis body--I believe it was 20 articles over 20 months--were owned by \ndifferent companies around this land. Those articles helped the \nAmerican public understand what was going on in this body, in this very \nChamber. The result was a constitutional amendment, a constitutional \namendment that shifted from indirect election of Senators to direct \nelection, to try to free the system in favor of ``We the people.''\n  When we came to this country, when our ancestors came to this country \nfrom overseas, they came from a system where wealth and power made all \nthe decisions. They did not have a voice. They came to America, and \nthey said we want to do it differently. We want to have a voice. The \nfirst three words of the Constitution captured that, ``We the \npeople''--not we the rich and powerful who write the rules but ``We the \npeople'' will decide how we are governed.\n\n[[Page S5180]]\n\n  The Citizens United decision of the Supreme Court, which allows \nunlimited secret oceans of money being spent with no identification, \ngoes completely against ``We the people.'' It is going to be up to this \nChamber to wrestle with this idea. That is why we should be on the \nDISCLOSE Act right now. We should be debating the impact. We should be \ndebating the history of Montana.\n  One hundred years ago, folks in Montana said our State is ruled by \nthe copper kings and we are tired of we the rich and powerful setting \nrules and we are going to take it back because we believe in ``We the \npeople,'' we believe in our Constitution. So they changed the rules in \ntheir State and our supreme court just a couple weeks ago gave them a \n100th anniversary present, which was to strike down ``We the people'' \nin Montana, with no debate. The supreme court, five justices, said we \ndon't want to have any information about how Montana politics were \ncorrupted by vast pools of money. We don't want to know that history. \nWe do not want to know how the people of that State, exercising their \npower as a State, reclaimed their democracy for the ordinary person. \nThey put their hands over their eyes, they put their hands over their \nears, and they said: We summarily decide against this case, against \nMontana, taking no evidence.\n  That is a dark moment for our supreme court. It follows on from the \ndramatically terrible decision of Citizens United. We must debate those \nissues on the floor of this Senate.\n  There are folks here who like to say in the tradition that the Senate \nis the world's greatest deliberative body. Then let's deliberate. Let's \nnot vote against even having a conversation about some of the most \nmonumental issues of our age.\n  This is a conversation that must continue. We must wrestle with how \nto honor the very premise at the heart of our Constitution, at the \nheart of our Republic, and not have ``We the people'' crossed off, out \nof the Constitution.\n  I turn to another issue; that is, the bill that is on the floor right \nnow, the Bring Jobs Home Act. We have a manufacturing sector in crisis \nin America. Since the year 2000, America has lost about 5 million \nmanufacturing jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and \nmore than 42,000 factories. Today, America has only about the same \nnumber of workers employed in manufacturing as we did in 1941, more \nthan 70 years ago. My home State of Oregon has been hit particularly \nhard. This trend, the loss of manufacturing jobs, strikes at the heart \nof the middle class because these are often living-wage jobs. These are \nfull-time jobs. These are jobs with benefits. They provide a foundation \nfor our families to succeed, a foundation for families to raise their \nchildren so the children will have opportunity and promise.\n  Put simply, if we do not make products in America, we will not have \nthe middle class in America. We can see the middle class shrinking year \nby year, right now, as we lose our manufacturing base. These jobs are \nnot disappearing into thin air. Yes, some factories shut down because \nof the consolidation and some jobs are limited due to automation \nstreamlining. But in most cases, those jobs are still there; they are \njust not in America, not in Oregon. Indeed, those jobs have gone \noverseas.\n  China has a four-tier industrial policy that says we are going to put \npeople to work here even if we violate the WTO agreement we have with \nthe United States of America. That is a huge problem that we should, in \na bipartisan effort, fully address.\n  Today, I would like share a couple letters from people who are in the \nfrontline of the disappearance of manufacturing jobs. Virginia, from \nthe city of Hillsboro in my State, wrote:\n\n       In February 2010, my department at my company was advised \n     we would be laid off after transitioning our job duties to a \n     replacement staff in India.\n       It felt like quite a blow. I had been there the shortest \n     time at 10 years, the longest person there was 35 years. Half \n     of our department was laid off within a few months, the rest \n     of us sweated every Friday wondering when we would receive \n     our lay off dates. We were finally all let go on March 11th, \n     2011.\n       Four months after my layoff, my husband was advised the \n     rest of his department is being laid off after their job \n     duties were transitioned to an off-shore site. My daughter, \n     myself, and my husband are all looking for work.\n       We have four generations living in our home--I have no idea \n     what will happen to all of us if none of us can find work. My \n     husband served his time in the Army and he and I have always \n     worked full-time, steady jobs, it feels like we're being \n     punished for spending our lives working to take care of our \n     family and keep a roof over our heads.\n       Americans need jobs! We want to work and need to work! We \n     are not lazy, instead we are innovators and always have been! \n     We need to regain our pride in our country, help each other \n     and quit focusing on greed.\n       My mother reminded me that just 25 short years ago, it \n     would have been considered un-American to take a job from an \n     American and send it to a person in another country. People \n     would stop doing business with any company who did choose to \n     do so. I'm mentioning this to state there's been a definite \n     change of the way businesses are run, which isn't all bad. \n     Technology and business processes change. The problem is, the \n     bottom line has become more important than the health of \n     America and its citizens and that, I believe, is the cause of \n     our current woes.\n       I love my country and want it back!!! I'll admit I'm tired \n     of giving our money, resources, and jobs to other countries \n     while American's lose their jobs, their homes, and their \n     security. Please help.\n\n  Duwayne writes from St. Helens:\n\n       I worked at an Oregon high-tech company for 15 years, until \n     I was laid off during the middle of the Bush depression. When \n     I joined, the company had over 18,000 employees--most of them \n     in Oregon. These were high-paid professionals and assembly \n     workers with family-wage jobs.\n       When I was laid off the company employed only about 4,500 \n     people--still mostly in the US, and mostly in Oregon. But \n     today the company has moved virtually all its manufacturing \n     to China, and their software engineering to India. Even \n     though the company payroll is growing, the number of \n     employees in the US continues to shrink. Almost all the new \n     jobs are in foreign countries.\n       You want to know where all the jobs went? I'll tell you. \n     They went to Mexico and China. That's because our government \n     policies are aimed at helping corporations, and have little \n     to no regard for American workers.\n       Companies like these need to be harshly penalized for \n     moving their jobs overseas--but instead they are rewarded, \n     and American workers pay the price.\n\n  The policies we are talking about on the floor are all about the \nissues Virginia and Duwayne are talking about. The bill ends rewards \nfor outsourcing jobs overseas. Currently, a company can deduct the \nmoving expenses of offshoring and actually save money on their tax that \nway. That would end. If a company wants to move a factory overseas, we \ncannot stop them, but we should not give them tax breaks to do so. I \nwould love to be in a forum of hundreds of people and I would ask this \nquestion: Do any of you love the idea that under the Bush \nadministration, we started subsidizing the shipment of jobs overseas?\n  I can tell you virtually no one would say they love that policy \nbecause the jobs in America mean so much to our families.\n  The second thing this bill does is it creates new tax credits to \nreward businesses that bring jobs home. If a company wants to take a \nproduction line from overseas and move it back to the United States, \nlet's help them pay for the moving expenses.\n  This spring I went on a tour called ``Made In Oregon,'' a tour of \nmanufacturing in my home State. It was spectacular to see how many cool \nthings were being made. In Bend, OR, AE Solar Energy is building \ninverters for solar energy on roofs and putting that power into the \nelectric grid. Bike Friday in Eugene is doing specialty, made-to-order, \nthe best folding bikes. Ordering over the Internet, they are shipping \ntheir best folding bikes all over our globe. Kinro West RV Windows in \nPendleton and Pendleton Woolen Mills had two very different types of \nmanufacturing: Woolen mills, they go back a century, and then an RV \nwindow manufacturer that is playing a key role in our recreational \nbusiness and providing these windows to manufacturers throughout the RV \nworld, the recreational vehicle world.\n  Then there is Oregon Iron Works. Oregon Iron Works is building \ntrolley cars. We are building streetcars in America again so cities \nputting in streetcars can buy an American-made product. They are \nbuilding a prototype of a wave buoy that will generate energy as it \nbobs up and down in the waves off the Oregon coast. That is going to go \ndown the river and be installed later this year, and perhaps it will \nlead the way for a new source of clean, renewable energy.\n  Vigor Industrial is building barges. Greenbrier is building railroad \ncars.\n\n[[Page S5181]]\n\nThese are the jobs, the companies that are the heart of living-wage \njobs and making products in America. We must do all we can to support \nthem.\n  Let's end the subsidies for shipping jobs overseas. Let's instead \nprovide incentives and support for moving jobs back to the United \nStates, to the benefit of our economy and the benefit of our families. \nI strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill and help bring jobs \nback to Oregon and back to America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Stephen R. Covey\n\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I rise today to honor an extraordinary \nAmerican from the great State of Utah--the world-renowned author and \nspeaker Stephen R. Covey, who passed away on Monday, July 16, 2012. He \nwas regarded as a legendary thought-leader throughout the global \nbusiness community yet showed over the course of his 79 years that the \ntrue measure of life is not in making a dollar, but in making a \ndifference.\n  Stephen leaves behind a legacy filled with meaningful words and \nmemorable deeds. His prolific and powerful writing contained the kind \nof personal insight and inspiration that transformed the hearts, minds \nand lives of countless individuals. He is best remembered for his 1989 \nNew York Times best seller, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective \nPeople. The book sold more than 20 million copies worldwide and has \nbeen translated into 38 different languages. Seven Habits served to \nprove Stephen's passionate belief that talking about principles changes \nbehavior better than talking about behavior changes behavior.\n  Ever the teacher and ever the student of strategies for achieving \npersonal and professional excellence, Stephen followed his pursuit of \nthese life-changing principles in subsequent books including First \nThings First, The 8th Habit, and The Leader in Me. Covey's words, \nideas, principles and practices have been used in a variety of \neducational settings, from college management classes to corporate \nbusiness seminars. In 2011, Time magazine listed Seven Habits as one of \nthe 25 most influential business management books of all time.\n  While Covey's words propelled him to become a global titan of bold \nbusiness strategies and tactics, it was his deeds, often in family \nsettings, which provided the notably personal touch found in his \nteaching and training. His poignant examples and anecdotes from his \npersonal life illuminated how to actually live the principles he \ntaught. Covey often shared a humorous experience he had with one of his \nsons when taking a business call at home. His son felt that Stephen had \nbeen on the phone for far too long, so he took out a jar of peanut \nbutter and began spreading it on Covey's balding head. Covey pretended \nto ignore it, so the son added a layer of jam and eventually a piece of \nbread. Stephen used this experience to teach the principles of proper \npriorities, life balance, and building relationships. He demonstrated \nit was possible to complete an important phone call, indulge his son's \nmischievous antics, and create a meaningful memory.\n  One of his best known principles, Sharpen the Saw, focused on the \nneed for rest and renewal. Covey stressed the important impact of \nfamily dinners, family vacations, family service in the community, and \nfamilies working together at home. He recalled ``work parties'' in \nwhich his whole family would tackle a project. Instead of just laboring \nfor hours, they would laugh and talk and eat snacks while they worked \nand then go to a movie once they finished. Stephen continually showed \nthat when you put your family first you can create a legacy that will \ntruly last. His deeds as a father, husband, neighbor, and friend are \nthe kind that communities, States, and nations would do well to promote \nand emulate.\n  Covey's contributions to the leadership community extend far beyond \nhis literary works. He revolutionized the field of leadership and \nmanagement development with the creation of the Covey Leadership Center \nin Utah. The Covey Leadership Center eventually merged with Franklin \nQuest to form FranklinCovey, a worldwide management firm specializing \nin training and consulting services for individuals, teams and \nbusinesses. His extensive client list includes a vast majority of the \nFortune 500 companies, world leaders, celebrities, national \ngovernments, and numerous charitable organizations. In 1996, Time \nmagazine named him one of the 25 most influential Americans, and in \n2011 Thinkers50 named him one of the top 50 business leaders in the \nworld.\n  He was an inspiration to millions, a revolutionary problem solver, \nand an icon for business managers everywhere. It is impossible to \ncalculate the immense amount of good that Stephen Covey did for so many \npeople. His insight helped to shape the future of an untold number of \nbusinesses, resulting in better jobs and indeed better lives for people \naround the world. Stephen Covey's life mission is reflected in the \nmission of FranklinCovey: ``We Enable greatness in people and \norganizations everywhere.'' Stephen Covey's words and deeds helped \npeople discover and deploy the principles that would ultimately enable \nthem to achieve greatness in life and in business.\n  My wife Sharon and I extend our thoughts and prayers to the family \nand friends of Stephen Covey. His wife Sandra, his 9 children, 52 \ngrandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren have a tremendous legacy to \ncherish and follow. Stephen taught his family and indeed the world that \n``to live, to love, to learn and to leave a legacy'' is what life is \nall about. We honor his memory, celebrate his service and recognize \nthat while his presence will be missed, his principles and practices \nwill live on for generations to come.\n  No words of tribute to Stephen Covey could be complete without a \nchallenge to do something, to produce personal deeds that match the \nwords and the principles he loved and lived. So I conclude this tribute \nwith a challenge for each of us to remember: We honor best those who \nhave gone before by living our lives with excellence today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent following \nmy remarks that the Senator from Nevada be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I rise because too many elected \nofficials, too many pundits, editorial writers, elite economists, and \nleaders of big corporations have simply gotten too comfortable and too \nused to sending American jobs overseas. We have seen outsourcing time \nand again from the U.S. Olympic Committee's decision to crown our \nNation's top athletes with a ``Made in China'' beret to leaders of \nAmerican companies far too eager to cash in and shutter U.S. \nmanufacturing plants and open doors to cheaper labor in foreign \ncountries. They don't just have a cheap labor advantage, they also have \nweak environmental rules, nonexistent or nonenforced labor laws, \nsubsidies for currency, energy, land, and for capital.\n  In other words, in some sense, in this whole Olympic debacle, with \nhundreds of American athletes at the opening ceremonies in London, the \nU.S. Olympic Committee has simply said: We will give the gold medal to \nChina for cheating.\n  In far too many cases, U.S. investors and executives have gotten \nricher at the largest companies while U.S. workers in places such as \nHamilton, Youngstown, Lorain, Lima, and Solon, OH, struggle to make \nends meet. That is why I am here with a simple message: Let's replace \noutsourcing with insourcing. Let's see the ``Made in America'' label \nsewn into the blazers that Members of Congress wear and on football \nhelmets worn by our student athletes.\n  I am wearing a suit made by union labor in Cleveland, OH, today. \nLet's see the letters ``U.S.A.'' stamped in every steel beam used in \nour country and the armored steel purchased by our U.S. Armed Forces. \nWe must encourage companies to return to the United States and \ndiscourage them from ever leaving.\n  Right now we have it backward. Our Tax Code is upside down. As it \nstands, businesses can classify moving personnel and company components \nto a foreign country as a business expense and therefore deduct the \ncost of offshoring from their taxes. So when a plant moves from \nYoungstown to Beijing, when a plant moves from\n\n[[Page S5182]]\n\nFreemont to Shihan, when a plant moves from Toledo to Wuhan, that \ncompany can deduct those moving expenses on its taxes and get a tax \nbreak for moving overseas. Combined with our outdated trade policy, \nwith PNTR with China and no real reporting requirements and even fewer \nenforcement rules and mechanisms, the current American tax law \nencourages companies to move jobs offshore, where labor is cheap and \nenvironmental and health standards are weak.\n  We saw a decade of manufacturing job loss. From 2000 to 2010, we lost \nmore than 5 million manufacturing jobs in our country. One-third of our \nmanufacturing jobs disappeared from 2000 to 2010. Fortunately, in part, \nbecause of the auto rescue which was such a resounding success in Ohio, \nfor instance, we have seen a 500,000 manufacturing job increase in the \nlast 2 years. We know what happens with manufacturing job loss. It can \ndestroy a family which had a decent wage and then can't find a job with \nany kind of decent wage. It weakens communities and undermines the tax \nbase. It means police, firefighters, librarians, mental health \ncounselors, and teachers get laid off.\n  But now the manufacturing sector is turning around. As I said, over \nthe last 2 years, our country, led by the revitalization of the auto \nindustry, is beginning to manufacture jobs. It is clear why our country \nand why my State of Ohio are good places to do business. We have a \nfirst-class workforce, a strong network of colleges and universities, \nand manufacturing know-how that is second to none.\n  Not only that, companies are returning to the United States because \nof higher costs associated with doing business abroad, whether that be \ntransportation costs, higher wages in places such as China, and the \nlegal difficulties of doing business overseas. We are seeing some \nreturn, but unfortunately it is more anecdotal and not extensive \nenough. We obviously have to keep looking ahead and make more of it \nhappen. That is the good news.\n  In Ohio, we see more and more evidence that demonstrates how \ncompanies are beginning to move operations back to the United States. \nFor instance, Apex Sports, based in Zanesville in eastern Ohio, \nproduces softballs with an engineered foam core. They were once made in \nChina. Apex Sports now makes its softballs in the United States. They \ngot their start at the Muskingum County Business Incubator, which I \nvisited not too long ago.\n  Roesweld Equipment is a small exporter in Columbus that now makes its \nproducts in Ohio rather than China. Columbus-based Priority Designs \nmanufactures dsolv, a compostable netting bagging system for yard \nwaste. Its product is now made in the United States but was previously \nproduced in Asia. We can do more to get Americans back to work. It \nmakes plain sense to put U.S. tax dollars back into the U.S. economy. \nThe U.S. tax dollars pay for some products such as American flags that \nfly over our post offices, outfits for a Federal agency, any kind of \nproducts bought by taxpayers and by the government. It makes sense on \nevery level that those products be made in the United States.\n  Let me tell you about a 22-year-old family-owned company in Akron \ncalled American Made Bags. They are making bags for Olympians and the \nArmy National Guard. They are making them here in America. Why \nshouldn't our national policies support American companies and support \nAmerican workers? The Bring Jobs Home Act, sponsored by Senator \nStabenow and many others, makes two commonsense changes in our tax \nlaws. It is a carrot-and-stick approach. It gives a tax credit that any \nbusiness can use against their overall tax liability for costs \nassociated with moving a production line, such as a trade or business \nlocated outside the country, back into the United States. That is the \nopposite of what we do now.\n  By providing this tax credit, we give incentives to companies to \nreshore and bring back jobs that might have been moved abroad earlier \nto places such as China, Mexico or India. In 2006 alone, U.S. \nmanufacturers claimed $45 billion in foreign tax credit--a huge \nfinancial advantage to companies that have sent jobs to China, Mexico, \nand India.\n  Instead of promoting job growth, U.S. tax policy rewards those \ncompanies for outsourcing. That is why we need to end the backward \npractices that allow businesses to deduct from their taxes the cost of \nshipping jobs overseas. We need to turn our Tax Code right side up when \nit comes to U.S. jobs by promoting their creation and discouraging \ntheir elimination. That is what the business bill does, and it is about \ntime.\n  One of the things that happened out of the auto rescue is a bit of an \nuntold story. It has to do with an assembly plant in Toledo, OH, where \nthe Wrangler and Liberty are put together. Prior to the auto rescue, \nonly 50 percent of the components at the Chrysler Jeep plant were made \nin the United States. Today, 75 percent of those components are made in \nthe United States. The glass comes out of Crestline and the seats come \nfrom Northwood. Much of the rest of the Jeep Wrangler comes from \nsuppliers in Ohio and Michigan. Those are American jobs, and it is a \nhuge increase in American jobs when we consider three-fourths of those \ncomponents are made in the United States, when only 3 years ago it was \nhalf those components.\n  Those Jeeps are selling, as is the Chevy Cruze that is made in \nYoungstown, OH. The components come from Ohio, Michigan and others \nStates and manufacturing plants. It makes a huge difference in building \na middle-class society.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Senator Heller pertaining to the introduction of S. \n3405 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HELLER. Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor. I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, today the Senate is considering \nlegislation to end tax breaks included in our own Internal Revenue Code \nthat actually help companies that want to ship American jobs overseas. \nThe Bring Jobs Home Act provides not only a tax credit to encourage \ncompanies to move jobs back to the United States, but it would end \nthose tax breaks that help companies ship jobs overseas.\n  Offshoring of American jobs has hurt the middle class and it \ncontinues to be a real problem. There is no good reason we should \ncontinue giving companies an incentive to offshore good American jobs.\n  We can address high unemployment by encouraging companies to bring \njobs back to the United States, and the tax credits in this bill will \nhelp to reverse the trend and put Americans back to work. In fact, this \nincentive could help bring 2 million to 3 million jobs back to the \nUnited States, according to some economic estimates. So I hope all of \nour colleagues will support this bill.\n  I also wish to take a few minutes to talk about another way that I \nthink we in the Senate and in Congress could work together in a \nbipartisan way to create jobs and help the economy. Today I filed an \namendment, along with Senator Portman from Ohio, that provides us with \na great opportunity to create jobs in America. This amendment is the \ntext of S. 1000. It is the Energy Savings and Industrial \nCompetitiveness Act, which is a bipartisan bill sponsored by Senator \nPortman and myself that will create a national energy efficiency \nstrategy for the United States.\n  Energy efficiency is the cheapest and fastest way to improve our \nNation's energy infrastructure and our economy's energy independence. \nIt is also something we can all agree on. Whether we are from the \nNortheast, as I am in New Hampshire, from the South, from the West--all \nof us can benefit from energy efficiency.\n  What our bill would do, which is the amendment we filed today, is \ncreate jobs for our workers, lower energy costs for consumers, and make \nbusinesses more competitive. In fact, a recent study by the American \nCouncil for\n\n[[Page S5183]]\n\nan Energy Efficient Economy concluded that our bill would create almost \n80,000 jobs and save consumers $4 billion by 2020.\n  Also, S. 1000 has broad support on both sides of the aisle. It passed \nout of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee with an 18-to-\n3 vote. In addition, there is a large and diverse group of industry, \nenergy efficiency, and environmental stakeholders who have endorsed the \nbill. That list includes the Chamber of Commerce, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the Alliance to Save Energy, the National \nResources Defense Council, Best Buy, and the Environmental Defense Fund \njust to name a few of the organizations on the list.\n  Anytime we can get organizations as diverse as the ones I just listed \nto endorse one piece of legislation, it is clear there is broad \nbipartisan support for the effort. This legislation contains a broad \npackage of low-cost and effective tools to reduce barriers for \nbusinesses, homeowners, and consumers who want to adopt off-the-shelf \ntechnologies, so we don't have to wait for something to happen in order \nfor the bill to make a difference. These are all efforts that will help \nconsumers, businesses, and homeowners save money.\n  This is an easy first step to make our economy more competitive and \nour Nation more secure while still meeting pent-up demand for these \nenergy-saving technologies from individuals and business alike.\n  The American public is desperately looking for Congress to work in a \nbipartisan way on policies to spur growth and create jobs. Energy \nefficiency legislation represents our best chance to achieve both of \nthose goals this year.\n  We need to get some energy legislation to the floor. I have had the \ngreat opportunity to work for the last 4 years with Senator Jeff \nBingaman and Senator Lisa Murkowski, the chair and ranking members of \nthe Energy Committee. We have done some great work in our committee. We \npassed significant pieces of bipartisan legislation out of the \ncommittee. In fact, there are 15 pieces of legislation that have been \npassed and all but one of those with strong bipartisan votes. Those \npieces of legislation are just sitting in committee because we have not \nbeen able to get an agreement to bring them to the floor.\n  We can get an energy efficiency policy in place. We can pass this \nlegislation. That kind of an energy efficiency policy would be one that \nenhances our national security, addresses our energy needs, and puts \nAmericans back to work. We can do it in this Congress if we can bring \nthe Shaheen-Portman energy bill to the Senate floor for a vote. That is \nwhat this amendment would do. I hope we have that opportunity.\n  Thank you very much, Madam President. I yield the floor and note the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, today we are debating a bill called the \nBring Jobs Home Act. We live in serious times. We have a debt fast \napproaching $16 trillion, millions remain out of work, and economic and \njob growth has slowed to a crawl. Times such as these demand serious \neconomic answers. So it is important that we all understand the utter \nlack of seriousness of this proposal. The only things serious about the \nBring Jobs Home Act are its flaws.\n  The Bring Jobs Home Act would deny the deduction for ordinary and \nnecessary business expenses to the extent that such expenses were \nincurred for outsourcing; that is, to the extent an employer incurred \ncosts in relocating a business unit from the United States to outside \nthe United States, the employer would be disallowed a deduction for any \nof the business expenses associated with such outsourcing.\n  The Bring Jobs Home Act would also create a new tax credit for \ninsourcing; that is, if a company relocated a business unit from \noutside the United States to inside the United States, the business \nwould be allowed a tax credit equal to 20 percent of the costs \nassociated with such insourcing.\n  On the surface, this proposal might sound reasonable. As sound bites \ngo, the President's reelection campaign and the Senate Democratic \nleadership have apparently decided they can make some political hay \nwith this proposal, but as substantive tax policy goes, this proposal \nis a joke.\n  First of all, the amount of money involved is trifling. According to \nthe nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, this bill's deduction \ndisallowance provision will only raise about $14 million per year. That \nis $14 million, not billion with a ``b,'' it is million with an ``m.'' \nLet's put that in perspective. This bill is supposedly a critical tax \nincentive to create jobs here in the United States. Yet, according to \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee, it will only \nraise about $14 million per year in this multitrillion-dollar economy. \nMeanwhile, President Obama's campaign has now spent $24 million on ads \nattacking his opponent and attacking what he considers to be \noutsourcing, which his opponent has not done.\n  The American people want us to address our fiscal situation and to \ncreate the conditions for robust economic and job growth. And how are \nthe President and Senate Democrats spending their time? Advancing a \nproposal that raises less money in 1 year than the amount the \nPresident's campaign has spent attacking Republicans on this topic on \ntelevision. If Democrats meant this as a serious revenue raiser for the \ngovernment, we would all be better off if the Obama campaign had simply \nsent its $24 million to the Treasury Department for disbursement to \ninsourcers rather than spend it on ads attacking American global \nbusinesses. And I think the President might get more credit for that.\n  Simply put, this bill is misleading. Its supporters would have you \nbelieve that under current law there is some special deduction that \nexists for moving jobs outside of the United States of America. That is \nsimply false. Rather, there has always been a deduction allowed for a \nbusiness's ordinary and necessary expenses, and expenses associated \nwith moving have always been regarded as deductible business expenses. \nSo allowing a deduction for these expenses is not a special thing, it \nis the rule. Disallowing this deduction would be the exception, an \nextraordinary deviation from current tax policy.\n  Yesterday I heard my friends from the other side say we need to end a \ntax deduction for jobs that a business sends overseas.\n  I have a letter from the Joint Committee on Taxation, addressed to \nthe bill's authors, that includes an analysis of their bill and a \nscore. I ask unanimous consent to have a copy of the letter printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                  Joint Committee on Taxation,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Bill Pascrell,\n     House of Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow and Mr. Pascrell: This letter is in \n     response to your request of June 5, 2012, for an estimate of \n     the revenue impacts of the ``Bring Jobs Home Act'' (S. 2884/\n     H.R. 5542). This bill provides a 20-percent tax credit for \n     eligible expenses associated with relocating business units \n     from overseas and disallows a deduction for business expenses \n     associated with relocating business units to foreign \n     countries.\n       Under present law, there are no specific tax credits or \n     disallowances of deductions solely for locating jobs in the \n     United States or overseas. Deductions generally are allowed \n     for all ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred by \n     the taxpayer during the taxable year in carrying on any trade \n     or business, which includes the relocation of business units.\n       Under the proposal, corporations would be granted a credit \n     equal to 20 percent of the expenses associated with the \n     relocation of business units from a foreign country to within \n     the United States. In order to qualify for the credit, the \n     firm must increase its domestic employment when compared to \n     the year prior to the first taxable year in which eligible \n     insourcing expenses were paid or incurred. Corporations also \n     would be disallowed from taking a deduction for expenses \n     associated with the relocation of business units from within \n     the United States to a foreign country.\n       In estimating this proposal, we assume that there will be a \n     behavioral response in how firms classify their \n     reorganization expenses in order to maximize their expenses\n\n[[Page S5184]]\n\n     eligible for the insourcing credit and to minimize their \n     disallowed deductions associated with the outsourcing credit.\n       The following estimate provides the effect of this proposal \n     on Federal fiscal year budget receipts. This estimate assumes \n     a date of enactment of July 1, 2012, and that the proposal is \n     effective for all expenses paid or incurred after the date of \n     enactment.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                          Fiscal years, in millions of dollars\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                     Item                       2012    2013    2014    2015    2016    2017    2018    2019    2020    2021    2022   2012-17   2012-22\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nProvide a 20 percent credit for expenses          -3     -21     -21     -22     -23     -24     -26     -27     -28     -29     -31      -115      -255\n associated with insourcing jobs............\nDisallow deduction for expenses associated         2      14      14      14      15      16      17      18      18      19      20        76       168\n with outsourcing jobs......................\n    Total...................................      -1      -7      -7      -8      -8      -8      -9      -9     -10     -10     -10       -39      -87\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNOTE: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.\n\n       I hope this information is helpful to you. If we can be of \n     further assistance in this matter, please let me know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Thomas A. Barthold.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Paragraph two of the letter says, and I quote:\n\n       Under present law, there are no specific tax credits or \n     disallowances of deductions solely for locating jobs in the \n     United States or overseas. Deductions generally are allowed \n     for all ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred by \n     the taxpayer during the taxable year in carrying on any trade \n     or business, which includes the relocation of business units.\n\n  Now, perhaps my friends on the other side take issue with a \ndescription of tax policy from Congress's nonpartisan official \nscorekeeper. Well, if they do, I invite them--or the President, for \nthat matter--to show me the provision of the Internal Revenue Code that \ncontains a special deduction for shipping jobs overseas.\n  Let me just mention that this is the Internal Revenue Code I have in \nmy hand. It is getting so big you can hardly handle it. Maybe Joint Tax \nand I are wrong, so I will keep the Tax Code right at my desk, and if \none of my friends wants to leaf through the Code and show me the \nsection that provides a special deduction for shipping jobs overseas, I \nwill stand corrected.\n  They cannot. It is not in here, this huge conglomerated mess that we \nwould like to reform, which will not be reformed until there is a \nchange in administration.\n  This administration is in the habit of pointing fingers every which \nway, blaming everyone but themselves for our weak economy and pathetic \njob growth. Just the other day the Treasury Secretary blamed Europe and \nrising oil prices for our economic slowdown. Yet he did not discuss the \npall of uncertainty that Democratic politicians, including his boss, \nare putting over the economy with their refusal to extend the 2001 and \n2003 tax relief unless they get their way on tax increases for small \nbusinesses.\n  According to an analysis by the American Action Forum, the fiscal \ncliff facing American taxpayers is now twice the size of total GDP \ngrowth this year. If we drive over this fiscal cliff, as the President \nand Senate Democratic leadership are now threatening, the likelihood \nthat small businesses will hire will decrease by 18 percent, and the \neffective marginal tax rate for many workers and small businesses will \ngo over 50 percent.\n  At least in part, and I would say in significant part, is the \ncomplete failure to provide certainty and progrowth tax policies to \nAmerica's families and businesses that is dragging our economy down. \nProposals such as the one before the Senate today are not helping \neither. They increase uncertainty for the businesses that will grow our \neconomy and hire new workers.\n  It is another example of the Obama administration's ``Washington-\nknows-best philosophy.'' Disallowing the business expense deduction \nmeans income will now be measured less accurately. Gross receipts minus \nbusiness expenses equals income. That is what both accountants and \neconomists tell us. But even through economists, accountants and \nbusinesses all measure income one way, Washington will now measure it \nanother way. Not only is this bad for business, but by disallowing \ndeductions for certain business expenses, this proposal would measure \nincome less accurately.\n  When the government's main source of revenue is income tax, it is \nrather important to measure income accurately. Ultimately, we know this \nbill is devoid of serious content because it is the product of \npolitical, not economic necessity. This bill is a sound bite, not sound \ntax policy. There really are not a lot of dots to connect.\n  Really, the genesis of this bill's prioritization can be traced in a \nstraight line from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to the President's \nreelection headquarters in Chicago. This bill is called the Bring Jobs \nHome Act, but its Democratic proponents have not presented any evidence \nof the number of jobs, if any, that will return to America if the \nproposal becomes law.\n  During comments in support of the bill, the sponsor referred to a \nchart that said, ``[i]n the last decade, 2.4 million jobs were shipped \noverseas.'' But the sponsor tellingly did not say the bill will bring \n2.4 million jobs back to America. The proponents of this bill have not \neven told us that jobs will return to America if this bill becomes law, \nmuch less how many jobs. The answer is probably none.\n  That is exactly the sort of question we would have explored had this \nbill been produced by the Senate Finance Committee rather than by some \ncampaign consultant in Chicago. The Senate Finance Committee would have \nheld hearings, we would have talked to the experts, and we would have \nlooked at comments on both sides of the issue. Then we would probably \nhave had a markup. It could have been brought to the floor with full \nFinance Committee support--except we would never pass a bill such as \nthis in the Finance Committee, in my eyes. Well, not with any real good \nintent.\n  It is disappointing that even though the sponsor of this bill is a \nmember of the Senate Finance Committee, the bill's sponsor chose to \nbypass that committee. This bill has come straight to the Senate floor \nwithout being vetted by the committee. Her colleagues on the committee \nwould likely have had some valuable feedback for her. Both staffs on \nthe committee would likely have had valuable expertise they could have \nbrought to bear on this proposal. That is why I anticipate moving to \ncommit this bill to the Senate Finance Committee.\n  How does this bill fit with tax reform? Many on the other side say \nthey want tax reform. I think it is fair to say there is a consensus \nthat tax reform means getting rid of tax expenditures so as to decrease \ntax rates. The mantra is broaden the base and lower the rates, but this \nproposal would create new tax expenditures. It would narrow the base.\n  Another major goal of tax reform is simplification, but this proposal \nwould make the tax laws even more complicated. This proposal is the \nantithesis of true tax reform. Rather than coming up with more sticks \nto punish American businesses that compete globally, as this proposal \ndoes, we should be coming up with more carrots to encourage American \nbusinesses as well as foreign businesses to make America a more \nattractive place to expand, hire, and invest. Of course, the best way \nto do that, consistent with free-market principles, would be to lower \nthe corporate tax rate.\n  By creating new tax expenditures, as this act would do, it becomes \nall the more difficult to lower the corporate tax rate. If we want \nbusinesses to locate and hire in the United States, then we need to do \nwhat we can to make sure they are glad they are incorporated in the \nUnited States and that their headquarters is in the United States.\n  As it stands right now, because of our worldwide tax regime, many \nglobal corporations have their parent company in the United States as a \nmatter of historical accident. If they had to do it all over again, \nthey very well might decide to incorporate elsewhere in the world. The \nway to address that, the way to make sure the United States is the \nplace that global businesses want to incorporate is to transition our \ncurrent worldwide system of taxation to a territorial tax system.\n\n[[Page S5185]]\n\n  A territorial tax system would only tax businesses on the profits \nthey make in the United States. This way businesses would not be \ndiscouraged from incorporating in the United States. If a business \nincorporates in the United States, all of its worldwide profits are \nsubject to U.S. tax. It is certainly true that a territorial tax regime \nmust be done right and that the devil is in the details, but it is also \nclear that territorial tax regime proposals could lead to greater \ninvestment in the United States and more headquarters jobs in the \nUnited States.\n  A territorial tax regime would put American businesses at a more \ncompetitive position when competing internationally. A territorial tax \nsystem would make us more consistent with major developed countries. So \nit is amazing that President Obama has decided to demagogue this issue \nas well, undermining the future jobs prospects of millions of Americans \nfor years to come in order to secure his own job for another 4 years.\n  Not content to grossly misrepresent the issue of outsourcing, he is \nnow doing the same with territorial taxation; that is, in spite of the \nfact that his own agencies have been for it.\n  And it's really quite strange. President Obama's Export Council, his \nCouncil on Jobs Competitiveness, his National commission on Fiscal \nResponsibility and Reform, and his Steering Committee on Advanced \nManufacturing have all recommended that make the U.S. more competitive \nit shift to taking income on a territorial basis. For a person who \nclaimed last week that he just cares so darn much about policy, he has \nan odd way of showing it when he campaigns.\n  In the 2008 election, he fundamentally misled the American people \nabout key aspects of the health care proposal put forward by my friend \nand colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain. In doing so, he kicked the \nlegs out from a reasonable and growing consensus about how best to \nreform the Nation's health care system, and he did so only for his own \npolitical gain.\n  His selfish acts on a territorial tax system have a similar flavor, \nand they promise to make tax reform much more difficult in the future. \nIt is hard to see how this President could lead the country on tax \nreform. He attacks territorial tax regimes with a $4.5 trillion tax \nincrease looming at the end of the year, essentially freezing job \ncreation and economic growth. His allies in the Senate are debating \nthis effectively useless bill on outsourcing.\n  His administration called for the so-called Buffett tax, essentially \ncreating a new alternative minimum tax that would provide trivial \nrevenues and tax capital gains at higher rates than even President \nCarter wanted. Some say it would have given us maybe 8 days' of \nspending in Washington.\n  After waiting years for a corporate tax reform proposal, this past \nFebruary President Obama's administration put out a series of bullet \npoints, the so-called framework for corporate tax reform--all fluff and \nno details.\n  Tax reform is critical if we want our economy to grow and if we are \ngoing to get out of our current jobs deficit. But given this mediocre \ntrack record, I do not think the President can be relied upon to lead \nthis Nation on this issue--not in 2012 and not in a second term either.\n  To the extent the President's tax agenda is not attributable to \npolitics, it can be blamed on his odd view of our economy and the \nbusinesses that grow it. I think it is fair to say the President's \nworld view is fundamentally out of step with that of ordinary American \ntaxpayers. Just the other day, while campaigning in Virginia, the \nPresident laid out his economic vision, channeling the economic know-\nhow of Harvard Law's faculty lounge. He told the crowd, ``If you've got \na business--you didn't build that, somebody else made that happen.'' As \nCharles Krauthammer put it, spoken by a man who never created or ran so \nmuch as a candy store.\n  I do not want to demean candy stores, but that is a fact. The \nPresident made clear for all to see just what he thinks of all the \nhard-working, risk-taking entrepreneurs who sacrifice daily to build \ntheir businesses. His perception is that the hard work and sacrifice of \nthose business owners and their families has nothing to do with their \nsuccess. Any success they have is owing to good luck and big \ngovernment, the fact that we have built some roads and so forth.\n  My guess is that not only American business owners, but most \nAmericans disagree fundamentally with this assessment. The President \nclearly does not understand or deliberately ignores economic incentives \nand the way they lead to business growth and job creation. This is \ncertainly on display in the policy that will forever define this \nPresident, ObamaCare. Good intentions are not enough, and ObamaCare's \nsmall business tax credit is a case in point.\n  This credit was designed to encourage small employers to offer health \ninsurance. The promise was that over 4 million employers would claim $2 \ntax in credits to help pay for health insurance. In reality, only \n309,000 taxpayers claimed the credit for a total of less than $466 \nmillion.\n  Why was the credit such a failure at achieving its well-intentioned \ngoal? Well, a picture is worth 1,000 words. So please look at this \nchart.\n  Can you imagine what a business owner must think when they encounter \nan administrative nightmare like all of this? The ObamaCare tax credit \nfor small businesses gives redtape a bad name. Talk about a \nbureaucratic straightjacket. No wonder the business community has \nfailed to embrace ObamaCare.\n  This issue of ObamaCare's manipulation of the Tax Code and its \nhistoric tax increases are deserving of extended remarks. For now, let \nme just say we should be pursuing laws that will help not harm \nbusinesses and middle-class taxpayers. The bill we are discussing on \nthe floor today, like ObamaCare, is not going to help.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, 1 week ago yesterday was a fairly typical \nday in the Senate. The Congressional Record shows Senators used the \nword ``jobs'' more than 150 times. The following day, a week ago today, \nthe word ``jobs'' appears in the Record 131 times. Just this Monday, a \nfew days ago when the Senate came in at 2 o'clock, ``jobs'' appears in \nthe Record 36 times.\n  So we are talking--and talking a lot--about jobs. Today, Senator \nStabenow's bill offers a chance to do more than talk; we can act.\n  The legislation addresses a fundamental flaw in our tax law. At a \ntime when Americans desperately want us to defend American jobs and to \ngive employers the incentives and support they need to hire new \nworkers, our tax law perversely rewards employers for moving jobs to \nother countries. Today, an American corporation can decide to close a \nfactory in this country, build a new one in another country, claim a \ntax break for the expense of moving those jobs out of our country, and \npay no U.S. taxes on the income that foreign factory earns as long as \nthey leave that income overseas.\n  Our Tax Code, in effect, tells employers: Here is a tax deduction to \nhelp you cut your American workforce and move those jobs offshore. That \nis the effect of our Tax Code. American employers have responded, \nunhappily. Statistics released in April by the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics show that since 1999, U.S.-based multinational corporations \nhave reduced employment in the United States by about 1 million workers \nbut they have added more than 3 million workers overseas.\n  A recent Gallup Poll found that only 13 percent of Americans believe \nthis trend of shipping jobs overseas is good for our economy. Almost 8 \nof every 10 Americans believe it does harm. In a poll for the Alliance \nfor American Manufacturing, 83 percent of respondents said they \ndisapprove of companies that move jobs to countries such as China.\n  The people in Michigan and every other State can no longer afford to \nwatch their tax dollars subsidize shipping their jobs overseas.\n  Earlier this spring, along with Senator Conrad, I introduced the Cut \nUnjustified Tax Loopholes Act or the CUT Loopholes Act. Our legislation \nwould cut several loopholes that enable tax avoidance, which adds to \nthe deficit\n\n[[Page S5186]]\n\nand to the tax burden of those who pay the taxes they owe. Our bill \nwould cut offshore tax loopholes that allow corporations and \nindividuals to avoid paying taxes by concealing their income and assets \nin offshore tax havens. One provision of the CUT Loopholes Act would \nensure that companies aren't taking a tax deduction for the expense of \nmoving jobs overseas. Under our bill, companies couldn't take a \ndeduction for the expense, for instance, of moving a U.S. factory to \nanother country until that company pays U.S. taxes on the income \ngenerated by that foreign factory.\n  Senator Stabenow's Bring Jobs Home Act takes a similar approach, \nending the taxpayer subsidy that helps firms to move American jobs \noverseas. In addition, it would offer a 20-percent tax credit to \ncompanies that move production back to the United States.\n  Surely it makes sense for us to offer employers a tax cut if they \nbring jobs back to the United States. Surely it makes sense to reform a \nlaw that adds insult to injury, that forces our taxpayers to watch \ncompanies move their jobs abroad with the assistance of our taxpayer \ndollars.\n  We have already seen the enormous benefits to our economy and our \nworkers when American companies make the decision to return jobs to our \nshores. Ford Motor Company is returning thousands of offshore jobs to \nMichigan and other States. Companies such as Whirlpool are making the \ndecision to hire American workers for work they once did abroad. \nAmerican manufacturing has built great momentum in the last 3 years, \nadding thousands of jobs. We should add to that momentum and adopt the \nBring Jobs Home Act. We should end existing tax incentives to export \nAmerican jobs, and we should provide a tax break for companies that \nbring jobs back to American workers.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Aid to Pakistan\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, there is a doctor in Pakistan by the name \nof Shakil Afridi. He has been identified as a doctor who helped us with \ninformation in order to get bin Laden. The Pakistan Government has now \nput him in prison for 33 years. I think this is an abomination. While \nwe can't tell countries what they must do with their internal affairs, \nwe certainly don't have to reward them with taxpayer money when they \nput someone in prison for attempting to help America.\n  My point and my message to Pakistan is that if they want to be an \nally, they should act like it. Putting this man in prison for 33 years \nfor helping America get bin Laden, which Pakistan was ostensibly \nsupposed to be doing, is a real travesty of justice. Bin Laden lived \nfor nearly a decade in Pakistan, in a city, living comfortably a mile \nor two from one of their military academies. We finally got him, but it \ndoesn't appear as if we got him with much help from the Pakistani \nGovernment.\n  Now this doctor is in prison for 33 years. And how does President \nObama respond? President Obama, this week, gave them $1 billion--an \nadditional $1 billion. We are rewarding bad behavior with more of our \nmoney--money we don't even have. We have a $1 trillion deficit and we \nare giving them an extra $1 billion.\n  Yesterday he was supposed to have an appeal. Dr. Afridi, the doctor \nwho helped us, was supposed to get a chance to help prove his \ninnocence. His trial has been indefinitely delayed. We have requested \nfrom the Pakistani Embassy whether there is going to be a trial. We \nwant to know the date, and has the date been set for his appeal. We \nhave gotten no answer. We have requested this information from \nPresident Obama's administration, from his State Department. Will Dr. \nAfridi get a trial? When will his trial be? We have gotten no answer.\n  If we can't get an answer--if they are going to continue to hold this \nman--I see no reason to send taxpayer money to Pakistan. I have the \nvotes and the ability to force a vote on this issue. My plan is to \nforce a vote on this issue next week. The vote will be on ending all \naid to Pakistan, ending the aid until this doctor is freed.\n  This is not something I take lightly. This doctor's life is now being \nthreatened. The information minister from that particular province in \nPakistan says they want him transferred because they receive death \nthreats on a daily basis toward him. They are worried about other \nprisoners killing him. I would hate for the Obama administration to \nhave on their conscience the fact that this doctor, who helped us get \nbin Laden, is killed in prison. I would hate to have on my conscience \nthe death of an innocent man, if he were to be killed in prison, whose \nonly crime was helping America. At the very least, the Pakistani \nGovernment ought to immediately get him into a safe prison in one of \nthe larger cities outside the tribal regions.\n  We are concerned about Dr. Afridi's safety, we are concerned about \nimprisoning him for life for helping America, and we are also concerned \nabout American taxpayers' money being taken from hard-working Americans \nand sent to a country that seems to disrespect us. I am all for \ncooperating with Pakistan. I hope they will continue to work with us. \nBut we shouldn't have to buy our friends. We gave them an extra $1 \nbillion. Yet they continue to disrespect us by holding this man in \nprison.\n  I am very concerned about Dr. Afridi's safety. I am concerned his \nappeal was not heard today and his trial was canceled. So next week, if \nwe don't have answers on his trial, we will be here on the floor until \nI get a vote on whether we should continue sending money to Pakistan \nwhile they hold him. This is a very important issue for Americans, and \nI hope all across America people are going to call their Senators and \nsay: You know what. I am not so sure we should send our hard-earned \ndollars to Pakistan when they treat us this way.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                    Water Infrastructure Investment\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I have taken to the floor of the Senate \non previous occasions to talk about our aging water infrastructure and \nthe need for financing. I have talked about the State revolving funds, \nwhich are the principal funding sources for our local governments' \nability to upgrade their water infrastructure. I have talked about the \nneed for safe drinking water and how that is being compromised. I have \nalso talked about the way we treat our wastewater and the health risks \ninvolved in an aging infrastructure. And when I have taken to the floor \non different occasions to talk about the consequences of our failure to \nact, I have made it clear if we move forward with water infrastructure \nprojects it will not only provide the type of infrastructure we need \nfor public health but it will also create jobs and opportunities in our \ncommunities.\n  I have the honor of representing the State of Maryland in the Senate, \nand we have some very aged communities in Maryland. One of those, of \ncourse, is my home city of Baltimore, where the water infrastructure is \nas historic as some of its buildings--well over 100 years old. And \nalthough I have talked about this issue before, I want to bring to the \nSenate's attention that this past Monday, in Baltimore, a 120-year-old \nwater main broke, creating a massive crater in downtown Baltimore on \none of the busiest streets in our city. I have been told it will take a \ncouple of weeks before that can be fixed. I have also been told that, \nas a result, downtown Baltimore was flooded, sending thousands of \nworkers home and costing businesses countless loss of revenue.\n  One might say: Well, these things happen. But in Baltimore we have a \nwater main break at the rate of about two or three a day, costing a \ngreat deal of money because our city workers have to go out, dig it up, \nand cut off water service to homes and businesses, which are \ninconvenienced by not having the ability to get water. And we \nexperience this expense again and again.\n  What we need to do is upgrade our water infrastructure. We all \nunderstand that. We need to make that investment. These major water \nmain breaks are becoming more and more a reality. In 2008, we saw River \nRoad in Bethesda turn literally into a river. We\n\n[[Page S5187]]\n\nhad to use helicopters to rescue people because of a water main break. \nIn October 2009, we had a major break in Dundalk, MD, outside \nBaltimore, which flooded thousands of homes, causing incredible \ninconvenience to that community. One year ago, not far from where we \nare right here, we saw a major water main break in Prince George's \nCounty, closing the Washington beltway and causing a lot of homeowners \nto be without water for an extended period of time.\n  The water infrastructure in this country is in desperate need of new \nattention and greater investment. That is true in our wastewater \ntreatment facility plants and it is true in the way we transport our \nclean water. Wastewater treatment plants are critically important in \npreventing billions of tons of pollutants each year from reaching \nAmerica's rivers, lakes, and coastlines. These facilities prevent \nwaterborne disease and make our water safe for fishing and swimming.\n  Similarly, some 54,000 community drinking water systems provide \ndrinking water to more than 250 million Americans, keeping water \nsupplies free of contaminants that cause disease. The ongoing \ndegradation of these systems puts our human health directly at risk.\n  Many of our water and wastewater systems are outdated, with some \ncomponents across the country over a century old. This aging \ninfrastructure contributes to the 75,000 sanitary sewer overflows that \noccur in the United States per year--75,000 sewage overflows a year in \nthe United States. It causes an estimated 5,500 annual illnesses due to \nthese contaminations which occur on our beaches and in our streams and \nlakes where American families vacation.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that more than $630 \nbillion will be needed over the next 20 years to meet the Nation's \ndrinking water and wastewater infrastructure needs.\n  As chair of the Subcommittee on Water and Wildlife, I held a hearing \nwhere we brought in some of our local officials to talk about some of \nthese needs. They told us they can't possibly do this with the \nresources they currently have available, that they need a Federal \npartner--they need a stronger Federal partner--and they need a Federal \nGovernment that will give them new innovative tools in order to deal \nwith these critical needs.\n  Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake of Baltimore testified she would like \nto see some form of trust fund established so we can leverage money and \nmake these types of investments. She pointed out--which we already \nknow--that for the money we spend on water infrastructure we will cause \na multiplier effect. By a ratio of 3-to-1, it actually creates more \nmoney in our economy. If we put $1 billion in water infrastructure \nimprovement, it creates $3 billion of economic activity in our \ncommunities, allowing us to create more jobs at the same time we \nimprove our water infrastructure for public health and for economic \ndevelopment.\n  This makes sense. We need to do this. I don't know how many more \ntimes I will have to come to the floor of the Senate and point out \nthese horrible water main breaks that are occurring all over. What is \nhappening in Baltimore--what is happening in Maryland--is happening in \nevery one of our States. This is not a one-State problem. This is a \nnational problem. People are outraged by these situations, and they are \ngoing to be more outraged when they realize their public health is at \nrisk and the availability of safe drinking water is at risk, as well as \nthe inconvenience that is caused when their basements are flooded or \nthey can't get to their businesses or have to leave their businesses \nearly or pay additional local taxes in order to repair the damage done \nas a result of the failure to replace aged infrastructure.\n  I urge my colleagues to work together on this issue. Let's make sure \nwe have a budget that makes sense for this country but that allows us \nto invest in the types of investments that are important for America's \nfuture. We have talked about that with transportation infrastructure, \nwe have talked about that with energy infrastructure, but the same \nthing is true with water infrastructure. So I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to provide the tools and \nresources that will allow our economy to grow and our local governments \nto upgrade their water infrastructure systems.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      OSCE's Magnitsky Resolution\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I come to the floor today to call \nMembers' attention to recent action taken at the Parliamentary Assembly \nmeeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, \nwhich convened in Monaco earlier this month.\n  The OSCE considered and passed with overwhelming support a resolution \non the rule of law in Russia and the case of Sergei Magnitsky. This is \na resounding and much welcomed rebuke of Russia's deplorable human \nrights record and systemic corruption.\n  With the Magnitsky resolution, the OSCE--made up of 56 participating \nstates spanning Europe, Central Asia, and North America--reaffirms the \nwidespread call for justice and rule of law. The international group \nhas sent a clear signal to human rights violators that they will be \nheld accountable.\n  The OSCE resolution supports government efforts to ban visas, freeze \nassets, and employ other financial sanctions against those connected to \nthe illegal detention and tragic death of Sergei Magnitsky. The young \nlawyer was beaten and denied medical care in a Russian prison after \nuncovering a vast conspiracy by Russian officials involving $230 \nmillion in tax fraud. Sergei Magnitsky died as a result of his \ntreatment, and no one has ever been held responsible for his death.\n  I have been a member of the Helsinki Commission for the last several \nyears, and I have seen firsthand the contributions the OSCE has made to \nadvance democratic, economic, security, and human rights issues. I was \nunable to attend the Parliamentary Assembly meeting, but I am grateful \nour colleague Senator John McCain was able to be there to highlight the \nimportance of this particular issue.\n  The Magnitsky case is just one example of the gross human rights \nabuses and official impunity in Russia. But as Senator McCain noted in \nhis statement before the OSCE meeting in Monaco, ``The demand for \njustice for Sergei is what has mobilized the world in his memory.''\n  Senator McCain is right to point out that the OSCE resolution--as \nwell as national initiatives to punish those implicated in Sergei \nMagnitsky's death--is not anti-Russia. Indeed, a return to the rule of \nlaw would be of great benefit to the Russian people. To quote my \ncolleague Senator McCain:\n\n       Defending the innocent and punishing the guilty is pro-\n     Russia. . . . The virtues that Sergei Magnitsky embodied--\n     integrity, fair-dealing, fidelity to truth and justice, and \n     the deepest love of country, which does not turn a blind eye \n     to the failings of one's government, but seeks to remedy them \n     by insisting on the highest standards--this too is pro-\n     Russia, and I would submit that it represents the future that \n     most Russians want for themselves and their country.\n\n  Senator McCain then goes on to encourage the assembly to align ``with \nthe highest aspirations of the Russian people--Sergei's aspirations--\nfor justice, for equal dignity under the law, and for the indomitable \nspirit of human freedom.''\n  Like the OSCE, Members of this Senate will also have an opportunity \nto lend our voices to the call for justice and accountability. The \nSergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act would impose travel and \nfinancial sanctions on those associated with human rights crimes.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and to uphold this \ncountry's commitment to the protection of human rights. I salute the \nleadership of my colleague and friend Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland \nfor his leadership in this regard, and I am pleased to note that the \nMagnitsky Act was included during consideration of extending normal \ntrade relations to Russia in yesterday's Senate Finance Committee \nmarkup. We are making great progress on this issue, and I look forward \nto a vote on the Senate floor.\n  In conclusion, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record\n\n[[Page S5188]]\n\nSenator McCain's full remarks at the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Statement by Senator John McCain at the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly--\n                          Sunday, July 8, 2012\n\n       Thank you for the opportunity to join you this afternoon.\n       Let me recognize my fellow members of Congress, Dennis \n     Cardoza and Robert Aderholt, who are doing great work on \n     behalf of the American delegation. I am pleased that Robert \n     is standing for vice president of this assembly, and I want \n     to voice my full support for his candidacy.\n       It is also my pleasure to support this resolution on rule \n     of law in Russia and the case of Sergei [SERgay] Magnitsky. \n     What happened to Sergei was a horrific crime. But it is also \n     an example--an extreme example, to be sure, but an example \n     nonetheless--of the pervasive and systemic corruption in the \n     Russian government. To this day, no one--not one person--has \n     ever been held responsible for Sergei's death. This, despite \n     the fact that the Russian Human Rights Council, established \n     by the Russian President, found that Sergei's arrest was \n     illegal, that he was denied access to justice, and that his \n     treatment amounted to torture. This resolution correctly \n     notes these disturbing facts.\n       The demand for justice for Sergei is what has mobilized the \n     world in his memory. In the United States, Senator Ben Cardin \n     and I introduced legislation that would impose an array of \n     penalties on those believed to be responsible for Sergei's \n     death, but also on other human rights abusers in Russia and \n     beyond. The Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act \n     has been passed by our Foreign Relations Committee, and no \n     matter what you hear, make no mistake: It will become law. \n     And it will contain the full array of essential measures--\n     visa bans, asset freezes, and financial sanctions. I assure \n     you of it.\n       The Congress now has a path to pass this legislation. I and \n     others have made clear that doing so is the condition for \n     repeal of the Jackson-Vanik amendment and extension of \n     Permanent Normal Trade Relations to Russia, which I have also \n     sponsored legislation to enact.\n       Other European legislatures, as well as the European \n     Parliament, have condemned Sergei's murder and may take \n     legislative action as well. Now, this resolution offers an \n     opportunity for all of us, legislators from more than 50 \n     nations, to speak with one voice in favor of the justice that \n     Sergei and his family deserve. It is essential that we do so.\n       I know that some will try to paint this resolution as anti-\n     Russia. I could not disagree more. Indeed, I believe it is \n     pro-Russia, as are the pieces of national legislation that \n     would punish those guilty of Sergei's death. I believe that \n     supporting the rule of law is pro-Russia. I believe that \n     defending the innocent and punishing the guilty is pro-\n     Russia. And ultimately, I believe the virtues that Sergei \n     Magnitsky embodied--integrity, fair-dealing, fidelity to \n     truth and justice, and the deepest love of country, which \n     does not turn a blind eye to the failings of one's \n     government, but seeks to remedy them by insisting on the \n     highest standards--this too is pro-Russia, and I would submit \n     that it represents the future that most Russians want for \n     themselves and their country.\n       The example that Sergei set during his brief life is now \n     inspiring more and more Russian citizens. They are standing \n     up and speaking up in favor of freedom, democracy, and the \n     rule of law. They, like us, do not want Russia to be weak and \n     unstable. They want it to be a successful and just and lawful \n     country, as we do. Most of these Russian human rights and \n     rule of law advocates support our efforts to continue \n     Sergei's struggle for what's right, just as they are now \n     doing.\n       Let us now add our voices to theirs by passing this \n     important resolution today. And in doing so, let us align \n     this Assembly with the highest aspirations of the Russian \n     people--Sergei's aspirations--for justice, for equal dignity \n     under the law, and for the indomitable spirit of human \n     freedom.\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, in just a couple minutes we are going to \nbe voting on a very important policy, a very important bill I am proud \nto sponsor with a number of cosponsors, a number of colleagues, called \nthe Bring Jobs Home Act. It goes to the heart of what has been \nhappening in a global economy when we have not been paying attention to \nour Tax Code or other things that we ought to be doing to be able to \nbring jobs home and other countries are aggressively working to take \nour manufacturing base, to take our middle class. They know when they \nlook at our country we have a middle class because we make products and \ngrow products, so they are rushing to be able to make products and to \ninnovate and so on and to create incentives for our jobs to be shipped \noverseas.\n  We know we are in a global economy. We know our companies are \ncompeting with countries. We have a whole range of things we have been \nworking to do to be able to support and incentivize and help \nmanufacturers and other businesses here to innovate, expand advanced \nmanufacturing, IT services, among others. But what we have not been \npaying attention to is how our own Tax Code actually is incentivizing \nor supporting--at the very least supporting and helping companies ship \njobs overseas.\n  There is a very important, very basic policy we will be voting on \ntoday. If a company decides to pack up and move overseas, should they \nbe able to write that off their taxes and you and I--all of us as \nAmerican taxpayers--pay for it? I do not think there are too many \npeople in the country who would say yes to that. In fact, I can't \nimagine why anybody would say yes to that. The reality is, if somebody \nloses their job at a plant and then they find out they get the \nprivilege, as an American taxpayer, to help pay for the move, folks \nsay: Are you kidding me or they say a whole lot of other things.\n  This bill, the Bring Jobs Home Act, is very straightforward. It \nsimply says we are not going to pay for that anymore. That loophole \nwill be gone. However, if they want to bring jobs back, we will be \nhappy to let them deduct those costs as a business expense, for \nbringing a job home. In fact, we will give them another 20-percent tax \ncredit for 20 percent of their costs on top of it. So we are happy to \nincentivize coming home and to support their efforts to come home, but \nwe are not paying for them to leave. That is basically what this is \nabout.\n  We are going to have a vote on whether to proceed to this bill. As we \nknow around here, unfortunately, we have seen the process that used to \nbe used rarely now used on every bill, to where we cannot even get to \nthe bill to vote on that with a majority vote without going through a \nsupermajority to be able to stop a filibuster, which is right now what \nbasically has been happening. There is an objection. We have to get 60 \nvotes to overcome it; otherwise, the filibuster continues.\n  We will need to do that today. We need bipartisan support to do that. \nI hope we will have that. A couple weeks ago we came together in strong \nbipartisan support. We worked together very hard, long hours, to pass a \nfarm bill. That is about growing products in America. Now we have an \nopportunity to work together, come together in a bipartisan basis to \nsupport making products in America.\n  We do not have a middle class unless we make products and grow \nproducts. It is not going to make any sense if we continue to have a \ntax policy that actually encourages or helps you to leave America.\n  What we have seen now is that we are actually losing jobs. We know in \nthe last decade 2.4 million jobs were shipped overseas. Those are just \nthe ones they are able to count at this point. So 2.4 million jobs have \nbeen shipped overseas, at a minimum, and we help to pay for it. The \ngood news is we have a lot of companies now, for a lot of reasons--the \nfact that we have the most productive, the smartest, most talented \nworkforce in the world, we have high productivity in our country--we \nhave companies now bringing jobs back and we want to accelerate that, \nto support that effort.\n  I am proud that in our automobile industry we are seeing jobs come \nback with support and help from policies that allowed loans to retool \nolder plants. Ford Motor Company has taken their largest plant in \nWayne, MI, and retooled it, along within investment in advanced \nbatteries. Jobs are coming back from Mexico. Some are coming from other \ncountries as well. GM is doing the same kind of thing, Chrysler--I am \nsure other companies as well. We know many companies, large and small, \nare looking at this.\n  Yesterday, I had the opportunity to have in a businessman from \nMichigan who is the CEO of a company called GalaxE.Solutions. He \nactually lives in New Jersey but is now having a major\n\n[[Page S5189]]\n\npresence in Michigan, in Detroit, hiring 500 people in IT, information \ntechnology. Those are jobs coming back from India, Brazil, China.\n  One of the things I heard, as he was talking yesterday, is when we \nlook at the bottom line, costs matter. If we have a Tax Code that helps \nhim bring jobs back rather than supporting him to take jobs away, to \nship them overseas, it makes a difference. It matters. It matters not \nonly for the cost but for the signal it sends about how serious we are \nin creating jobs in America.\n  I cannot imagine anybody who doesn't want to see ``Made in America'' \nagain on everything. We are not going to get there if we do not start \nwith the basics. That is what this is. I know you have talked about \nthis so many times as well. This is about the basic premise of saying \nwe are going to stop loopholes in the Tax Code that reward companies \nthat are shipping jobs overseas and we are instead going to support and \nincentivize jobs coming back.\n  We know there are many other things, in addition to this, that we \nneed to do. We need comprehensive tax reform in a global economy. There \nis no question about that. That is something I am confident we will be \ndoing in the months ahead and into the next year. We need to do that. \nWe need to do it on a bipartisan basis. But that is not a reason not to \nclose this loophole, to stop this policy that makes no sense.\n  We have a lot more to do. We know that. We need to come together \naround policies that focus on innovation and education and rebuilding \nAmerica and supporting the great entrepreneurs of the country--small \nbusinesses, large businesses. We know that. There is much to do. But \ntoday we have a chance to do something. We have a chance to do \nsomething. This is very straightforward. We have a chance to simply say \nthe Tax Code in America is not going to reward or pay for the costs of \nAmerican jobs being shipped overseas. It is as basic as that. No other \ncountry in the world would do this. They think we are crazy to have \nthis kind of policy in place. So today is a chance to say: No, we are \nnot crazy. We get it.\n  We know there is a lot to do, but let's come together on this issue \nand then we can come together on the next and the next and continue to \nbuild and rebuild our economy for the future.\n  But today is very simple. Today is the day to say no to American \ntaxpayers helping to pay the costs for American jobs being shipped \noverseas. It is a day to say yes to supporting, through tax deductions, \njobs coming back and additional incentives on top of that. I hope my \ncolleagues will come together and very strongly vote yes on this \nmeasure so we can proceed to debate and to pass something that I know \nis strongly supported across our country.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I wish to take a moment to \nspeak about what just happened and my deep concern about what just \nhappened with this vote.\n  On the one hand, we have 56 Members, a majority--a substantial \nmajority of Members who voted yes, that they want to bring jobs home, \nthat they want to stop paying for jobs that have been shipped overseas, \nand that we want to support and provide assistance through the Tax Code \nto bring jobs home. Fifty-six Members--that is a majority. What we \ndidn't have is a supermajority to stop a filibuster.\n  So this is basically what has been happening here. We have a \nsituation where, despite the will of the majority of the people here, \nthe majority of Senators who want to move forward to this legislation \nand pass it, because we have 56 votes to pass it, we don't have a \nsupermajority. This is what has been happening over and over in the \nSenate despite the fact that people want us to work together and get \nthings done.\n  What we are trying to do--and we are going to continue to push \nforward--is to say very clearly to businesses that if they are going to \nclose shop and ship jobs overseas, it is on their dime, not the \nAmerican taxpayers' dime. We are not going to help pay for it. If they \nwant to bring jobs back, we are happy to have our Tax Code allow \nbusinesses to write off those costs. In fact, we will give businesses \nan extra 20 percent toward those costs.\n  This is deeply concerning to me today. I think those watching around \nthe country are probably scratching their heads or saying things that \nwe probably can't say on the Senate floor about what in the world is \ngoing on when we can't come together on the simple premise that \nAmericans should not be paying for jobs shipped overseas.\n  So we are going to keep at it until we get it done. What we ought to \nbe unified around is having the words ``Made in America'' on everything \nagain in this country. We are going to keep fighting until we can get \nthat done.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan is still on the floor--and she has done such commendable work \nhere, as somebody who brought together the Senate Agriculture Committee \non a very complex farm bill, and in a record amount of time got it \npassed with a heavy bipartisan majority--I think she would\n\n[[Page S5190]]\n\nagree with me that is the way we used to and should do legislation.\n  For the life of me, I cannot understand why any Senator would not be \nsupporting the Senator from Michigan on the bill. We want jobs here in \nthe United States. Everybody will say: We want jobs in the United \nStates. Everybody says they want to have tax laws that actually help \nthis country. So what do they do? By refusing to allow us to go \nforward, they vote to allow jobs to go overseas. But worse than that, \nit gives special tax breaks. It is almost like saying: Hey, this \ncompany of yours, these jobs you have, come on, I know a great place \nfor you to go overseas. By the way, here is the airplane ticket. Here \nis the special deal. We are not going to give that to a small business \nowner in Vermont or Michigan, but we will give that to you to ship your \njobs overseas.\n  Come on, let's get real. If you took a poll of the American people on \nthis: Do you want to close loopholes for shipping jobs overseas or do \nyou want to give encouragement to have jobs here in the United States? \nI guarantee you, it would be overwhelmingly passed. The U.S. Senate \nbetter wake up and say: We will pass it too.\n  So I thank the Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                   Release of Camp Lejeune Documents\n\n  Mr. President, the distinguished Presiding Officer and I are both \nfrom Vermont, where we have open and available government. He did in \nhis role as mayor of our largest city. He has encouraged it all the way \nthrough.\n  We know that the ``right to know'' is a cornerstone of our democracy. \nDuring my three decades in the Senate, I have urged Democratic and \nRepublican administrations alike to be open and transparent to the \nAmerican people.\n  That is why in March I joined a bipartisan group of Members of \nCongress--Senator Grassley, Senator Burr, Senator Hagan, Senator Bill \nNelson, and Senator Rubio--in writing to Secretary of Defense Panetta \nto request the release of government records regarding the \ncontamination of drinking water that occurred over several decades at \nCamp Lejeune Marine Base, in North Carolina.\n  The drinking water contamination at Camp Lejeune was one of the worst \nenvironmental disasters in American history to occur at a domestic \nDepartment of Defense installation. Unfortunately, the Department of \nDefense initially refused to provide this important information to the \nCongress. But I am pleased to report that after I pursued it further \nwith Secretary Panetta, the Department finally provided more than 8,500 \nfiles about this issue to the Judiciary Committee on July 9.\n  I commend Secretary Panetta for accommodating the committee's request \nfor this information. But I believe that much more transparency is \nneeded. I believe it as a U.S. Senator. I believe it as one who \nbelieves in transparency. I also believe it as a father of a Marine.\n  Today, thousands of active and retired Marines who lived on or near \nCamp Lejeune prior to 1987, and their family members, are extremely \ninterested in learning more about what occurred, and why.\n  In my own State of Vermont, 402 Vermonters have signed in saying they \nare looking to their government to provide more information about this \ncalamity.\n  Open government is neither a Democratic issue nor a Republican issue. \nIt is an American value. It is a virtue that we all have to uphold.\n  It is in this bipartisan spirit that I announce I will make all the \ndocuments the Department of Defense has provided to the Judiciary \nCommittee about what happened at Camp Lejeune available to the public. \nThese documents can be seen on the Judiciary Committee's Web site. Go \nto www.judiciary.senate.gov. Find out what the documents say about what \nhappened at Camp Lejeune.\n  To protect the personal privacy of our servicemembers and other \nprivate information, information that would be subject to the Privacy \nAct, has been redacted from these files. But the Marines and any other \nAmericans who have been touched by this environmental disaster deserve \ncomplete candor from their government. Our uniquely American tradition \nof a government that is open, accountable, and accessible to its people \ndemands nothing less.\n  Again, I thank Senator Grassley, the committee's distinguished \nranking member, and Senators Burr, Hagan, Nelson, and Rubio for working \nclosely with me on this important transparency issue.\n  I say to those Marines, we will find out what happened.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have been able to work things out. We are \nnot going to have to be in session--we thought we had it all worked out \nbut now we do not.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLieberman and I and Senator Graham--if he shows up--be allowed to \nengage in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Syria\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I join my friend Senator Lieberman again \non the floor on the issue that has, in my view, transcendent \nconsequences not just for the people being massacred in Libya, but also \nfor a definition of what the United States of America is all about.\n  Yesterday's attack in Syria killed some key leaders of the Assad \nregime, including one of its most notorious and brutal henchmen. It is \na sign of victory and progress for the Syrian opposition and, \nhopefully, it could be a sign that Assad is losing his hold on power. \nBut it is hardly time to celebrate or claim credit.\n  I see in the various organs of the administration, such as the New \nYork Times that, well, the administration's hands-off policy has been \nsuccessful. Successful? Seventeen thousand Syrians have been massacred \nwhile this administration has done nothing, and the President has \nrefused to even speak up. The President of the United States talks \nabout Bain Capital all the time. Why doesn't he talk about the capital \nof Syria where thousands of innocent people have been tortured, raped, \nand murdered?\n  So Assad will fall, as the Senator from Connecticut and I have said \ntime and time again. But how many more will die before the United \nStates of America, first, speaks up for them and, second, helps with \nother countries to provide them with arms and an ability to defend \nthemselves and a sanctuary--a no-fly/no-drive sanctuary--and work with \nother countries in the region, accelerating the departure of Bashar \nAssad.\n  I will make another point before I ask my friend from Connecticut to \nspeak. It seems now that U.S. national security rests not with the \ndecisions that should be made in the Halls of Congress and at the White \nHouse, but that the decisions concerning what actions the United States \nof America may take is now dictated by Russia and China in the United \nNations. How many times have we heard the administration say: We would \nlike to do more and have more happen, but Russia vetoes it in the U.N. \nSecurity Council?\n  Does that mean when these people are being massacred and are crying \nout for our help and moral support, because Russia vetoes a \nresolution--as they did today again, supported by China--in the \nSecurity Council, therefore we can do nothing?\n  Former President Clinton went to Kosovo without a United Nations \nSecurity Council resolution because he knew the Russians would veto any \nresolution concerning Kosovo. He went and we saved Muslims' lives. The \nadministration continues to assume what they call a ``Yemen solution'' \nis possible in Syria. They believe that with Russia's backing, we can \ncompel Assad and his top lieutenants to leave power\n\n[[Page S5191]]\n\nand the apparatus of the Syrian State will continue to function under \nnew management.\n  I wish this could be so. Let me also point this out: I ask my friend \nfrom Connecticut, isn't it true that the predictions that the longer \nthis conflict lasts, the more likely it is that extremists will come in \nand take this revolution, which began peacefully?\n  Isn't it true that our concern about weapons of mass destruction and \nthe stockpile become more valid every day this goes on? Isn't it a \nvalid assumption that Bashar Assad, in his desperation, may use these \nweapons against his own people, and the whole stockpile of those \nweapons becomes more and more tenuous by the day?\n  Isn't it true that the likelihood of further chaos, further inability \nto put that country and its people back together after this conflict is \nover and, as we agree, Bashar Assad relieved--but isn't it true that \nevery day that goes by and he remains in power the situation becomes \nworse in all respects as far as American national security interests \nare concerned, whether it be weapons of mass destruction, whether it be \nIslamic extremists taking over that country and, by the way, including \nthe continued Iranian presence in Syria propping up Hezbollah in \nLebanon and all of the ramifications of their continued presence there?\n  I ask my friend, finally, doesn't this argue and cry out that rather \nthan saying, well, what happened yesterday, that was good, and it shows \nAssad is on his way out--but doesn't this indicate it is now more in \nour interest to accelerate his departure, not with American boots on \nthe ground but through moral, physical, and logistic support, working \nwith our allies?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I say to my friend from Arizona, of \ncourse, I agree with him. The reality is that the premature judgment \nabout the victory of the Syrian freedom fighters is exactly that--\npremature. The assassination, elimination of these critical leaders of \nthis dictatorial government yesterday by the Syrian opposition was a \nvery significant development.\n  Apparently, the fighting continues in Damascus in a way that may \nbring exactly what my friend from Arizona says--more chaos in Damascus. \nBut this fight is not over. This regime has a devastating inventory of \nweapons, including weapons of mass destruction, and as the Senator from \nArizona said, Bashar Assad's father used those weapons--in that case, \nchemical weapons--against his own people decades ago, killing thousands \nof them on a single day.\n  No, this fight is not over. The danger is that, as he said, it gets \nworse the more it goes on without the involvement of the civilized \nnations of the world that have to be led by the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I want to put in juxtaposition two significant events of the last 24 \nhours, which my friend has described. One is the suicide bombing, \napparently, or the death of these leaders of the Assad government. \nSecond is the vote in New York at the U.N. today. After months in which \ntoo much of the civilized world has been pleading with Russia and \ndepending on Russia to change its mind and come in and get Bashar Assad \nout of there, this veto today shows they are not going to do it.\n  I will yield in a moment because I see the presence of the majority \nleader. First, I will finish this thought.\n  The reality is now that the figleaf has been taken off of the plan \nsince it went into effect and allegedly brought a cease-fire in Syria, \nthousands more Syrians have been killed. The reality is that Russia \nwill not join in trying to stop the slaughter in Syria, and the \nslaughter will only be stopped by facts on the ground, and those facts \nare military. It will not get better until the United States leads a \ncoalition of the willing to support the opposition and bring about the \nearly end of this horrific regime that now rules Syria.\n  With that, I yield the floor to the majority leader.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, there will be no further rollcall votes \ntoday. The next vote will be Monday at 5:30 p.m. on the nomination of \nMichael A. Shipp to be a U.S. district judge for the District of New \nJersey.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank the majority leader. I urge him, \nhowever possible, to bring up the Defense authorization bill, which I \nhope we can do sooner rather than later, as we have done for the last \n50 years. I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I had a long conversation yesterday with \nthe chairman of the committee and with his ranking member, Senator \nMcCain. I understand the importance of the legislation. I know Senator \nMcCain is trying to work to narrow the focus of what we do when we get \non that bill. We will get on that; it is only a question of when.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I want to mention to my friend from \nConnecticut, as we continue this colloquy, there is another aspect of \nthis that I would appreciate his comments on.\n  We all agree that Bashar Assad will go. We know that. Now, the \nquestion is how many will die, how many are wounded, how many are \nkilled, and what happens to the weapons of mass destruction? I think we \nhave established that the longer it goes on, the more those threats \nincrease, and the more dangerous the situation becomes, the harder it \nwill be to resolve once Bashar Assad does leave.\n  I also ask my friend from Connecticut, how will the Syrian people \nfeel about the United States of America if we continue to sit by and \nprovide them not even moral assistance, much less the physical and \nlogistical assistance the Senator and I discussed being necessary. \nSenator Lieberman and I have been to Libya on numerous occasions. I was \nthere at an exhilarating moment--at the time of their elections.\n  I can tell you firsthand from seeing a couple hundred thousand people \ncelebrating that they are grateful to the United States of America for \nwhat we did. I wonder what the attitude of the people who will emerge \nas the new leaders of Syria--whoever they are--what their attitude will \nbe toward the United States, I ask my colleague. Taking into \nconsideration that the challenges that whoever takes over power in \nLibya will face are myriad, and there are incredible obstacles to a \npath to a free and democratic nation, that would cry out for American \nassistance, how willing and eager will they be for the United States to \nbe engaged in any way in assisting them as they try to achieve the goal \nthey have already sacrificed 17,000 lives for?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Well, the Senator makes a very important point. Let me \nrelate it back to one of the excuses that has been given for the United \nStates not to have become more involved on the side of the opposition \nto Assad, which is the side of freedom, which is where our national \nvalues call us to be. One of the excuses for not getting involved is \nthis argument: We don't know who is going to follow Assad. It could be \nIslamist extremists.\n  Well, my reaction to that is that the longer we sit back, the more \nlikely it will be people who are not friendly toward the United States \nbecause in their hour of need--unlike the situation in Libya that the \nSenator just described--we were not with them. The Senator and I have \nbeen to Turkey together, and I made a trip to Lebanon. In each case, we \ntalked to the leaders. In one case, in Turkey, we spoke to the leaders \nof the Syrian opposition, the Syrian National Council, and we met with \nthe heads of the Free Syrian Army and met with individual refugees.\n  My own judgment is that these people are not extremists or radicals; \nthey are patriots, nationalists, people who want a better life than \nthey were living under Assad. Now, increasingly, they are people whose \nrelatives or friends have been killed by Assad's military, and so they \nhave a fury in them, an anger that they didn't have before because now \nthey have been victims.\n  Now, can I say that there are no Islamist extremists who are now \nfighting in Syria against Assad? I cannot say that. I think the longer \nwe stand back and don't partner openly and strongly with the Syrian \nfreedom fighters, the greater the danger is that, one, extremists will \nbe what follows Assad and, two, even if we are lucky enough and it is \nnot extremists, it will be a leadership group that will not feel any \nparticular sense of gratitude toward the United States because we\n\n[[Page S5192]]\n\nwere not with them when they needed us.\n  Mr. McCAIN. First of all, I wish to point out that I understand--as I \nknow my friend from Connecticut does--the focus of the American people \nis on our economy, on jobs, and the severe recession we are in. But I \nsay to my friend from Connecticut, I just wish every American could \nhave been with us or had seen on film a recording of our visit to the \nrefugee camp on the Turkish-Syrian border, with 25,000 refugees--I \nunderstand now that is up to 35,000 or 40,000 refugees--from Syria. \nThese are people who have been driven out of their homes, living not in \nsqualid conditions but certainly very crowded and unpleasant \nconditions. They are certainly not the same conditions which they \nenjoyed in Syria. I wish the American people could have seen when we \nmet those young children who have been displaced from their homes or \nwhen we met a group of men who told us about watching their children \nbeing murdered in front of their eyes and of the young women who had \nbeen gang raped and hear the defectors from the Syrian military who \ntold us their instructions are--in order to try to subdue the people--\nto torture, murder, and rape. We know from human rights organizations \nthere are torture centers set up around Syria by the Assad military, \nwhere people are taken and, obviously, tortured.\n  The American people are the most generous people in the world. The \nAmerican people, where we can, try to stop these kinds of atrocities \nand offenses that are against everything we stand for and believe in. I \nwish more Americans would know how terrible and dire this situation is \nfor the average citizen and not just for those who are demonstrating \nbut anybody who happens to be in one of these areas where the tanks \nroll in and the artillery starts firing and the helicopter gunships \nstart slaughtering people in the streets.\n  I hope I am not saying this in a partisan fashion, but I wish the \nPresident of the United States would speak up for these people. That is \nthe job of the President of the United States--to lead. I wish we in \nCongress would do more in order to help these people because that is a \nlong American tradition. Yes, it may require some financial sacrifice \nand maybe materiel sacrifice on the part of the American people, but I \nthink the cause is one of transcendent importance.\n  I wish to thank my friend from Connecticut for his compassion, his \nconcern, and his commitment to these people who live far away.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank Senator McCain for his \nleadership. This is one of those cases where we have the opportunity--\nand it is painful that we have not taken it over these many months of \nthe uprising in Syria--not only to do what is right but to do what is \nbest for our country diplomatically. In other words, what is right is \nto be on the side of freedom, to be with the people fighting against a \nbrutal dictator. That is the right thing to do. What is right is to \nenter this fight to stop the slaughter of innocent men, women and, \nliterally, children. But there also happens to be a strategic \nopportunity.\n  I ask my friend from Arizona about this. Does he agree Syria's Assad \nis not only the best friend but the only friend and ally Iran has in \nthe Middle East? Iran is our No. 1 strategic threat in the world today; \nthe No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism, in a headlong effort to build \nnuclear weapons that will totally change the peace of the world if they \nget them. So here we have an opportunity not only to do what is morally \nright but to help overthrow the best friend of our worst enemy--Iran.\n  As the Senator remembers--we were there together--when GEN James \nMattis, a great American military leader and head of Central Command \noverseeing the Middle East, said that if Assad is overthrown, it will \nbe the worst setback Iran has suffered in more than a quarter of a \ncentury. That will, in turn, I think, open tremendous new possibilities \nin Lebanon, which has been under the Syrian-Iranian influence. Even in \nIraq, where the new Iraqi Government has felt, I think, pressured on \nboth sides from Iran and Iran's ally Syria on the other side, if Syria \nis not controlled by an Iranian puppet, I think we may see some more \nindependence from Iraq that we would like to see.\n  I ask the Senator from Arizona if he agrees there is not just a moral \nimperative but an extraordinary strategic opportunity here to get in \nand shape history.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would say my friend from Connecticut is exactly right. \nBoth he and I visited Lebanon recently, and the fact is that Hezbollah \nbasically controls the government with a Prime Minister who is not \nHezbollah but who was put into power by Hezbollah, and their country is \nbasically gridlocked as well. If Syria goes, Bashar Assad goes. That \nconnection between Iran and Hezbollah will be severed and the people of \nLebanon will have a great opportunity to have what once was a very \nthriving democracy restored.\n  Finally, I would like to mention to my friend one of the things that \nsurprises me from time to time as I have traveled to places such as \nBurma, whose people were recently freed. I met three men there who were \nin prison, one of whom had been there for 18 years and another for 22 \nyears. When I have traveled to Libya, as I was for the elections the \nother day, when I have been in Egypt and I have met some of the young \npeople who were part of the revolution, and in Tunisia, where we met \nthe young people there and the new government there, much to my \nsurprise, to some degree, they pay attention to what we say. They pay \nattention.\n  These three men who were imprisoned for over 20 years said: Thank you \nfor what you said. We listened to you in prison. The people in Libya on \nelection night, waving little Libyan flags, were saying thank you. \nThank you, America. Thank you. Thank you, Senator McCain, for saying \nthat. The people in Syria are listening and will find out what we are \nsaying today on the floor of the Senate.\n  Does it matter much? I don't know. But the people in Syria know there \nare some of us who are committed and will not rest until this massacre \nstops, until these terrible atrocities cease, and that we will continue \nto do everything we can to provide them with the kind of moral \nassistance, which is a vital ingredient in continuing their resistance, \nand the materiel assistance which provides them the wherewithal to gain \ntheir freedom.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator. I want to make clear, as we \nfinish, what we are talking about.\n  What are we asking our government to do? We are not asking our \ngovernment to put American troops on the ground in Syria. They do not \nneed American troops. They have fierce patriotic fighters. What they \nneed first from us is an open declaration that we are on the side of \nthe Syrian opposition.\n  The second is, I believe they need us to organize a coalition of the \nwilling, just as Senator McCain said President Clinton did in the case \nof Kosovo, without the United Nations supporting it. Again, it was a \nRussian veto that stood in the way.\n  Mr. McCAIN. President Clinton said his greatest regret was that we \ndid not intervene in Rwanda, where some 800,000 people were massacred.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Absolutely. So we have to learn from those lessons of \nhistory. There is a coalition of the willing waiting to be formed here, \nif only we in the United States will show leadership. Nobody is asking \nus and we are not asking for unilateral American action.\n  There is no question we have allies in the Arab world who are already \ninvolved in supporting the opposition in Syria--namely Saudi Arabia and \nQatar, which would join us. I believe there may be one or more European \ncountries that would join us. There are other Arab countries that would \njoin us.\n  What are we asking? Let us increase the flow of weapons and training \nto the opposition. I think it is time for us to use American air power \nto at least impose a no-fly zone over Syria because the Syrians are now \nusing gunships, and I fear they will begin to use fighters to attack \ntheir civilian population and create and spread the kind of fear they \nnow depend upon.\n  It is a coalition in support of the opposition, it is weapons and \ntraining, it is sanctuaries where they can be trained and equipped, and \nit is the use of air power against this regime which I think will not \nonly deal a devastating blow to their regime but will make the \nremaining supporters it has in the\n\n[[Page S5193]]\n\nmilitary and in the business community despair and see the end is near \nand abandon Assad.\n  Have I stated correctly what the Senator from Arizona feels we want \nthis government of ours to be doing now in regard to Syria?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think the Senator is exactly right and has described it \nwell.\n  There is an element also that adds more urgency, of which I know the \nSenator from Connecticut is very well aware; that is, that published \nmedia reports have talked about the fact that weapons of mass \ndestruction--which, apparently, Bashar Assad has significant stocks \nof--have been moved around. For what purpose those weapons have been \nmoved around is not known. But it is not an unbelievable scenario that, \nin final desperation, Bashar Assad would behave as his father did and \nuse these chemical weapons and slaughter unknown numbers of people.\n  Again, that information lends urgency to bringing him down, to having \nit happen as quickly as possible, and that, of course, means the kind \nof engagement the Senator from Connecticut just described.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend. I feel disappointed we continue to \nhave to return to the floor to make these pleas. I hope we come to a \nday soon when we come to the floor to celebrate the victory of freedom \nand the defeat of Assad the dictator. May it happen soon.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that for the \nnext half hour, myself, Senator Mikulski, Senator Blumenthal, Senator \nCoons, and Senator Blunt, and also, should they come, Senator Graham \nand Senator Kyl be allowed to engage in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Cyber and Critical Infrastructure\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Our topic is the urgency of the need to protect our \nprivately held critical infrastructure--the power grid, the machines \nthat process our financial transactions, and the communications \nnetworks that connect our BlackBerrys and our phones.\n  In this area, no one is more expert than Senator Mikulski, who is a \nsenior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, helped draft the \nSenate intelligence report on cyber, and has the pen as the cardinal \nfor the budgets of most of the agencies that are relevant to this \ndiscussion. So let me lead immediately to Senator Mikulski, who has \nbeen enormously helpful in this arrangement.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island, a former member \nof the Intelligence Committee and an activist in this area.\n  Madam President and colleagues, I am happy to be on the floor with a \nbipartisan group of people who are really worried about our country, \nand we are worried about its survivability in the event of a cyber \nattack.\n  Cyber attacks are not the work of science fiction, though they were \nonce written about. That which was once science fiction is now a hard \nreality that could cripple our country and bring it to the ground. We \nhave to come up with the legislative framework to be able to protect \ndot.com and also be able to protect critical infrastructure. I am \ntalking about something that could create catastrophic economic damage, \nsevere degradation.\n  Why am I obsessed about it? Let's take the grid. There are those who \nsay America runs on oil. Barbara Mikulski says it runs on electricity. \nYou cannot have a community without electricity. Look at what happened \nto us in this north capital region when, 2 weeks ago, we had this \nfreaky storm. We nearly came to our knees. Metro couldn't function, \nstoplights were out, and communication went down. People didn't have \naccess to many communications. Their homes were without electricity, \nfood went bad, and tempers rose. We could not function as a community.\n  The good news is that no matter how late the utilities were in coming \nin to respond, they could turn the lights back on, they could turn the \nelectricity back on. But I will tell you, in a cyber attack, that \ninternational predator will fix it so that we won't be able to turn it \nback on or not turn it on for hours, days, or weeks. Do you know what \nthat means? They want to humiliate us, they want to intimidate us, and \nthey want to terrorize us.\n  We have it within our hands to pass legislation that would bring the \nappropriate sources together for our privately owned critical \ninfrastructure to be able to make the significant efforts, and I \nbelieve we need to incentivize them to be able to protect us. I don't \nwant to wake up one day and find out America has been hit because of \ngridlock here. And I will tell you, if we are hit, we will overreact, \nwe will overspend, we will overregulate, and we will go over the top.\n  I want to listen to my other colleagues, but we have to get off of \nour pet peeves here and move America to a safe result.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I am very honored and proud to \nfollow the Senator from Maryland, who has been such an extraordinary \nleader in so many areas and, most prominently and recently, this one \nthat involves the future of our country. I thank the Senator from Rhode \nIsland for his leadership and my colleague, Senator Coons of Delaware, \nbecause he has been at the forefront. This issue truly is bipartisan. \nSenator Blunt has played a leading role, as have Senator Graham and \nSenator Kyl and, of course, Senators Lieberman and Collins and Senator \nMcCain, who was on the floor before, and Senator Chambliss. This kind \nof amassing senatorial consensus reflects the urgency and immediacy of \nthis problem. Our Nation is under attack.\n  I came today from a meeting with one of the major accounting and \nconsulting companies in the United States, whose name would be \nimmediately recognizable to you, and by happenstance, sheer \ncoincidence, he said to me that his company is attacked literally 1,000 \ntimes a day. His company has information that is intensely valuable and \nprivate and has taken steps to safeguard itself. But the magnitude of \nthis attack on this single company and others like it that may have \nintellectual property lost to this country if it gets stolen by hackers \nand by other nations reflects the seriousness and importance of this \nissue.\n  Time is not on our side. We must act immediately. The Senate must \nfollow its duty and make sure we meet the challenge, No. 1, of bringing \ntogether all the stakeholders to enhance the resiliency of our critical \ninfrastructure systems. Much of this infrastructure lies beyond the \npurview of the Federal Government. Cybersecurity is a major concern of \nboth the government and the private sector. There must be a partnership \nbetween them; it is not for either to do alone.\n  Today, the computers that control energy and manufacturing, water, \nand chemical facilities across the country are connected via the \nInternet. None of them is an island. No one is an island in the \nInternet age. We are all under attack when any one of us is under \nattack.\n  I believe we have a path forward to strengthen protection of our \nNation's network industrial control systems without heavyhanded \nregulation and in partnership with the businesses that own the systems. \nMany are already pursuing best practices. Many already are addressing \nthis threat. And my hope is that the legislation coming forward as a \nresult of the leadership by my colleagues here today will make sure \nthese best practices become common practices and uniform to every \nindustry so that access to controls and audits and monitoring is done \nsystemically.\n  Finally, let me emphasize--and I think this point is especially \ncritical to many who are watching this process today--we can make \nprogress in strengthening the privacy and civil liberties protection in \ncybersecurity while preserving its underlying goal of safeguarding the \nNation.\n  Americans have become aware of the need to protect online privacy. As \nI\n\n[[Page S5194]]\n\nhave seen personally in my contacts with the citizens of Connecticut, \nthey are outraged and fearful about frequent reports of massive data \nbreaches and the theft of personal information as a result of the very \nhacking that threatens private industry and the government. Hacking and \nspear phishing attacks that have become a daily occurrence in our lives \nthreaten our privacy, our financial integrity, and our security.\n  A recent United Technologies National Journal poll found that 62 \npercent of respondents believe that government and businesses should \nnot be allowed at all to share information because it would hurt \nprivacy and civil liberties. That same poll found that 67 percent of \nthose surveyed said they were either very or somewhat concerned about \nthreats to our country's computer networks. The two anxieties go hand \nin hand, they fit together, and we must find a path forward on this \nlegislation reconciling these views.\n  I personally believe this cybersecurity is compatible with privacy \nprotection and with the liberties--including the liberty to go to court \nand protect the individual rights--that are so integral and fundamental \nto our constitutional protections and American civil liberties. We can \nmake sure adequate protections are in place.\n  Again, this task is one we must address--and address it now.\n  I again thank the Senator from Rhode Island, and I yield to him.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Let me welcome Senator Blunt to the discussion and \ninvite him to chime in now. He has been a very important voice in the \nbipartisan discussions on how we can find a proper way to protect \nAmerican privately owned critical infrastructure. He is a consummately \nexperienced legislator from the House and has been a great addition to \nthe Senate, and we welcome him to the discussion.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his kind \ncomments.\n  I wish to comment on a couple of things that have been said, and one \nby my friend from Connecticut that there are competing concerns here \nand they don't need to be mutually exclusive at all.\n  When we talk about cybersecurity, we are not talking about the \ngovernment somehow securing everything that happens in the cyber world; \nwe are talking about, what are the things we can identify and agree on \nas critical infrastructure? There is a lot of security about what \nhappens on the military cyberspace, dot-mil, and a lot of comfort about \nwhat happens in the government part, the dot-gov. What we are concerned \nabout is what is outside those two networks that doesn't have the kind \nof protection those networks have, not about controlling everything--in \nfact, about defining specifically in the most limited way possible what \nis critical to the ongoing daily operation of the country. Senator \nMikulski talked about that. She also said that if something happens, \nthere is no telling what kind of legislation will pass. And I couldn't \nagree more with that comment in every way I can think of.\n  We are going to pass a cybersecurity bill at some time, I believe, in \nthe not too distant future, and it will either be in the kind of \nenvironment the four Senators along with me here on the floor have been \nworking to create, where we do this in the most thoughtful way, we do \nthis in a way that has taken time to bring people together and have a \ndiscussion, or in a post-cyber attack moment, like a post-9/11 moment, \nand who knows what we might do. I think Senator Mikulski said wisely \nand rightly that it will go further than it should go and it will cost \nmore than it should cost because then we are reacting, and that is what \nwe need to avoid.\n  We can do this in the right way or the wrong way, and the wrong way \nwould be waiting too long. The right way is to do this now. You don't \nhave to be well read into the intelligence community. I have a chance \nto be on that committee with Senator Mikulski. I served on the House \ncommittee when Senator Whitehouse was on the Senate committee and know \nthey have long been advocates of securing this part of our \nvulnerability. But you don't have to be on the Intelligence Committee \nor even have access to the information that all Senators have to know \nthat this is believed to be our greatest area of vulnerability. And why \nis it? Because it involves everything. It involves how we communicate, \nit involves how we get gasoline, and it involves how we power \neverything from the drinking water system to the electricity at home.\n  A windstorm created all kinds of problems. Two different 30-minute-\nor-so stops on the Metro system in the Washington area because the \nscreen went blank caused all kinds of problems. Imagine that multiplied \nby whatever multiple you want to use, and the country would quickly not \nbe functioning in any way--traffic in Washington, traffic anywhere in \nthe country, trying to get from one gas station to the other only to \nfind out that, by the way, the gas pumps don't work because the \nelectricity is out and your car doesn't have enough gas.\n  This is a huge problem. How do we define that critical \ninfrastructure, and how do we do that in a way that is the most \nresponsible, as Senator Blumenthal said, protecting civil liberties at \nthe same time that we are carefully carving out that spot where \ngovernment does have some obligation to make that area secure, and if \nwe can do that in a way that encourages people to get into that \nenvironment.\n  One of the things Senator Coons has been talking about--a former \nlocal government executive who knows all of the impact of police and \nfire and the court system and everything else he had to be responsible \nfor, as well as his private sector work--has brought real value to this \ndiscussion. Somebody told me the other day, if you are in almost any \nkind of business, you have either been attacked, are going to be \nattacked, or you are being attacked right now as people are trying to \nfigure out--maybe for malicious purposes, maybe just to see if they can \ndo it--how they can get into your system. And Senator Coons has been so \nhelpful in these discussions. I would like to hear what his thinking \ntoday is on this and where you are, talking about this on the floor.\n  Mr. COONS. I very much thank Senator Blunt. Thank you for helping to \ncontribute to the bipartisan, positive tone of our deliberations. I \nthank my friend, the Senator from Rhode Island, for his leadership both \nin today's colloquy and in pulling together the language and partners, \nand Senator Mikulski, who started off our conversation today by \nreminding us as Senator Blunt has that it was a terrible storm in this \narea that knocked out power for a couple of days that gave a bracing \nreminder to the community around Washington, DC, just how much we rely \nin this modern economy of ours, on continuous, uninterrupted power.\n  That storm was an act of God. That storm was a random meteorological \nevent. But as all of us have spoken--Senator Blumenthal also commented \non this--we know as Members of the Senate that there are daily efforts \nat attacks on the United States far more devastating, far more far-\nreaching than that transitory storm. For us not to act, for us to fail \nto act in a bipartisan, thoughtful, and responsible way would be the \nworst sort of dereliction of duty.\n  All of us have been in secure briefings with folks from four-star and \nthree-letter agencies with the most central roles in our intelligence \ncommunity, in our national security agencies. But this is not something \nthat only those of us in the Congress know or only those in the higher \nreaches of executive branch leadership know. This is now broadly, \npublicly well known. The water is rising, the storms are coming, and we \nneed to incentivize the private sector that is responsible for running \nmost of our essential infrastructure to man the barricades, to fill the \nsandbags, and to take on the responsibility in a thoughtful, balanced, \nand responsible way of preparing for the wave of highly effective \ncyber-attacks that are currently underway and that will crescendo soon.\n  We have heard public comments that are remarkable. The Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs, General Dempsey, has said an effective cyber-attack \ncould literally stop society in its tracks. As Senator Blunt mentioned, \nas a county executive I was responsible for emergency response, and all \nover this country cities, counties, and States are trying to understand \nhow to prepare for the consequences of a cyber-attack.\n  We are not talking about trying to craft legislation that would deal \nwith\n\n[[Page S5195]]\n\nevery possible cyber harm, every possible cyber crime. We are talking \nabout those few incidents that would be likely driven by a nation state \nor by a terribly advanced and sophisticated terrorist group that would \nstrike at the very heart of what makes our modern society vibrant and \nthat would have mass casualty consequences, dramatic impact on our \neconomy, or wipe out whole sectors for days or weeks, such as a failure \nof the power grid.\n  This is not exotic. We just had another public hearing on the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee and were warned yet again of what the \nDepartment of Homeland Security documented back in 2007 in their Aurora \nexercise, that our power grid, nationally interconnected, vital to the \nmodern economy, is fragile, is vulnerable to cyber-attacks. We have \nseen this unfold overseas. The small Baltic nation of Estonia was the \nvictim of a comprehensive cyber-attack. They saw also in 2007 banks, \nmedia outlets, government entities that collapsed, bank cards, mobile \nphones, government services over a 3-week period completely shut down.\n  Is there a real threat? Absolutely. Are we doing enough to face it? I \ndon't think so. I don't think we have yet done enough. There is \nlegislation that has been brought forward by a whole group of Senators \nled by Senators Lieberman and Collins that I hope this body will turn \nto in the days ahead and find ways to balance. As Senator Blumenthal \nsaid previously, we live in a country where we must continue to respect \nthe powerful, passionate commitment to individual privacy and civil \nliberties. But I think we can, with narrowly targeted, appropriately \ncrafted legislation that incentivizes and encourages the private \nsector, take on the role, appropriately informed by those from \nthroughout Federal Government, to strengthen their defenses against \nthese coming attacks. I don't think we have to make a choice between \nprivacy and security and I do think we can give the private sector the \ntools to make our country safe and strong.\n  But those who view new cyber regulations as onerous, as burdensome, \nas overly expensive for the private sector, as threatening needlessly \nour privacy, have an obligation to come forward with a credible \nalternative before it is too late.\n  Today we are, frankly, leaving our country wide open to attack. As we \nrecently heard in floor speeches by both Senator Blumenthal and Senator \nWhitehouse, when private sector companies, even the most technically \nsophisticated, are contacted by our government and told they have been \nthe victim of a successful intrusion and attack, in nearly 90 percent \nof the cases they were utterly unaware. We need to strengthen \ninformation sharing. We need to develop robust standards of defense. We \nneed to help invest in building up the infrastructure protection of \nthis country, and it is the most vital thing I can think of that this \ncountry could turn to.\n  Let me close with this for my moment, if I could. I had a chance to \nhave lunch last week with Senator Daniel Inouye. That was for me a \ngreat honor, a chance to sit with him and visit and ask his advice. He \nmade one comment to me in closing. He is the only Member of this body \nwho was at Pearl Harbor. He shared with me that in his view the next \nPearl Harbor, the next unexpected massive attack that could hurt the \nUnited States, will come from cyber. It is our obligation to take that \nlesson seriously and to legislate in a bipartisan, thoughtful but swift \nand effective way.\n  So, I say to Senator Whitehouse, I am grateful for his leadership of \nour efforts in this regard.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I agree with Senator Coons, and more important than \nme agreeing with him, the Secretary of Defense of the United States of \nAmerica agrees with him. He has said, ``The next Pearl Harbor we \nconfront could very well be a cyberattack,'' and that is an exact \nquote.\n  I wish to turn back to Senator Mikulski for a moment, as the person \nwho is in charge of the appropriations for these key agencies, because \nthere is a sense in some quarters that if you leave the private sector \non its own to do this, they will be fine. I think the evidence we have \nheard in a series of hearings that Senator Mikulski, Senator Blunt, \nmyself, and Senator Kyl cochaired, bipartisan hearings--Senator Coons \ncame to virtually all of them, and to their great credit Senator \nLieberman and Senator Collins came to virtually all of them--the \ntestimony we heard was that was not the case.\n  Some of the public commentary, our Deputy Secretary of Defense Ashton \nCarter says:\n\n       There is a market failure at work here . . . companies are \n     not willing to admit vulnerabilities to themselves, or \n     publicly to shareholders, in such a way as to support the \n     necessary investments or lead their peers down a certain path \n     of investment and all that would follow.\n\n  That is a bipartisan sentiment. Mike Chertoff, who is the former head \nof DHS, said:\n\n       The marketplace is likely to fail in allocating the correct \n     amount of investment to manage risk across the breadth of the \n     networks on which our society relies.\n\n  Senator Coons pointed out 9 out of 10 of the companies contacted by \nthe NCI JTF, when they became aware they were attacked, had no idea \nthey had been attacked.\n  I will turn to Senator Mikulski to make her comment on this. It is a \npublic-private partnership here.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank Senator Whitehouse for what he said and the \nfact we really had a great study group, both sides of the aisle eager \nfor information, eager to come up with the best policies.\n  Much has been said about the private sector. I talk to the private \nsector a lot because of our work on the committees, and the private \nsector is looking for leadership. They are looking for a framework. \nThey worry that overregulation could be both costly and strangulating; \nwould we be so prescriptive that we mandate--first of all, that we \nmandate, and that we essentially mandate dated technology because this \nis a fast-moving, evolving field. They are looking for us to give a \nlegislative framework where they could work with their government on \nwhat they want to bring to the table and feel free, because of certain \nproprietary concerns, to do it.\n  I talked to people who have responsibility for delivering power in \nMaryland. They are working. Edison Institute, which represents \nessentially the electric companies and the grid, would like us to have \na framework. They want to be at the table. They want to know who is in \ncharge, who do you call, what do you do in the event of an attack.\n  When you say to them how can we prevent the attack, they say that is \nwhere we need government, to tell us where you think we are heading, to \nbring the great Federal labs to bear with their ideas and how do you do \nthis in a way that encourages not whatever government is going to do \nbut voluntary efforts, but voluntary efforts with some teeth, some \nstandards to be met--standards that are not prescriptive, that could be \ndated, but again the ever evolving of the state of science.\n  I think we have the elements. Where the problem is, is not do we know \nwhat to do, but the problem is are we going to do it and can we put \naside where we make the perfect the enemy of the good. Colin Powell had \na great phrase: ``America always needs to seek the sensible center.'' \nThat is what I am talking about here. I want to protect civil \nliberties. I certainly do want to protect civil liberties. But you know \nthe first civil liberty is that you can turn your lights on, and when \nyou go to bed you know your refrigerator is going to be working; the \nstoplights are going to be working when you wake up the next day; or if \nyour child is at school or at camp, you are going to be able to get to \nthat child, and that 911 is going to be working if you call 911. That \nis civil liberty. It means you can function in a free and democratic \nsociety but that you are not terrified that you are literally in the \ndark, you are literally in the cold, you have no power politically, you \nhave no power with electricity. It is all because we failed that.\n  I think we can do that. I think Senators Lieberman and Collins have \ngiven us a great only starting point. I think to use the language of \nour future Super Bowl champions, the Ravens, which will happen, we are \nbeyond the 50-yard line. We can do this.\n  I hope in the spirit we came here today, we need a sense of urgency, \nwe need a bipartisan effort, and we need the will to serve America and \nput that interest first.\n\n[[Page S5196]]\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Senator Blunt.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I think Senator Mikulski made the case so well here, too. \nWhen we looked at this, when we have gone through exercises, the power \ngrid is where you go first because it is the most dramatic, I suppose. \nBut there are so many other places you could go--the description of the \nfinancial networks. Suddenly business stops. I was making a list here. \nWe were talking of the kinds of things that could be at risk through \nsome kind of cyber-attack--everything from electromagnetic pulse attack \nto literally a cyber-attack that comes into these various networks.\n  There are 111 powerplants in Missouri. In our State alone, there are \n111 powerplants. They are all in some way or another hooked into the \ngrid. They can be disabled in a significant way. I was talking to a \nfriend of mine who, during the last few days, was in West Virginia with \ntheir family. Driving to West Virginia, the electricity was out and \nthey began to see abandoned cars because nobody could get to a gas \nstation, and if they could get to a gas station, it was closed. So \nthere were cars all over the place. That is assuming you can even get \nout of the traffic mess you would be in in more urban areas. But where \nwould you go? What would you do? The desperation we understand. It \nwould be something that is preventable if we prevent it. It is \nsomething that is preventable in ways that--particularly Senator \nWhitehouse has been thoughtful in putting together ideas of how you \nencourage people to voluntarily want to get into this space, to where \nthey have assistance that they would not otherwise have, where they \nhave assurances that they have done everything they could do to prevent \nthis from happening.\n  Frankly, if we do everything we can do to prevent this from \nhappening, there is a chance it will not happen. But if we do not, \nthere is certainty it will happen. We know that. I am glad my \ncolleagues are here. I hope the Senate turns to this issue and we have \na full and free debate because if we are united on this in a bipartisan \nway, that finds that sensible answer Senator Mikulski was talking \nabout.\n  Senator Whitehouse.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the Senator from Missouri. I will wrap up by \nmaking three points and I will make them briefly. I have given remarks \nat greater length in these areas before so I think my position on this \nis pretty clear.\n  One is, protecting our critical infrastructure, the privately owned \nsystems our way of life depends on, is the weak point we need to \naddress. We do well with dot-mil, we do well with dot-gov. The \ngovernment has the authority to provide all of its resources to protect \nthose. We don't particularly care about ordinary Web sites, about chat \nrooms--we do not want to interfere with those anyway. It is just the \ncritical infrastructure that is important, the privately held \ninfrastructure. We really need to work on that. The warnings from our \nnational security leaders are across the board: Secretary of Defense \nPanetta, NSA Cyber Command and Director Keith Alexander, Director of \nNational Intelligence Clapper, Secretary of Homeland Security Janet \nNapolitano, Attorney General Holder, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff Mark Dempsey have all clearly expressed the danger of this \nthreat.\n  The second point, it is bipartisan. The former Director of National \nIntelligence and NSA Director Mike McConnell has said:\n\n       The United States is fighting a cyber-war today, and we are \n     losing. It's that simple. As the most wired nation on Earth, \n     we offer the most targets of significance, yet our cyber-\n     defenses are woefully lacking. . . . [W]ith cybersecurity, \n     the time to start was yesterday.\n\n  Former Assistant Secretary for Policy at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity Baker said:\n\n       We must begin now to protect our critical infrastructure \n     from attack.\n\n  A great number of national security officials, bipartisan, wrote a \nletter to us in the Senate and said:\n\n       The threat is only going to get worse. Inaction is not an \n     acceptable option.\n       Protection of our critical infrastructure is essential in \n     order to effectively protect our national and economic \n     security from the growing cyber threat.\n\n  As I said earlier in introducing Senator Mikulski, there is indeed a \nmarket failure that has been identified in a bipartisan fashion. The \nfacts prove it because so often when public or private sector folks \nrespond to an intrusion, they find 90 percent of the time the company \nhad no idea it was hacked.\n  Even the Chamber of Commerce was hacked and had Chinese infiltrators \nwith access to all of their computers for months. When the Aurora bug \nhit Google and others, only 3 out of 30 companies were aware of it. So \nthe private sector does need a supportive government. We, in turn, from \nthe government side have to make sure the burden is not unreasonable \nand make sure we are doing this in as light, as sensible, and voluntary \nas is possible and consistent with the mission of actually protecting \nour cybersecurity.\n  In the Bush administration, the Assistant Attorney General was Jack \nGoldsmith, who is now at the Harvard Law School. He has written about \nthis very issue. He wrote:\n\n       [T]he government is the only institution with the resources \n     and the incentives to ensure that the [critical \n     infrastructure] on which we all depend is secure, and we must \n     find a way for it to meet its responsibilities.\n\n  I thank Senator Mikulski, Senator Blunt, Senator Blumenthal, and \nSenator Coons for participating in this colloquy today. I thank our \ngroup and the group I just mentioned. In addition I would like to thank \nSenator Kyl, Senator Graham, and Senator Coats for the bipartisan work \nthat has been done to try to find a way forward to protect critical \ninfrastructure.\n  Again, I thank Senator Blunt, Senator Kyl, and Senator Mikulski for \nthe series of private briefs and classified briefings that have helped \nbuild the momentum toward this effort.\n  I think we can get this done. It is essential we do. I appreciate the \nwork of my colleagues in making this happen.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Global Warming\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I come to the floor most every week to \ndiscuss the issue that I think is the one that Members of Congress in \nthis era are most likely to be judged on in the future; that is, the \nrelentless carbon pollution of our atmosphere that we are engaged in \nand the changes in our climate and in our oceans that are very visibly \nhappening as a result.\n  I know there are many interests in Washington that would prefer us to \nignore this issue, but just because they ignore it and just because \nthey want us to ignore it doesn't mean it is going anywhere. The \ncountry, as we have heard in the last few weeks, has baked in record \nheat. I think it was Bloomberg News that described the Midwest farmers \nas farming in hell. It has been scorched by drought, driven by \nunprecedented wildfires, and that has resulted in an increasing amount \nof chatter in the news and even some conversation on the Senate floor \nabout climate change.\n  Some have tried to say there is no relation, but I want to talk a \nlittle bit about the science of what we see happening around our \ncountry and around the world.\n  There is an interesting report that I would mention. I am not going \nto put it in the Record because it is too large. It is called ``The \nState of the Climate in 2011,'' a special supplement to the bulletin of \nthe American Meteorological Society.\n  What we see is that 2012 is shaping up to look a lot like 2011, which \nDeputy NOAA Administrator Kathryn Sullivan called ``a year of extreme \nevents, both in the United States and around the world.'' The report I \njust showed is a peer-reviewed report. It was compiled by 37 scientists \nfrom 48 countries.\n  As explained by Dr. Sullivan, and I quote her:\n\n       Every weather event that happens now takes place in the \n     context of a changing global environment. This annual report \n     provides scientists and citizens alike with an analysis of \n     what has happened so we can all prepare for what is to come.\n\n  Here are some of the highlights from the American Meteorological \nSociety report. The first generally is that\n\n[[Page S5197]]\n\nwarm temperature trends are continuing. Four independent datasets show \n2011 was one of the 15 warmest years since recordkeeping began in the \nlate 19th century, and yet one of the coolest since 2008. The average \ntemperature for 2011 was higher than the 30-year annual average \ntemperature. The Arctic continued to warm at about twice the rate \ncompared with lower latitudes.\n  On the opposite pole, the South Pole Station recorded its all-time \nhighest temperature of 9.9 degrees Fahrenheit on December 25, Christmas \nDay, breaking the previous record for warm weather around the South \nPole by more than 2 degrees.\n  So the warm temperature trends continue. The other major finding of \nthe report is that greenhouse gases continue to climb. Major greenhouse \ngas concentrations like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide \ncontinued to rise. Carbon dioxide steadily increased in 2011, and the \nyearly global average exceeded 390 parts per million for the first time \nsince instrumental records began. This represents an increase of 2.10 \nparts per million over the previous year.\n  I would note that the Arctic sampling stations have for the first \ntime in history recorded concentrations over 400 parts per million. \nThat is an ominous number because the Arctic tends to be the leading \nedge for these indicators. There is no evidence that natural emissions \nof methane in the Arctic have increased significantly during the last \ndecade, so they have not yet contributed to this steady increase. But \nthere could be significant increases of methane in the future as the \ntundra thaws and as methane captured under the permafrost is released.\n  Arctic sea ice is decreasing. Arctic sea ice extent was below average \nfor all of 2011 and has been since June of 2001. It is a span of 127 \nconsecutive months through December of 2011. Both the maximum ice \nextent, which was 5.67 million square miles on March 7, and the minimum \nextent, 1.67 square miles on September 9, were the second smallest \nmeasurements for maximum and for minimum of the satellite era.\n  A fourth finding is that sea surface temperature and ocean heat \ncontent continue to rise. Even with La Nina conditions occurring during \nmost of the year, the 2011 global sea surface temperature was among the \n12 highest years on record. Ocean heat content measured from the \nsurface down to 2,300 feet deep continued to rise since records again \nbeing taken in 1993, and ocean heat content was at a record high.\n  In addition to putting 2011 into the context of these longer trends \nand timelines, the researchers from NOAA and the U.K. Meteorological \nOffice also examined the link between climate change and extreme \nweather events that occurred in 2011. Here is what they say:\n\n       In the past it was often stated that it simply was not \n     possible to make an attribution statement about an individual \n     weather or climate event. However, scientific thinking on \n     this issue has moved on and now it is widely accepted--\n\n  Widely accepted--\n\n     that attribution statements about individual weather or \n     climate events are possible, provided proper account is taken \n     of the probabilistic nature of attribution.\n\n  So let me be clear. It is still not correct to say that any weather \nevent specifically is or is not directly caused by climate change. \nHowever, what these researchers have done is evaluate methods to see if \nthe probability of this event occurring has changed by a particular \npercentage given the changing climate. Have we, in effect, loaded the \ndice in our atmosphere to make extreme weather events more likely? And \nnot only have we loaded the dice, but how loaded are the dice? How are \nthe odds changing?\n  This paper evaluated six events from last year, and here are some of \nthose findings:\n  La Nina-related heat waves such as that experienced in Texas in 2011 \nare now 20 times more likely to occur during La Nina today than during \nLa Nina years 50 years ago. So we have loaded the dice for these events \nto happen during the La Nina years by a factor of 20. That is a pretty \nheavy increase.\n  Researchers evaluated a very warm November that the United Kingdom \nexperienced in 2011. They found that warm Novembers are now 62 times \nmore likely for the region. Again, not only are the dice loaded for \nunusual weather events, they are loaded with big numbers.\n  The next month, December 2011, was very cold. Researchers found that \ncold Decembers were 50 percent less likely to occur now versus 50 years \nago.\n  Moving on to 2012, I wish to mention another event that happened this \nweek. On Monday, researchers at the University of Delaware and the \nCanadian Ice Service reported that a 46-square-mile chunk of ice broke \noff from the Petermann Glacier on the northwest coast of Greenland. \nThis piece of ice is two times the size of Manhattan. In August 2010, a \npiece four times the size of Manhattan separated from the glacier. This \nmost recent breakoff of the Petermann Glacier puts the glacier's end \npoint where it has not been for 150 years.\n  Andreas Muenchow, a researcher at the University of Delaware, said:\n\n       The Greenland ice sheet as a whole is shrinking, melting \n     and reducing in size as a result of globally changing air and \n     ocean temperatures and associated changes in circulation \n     patterns in both the ocean and the atmosphere.\n\n  When we change the temperature, we change the circulation patterns. \nThose go hand in hand.\n  Relatedly, an article published in Science magazine examined data \nfrom not the Arctic areas but the tropic areas from coral reefs around \nthe world. The researchers concluded that sea levels during the last \nwarming period, which is most similar to today's climate, were roughly \n18 to 30 feet higher than today. That is about 6 to 10 feet higher than \nprevious estimates had projected. The likely culprit: more melting of \nthe Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets than was previously assumed.\n  All of this evidence, these changing trends and emerging science \nevaluating increased probability of extreme weather events, ought to be \nenough for us to consider limiting our greenhouse gas emissions. It \nought to be enough of a warning for us to stop what is presently an \nuncontrolled experiment that we are conducting on our planet. We should \ndo this while we still can.\n  Yet, unfortunately, there are special interests in Washington who \ndeny that carbon pollution causes global temperatures to rise; deny \nthat melting icecaps destabilize our climate so that regions face \nextreme drought or outsized precipitation events; deny that they have \nany responsibility to do anything about this. These special interests \nhave a strong grip on Washington and on Congress. They pretend to us \nand to the American public that the jury is actually still out on \nclimate change caused by carbon pollution, that we should wait, we \nshould let them continue with business as usual and wait for the \nverdict to come in. Well, they are wrong. The jury is not still out. \nThe verdict is, indeed, in, and their claims to the contrary are, \nfrankly, outright false.\n  This is a pattern, actually, that has manifested itself with other \nindustries in the past. The lead paint industry, the tobacco industry, \nand others have all had legions of scientists who have been willing to \nmanufacture enough doubt about the danger of the product--tobacco is \nsafe to smoke, lead paint won't hurt children, that sort of thing--so \nas to delay public safety action that would protect the public from \ntheir product. They obviously have a motive in doing that because they \nwant to keep selling their product and keep making profits, but the \ncost has been terribly high to the public when we have listened to that \nkind of science. Unfortunately, we are listening to that now again. We \nshould not be fooled. The vast overwhelming bulk of scientists agree \nthat climate change is happening and that human activities are the \ndriving cause of this change.\n  When I give these talks, I often refer to a paragraph from a letter \nwe received in Congress in October of 2009. The letter was very \npowerfully stated, particularly when we consider the cautious way in \nwhich scientists ordinarily couch their findings. Here is what the \nletter said:\n\n       Observations throughout the world make it clear--\n\n  Clear is the word they use--\n\n     that climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific \n     research demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by \n     human activities are the primary driver. These conclusions \n     are based on multiple independent lines of evidence--\n\n\n[[Page S5198]]\n\n\n  And they close with this--\n\n     and contrary assertions are inconsistent with an objective \n     assessment of the vast body of peer-reviewed science.\n\n  In other words, if we look at the peer-reviewed science, the body of \nscience, objectively, one cannot reach those conclusions. Those \ncontrary assertions are inconsistent with an objective assessment. \nClearly, subjective assessments are different, but subjective \nassessments we should discount because of the motives that lie behind \nthem.\n  The letter I just quoted was signed by an enormous number of very \nprestigious scientific organizations, from the American Association of \nthe Advancement of Science, to the American Chemical Society, the \nGeophysical Union, Institute of Biological Science, Meteorological \nSociety, Society of Agronomy, American Plant Biologists, the Ecological \nSociety of America, the Organization of Biological Field Stations, Soil \nScience Society of America, and an immense group of very respectable \norganizations not gathered together for the purposes of argument about \nclimate change but who have a responsibility to their scientific \ncommunities to be accurate. These are highly esteemed scientific \norganizations. They know the jury is not still out. They know that the \nverdict is, in fact, in and that it is time we did something about it. \nIt is really irresponsible and nonsensical for us not to.\n  The science on this goes back to the Civil War. It was a scientist \nnamed John Tyndall, an Irish scientist practicing in England, who \ndetermined that carbon dioxide and water, when they were trapped in the \natmosphere, had a blanketing effect and would trap heat in the \natmosphere--the basic principle of global warming.\n  In 1955, the year I was born, a textbook called ``Our Astonishing \nAtmosphere'' said the following:\n\n       Nearly a century ago, scientist John Tyndall suggested that \n     a fall in the atmospheric carbon dioxide could allow the \n     Earth to cool, whereas a rise in carbon dioxide would make it \n     warmer.\n\n  If that was century-old information the year I was born, then I think \nit is entitled to some credence around here.\n  Of course, we are observing these changes. Let me put one into \ncontext, and then I will yield the floor. That one is that 390-parts-\nper-million figure I alluded to earlier. For the last 8,000 centuries--\n800,000 years--we have been able to measure what the range was of \ncarbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere, and for all that period, \n800,000 years, it has been between 170 parts per million and 300 parts \nper million. So 170 to 300 is the range. So when we are out of that not \nby a little bit but by a lot--we are already to 390, and in the Arctic \nwe have hit 400--this is measurement, by the way, not theory--that is \nsomething to be worried about because when we look back at history, \nbefore 800,000 years ago, back into previous geological events, we find \nthat these high carbon concentrations are associated with really \ndramatic die-offs, very hostile environments for human occupation.\n  Of course, we have never had that experience because we have really \nonly been around on this planet for probably less than 200,000 years. \nWe only started scratching the soil, planting things and developing \nagriculture, 10,000 years ago. So 800,000 years ago is a long time, and \nthe safe bandwidths our species has developed within during that \n800,000 years is something that we should not be so frivolous about \nflying outside of to the tune of now hitting 390 parts per million. \nThere will be consequences that will be grave.\n  We are already seeing consequences that are grave. Our ocean is \nacidifying in unprecedented ways. If we are looking for a first \ncatastrophe to ensue, it is as likely to be through the acidification \nof our oceans as it is through climate and through the damage that an \nacidic ocean can do to small creatures, particularly those at the very \nbottom of the food chain, the ones all the others eat. Let me put it \nthis way: It is a hard thing for an animal to succeed and survive in a \nphysical environment in which it is soluble.\n  So I see a colleague on the floor, and I will yield to him. I \nappreciate the attention of the Senate to this issue, and I hope the \nday will come soon when we can wrench ourselves free of the grip of the \nspecial interests and do something serious about this looming threat.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                          Progrowth Tax Reform\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I rise today to discuss the need for progrowth tax \nreform. I came to the floor last week, I have been here this week on \nthe subject, and I am here again today to talk about the need to get \nstarted and get going right now on the progrowth tax reform that will \nunleash private investment in this country and help us grow our economy \nand create jobs for the more than 13 million people we have unemployed \ntoday.\n  The current Tax Code changes at the end of the year. If we fail to \nact, the current Tax Code changes. That is a fact. Simply put, tax \nrates go up. The income tax rates rise. Capital gains taxes go up. The \ndeath tax goes up.\n  Today, we voted on a measure regarding outsourcing. Its goal was to \nencourage U.S. companies to invest and hire workers in the United \nStates rather than overseas. But, at best--at best--that is a piecemeal \napproach. The reality is, the tax increases that will occur at the end \nof the year will do far more to drive investment and employment \noverseas than any measure like the one we considered today. Those \nincreases to the tax rates on small businesses across this country will \nhave a much bigger impact than any single measure like the one that was \noffered today.\n  So think about it. By not extending the current tax rates, we will \nhave a business climate that makes it harder to do business in this \ncountry. It seems to me that makes the solution pretty simple. Let's \nextend the current tax rates for 1 year, and let's set up a process to \nengage in progrowth tax reform that will empower small businesses--\nmillions of small businesses across this country--to do what they do \nbest; that is, to invest and hire people, to put Americans back to \nwork.\n  The question is, Why aren't we doing it? By setting up a process to \nundertake comprehensive, progrowth tax reform over the next year, \neveryone has a chance to provide their input and to provide their \nideas, to offer their legislation, Republicans and Democrats alike. In \nfact, formats have already been proposed, formats such as Simpson-\nBowles, Domenici-Rivlin, groups such as the Gang of 6 and others that \nhave put forward different concepts. So there is absolutely no reason \nto wait.\n  The question is not are we or are we not going to do it. The reality \nis, we have to do it. The reality is we have to do it to get our \neconomy going. So let's get started. President Obama needs to join with \nus in this effort. Look at our economy. Look at the statistics since \nPresident Obama took office.\n  Unemployment. We have 8.2 percent unemployment. Unemployment has been \nover 8 percent for 41 straight months. We have 13 million people in \nthis country unemployed--13 million people in this country looking for \nwork--and we have another 10 million who are underemployed; that is, 23 \nmillion people either unemployed or underemployed.\n  Middle class income. Middle class income has declined from \napproximately $55,000 annually to $50,000 since the current \nadministration took office.\n  Food stamps. Food stamp usage has increased dramatically, from 32 \nmillion recipients to 46 million recipients.\n  Home values. Home values have dropped. Home values have dropped, on \naverage, from $169,000 to $148,000.\n  Economic growth. GDP, gross domestic product, growth is the weakest \nfor any recovery since World War II.\n  Job creation last month. Mr. President, 80,000 jobs were created. But \nit takes 150,000 jobs each and every month just to keep up with \npopulation growth to actually reduce the unemployment rate.\n  So these facts speak for themselves. These are the facts. The \nPresident's approach to our economy is making it worse, and his failure \nto join with us to extend the lower tax rates and engage in progrowth \ntax reform is sitting on our economy like a big wet blanket. But we can \nchange that. We can change that right now. We can change that by \nextending the current tax rates and by together, on a bipartisan basis, \nwith the administration, joining in a process to put in place progrowth \ntax reform and at the same time getting control of our spending.\n\n[[Page S5199]]\n\n  Business investment and economic activity would respond immediately. \nLook at the latest information from the Congressional Budget Office, \nthe CBO. The CBO projects the economy will contract--will contract--by \n1.3 percent on an annualized rate for the first 6 months of next year, \nmeeting the definition of ``recession'' if the fiscal cliff we now face \nis not addressed. Overall, the economy, based on the CBO projection for \nnext year, would grow by only one-half of 1 percent for the entire \nyear. That compares to a 4.4-percent growth rate for next year if the \nfiscal cliff is avoided.\n  Granted, that fiscal cliff includes not only addressing the tax \nincreases that would go into effect but also sequestration. But we have \nput forward ideas to address sequestration as well. Clearly, the tax \npiece is a huge part of what drives that difference in economic \ngrowth--the difference between one-half of 1 percent and over 4 percent \neconomic growth next year.\n  Think of what that means in terms of employment to the people who are \nlooking for a job. Think of what that means in terms of growth in the \neconomy and revenue growth to help address our deficit and our debt. \nAll that stands to reason because business needs certainty. Business \nneeds certainty to invest, to grow, to hire more people.\n  With legal, tax, and regulatory certainty--not more government \nspending but with legal, tax, and regulatory certainty, businesses in \nthis country will invest and grow and put people back to work. There is \nmore cash, there is more private capital on the sidelines now than ever \nbefore in our history. With the uncertainty about what the Tax Code is \ngoing to be, that investment will continue to be sidelined rather than \ndeployed in ventures that will create jobs.\n  The longer we go, the more uncertainty. That means slow economic \ngrowth; that means higher unemployment; that means more people out of \nwork rather than finding a job; and it means less revenue to help \nreduce our deficit and our debt. Clearly, that is not the way to go.\n  President Obama, however, says: But wait a minute. Everyone needs to \npay their fair share. So he is proposing tax increases on that basis. \nOf course, everyone needs to pay their fair share. But the way to \nensure that gets accomplished is with progrowth tax reform and closing \nloopholes. That is exactly what we have proposed--not by raising taxes \non more than 1 million small businesses across this country, which is \nwhat the President has proposed.\n  Let's extend the current tax rates for 1 year. Let's set up a process \nto pass comprehensive, progrowth tax reform that lowers rates, closes \nloopholes, that is fairer, that is simpler and that will generate \nrevenue to reduce our deficit and our debt through economic growth \nrather than through higher taxes. In reality, that is the only way we \nwill get our economy going, and that along with controlling our \nspending will reduce our deficit and our debt and it will put Americans \nback to work.\n  Leadership is all about finding common ground. President Obama needs \nto join with us to find common ground on this issue. We have offered \nit. We are offering it right now. I hope the President will join with \nus in this endeavor. It is simple. It is straightforward. It is what \nthe American people want and what they need and we need to get started \nright now.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Campus Debit Cards\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there was a troubling report recently \nreleased by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. It is entitled \n``The Campus Debit Card Trap.'' The report from PIRG documents how \ncolleges and universities across the country have signed deals with \nfinancial service companies to provide campus debit cards and prepaid \ncredit cards to students.\n  Sometimes these debit cards are linked to a student checking account, \nand many times the school's name will appear on the card. In some \ncases, the student ID card is turned into a bank debit card. We are \nalso seeing colleges and universities make deals in which banks issue \nprepaid debit cards to make financial aid disbursements to students.\n  When they are managed appropriately, debit and prepaid cards can be a \ngood thing for students. It can give them an effective way to conduct \ntransactions and receive their student aid payments. But, \nunfortunately, as the PIRG research found, some of these campus debit \ncard arrangements raise some serious questions.\n  Why did the U.S. PIRG title its report, ``The Campus Debit Card \nTrap''? You guessed it. Many students are being charged unreasonable \nfees that are costing them millions of dollars. According to the U.S. \nPIRG report, 15 financial institutions have debit or prepaid card \ncontracts with 878 campuses that serve more than 9 million students. It \nis a big business. Forty-two percent of all students nationwide go to \nschool on these 878 campuses.\n  It is a lucrative business for financial institutions. There is a lot \nof money to be paid from fees on college debit cards, especially when \nthey start charging fees on the billions of dollars disbursed each year \nin Federal student aid. So the Federal money is passing through these \ncards to the students. The financial institutions are making money in \nthe process.\n  As the U.S. PIRG report shows, some of the fees being charged are \nclearly unreasonable. One of the most egregious fees is a per-\ntransaction fee on students for using a PIN number on debit purchases \ninstead of a signature. One of the largest campus debit card companies, \nHigher One, currently charges students 50 cents every time the student \nenters his PIN number at a checkout. PIN-based transactions are \nsupposed to be more secure than signature transactions. But this deal \nactually penalizes the students for using PIN numbers which are \nsupposed to be more secure.\n  Another unacceptable fee is the ATM balance inquiry fee that some \nbanks charge. This penalizes students who check on their balances to \nmake sure they do not overdraw their accounts or incur an overdraft \nfee. Why would you discourage a student from checking on their balance \nso they do not overdraw their account?\n  Some banks charge inactivity fees, when a student is charged $10 a \nmonth if they are not using the account after 6 months. In other words, \nif the student is not using the card, racking up fees by making \npurchases, the financial institution still charges $10 each month. So \nit is going to get the money either way.\n  Of course, there are mysterious fees such as Higher One's $50 lack of \ndocumentation fee. That is what they call it. They recently abandoned \nthis. And not to mention the obscure and unreasonable overdraft fees \nthat some institutions charge.\n  Not only do those fees eat away at the limited money these students \nhave for books, food, and living expenses, but these fees also cut into \ntaxpayer-subsidized student aid dollars.\n  Student aid should be used to aid students, period, not banks. We \nshould not allow financial institutions to take a slice off a taxpayer-\nsubsidized student aid disbursement through unreasonable fees. We \nshould not have debit card deals between financial institutions and \ncolleges that leave students holding the bag.\n  Colleges and universities should negotiate for the students, for the \nbest deal for them; the lowest fees, the best consumer protection. We \nneed these deals to be fully transparent. Students often think: Wait a \nminute. If the university is recommending this bank or this school ID \nor this debit card, then it must be approved by the school.\n  The terms of the deal ought to be clear to the student so they can \nmake the right choice. In addition, if the school receives incentives \nor kickbacks for providing exclusive access to the students, there is \nan inherent conflict of interest that at least ought to be disclosed.\n\n[[Page S5200]]\n\n  I wrote a letter, along with Senator Jack Reed and Congressman Peter \nWelch, calling on the 15 financial institutions mentioned in the PIRG \nreport to immediately discontinue several of the worst fees that were \nhighlighted and disclose their contracts with colleges and \nuniversities. I am pleased that some financial institutions are \nresponding to this PIRG report, but more needs to be done.\n  Fortunately, there are colleges and universities out there that are \nready to step up. Soon after the PIRG report came out, I met the with \nthe president of a university in Illinois that uses prepaid Visa debit \ncards to disburse title IV student aid. Students at this school were \nbeing charged some of the fees that were mentioned in the PIRG report, \nsuch as the inactivity fee and a fee for checking on the balance on \ntheir account.\n  When I alerted the president of the university to these fees, he \nimmediately responded and agreed that he thought that was unreasonable. \nHe said he will work to promptly address this issue for the benefit of \nthe students.\n  I hope other leaders of colleges and universities who try to convince \nstudents and their families that they are truly their friends will be \ntheir friends when it comes to these debit cards. In the days to come, \nI am going to work with the regulators at the Department of Education \nand the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and with the higher \neducation and financial communities to take the tricks and traps out of \nthe campus debit card programs.\n  Let's give our college students who are already borrowing money, deep \nin debt, struggling to pay their bills a break. Let's not increase the \ndebt they are going to carry out of school, trying to enter into the \njob market. I thank my colleagues who are already working with me on \nthis. I urge others to join me.\n\n\n                          VA Caregiver Program\n\n  Mr. President, since last July, the Veterans' Administration's \nCaregivers Program has been providing the families of severely disabled \nIraq and Afghanistan veterans with the support they deserve to care for \ntheir loved ones. I would like to mark the 1-year anniversary of this \nprogram by taking a few minutes to talk about its impact on families \nacross America.\n  The Caregivers Program was originally conceived by then-Senator \nHillary Rodham Clinton. She came up with this notion to help those \ncaregivers who were staying at home with disabled veterans, many of \nthem parents and spouses, who make considerable sacrifices to make sure \ntheir disabled vet has the very best love and care in the place they \nwant to be, right in their home.\n  Sometimes it is a hardship, not just the medical requirements but \nsometimes the financial requirements. So we passed the Caregivers \nProgram, originally conceived by Senator Clinton. With the assistance \nof Senator Akaka, it became the law of the land. Here is what it said: \nFor the veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan who came home with a \ndisability and needed a caregiver to make sure they could go about \ntheir daily routine, we would say first to the caregiver, we are going \nto provide you with the medical training you need so you can take care \nof this vet in terms of their personal needs.\n  Secondly, we will provide you with a respite. If you need time off to \ngo spend a few days somewhere to rest and relax and recharge your \nbatteries, we will find a nurse or someone to come in and take care of \nthat vet so you can have a little time to yourself.\n  Third, if there is a final need, an economic hardship, we pay up to \n$3,000 a month--not a huge sum of money--but up to $3,000 a month to \nthe caregivers who are willing to help. I just had a group of wounded \nwarriors in my office the other day. They talked about what this meant \nto some of these families. It meant whether their homes would be \nforeclosed upon. So when you think about it, the alternative is \ninstitutional care for these veterans, not nearly the level we want, \nthe kind of care we would want to have. Instead, they are home with \nsomeone they love at a fraction of the cost of institutional care. We \nare just giving a helping hand to the caregivers.\n  So let me show a couple of photographs because these are some stories \nthat I think are important for everyone to know about. This is a family \nI know pretty well. They are from North Carolina. Eric Edmundson served \nin the U.S. Army. Eric is shown with his wife Stephanie, his daughter \nGracie, 7 years old, and his baby son Hunter, who is almost 2 years \nold. Eric served in the Army and was injured, and during the course of \nsurgery, there were complications. He ended up a quadriplegic, unable \nto speak. They almost gave up on him. They talked to his father about \nsending him, at the age of about 24, into a nursing home. His dad blew \nhis stack and said: You are not going to do that to my boy. He got on \nthe Internet and started asking questions and ended up with Eric being \nadmitted to the Rehab Institute in Chicago. That is where I met them, \nthis North Carolina family. His dad said: My son will get the best care \nno matter what. Because he worked so hard and pushed so hard, Eric got \nthe care he needed.\n  I can remember visiting him in his hospital room and saying that I \nwant to come back from time to time to see how he is doing in Chicago. \nI came back a few weeks later, and his mom said Eric had a gift for me.\n  I said: For me, a gift? What is it?\n  She said: I will show you.\n  His mom and dad walked to the side of his wheelchair, lifted him up, \nand he took three steps. There wasn't a dry eye in that room. There \nwere tears of joy all the way around. This man who had been given up on \nwas taking steps. His mom and dad said: He is supposed to check out on \nMemorial Day, and he will walk out of the front door of this hospital \nin his full dress uniform. Can you be there?\n  I said I wouldn't be anywhere else. So I came, as did the mayor of \nChicago and a lot of press, and watched Eric walk out of that hospital. \nIt was one of the happiest days I can ever remember. His wife Stephanie \nwas waiting with his daughter Gracie, and they moved back to North \nCarolina. His mom and dad gave up their business and devoted their \nlives to him. They are living with this family to make sure Eric has a \nlife. They have a brandnew baby boy.\n  I have visited at their home. It is one of those stories where local \nvets and good people said: We will build you a home at no expense so \nyou can get around in your wheelchair.\n  It is a terrific, wonderful story of a brave family who worked hard \nto give Eric a life, and all the neighbors and friends have helped \nsustain him.\n  I can tell you that Eric's story went a chapter further. His dad came \nto me and said: Have you ever heard of the caregivers bill Hillary \nClinton had introduced?\n  I said no.\n  He said: She is leaving the Senate to be Secretary of State, so would \nyou take a look at it?\n  I said I would. As a result of that, I worked with Senators Akaka and \nInouye and the President, who signed it into law. As a result, families \njust like the Edmundsons will get the helping hand they need, like Eric \ngot the kind of care he needed. The Iraq war is over, but his struggle \nwill continue. We want to make sure he has the loving care he needs \nthroughout his life.\n  Let me tell you about another family from Clinton, IL. I don't have a \nphoto. It is Nathan Florey and his caregiver mother Deanna.\n  Nathan was a military police officer in Iraq, and he suffered an \naneurysm while on duty in 2008. His recovery took 15 months. At one \npoint it was suggested that Nathan should go to a group home. His \nmother refused to allow that to happen and said: No, send him home with \nme. She has taken care of him ever since. They were told that Nathan \nmight never wake up, regain consciousness, but he exceeded everyone's \nexpectations. He has received an associate's degree and is working on a \nbachelor's degree. Deanna says the caregiver program gives her a \nsupport system so that she doesn't feel like she is caring for Nathan \nalone.\n  This is a common refrain. Another caregiver named Beth, whom I spoke \nwith this spring in downstate Illinois near Marion, pointed out that \nthis support from the caregivers program gave her the flexibility to be \nable to care for her husband full time.\n  These are the kinds of families we want to help with this program. \nWhen we started, we thought a few thousand Iraq and Afghanistan \nfamilies might qualify. As it turns out, these signature wounds that \nlead to this type of\n\n[[Page S5201]]\n\ncare are more prevalent than we thought and families' hearts are even \nbigger than we imagined. So far, 5,153 families have qualified for the \ncaregivers program. Think about that. They have taken the training to \nprovide quality care for their loved ones in the comfort of their own \nhomes. This includes Deanna and Beth and 129 other families in my \nState, and I will bet there are some families in Minnesota.\n  This is an interesting and amazing story as well. This is a family \nfrom Oak Lawn, IL. This is Yuriy and Aimee Zmysly in the center of the \nphoto. I was connected with the Zmyslys several years ago after I read \nabout them in a Chicago newspaper. They became strong advocates for the \ncaregivers program, spreading the word about it in Illinois, including \nat this event in Chicago last fall.\n  Yuriy was a marine serving in Afghanistan and Iraq. In 2006, he came \nback to the United States for surgery at the military hospital, where \nhe suffered complications from a burst appendix and was left with a \nsevere brain injury. When she got the news, Aimee drove to the hospital \nand put her whole heart and life into caring for Yuriy. At the time, \nthey weren't married, but Aimee said she made her commitment to him \nbefore this. They got married after he suffered this grievous injury. \nThe Zmyslys qualified for the caregiver program last summer. As Aimee \ntold the Sun Times in an update to their story, ``It's good to be \nrecognized for what I've been doing and other people have been doing \nfor years.''\n  Let me close with a brief update on Eric Edmundson, whom I started \ntalking about. His father Ed tells me in a recent note that enrollment \nin the program went smoothly--the caregivers program. His wife Beth, \nwho gave up her health insurance when she left her job to care for her \nson, now has her health insurance back thanks to the program. And Eric \nis doing great as well. He is back hunting and fishing. He can \nliterally go hunting. He loves it so much. And he can also fish with \nhis dad. He recently completed a multistate hunting trip sponsored by \nthe Wounded Warrior Project. Eric also received the 2011 Pathfinder \nAward from Safari Club International in recognition of the way he has \nexplored life undeterred by his injuries. As part of the award, he is \ngoing to head to South Africa in September to hunt big game. Who would \nhave imagined that this young man, abandoned by our system, which said \nhe would virtually spend the rest of his life alone in a nursing home, \nnow has such a full life?\n  His father said in his note to me, ``Eric works through his \nchallenges. He will not be disabled by them--always a warrior.''\n  I am pleased that the caregivers program has been able to help \nveterans in America--over 5,000 in Illinois, North Carolina, and \neverywhere. I encourage anybody who is following this statement on the \nfloor of the Senate and knows of an Iraq or Afghanistan veteran who may \nqualify for the caregivers program to get more information at \nwww.caregiver.va.gov.\n\n\n                             Crop Insurance\n\n  Mr. President, last Sunday I went to Gardner Township outside of \nSpringfield and met with a group of farmers to talk about the drought. \nWe were across the street from a cornfield, and I have seen these since \nI was a little kid. If you looked at it driving by, you would think it \nwas just another cornfield. The farmers took me into the cornfield, and \nwe started looking at the corn and stalks. It is a disaster.\n  The drought has really taken its toll. As of last week, my entire \nState is suffering through at least a moderate drought, and 33 counties \nhave been declared to be in severe drought. They have joined 1,000 \nother counties in 26 States that have already been declared disaster \nareas by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Some people think it is \nthe worst drought we have had in 25 years. I am afraid they could be \nright. Nobody knows better than our farmers, which I learned when I \nmade this visit. Some of this corn crop is going to be flatout lost. \nThey chop it off at ground level and let it dry out and try to feed it \nto the livestock. But it will get worse if the drought continues. We \nneed rain and need it desperately--not just a little rain but a level \nof consistent, meaningful accumulation.\n  The primary tool available to producers to help them get through this \nis crop insurance. Taxpayers help the Crop Insurance Program by \nsubsidizing about 62 percent of the premiums, but it is a better deal \nthan disaster payments, which are unfortunately massive in amount and \ndon't reward good conduct. The basic Crop Insurance Program rewards \nthose producers who are trying to protect themselves from these \noutcomes.\n  I talked to Secretary Vilsack with the Department of Agriculture last \nweek. I know they are watching this disastrous situation across \nIllinois and the Nation as, unfortunately, it increases. The benefits \nthat are available to local farmers are low-interest loans they can \ntake out to get through this while waiting for the crop insurance \npayout. These farmers don't want a handout, but they have no choice. \nThey have to get through this year so they can get into next year. The \nloans are not going to solve the problem, but they will help address \nthem.\n  There is a political thing we can do. I wish we would pass a bill to \ncreate rain, but we obviously can't. We did pass a farm bill. Sixty-\nfour Senators, Democrats and Republicans, voted for the farm bill. \nSenator Stabenow of Michigan and Senator Roberts of Kansas, a Democrat \nand a Republican, worked through a bipartisan bill when most people \nsaid they didn't have a chance. They did it and did a great job. They \nsent it to the House. The House, unfortunately, has not been able to \nmove the farm bill.\n  This is like the story we heard on the Transportation bill. Here is a \nbill that is critically important for farmers, many of whom are facing \ndisasters like the drought now, and the House needs to get moving. I \nhate to put pressure on the House, but that is what Senators do to \nHouse Members, and they try to do the same to us. If they fail to pass \na farm bill, it will reduce the opportunities to help our farmers \nthrough this drought.\n  So I am encouraging all Members of the House of Representatives, \nDemocrats and Republicans, to at least vote on the Senate bipartisan \nbill if you can't come up with a bill. It will give us a chance to help \nproducers in rural America facing a natural disaster. As they face \nthese natural disasters, we should not create political disasters to \nmake it worse.\n  I call on the House of Representatives, before you leave for the \nAugust recess, pass a farm bill, get to conference, and get the job \ndone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss \nthe urgency that is growing with each passing day for the House to take \nup and pass the farm bill. Most Senators in this body have a \nconstituency that is being impacted by the worsening drought \nconditions, which is currently affecting 61 percent of the landmass of \nthe continental United States. I have seen a growing frustration among \nmy colleagues, myself included, with the lack of action on the part of \nthe House of Representatives.\n  The Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act of 2012, which is the \nSenate's version of the farm bill, contains an extension of the \ncritical livestock disaster assistance programs, and would ensure that \nthis assistance would apply to losses experienced this year. The bill \nalso contains a new commodity program which would serve to supplement \ncrop insurance.\n  Unfortunately, if we do not complete a full reauthorization by the \nend of September, producers are at risk of not having this assistance \navailable to them. Our disaster assistance programs, which we \nauthorized in the 2008 farm bill, expired on September 30, 2011, and so \nthey will not be available unless the House leadership brings up the \nfarm bill for immediate consideration. We need to move the process \nforward so that we can get to a conference committee and complete a \nfull reauthorization by the end of September.\n  Continued unwillingness of the House leadership to bring the farm \nbill up for consideration puts my producers at risk. The uncertainty of \nhow the House will proceed led me to join last week with Senators \nBaucus, Tester, and Conrad in introducing standalone legislation to \nextend the Supplemental Revenue Assistance, SURE, program, the \nLivestock Indemnity Program, LIP, Livestock Forage Program, LFP, and \nthe Emergency Livestock Assistance Program, ELAP, through the current \ncrop year. While the farm bill that\n\n[[Page S5202]]\n\nwe passed through the Senate last week includes the livestock disaster \nprograms and a new commodity program to supplement crop insurance, the \nHouse has not given any indication that it will move the \nreauthorization process forward. As such, we introduced this standalone \ndisaster assistance bill as another option for ensuring assistance is \navailable for our producers.\n  There are a lot of things in the House farm bill that I do not like, \nbut that is why we have a process in place to work out differences \nbetween the House and Senate versions. Ideally, the House should just \nbring up and pass the Senate bill, which passed last month with wide \nbipartisan support, so we can give our producers some certainty and the \nassistance they need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/19/senate-section/article/S5202-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF MICHAEL A.

Mr. President, I recognize and honor Kathryn E. Landreth \nfor her distinguished service from 2005 to 2012 as the State Director \nof the Nevada Chapter of The Nature Conservancy.\n  Under Kathryn's leadership, The Nature Conservancy--Nevada Chapter \nhas maintained its focus on its core mission to conserve lands and \nwaters on which all life depends. Kathryn was first drawn to The Nature \nConservancy for its commitment to science-based information to reach \ncollaborative outcomes for conservation. She was instrumental in \nworking with important partners to establish the Ash Meadows National \nWildlife Refuge and protect the desert tortoise habitat. Kathryn's \nvision and leadership also helped the Chapter acquire Independence \nLake--one of the most pristine alpine lakes--complete the Whit Hall \nInterpretive Center and complete restoration work at the McCarran Ranch \nand Lower Truckee River. In Western Nevada, the Chapter completed the \nrestoration of the Carson and Truckee Rivers to improve wildlife \nhabitats and water quality.\n  I have had the good fortune of working with Kathryn and The Nature \nConservancy in Nevada and nationally on legislation that impacts our \nFederal wild lands heritage. She and The Nature Conservancy have been \nimportant partners in successful efforts to protect Nevada's unique \nlandscapes; their advocacy has led to the protection of over 1 million \nacres across the Silver State.\n  Prior to her work with The Nature Conservancy, she was appointed by \nPresident Clinton in October of 1993 to serve as United States Attorney \nfor the District of Nevada. Kathryn served as a tough and effective \nprosecutor and established a fine legal reputation.\n  Due to her impressive and dedicated work, her efforts have not gone \nunacknowledged. The Nevada Chapter of the National Association of \nSocial Workers previously recognized her as Public Advocate of the \nYear, the State Bar of Nevada named her Public Lawyer of the Year, and \nthe Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce recognized her as a Woman of \nDistinction in Government.\n  I am tremendously proud of the legacy that she has imprinted on the \nState of Nevada. Thank you, Kathryn, for your extraordinary service as \na leader and advocate for conservation and justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/19/senate-section/article/S5202-5", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5202-S5203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING ST. BERNARD HOSPITAL\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for the past several years much of the \nconversation about health care in Washington has been a war of words. \nToday I would like to talk about a hospital in my home State that is \nseeking to better the lives of the women in its community, not simply \nwith words but with action.\n  This month, St. Bernard Hospital in the Englewood neighborhood in \nChicago, announced it would provide 150 free mammograms for women. The \nmammograms will be for women who are over the age of 40 and do not have \nhealth insurance.\n  For those who may not know, Englewood is a neighborhood in Chicago \nthat struggles with high levels of crime and unemployment.\n  The mammograms will be offered as part of the Metropolitan Chicago \nBreast Cancer Task Force's ``Screen to Live'' initiative. The Task \nForce was created in 2007, after a landmark study by the Sinai Urban \nHealth Institute found that the mortality rate from breast cancer for \nAfrican American women in Chicago was 68 percent higher than white \nwomen.\n  That startling statistic is not unique to Chicago.\n  According to the American Cancer Society, African American women \nnationally have the lowest survival rate from breast cancer of any \nracial or ethnic group. Not surprisingly, the study found poverty and a \nlack of health insurance are also associated with lower breast cancer \nsurvival.\n  It is this disparity that led St. Bernard President and CEO, Sister \nElizabeth Van Straten, to offer the mammograms. St. Bernard Hospital is \nnot a wealthy hospital. But this gift of 150 free mammograms to the \ncommunity will save lives. And this partnership between St. Bernard's \nand the Metropolitan Chicago Breast Cancer Task Force should be \napplauded.\n  This brings me to the Affordable Care Act.\n  The lesson to learn from St. Bernard's effort is that preventive care \nmatters. Because survival often hinges on early detection, the \nAffordable Care Act has made preventive services free. In fact 54 \nmillion Americans, including 2.4 million in Illinois have received \npreventive services from their insurance company at no cost. In 2011, \n1.3 million people on Medicare in Illinois received free preventive \nservices. And starting next year, States will receive an increased \nshare from the Federal Government to cover preventive services for \npeople on Medicaid.\n  This effort to bring preventive services to millions of Americans \nacross the country will no doubt save lives.\n  I want to acknowledge the outstanding people at St. Bernard's and\n\n[[Page S5203]]\n\nthe Metropolitan Chicago Breast Cancer Task Force who made this happen. \nI am proud to be their Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/19/senate-section/article/S5203-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING WILLIAM RASPBERRY\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, my State of Mississippi and the American \njournalism community have suffered a great loss with the death of \nWilliam Raspberry. As a widely respected writer, his articles were \nrefreshing in their depth of understanding and even handed reporting of \nthe perils and triumphs of politics and government.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from \nthe Clarion-Ledger in Jackson, Mississippi, written by Sid Salter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Clarion-Ledger, July 18, 2012]\n\n          Raspberry's Amazing Legacy Reaches Beyond Journalism\n\n                            (By Sid Salter)\n\n       When I learned of the death of longtime Washington Post \n     columnist William Raspberry, I was immediately reminded of a \n     conversation I'd had with him in 2005 in his hometown of \n     Okolona. Raspberry, who logged 40 years writing commentary \n     for the Post and saw his work syndicated nationally in over \n     200 newspapers, died at age 76 at his Washington home of \n     prostate cancer on July 17.\n       Raspberry won the 1994 Pulitzer Prize for commentary and \n     was then only the second African-American writer afforded \n     that honor.\n       I had met Raspberry several times over the years at \n     conferences, but never spent much time with him until 2000 \n     when he became the first African-American journalist inducted \n     into the Mississippi Press Association's Hall of Fame. In \n     2005, after learning of the early childhood education/\n     intervention effort he was personally funding in Okolona, I \n     asked him to meet me there and to tell me about his vision \n     for changing the game for disadvantaged children in a town \n     with a poor track record in public education.\n       Prior to the interview, I asked him if it bothered him that \n     in 2000 he had been the first black MPA Hall of Fame inductee \n     and that coming some six years after winning the Pulitzer. He \n     reflected on the question, then said: ``No, not really. One \n     thing one learns growing up in the segregated South is \n     patience. I was pleasantly surprised when the honor came and \n     I was glad that my mother lived to see it, but my career had \n     taught me that change comes ever so slowly.''\n       One area in which Raspberry lost his patience was early \n     childhood education. Raspberry's solution was program he \n     funded and founded called Baby Steps in Okolona. The Baby \n     Steps Program has been a partnership between columnist \n     William Raspberry, the Okolona Area Chamber of Commerce, the \n     University of Mississippi and the Barksdale Reading \n     Institute. Other key community partners include a number of \n     Okolona and Tupelo churches and local volunteers. ``The (Baby \n     Steps') basic idea is that all parents, no matter how \n     unsuccessful they might have been in school, want their \n     children to succeed academically--even if many of them don't \n     know how to make that happen,'' Raspberry wrote in his \n     nationally syndicated Nov. 17, 2003, column in The Washington \n     Post.\n       ``We propose to teach them. The text for the effort is \n     Dorothy Rich's ``MegaSkills''--a set of 11 attitudes and \n     competencies that she believes lead to success in school and \n     in life . . . the idea is to train the parents themselves, as \n     they children's most effective teachers, to pass these \n     MegaSkills along to their children.''\n       On that day in 2005 in Okolona, I joined Raspberry at the \n     Hazel Ivy Child Care Center--Ground Zero for the Baby Steps \n     program in Okolona--along with two of the city's other day \n     care centers. Raspberry arrived at Ivy's center and was \n     greeted not as one of the nation's premier journalists, but \n     as a neighbor and friend called ``Bill.''\n       Raspberry cut his journalistic teeth covering the Watts \n     Riots in Los Angeles in 1965 and wrote passionately about the \n     violence that gripped Washington, D.C., for a time. But in \n     many ways, Raspberry never forgot his Mississippi upbringing \n     and the inspiration of his schoolteacher parents. He was an \n     advocate of self-reliance and hard work.\n       In 2005, I asked Raspberry to define his legacy in \n     journalism: ``I'm at an age where legacy becomes important. \n     I'd like to leave something behind other than yellowing \n     newspaper columns, something that people can carry forward. \n     At the end of the day, I'd like to be remembered as someone \n     who always tried to make clear the things that were pulling \n     us apart and tried to ameliorate it, to point out that we're \n     not as far apart as folks would have us to believe.''\n       Bill Raspberry's place in American journalism is assured, \n     but Mississippians would be wise to claim our part of this \n     good man's distinguished personal and professional legacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/19/senate-section/article/S5203-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5203-S5204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  HONORING AMERICA'S VETERANS AND CARING FOR CAMP LEJEUNE FAMILIES ACT\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida, Mr. President, it has been 31 years since Camp \nLejeune officials became aware that toxic compounds were found in the \ndrinking water at the North Carolina base. It has taken 31 years for \ncountless water tests, analyses, investigations, studies, and reports \nto be conducted so we can finally vote on H.R. 1627, a bill that will \ngive thousands of Marine veterans and their families the health care \nthey deserve after suffering from illnesses caused by this water \ncontamination.\n  Almost 1 million people at Camp Lejeune were exposed to drinking \nwater that was poisoned with cancer-causing industrial compounds, \nincluding trichloroethylene--a metal degreaser, tetrachloroethylene--a \ndry cleaning solvent, benzene and vinyl chloride. For almost 3 decades \npeople who lived and worked at the base were drinking, cooking, and \nbathing in water with these toxic chemicals, which medical experts have \nlinked to birth defects, childhood leukemia and a variety of other \ncancers.\n  There are over 181,000 people currently registered on the Camp \nLejeune water contamination website registry, which is the critical \ninformation link for the Camp Lejeune veterans, civilians, and their \nfamilies who may have been exposed to water contaminants. Next to North \nCarolina, Florida has the second highest number of registrants with \nover 15,000. Every single State has residents registered on the Camp \nLejeune website, and every Member of the Senate has constituents who \nhave been affected by this water contamination.\n  Some scientists have been calling this one of the worst public \ndrinking-water contaminations in our Nation's history. Some of the most \nvocal supporters of the Camp Lejeune victims are from my State of \nFlorida. I am happy to tell them that we are finally doing right by \nthose harmed while serving our country. Thanks to the dedication of \nthese folks, the full impact of the contamination is being exposed.\n  I have pressed the Navy for all the facts surrounding the incident, \nand have advocated for conducting the right studies so those affected \nand their families can get more information on the possible association \nbetween their exposures and current and future health effects. The \nAgency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry has been assessing the \neffects of exposure to drinking water containing volatile organic \ncompounds since 1993. This Agency is also conducting an investigation, \nat the request of Congress, to determine the health effects of exposure \nto this drinking water. And the Department of Veterans Affairs already \nemploys mechanisms to prevent fraudulent claims.\n  We are finally fulfilling our duty to protect our Nation's veterans \nand families who have sacrificed so much. After 55 years, they will \nfinally get the medical coverage they are owed.\n  Finally, I would like to applaud my colleagues in the Judiciary \nCommittee Senators Leahy and Grassley, for shedding some light on this \nwater contamination issue.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased that Chairman Leahy and I \nwere able to help with the effort to look at the issue of water \ncontamination at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. In \nparticular, in June, we sent a letter to the Department of Defense, \nwhich has resulted in it producing more than 8,500 documents to the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  I know that Senator Burr and others have been leaders with the effort \nto look into the situation at Camp Lejeune.\n  Every member of the Senate should be aware of the situation at Camp \nLejeune.\n  The drinking water contamination that took place over several decades \nat the base was one of the worst environmental disasters in American \nhistory.\n  Camp Lejeune was designated a Superfund site by the Environmental \nProtection Agency (EPA) in 1988 after inspections confirmed \ncontamination of the ground water due to the migration of hazardous \nchemicals from outside the base and inadequate procedures to contain \nand dispose of hazardous chemicals on the base.\n\n[[Page S5204]]\n\n  Residents of every State, who previously lived or worked at the base, \nhave been impacted by the contamination.\n  Indeed, more than 180,000 current and former members of the armed \nservices and employees at the base have signed up for the Camp Lejeune \nHistoric Drinking Water Registry. By registering, individuals who lived \nor worked at the base before 1987 receive notifications about the \ncontamination.\n  The Camp Lejeune registry includes residents from all 50 States. \n1,121 Iowans are among them. It's estimated that more than 750,000 \npeople may have been exposed to hazardous chemicals at the base.\n  The numbers don't fully reflect the impact of the disaster at the \nbase. There are real people behind those numbers.\n  In March, as part of the Judiciary Committee's annual oversight \nhearing on the Freedom of Information Act, we heard the testimony of \nretired Marine Master Sergeant Jerry Ensminger. He was stationed at \nCamp Lejeune with his family and told us of the battle his daughter, \nJaney, fought with leukemia for two-and-a-half years, before she died \nat the age of nine. He also told us of the difficulties that he and \nothers were having getting information from the Department of Defense.\n  The men and women of the armed services protect us every day. We \nshould never take them or the sacrifices that they and their families \nmake for granted.\n  We in Congress have an obligation to do everything that we can to \nsupport them in their mission.\n  That's why I'm a cosponsor of the Caring for Camp Lejeune Veterans \nAct, which was introduced by Senator Burr in 2011. That bill, a version \nof which passed by unanimous consent in the Senate yesterday, will help \nto provide medical treatment and care for servicemembers and their \nfamilies, who lived at the camp and were injured by the chemical \ncontamination.\n  Unfortunately, the Department of Defense has not been forthcoming \nwith information about the contamination at Camp Lejeune.\n  That's troubling, especially coming from the administration that \nproclaims itself to be the ``most transparent administration ever.''\n  As we all recall, on his first full day in office, President Obama \ndeclared openness and transparency to be touchstones of his \nadministration, and ordered agencies to make it easier for the public \nto get information about the government.\n  Specifically, he issued two memoranda written in grand language and \npurportedly designed to usher in a ``new era of open government.''\n  Based on my experience in trying to pry information out of the \nExecutive Branch and based on investigations I've conducted, and \ninquiries by the media, I'm disappointed to report that President \nObama's statements in memos about transparency are not being put into \npractice.\n  There's a complete disconnect between the President's grand \npronouncements about transparency and the actions of his political \nappointees.\n  The situation with the Camp Lejeune documents is just another example \nof that disconnect. The documents should have been produced long ago.\n  The recent letter that Chairman Leahy and I sent from the Judiciary \nCommittee had to be sent because the Defense Department refused to \nproduce documents in response to a March letter signed by six senators \nand three members of the House of Representatives. Chairman Leahy and I \nhad also signed that March letter.\n  The March letter had to be sent because of complaints that \nCongressional offices had received about the Navy's refusal to disclose \ndocuments needed for scientific studies of the contamination at Camp \nLejeune. It was also needed because of claims that the Navy is \nimproperly citing exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act to \nwithhold documents related to the contamination.\n  So, while I'm pleased that there was a bipartisan effort to obtain \nthese documents, I'm disappointed by the stonewalling and by the \nhurdles that were put up by the administration.\n  Transparency and open government must be more than just pleasant \nsounding words found in memos. They are essential to the functioning of \na democratic government.\n  Transparency is about basic good government and accountability--not \nparty politics or ideology.\n  Throughout my career I have actively conducted oversight of the \nExecutive Branch regardless of who controls the Congress or the White \nHouse.\n  I'll continue doing what I can to hold this administration's feet to \nthe fire with Camp Lejeune and where ever else I find stonewalling and \nsecrecy.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/19/senate-section/article/S5204-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5204-S5205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  LEADERSHIP ALLIANCE 20TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, twenty years ago, Brown University, located \nin my home State of Rhode Island, established the Leadership Alliance, \na national academic consortium of leading research universities and \nminority serving institutions with the mission to develop \nunderrepresented students into outstanding leaders and role models in \nacademia, business, and the public sector. Brown University and its \npartner institutions have continued to address this pressing national \nneed.\n  The National Research Council recently published a report titled \n``Research Universities and the Future of America'' that included a \ncall for ten ``breakthrough actions.'' Two of these actions involve \nreforming graduate education and creating pathways into the fields of \nscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) for women and \nunderrepresented minorities. That is what the Leadership Alliance has \nbeen striving to do since 1992.\n  Through an organized program of research, networking and mentorship \nat critical transitions along the entire academic training pathway, the \nLeadership Alliance prepares young scientists and scholars from \nunderrepresented and underserved populations for graduate training and \nprofessional apprenticeships. Leadership Alliance faculty mentors \nprovide high quality, cutting-edge research experiences in all academic \ndisciplines at the Nation's most competitive graduate training \ninstitutions and share insights into the nature of academic careers.\n  In the 20 years since its establishment, the Leadership Alliance has \nestablished a strong track record of success. More than half of the \nstudents who participated in the Summer Research Early Identification \nprogram enrolled in a graduate level program. Leadership Alliance \ninstitutions graduated approximately 25 percent of all doctorates in \nthe biomedical sciences degrees to underrepresented minority students \nbetween 2004 and 2008, making it a leading consortium grantor of PhD \ndegrees in the biomedical sciences in the United States.\n  Since founding the Leadership Alliance in 1992, Brown has mentored \n386 scholars, of whom 35 percent have attained a graduate level degree. \nNearly half of the students who participated in its Summer Research \nEarly Identification program completed a graduate level degree. A \nmajority of the Leadership Alliance doctoral degree recipients are in \nthe STEM disciplines.\n  The Leadership Alliance is a model for identifying, training, and \nmentoring underrepresented minorities who are poised to expand and \ndiversify the base of the 21st century workforce. I am pleased today to \nrecognize the importance of such efforts and acknowledge the continued \ndedication of institutional leaders, faculty members, and \nadministrators across the United States who provide training and \nmentoring of underrepresented students along the academic pathway. As \nsuch, I congratulate and commend the Leadership Alliance, including \nBrown University, for 20 years of contributing to creating a diverse \nand competitive research and scholarly workforce.\n  Mr. CASEY: Mr. President, today I would like to acknowledge the great \nwork of the Leadership Alliance during its 20th anniversary. The \nLeadership Alliance is a consortium of 32 leading colleges and \nuniversities that aims to train, mentor and inspire a diverse group of \nstudents from a wide range of backgrounds to enter competitive graduate \nprograms and research careers. This admirable goal of expanding access \nto high-quality programs is supported by the consortium's shared \nresources and vision.\n  I would especially like to acknowledge the program at the University \nof Pennsylvania, which is one of the\n\n[[Page S5205]]\n\nLeadership Alliance founding members and the only member in \nPennsylvania. According to the university, the Leadership Alliance \ncomplements Penn's broader strategic vision of increasing diversity \nwithin its graduate student body and faculty. As it seeks to prepare \nleaders and role models for service in academia and the private and \npublic sectors, the Leadership Alliance disseminates best practices in \nrecruitment, mentoring and career development. With 20 years of \nexperience in developing and sharing these essential techniques, the \nLeadership Alliance has helped to provide the Nation with a more \ndiverse and globally competitive workforce. I wish to congratulate the \nLeadership Alliance on its 20th anniversary and thank its leaders and \nscholars for their significant contributions.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am proud to rise today to honor the \nLeadership Alliance, which was founded 20 years ago in 1992 at Rhode \nIsland's Brown University. It has grown to become a consortium of 32 of \nour country's leading higher education research and minority serving \ninstitutions, working together to bring students from underrepresented \ngroups into competitive graduate programs and professional research \ncareers. Through training and mentorship, the Leadership Alliance opens \ndoors for our best and brightest young people to become the innovators \nof tomorrow.\n  During its 20 years, the Leadership Alliance has mentored more than \n2,600 undergraduates, including 43 Rhode Islanders. These students are \noffered the unique and exciting opportunity, through the Summer \nResearch-Early Identification Program, to participate in a 9-week paid \nsummer internship where they work side by side with faculty in the \nacademic discipline of their choice at some of our leading research \ninstitutions. They then present their research to the annual Leadership \nAlliance National Symposium. This summer experience gives the students \nthe opportunity to expand their intellectual horizons, as well as \nnetwork with academics and their peers. The program has produced nearly \n200 PhDs, the Leadership Alliance Doctoral Scholars, along with \nprofessionals in private research and academia.\n  It is vital for our country's continued competitiveness in the world \nthat we seek to inspire our young people to innovate and experiment, to \npush the boundaries of our current knowledge. The Leadership Alliance \nhas recognized that mentoring is key in order to ensure that students \nfrom all backgrounds feel that they have access to graduate education \nand know that they have peers in research. The innovative programs the \nLeadership Alliance has created over 20 years have not only allowed \nthese students to increase their own opportunities academically and \nprofessionally, but allowed past students to become role models \nthemselves.\n  I congratulate the Leadership Alliance, Brown University, and the \nother participating colleges and universities, as well as academics and \nstudents, past and present, who through 20 years have shown their \ncommitment to American education, leadership, and innovation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/19/senate-section/article/S5205-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO EDWARD J. HAMILL\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to \nEdward J. ``Eddie'' Hamill, who is retiring on July 31, 2012 after more \nthan three decades of exemplary service to the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture Farm Service Agency. On July 17, the Missouri Farm Service \nAgency, FSA, held a reception for Eddie recognizing his service. Today, \nI would like to stand to honor his contributions to agriculture and the \npeople of Missouri.\n  Eddie is a lifelong Missourian who has served the people of Missouri \nthrough his work at the Farm Service Agency since 1979. In addition to \nhis dedicated work at the Farm Service Agency, Eddie's passion for \npublic service is evident in his willingness to serve beyond his normal \nworkload. He is active in the Perry Lion's Club, Mark Twain Young \nFarmers, Missouri Cattlemen's Association, Missouri Farmer's Union, and \nserves as a member of the Ralls County Health Department Board of \nDirectors. On top of all this, Eddie operates a family farm with 1,200 \nacres of cropland and pasture for a cow-calf herd.\n  In July 2009, Eddie was appointed by President Obama to serve as the \nState Executive Director of FSA, responsible for overseeing the \ndelivery of the income support, disaster assistance, conservation and \nfarm loan programs. With more than 100,000 farms, Missouri agriculture \nemploys nearly 250,000 people. Immensely productive and highly diverse, \nit is the backbone of Missouri's economy. The task of ensuring that \nMissouri's farmers and ranchers have the tools they need to provide for \nour families and communities is vital.\n  During his tenure as Missouri FSA Director, Eddie has worked \ntirelessly to ensure the agency is doing everything it can to properly \nserve our State. With nearly 100 offices in counties throughout the \nState, the local Farm Service Agency office is where Missouri farmers \nturn for assistance. A husband, father of four, and a farmer himself, \nEddie believes in improving economic stability for Missouri farmers one \nfamily at a time. From the letters that have come in to my office from \nMissourians expressing the importance they place on their local Farm \nService Agency office, the value of his approach and dedication is \nclear.\n  Perhaps nowhere has the value of Eddie's leadership been clearer than \nin response to the devastating natural disasters Missouri agriculture \nhas faced. From the devastating flooding we experienced along the \nMissouri River, to the catastrophe at Birds Point, to this year's \ncrippling drought conditions, Eddie and the entire Missouri Farm \nService Agency staff have answered every call to help.\n  I am happy today to pay tribute to Eddie Hamill. He stands out \namongst public servants, and he has my thanks and surely that of all \nMissourians for his service to our State. I wish congratulations and \ngood luck to him and his entire family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/19/senate-section/article/S5205-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5205-S5206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING HIRAM HISANORI KANO\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I wish to pay \ntribute to a historic figure in Nebraska who helped this country \nthrough troubling times in a battle against racism, hatred and fear and \nin pursuit of justice and equality.\n  Hiram Hisanori Kano was born in Tokyo, Japan, in 1889. When former \nPresidential candidate William Jennings Bryan traveled to Japan, the \nKanos, as part of the Imperial family, hosted his visit. Their visitor \nfrom the west sparked in young Kano an intense desire to travel to the \nUnited States and especially to Bryan's home state of Nebraska.\n  As the story is told by James E. Krotz during the Annual Council \nEucharist at the Church of Our Savior in North Platte, NE, in 1916 Mr. \nKano came to America, where his skills were put to good use in helping \nthe many young Japanese who were immigrating to the United States to \nfarm. He came to America and quickly earned a Masters Degree in \nAgricultural Economics at the University of Nebraska. In the years that \nfollowed he served as organizer, translator, teacher and spokesman for \nJapanese immigrants living in Nebraska.\n  Just 1 year after his graduation from the University, Kano faced his \nfirst challenge when the Nebraska Constitutional Convention assembled \nin Lincoln in 1919. The purpose was to update the State constitution to \nreflect the monumental social, economic and political changes brought \nabout by World War I. A number of bills were introduced that would have \ndiscriminated bitterly against Japanese immigrants. One would have \nprohibited aliens from owning land, inheriting farmland, or even \nleasing land for more than 1 year. Since the Japanese did not have the \nright to become naturalized citizens at that time, these laws would \nhave excluded them entirely from farming, except as hired laborers.\n  Mr. Kano left his farm in rural Nebraska and hurried off to the State \ncapital, where he testified before the Judiciary Committee. ``In \nNebraska,'' he told them, ``there are about 700 Japanese, including \nNisei [American citizens born to Japanese immigrant parents]. There are \nabout 200 Japanese farms, mostly raising sugar beets along the North \nPlatte River. Nearly all are\n\n[[Page S5206]]\n\ntenant farmers whose skill and hard work satisfies their landlords and \nthe sugar company. Japanese living in towns or cities mostly operate \ncafes and restaurants, with the help of their employees. They are \nfriendly and cooperative with their neighbors, sharing their joys and \nsorrows.'' Mr. Kano was successful in persuading the Nebraska \nLegislature to vote against the anti-Japanese bills, which went down in \ndefeat.\n  Several years later, Mr. Kano joined with Bishop George Allen Beecher \nto defeat a similar bill and came up with a compromise. Bishop Beecher, \nan Episcopalian, was obviously impressed by Hiram Kano because in 1923 \nhe descended on the Kano farmstead unannounced and asked Mr. Kano to \nserve as a missionary to the Japanese immigrants living in western \nNebraska. Already a deeply committed Christian, though not an \nEpiscopalian, Kano was profoundly moved; and in 1925, he left his farm \nand traveled to Mitchell, NE, to begin Bishop Beecher's missionary work \namong the Japanese.\n  Kano was ordained Deacon in 1928 and continued in that order for 8 \nyears. He served as pastor of St. Mary's church in Mitchell and also \nserved the Japanese mission in North Platte. For the next 12 years, \nDeacon Kano served as an agricultural consultant, English teacher, \nadvocate, friend and pastor to the Japanese in the Platte Valley. In \n1936 he was ordained priest and continued his tireless ministry.\n  On December 7, 1941, the Japanese Imperial Navy attacked Pearl Harbor \nin Hawaii. American reaction against Japanese immigrants was swift and \nharsh. Father Kano was arrested by agents of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation that very afternoon on the steps of his church in North \nPlatte.\n  Despite the protests of their many friends and without regard for \ntheir exemplary behavior, the Japanese were severely treated and some \neven sent to prison camps. Father Kano spent time in five different \ncamps. There he continued his ministry, calming the fears of his people \nand giving them strength through knowledge. Through what he called the \n``Internment University,'' he helped hundreds of Japanese Americans \nlearn to read, speak, and write English. Following his release from \ncustody, Father Kano returned to his mission with the church.\n  It was not until the Walter-McCarran Act of 1952 that Father Kano, \nthen 63 years old, could become a naturalized citizen. By then, he had \nworked 33 years in service to his country, his people, and his church.\n  The Reverend Hiram Hisanori Kano died on October 24, 1988, at the age \nof 99. Each year, the Episcopal Church in Nebraska and in Colorado \ncelebrates the life and ministry of Father Kano on the anniversary of \nhis death. As a layman, Father Kano was a quiet, persevering warrior in \nthe battle against the evils of racism. He was a champion for his \npeople in the struggle for justice and peace, respected as he fought \nfor the dignity of every human being.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/19/senate-section/article/S5206-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5206-S5207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT\n\n Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, on July 11, I addressed the Fund \nfor American Studies annual Congressional Scholarship Award Dinner here \nin Washington. I ask consent to have this transcript of my remarks \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Very often, young people say to me, ``How can I get \n     involved in politics and government?'' Tonight there are at \n     least 85 of you here who are young and may be wondering about \n     that, so I'm going to tell you exactly how to do it.\n       Here's the secret formula: Pick someone whom you admire. \n     Volunteer to help carry their bag, write their speeches, do \n     anything they ask you to do that's legal. Watch what they do, \n     watch what they do well, watch what they do wrong, and learn \n     from it. That's the way I would suggest to get involved in \n     politics and government.\n       Now, back when I was governor, I made a speech and my late \n     friend Alex Haley, the author of Roots, was in the audience, \n     and he came up to me afterwards and said, ``Lamar, may I make \n     a suggestion to you?'' And I said, ``Of course Alex.'' He \n     said, ``When you start a speech, if you will just say Instead \n     of making a speech, let me tell you a story,' people might \n     actually listen to what you have to say.'' So instead of \n     making a speech, let me tell you some stories to illustrate \n     my secret formula for how to get involved in politics and \n     government.\n       I'm going to mention three of my mentors, and I think it's \n     important for you to know that I had no special connection to \n     these three who helped me get involved in politics and \n     government.\n       When I was running for president some years ago, the New \n     York Times wrote an article that said, I grew up in a small \n     town in lower-middle class family, in a small town on the \n     edge of the mountains in Tennessee. And, when I called home \n     later in the week to talk to my mother, I found her reading \n     Thessalonians to gather strength on how to deal with this \n     slur on the family. She said, ``Son, we had never thought of \n     ourselves in that way. You had a library card from the day \n     you were three, you had music lessons from the day you were \n     four. You had everything you needed that was important.'' So \n     I had everything I needed that was important, but to these \n     three men, who helped me so much, I had no special connection \n     at all.\n       The first was John Minor Wisdom. Toward the end of my third \n     year at New York University Law School, I didn't know what to \n     do and the dean of the Law School said, ``Would you like to \n     clerk for Judge Wisdom in New Orleans?'' And I said, ``Well \n     of course, he's one of the best in the country.'' He said, \n     ``There's one hitch, he's already got a clerk and he's only \n     allowed one.'' So I said, ``Well how do I get to be a \n     clerk?'' He said, ``He has a position of messenger that pays \n     $300 a month, and if you'll take the job as messenger he'll \n     treat you like a clerk.'' So, I took it. I drove down to New \n     Orleans--the Harvard guy got a clerkship, and I was the \n     messenger. Of course, Judge Wisdom treated me like a clerk \n     and I had a wonderful year. I did get tired of making so \n     little money, so I went down to Bourbon Street and got a job \n     playing trombone, washboard and tuba at a place called ``Your \n     Father's Mustache,'' and that's how I got started with Judge \n     Wisdom. So, if you want to be a clerk, and someone offers you \n     a job as messenger, take it, and then learn to play the \n     trombone, the washboard, and tuba.\n       Now my second mentor: Howard Baker. Many people here know \n     Howard. I could speak about him for a week, and he is \n     undoubtedly the most important person in my life, other than \n     my own family members. But how did I get connected to him? \n     Well, I didn't know him. His father was our congressman. My \n     dad took me to the courthouse to meet Mr. Baker, Howard's \n     father, when I was ten years old. He gave me a dime, I \n     remember that, and I thought I'd probably met the most \n     respected man I was ever likely to meet, other than my father \n     and the preacher. But when I was getting through with Judge \n     Wisdom I noticed that Howard Baker was running for the United \n     States Senate from Tennessee. We'd never had a Republican \n     Senator, so I wrote him a letter, volunteering to work in his \n     campaign. I never heard from him. So I was home for Easter in \n     1966 and I finagled an appointment with him, got in to see \n     him and volunteered for his campaign. The long and short of \n     it was, a couple of months later I had a little bit of a \n     paying job.\n       Then, to our surprise, he got elected, he brought me to \n     Washington, and I was his first legislative assistant. We \n     had, as he likes to tell it, a perfect relationship. One of \n     my duties was as his speechwriter. I would write a speech, \n     give it to him, and he seemed happy. Well one day, I wanted \n     to hear him deliver one. He didn't say a word of anything I'd \n     written. I went a second time. Not a word. So I asked to see \n     him. I said, ``Senator, we have a problem.'' He said, \n     ``What's the problem?'' I said, ``I work hard, write these \n     speeches and you never give a word of it.'' He said, ``Lamar, \n     we have a perfect relationship. You write what you want to \n     write, I say what I want to say.''\n       Now the mentor I'd like to talk about tonight is a man well \n     known to this organization because this institute was once \n     named for him--Bryce Harlow.\n       In 1968, I was working for United Citizens for Nixon-Agnew \n     in the Willard Hotel, and it was filled with people who \n     didn't quite fit into the Republican establishment at the \n     time, one of whom was Bud Wilkinson, the most famous football \n     coach of the time. And when the campaign was over, I didn't \n     have a job. And so Bud said, ``Well, let me call Bryce \n     Harlow.'' Which he did, and I got a job. And so Bryce Harlow \n     was President Nixon's first appointee and I, without ever \n     having known him, ended up as his executive assistant, which \n     means I sat in his office in the West Wing of the White \n     House, about eight feet from him for six months, smoking \n     cigarettes with him, answering the telephone and getting a \n     Ph.D. in politics and government from the wisest man in \n     Washington, D.C. Today, that office is the office of the Vice \n     President of the United States, Joe Biden.\n       After Bryce got tired of me sitting so close to his office \n     for six months, he moved me out and created a little \n     cubbyhole. And, if any of you are in there visiting Joe \n     Biden, you can still see that cubbyhole today.\n       But why do I say that Bryce Harlow was the wisest man in \n     Washington, D.C.? Well, here's an example. He was from \n     Oklahoma. He was recruited to Washington to work for General \n     George Marshall. He used to tell me, and here's a lesson, \n     that he was very popular with the generals because he could \n     take shorthand. Bryce was a small guy. He said there's nobody \n     more popular in a room full of generals than a short little \n     guy who can take shorthand and write down all those orders. \n     He moved straight up the ladder. So the\n\n[[Page S5207]]\n\n     lesson is: learn shorthand. Bryce stayed in Washington, \n     worked for the House Armed Services Committee, and became \n     President Eisenhower's favorite staff member.\n       He was in charge of government relations for Proctor & \n     Gamble when he wasn't in the government. And when President \n     Nixon was elected, Bryce Harlow was his first appointee. The \n     campaign transition headquarters was in the Pierre Hotel, New \n     York City. And on one occasion, Mr. Nixon, the president-\n     elect, had said something about foreign policy that made \n     President Johnson, who was still President, very upset. So, \n     President Johnson called the one person he knew in the Nixon \n     campaign, Bryce Harlow. As Mr. Harlow is sitting there \n     listening to President Johnson chew his ear out on the \n     phone--saying ``Bryce, there's only one President at a time, \n     and I am that President!''--Mr. Harlow's secretary comes in \n     and says, ``Mr. Harlow, President Eisenhower is calling for \n     you.'' So, Mr. Harlow, listening to President Johnson, told \n     Sally, the secretary, ``You'll have to put President \n     Eisenhower on hold.'' Then Larry Higby, who was working at \n     the Pierre Hotel, came running in and said, ``Mr. Harlow, Mr. \n     Harlow, President Nixon wants to see you immediately.'' So, \n     you can see that Bryce Harlow was in demand, with the current \n     president chewing his ear off, the former President on hold, \n     and the President-elect demanding to see him in his office.\n       The wiser members of the White House staff would drop by \n     that office and ask Mr. Harlow what to do. Here's an example: \n     Peter Flannigan, who lives in New York and is a great friend \n     of mine still today, was a very good businessman. I remember \n     he came in to see Mr. Harlow and said, ``Bryce, I just wanted \n     to chat with you. I'm in charge of the Independent Regulatory \n     Agencies, and we are a pro-business administration, we need \n     efficiency in government. There's a television license that's \n     been pending for 18 months for a Miami station. I'm going to \n     call over there and I'm not going to tell them what way to \n     decide, I'm just going to say that we want to know the status \n     of the case.''\n       And Bryce responded, ``Peter, do you remember Sherman \n     Adams?'' And Peter said, ``Well of course I do. He was \n     President Eisenhower's disgraced Chief of Staff.'' Bryce \n     said, ``Peter, do you remember what disgraced him?'' Peter \n     said, ``No I'm not sure.'' Bryce said, ``He made a telephone \n     call to an Independent Regulatory Agency on behalf of a \n     friend who was a campaign contributor and had given him a \n     Christmas present.'' So Mr. Flannigan thought about this and \n     thought better of making that telephone call.\n       We young people in the White House were very impatient. We \n     wanted the president and his top advisors to do even more \n     this way, even more that way. And I remember Mr. Harlow \n     saying to me, ``No Lamar. Remember that in the White House, \n     just a little ripple here makes a very big wave out there. \n     So, just settle down, just a little bit.''\n       In the early months of the Nixon administration, the new, \n     brasher young members of the White House staff, and some of \n     the old ones too, were in deep trouble with the United States \n     Senate. They knew nothing about the Senate. Finally, they \n     came to Mr. Harlow and said, ``Bryce, we can't get anything \n     done, can you help us out?'' So Mr. Harlow got his bag, got \n     in a car, drove up to the Senate, went to some back room \n     where Senator Eastland and a bunch of the old boys, who were \n     the Southern senators, were all clumped together having a \n     bourbon in the late afternoon. They were in a very foul mood \n     about the Nixon White House. Mr. Harlow went in, he went down \n     on one knee, bowed to them and said, ``Ah, I see before me \n     155 years of accumulated seniority and wisdom.'' Upon which \n     they all burst out laughing, and everything was fine. He had \n     the experience and the good judgment just to show a little \n     respect to the office that these Senators held, and that was \n     really all it took for him to get what he wanted.\n       I remember once that an irate Democratic chairman called, \n     complaining because the new Republican administration was \n     announcing grants in his district before Democratic \n     congressman knew about it. Bryce said, ``Mr. Chairman, I \n     understand your feelings. Let me call you right back, I want \n     to check on something.'' So he called Larry O'Brien, who was \n     the Chief of Congressional Relations for President Johnson in \n     the Democratic administration. He said, ``Now Larry, could \n     you tell me exactly how you and President Johnson announced \n     those grants when you were in office?'' Once he heard, he \n     called back the chairman and he said, ``Mr. Chairman, I've \n     just checked with Larry O'Brien and here's exactly what \n     President Johnson did. We're going to be exactly fair with \n     you, we're going to do just the reverse and let the \n     Republicans announce them.'' And there was this big laugh on \n     the end of the line. So he got done what he had to do, but he \n     did it in a way that made the other person feel good about \n     it.\n       Bryce Harlow had a great sense of ethics. One of his \n     personal ethics was that he never wrote a book. He thought it \n     would be a betrayal of all the confidential relationships \n     that he had in the White House, and couldn't do it. It's a \n     shame he didn't, in a way, because he was the best writer \n     around in the Nixon and the Eisenhower administrations.\n       On one occasion, he was planning to take a vacation with \n     his wife in Mexico with an old friend. There couldn't be any \n     possible conflict of interest with this friend--they'd known \n     each other forever, and there was really nothing Mr. Harlow \n     could do for this person. Then about a week before the trip, \n     the friend called, asking for a small favor, and the next \n     thing I knew, Mr. Harlow's secretary was calling the friend \n     saying, ``I'm so sorry, but the President has asked Bryce to \n     go to thus and so, and he won't be able to go on the trip.'' \n     She didn't embarrass the friend, but he also didn't even take \n     the risk of an appearance of impropriety based upon a tiny \n     favor that the friend had asked of him.\n       I heard it said a little earlier that ``Your word is your \n     bond.'' That's Bryce Harlow's phrase, he always would say to \n     a lobbyist or anyone working with a member of Congress or \n     with a Senator, or even with another Senator, ``Always tell \n     the truth, tell the exact truth. Don't overstate a thing, \n     don't understate a thing, and if you have to, tell the other \n     side to make sure that whomever you're speaking with is never \n     surprised as a result of what you've just told them. And \n     always keep your word.'' It gave him a tremendous reputation \n     in this community and it greatly influenced hundreds of \n     people who work here.\n       One other thing, he told me a story that I've remembered \n     for a long time about his days with the Eisenhower \n     administration. Some people must read books about Lyndon \n     Johnson and suspect that maybe most of the people who work in \n     high positions of trust--in politics, in business, in \n     universities, or whatever line of work--are always shading \n     the truth and looking at the angle and elbowing one another \n     and taking advantage. How else, you might ask, would they get \n     to the top? It's hard to get a picture of what people who are \n     really at the top actually do when they make decisions.\n       While I can't tell you what they all do, I can tell you \n     this is the story that pretty much symbolizes my impression \n     of most of the successful people I know in politics and how \n     they make their most difficult decisions.\n       President Eisenhower was having a Cabinet meeting in the \n     1950s. Some great issue was laid before the Cabinet, so the \n     President put the issue to the Secretary of State, ``Mr. \n     Secretary, what shall we do?'' ``Well, from a foreign policy \n     point of view,'' said the Secretary, ``we must do X.'' ``Mr. \n     Secretary of Defense, what shall we do?'' ``Well, um, from a \n     defense point of view, if we did X that would be a disaster \n     for the country, so we've got to do Y.'' ``And Mr. Treasury \n     Secretary, what shall we do?'' And the Treasury Secretary had \n     Z as an angle. Before long they went around the cabinet room \n     and they all had a different opinion about how the decision \n     might affect the department each headed. And then President \n     Eisenhower asked this question, ``Well gentlemen,'' (and I \n     think they were all gentleman but one at that time), he said, \n     ``What would be the right thing to do for the country?''\n       The Secretary of State said, ``Well Mr. President, the \n     right thing to do would be C.'' And Secretary of Defense \n     said, ``Yes, the right thing to do would be C,'' and pretty \n     quickly they all agreed that would be the right thing to do \n     for the country. And so the President of the United States \n     said to his Press Secretary Jim Hagerty, ``Jim, then that's \n     what we'll do, go tell the press.''\n       Now, here we have, not an unsophisticated man, this was the \n     leading general during World War II, this was a man who was \n     President of the United States. He had the biggest job in the \n     world. And he was making a big decision. And when it came \n     time to ask the question that had to be answered before a \n     bunch of very sophisticated people, his question was, ``What \n     would be the right thing to do for our country?'' I think \n     you'll find more often than not that when we're puzzled by \n     what to do, that's the right question. And the answer isn't \n     always obvious, but that question will lead to the answer \n     more quickly than just about any other question that you can \n     ask.\n       So thank you for allowing me to come tonight. I'm here to \n     honor you. I'm glad to have a chance to tell you about the \n     great Bryce Harlow, who has meant so much to this \n     organization. My advice about how to get involved in politics \n     and government is: Pick someone who you admire, volunteer to \n     work for them, carry their bag, do anything that they ask you \n     to do that's legal, learn from them, watch what they do \n     right, watch what they do wrong--and one more little piece of \n     advice that my railroad-engineer grandfather used to tell me \n     when I was a little boy, he'd say ``Aim for the top, there's \n     more room there.'' Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/19/senate-section/article/S5207-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5207-S5208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SOUTH DAKOTA HUMANITIES COUNCIL\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I wish to \nrecognize the 40th anniversary of the South Dakota Humanities Council, \nSDHC. As an organization dedicated to promoting culture and our State's \nrich history, SDHC plays an integral role in fostering an interest in \nhistory, literature, and other humanities subjects. Founded in 1972, \nthis important anniversary gives us the opportunity to recognize and \ncelebrate 40 successful years of SDHC humanities programming in South \nDakota.\n  SDHC serves as a faithful steward of our State's heritage and a \nleader in promoting cultural awareness. After 40\n\n[[Page S5208]]\n\nyears, SDHC continues to fulfill its mission ``to support and promote \nthe exchange of ideas to foster a thoughtful and engaged society.'' \nWith funding from the National Endowment for Humanities and support \nfrom local communities, SDHC has improved access to outstanding \ncultural and civic opportunities for all South Dakotans. Virtually \nevery county and most school districts in our State have benefitted \nfrom SDHC-sponsored programs. Especially at a time when many school \ndistricts have been forced to make difficult cuts to their budgets, \nSDHC has served as a valuable partner to schools across our State \nthrough its support of programs like National History Day. In addition, \nSDHC grants to community organizations provide critical ``seed money'' \nthat promotes the preservation and study of humanities topics in cities \nand towns across South Dakota.\n  In addition to enriching the lives of South Dakotans, humanities \nprograms represent an important source of economic development. The \nannual Festival of Books attracts thousands of booklovers every year \nwho are given the chance to talk with locally and nationally recognized \nauthors. In addition, the Museum on Main Street program brings \nSmithsonian exhibits to rural communities. This year, six communities \nin South Dakota will be hosting the exhibit ``New Harmonies: \nCelebrating American Roots Music.'' The SDHC's Speakers' Bureau \nprovides funding for humanities scholars to present and lead \ndiscussions on humanities topics. These and many other programs \nsponsored by SDHC play an important role in attracting visitors to our \nState, which in turn brings in tourism dollars and supports jobs in \nlocal communities.\n  I appreciate the valuable role of SDHC in promoting the humanities in \ncommunities and schools across South Dakota. As a member of the Senate \nCultural Caucus and a lifelong supporter of the arts and humanities, I \ncongratulate SDHC on 40 successful years and thank the organization for \nits service to our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/19/senate-section/article/S5208-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING UNITED HEALTH FOUNDATION SCHOLARS\n\n Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity \nto highlight two bright, young scholars from my home State of \nMinnesota, David Koffa and Victoria Okuneye, who have received \nscholarships from the United Health Foundation's Diverse Scholars \nInitiative.\n  David and Victoria are both hard-working and dedicated individuals \nwho will undoubtedly be great members of the health care workforce.\n  David, who is currently attending Dartmouth College, believes that we \ncan improve the health care system by taking a holistic approach to \npatient care. As a member of the future health workforce, David plans \nto focus not only on the physical well-being of patients, but on the \nsocial and emotional aspects of patient health. Taking advantage of the \nskills and opportunities provided through the United Health Diverse \nScholars Initiative, David intends to provide high-quality health care \nservices to impoverished communities and third-world countries.\n  Victoria, who is excelling at the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology, strives to make a difference by working to expand mental \nhealth research and services for disadvantaged/low resource \ncommunities, particularly among youth and adolescents. Through the \nUnited Health Diverse Scholars Initiative, Victoria has been able to \ntake advantage of rewarding opportunities such as academic research \ninternships and experiences in international public service.\n  Both David and Victoria are examples of academic excellence and \npersonal determination. And as scholars of the United Health \nFoundation's Diverse Scholars Initiative, they will be great \nrepresentatives of a multicultural and diverse health care workforce. I \nwant to congratulate them on their achievements and look forward to \ntheir promising futures. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/19/senate-section/article/S5208-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL McSHANE\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor my long-\ntime friend and advisor, Michael McShane, who will be retiring next \nmonth after 40 remarkable years working in government, the private \nsector, and in Democratic politics.\n  I first got to know Michael when he and I worked together to advance \nthe goals of the Democratic Leadership Council and Third Way. He was \nresponsible for all the DLC activities at both Clinton inaugurals and \nthe 1996 and 2000 Democratic Conventions. Later, when I decided to run \nfor President in 2004, I was honored to have Michael serve as the vice \nchair of my campaign.\n  Michael has built a long and impressive record of public service. As \na young man, he served in the Air Force for 6 years, where he flew B-\n52s and served in Vietnam. After leaving the military in 1972, Michael \nworked as press secretary for Congressman John J. Rooney and then as a \nForeign Service Officer before joining the Carter-Mondale 1976 \nPresidential campaign. Following that election, he served in the Carter \nWhite House as a Special Assistant to Vice President Mondale. Michael \nwas later a White House advisor to President Clinton. He recently \nreturned to public service, joining the Congressional Liaison Office at \nthe United States Agency for International Development.\n  Mike McShane has also had a notable career in the private sector. \nAfter leaving the Carter administration in 1979, he began managing \ngovernment relations programs for trade associations and Fortune 500 \ncompanies including System Development Corporation, National Computer \nSystems, and TRW. He also founded and led The Policy Institute, and, \nlater, the McShane Group International.\n  The academic and nonprofit communities have also benefitted greatly \nfrom Michael's talents and experience. He has served on the faculty of \nthe Bryce Harlow Foundation, which seeks to promote the highest \nstandards within the profession of lobbying and government relations, \nas Visiting Lecturer in American Political History at Boston \nUniversity, and as a teacher of politics at Stanford, Notre Dame, \nVillanova, Georgetown, American, and East Carolina, his alma mater. A \nproud alum, Michael presently serves as vice chair of the Board of \nVisitors at East Carolina and the Board of the ECU Alumni Association. \nIn 1998, he was named the East Carolina University Alumni of the Year.\n  I can't help but view Michael McShane's departure from Washington \nthrough a bittersweet lens. For while I am excited that he and his \nwonderful wife Susan will get to enjoy a much deserved retirement, I \nwill miss Michael's wise counsel and thoughtful insights. Still, I am \nconfident that his example will live on in all of us who were lucky \nenough to know him, and I wish Michael and Susan much happiness and \nsuccess in their retirement in Charlottesville.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/19/senate-section/article/S5208-3", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5208-S5209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING CHERYLL HEINZE\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am saddened to inform the \nSenate of the death of a friend and former member of the Alaska \nLegislature Cheryll Heinze. Cheryll died last week when a float plane \nthat was carrying her and colleagues to a fishing outing cartwheeled on \nlanding and became submerged on Beluga Lake near Homer. At the time \nCheryll was working as Director of Human Resources and Public Relations \nfor the Matanuska Electric Association.\n  It is appropriate that we remember those whose lives end in tragedy \nfor the way they lived their lives so I want to take the next few \nminutes to speak in tribute to an Alaskan who lived life to the \nfullest.\n  Cheryll Heinze was born in Wewoka, OK. She spent part of her \nchildhood in Anchorage when her father was an Army Chaplain at Fort \nRichardson. In 1985, Cheryll returned to be an Alaskan for life. Most \nof her time in Alaska was spent in Anchorage but she also lived in \nSlana, Talkeetna and Valdez. Cheryll was married to Harold Heinze, the \nformer President of ARCO Alaska. The two met when Harold was serving as \nAlaska's Commissioner of Natural Resources under former Governor Walter \nHickel. Cheryll served as Press Secretary on Governor Hickel's 1990 \ncampaign. The two made quite a power couple.\n  In 2002, Cheryll was elected to the 23rd Alaska Legislature \nrepresenting House District 24 in Anchorage. Although she served a \nsingle 2-year term,\n\n[[Page S5209]]\n\nshe accomplished a great deal during her time in Juneau. During that \nterm she chaired the Special Committee on Economic Development, \nInternational Trade and Tourism and was Vice Chair of the Resources \nCommittee.\n  Cheryll is best known for working with colleagues across the aisle in \nmoving Alaska's anti-stalking law out of the legislature and to the \nGovernor's desk. Her bill allowed victims of stalking to obtain \nprotective orders in the same way that victims of domestic violence \ncould in the State of Alaska. Cheryll was also a strong supporter of \ntherapeutic courts and passed a resolution encouraging prosecutors and \npublic defenders to take full advantage of this important resource. She \nworked to make health insurance more affordable to small employers and \nhelped promote trade relations between Alaska and Taiwan.\n  Cheryll was well liked by those inside and outside of the political \ncircle and was viewed as a genuinely nice person. A mutual friend, Mike \nChenault of Nikiski, who served with Cheryll in the Alaska House and is \ntoday the House Speaker had this to say about Cheryll: ``She had a \nlight smile and an easy way about her that made her popular not only \ninside, but outside the Capitol.''\n  Alaska takes pride in the fact that our Legislature is composed of \ncitizens who come to Juneau for a few months each year to do the \nbusiness of the State and then return home to carry on their own lives. \nArt was central to Cheryll Heinze's life. In fact, her official \nlegislative biography lists her profession as ``Artist.'' In fact, she \nwas a world class oil painter who took inspiration from Alaska's \nfabulous scenery. Her painting of Mount Foraker hung in the offices of \nthe Foraker Group, a consulting group that supports Alaska's non-profit \nsector. We also took pride in Cheryll's poetry.\n  In addition to all of her other activities she was a former President \nof the Anchorage Symphony League, a board member of the Pacific \nNorthern Academy and Breast Cancer Focus, Inc., a member of the Alaska \nPacific University President's Steering Committee, and an Art \nInstructor at the University of Alaska Rural Extension. She was a \nmember of the Anchorage Opera Board, the World Affairs Council and the \nMatanuska Charitable Foundation Board. Cheryll brought energy and \nenthusiasm to all she did.\n  I extend the Senate's deepest condolences to Harold and other members \nof the family. Cheryll left us well before her time but in a way that \nis so appropriate for Alaskans--in pursuit of adventure. Alaskans have \nlost a friend and a leader and she will be greatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/19/senate-section/article/S5209-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MAYOR TED JENNINGS\n\n Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, small, local businesses play a \ncritical role in our economy, creating two-thirds of all jobs across \nthe Nation. Nowhere is small businesses' value more evident than in my \nhome State of Maine. Even during these challenging economic times, \nentrepreneurs across the State continue to make headlines for their \nperseverance and can-do attitude in the face of adversity. I rise today \nto recognize and commend Baldwin Apple Ladders and owner Peter Baldwin \nfor their tremendous contribution to the local economy and for \nresilience in the face of disaster that struck a mere 2 months ago.\n  Mr. Baldwin founded Baldwin Apple Ladders in 1984, in his hometown of \nBrooks, ME. Since its opening, Baldwin Apple Ladders has built \napproximately 30,000 ladders, which have been used in orchards \nthroughout Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, North \nCarolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Famous for their \ndurability and signature style, the ladders were even featured in \nMartha Stewart Magazine. Mr. Baldwin's business purchases the lumber \nused in ladder production from local sources, generates jobs through \nshipping and delivery, and supplies customers nationwide, giving it a \nnational as well local presence. While business was at its peak, the \nBaldwin Apple Ladders manufactured and sold an average of 1,200 ladders \nannually.\n  On May 8th 2012, Mr. Baldwin was contacted by a neighbor with the \ndevastating news that Baldwin's ladder building facility was on fire. \nAlong with the stock inventory of finished ladders, production \nequipment, and stacks of unused materials, the fire consumed the 6,500 \nsquare foot dairy barn which housed his manufacturing operations.\n  After the smoke cleared and the remaining assets were assessed, Mr. \nBaldwin was faced with a difficult decision to retire after 30 years in \nbusiness, or rebuild. Mr. Baldwin chose to rebuild, refusing to let the \nfire dictate his future. Mr. Baldwin is committed to making ladders for \nas long as possible; recently building his first post-fire ladder, \nusing tools that are no more advanced than what he had to work with \nwhen he first opened, back in 1984. Though this manner of manufacturing \nis considerably more arduous and time consuming, Mr. Baldwin is \ncontinuing his business and hoping to emerge stronger than ever.\n  Generous local donations, assistance, and support have helped in \nmaking tremendous strides in the rejuvenation of Baldwin Apple Ladders, \na testament to the goodwill Mr. Baldwin has earned throughout the \ncommunity.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to treat small \nbusinesses bequeathed to spouses and dependents by members of the Armed \nForces killed in line of duty as small business concerns owned and \ncontrolled by veterans for purposes of Department of Veterans Affairs \ncontracting goals and preferences, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, last month was yet another disappointing \nmonth of job growth. Over 12 million Americans are unemployed, close to \n6 million have been unemployed for over 27 weeks, and 8 million have \nbeen forced to work part time because they have been unable to find \nfull-time work.\n  To put this in context, since this administration came into office, \nthe number of Americans who are unemployed has increased by 700,000. \nThis is a 5-percent increase in our national unemployment rate. Home \nvalues and middle-class income have decreased, and America has dropped \nfrom being the most competitive Nation in the world to the fourth most \ncompetitive Nation in the world.\n  After this administration's failed policies of bailout after bailout, \nSenate Democrats are endorsing the idea of letting America go off the \nso-called fiscal cliff at the end of this year instead of letting \nbusinesses maintain their existing tax rates. This would effectively \nraise taxes on every American during one of the slowest economic \nrecoveries in modern times.\n  While I support extending these taxes and giving our Nation's job \ncreators certainty, I believe we need tax reform. Our Tax Code is too \ncomplex. We need to close loopholes, broaden the base, and lower rates.\n  As a member of the Committee on Ways and Means in the House, I worked \non this issue, and I will continue to advocate for comprehensive reform \nwhile I am in the Senate. While I recognize that sometimes \ncomprehensive policies may be difficult to move forward, especially in \nan election year, I believe we can find consensus on commonsense \nsolutions.\n  Since coming to the Senate, I have advocated for policies that create \njobs for Nevadans and for all Americans. My State has been one of the \nhardest hit in this current economic climate. Nevada\n\n[[Page S5214]]\n\nhas had the distinction of leading the Nation in unemployment for over \n2 years, as well as in foreclosures and bankruptcies. One part of our \npopulation has been especially hit hard, and that is our veterans.\n  Over 13 percent of the Nation's bravest who put their lives on the \nline are unable to find a job in this economy. They come home from \noverseas to find their homes underwater or chronic unemployment in \ntheir communities. While a number of veterans have fallen on tough \ntimes financially, some have had difficulty adjusting to civilian life. \nCongress should make it a priority that necessary resources are made \navailable to those who have bravely served our Nation. We must also not \nforget the families of our veterans, particularly those who have lost \nloved ones in combat.\n  So I am proud to join with Senator Burr to introduce the Veterans \nSmall Business Act, which simply ensures that surviving spouses and \nchildren are eligible for small business benefits. Congress has \nprovided numerous benefits to our Nation's veterans who own small \nbusinesses, including sole-source contracting, low-interest loans, and \nother resources in order to help these small businesses grow and create \njobs. However, should a spouse or a child of a veteran lose a loved one \nin combat, they can no longer receive these benefits or enroll in these \nprograms.\n  My legislation closes this large gap in Federal law that does little \nfor those who own businesses before their activation and were killed in \nthe line of duty. As a Member of Congress, we must honor our Nation's \nfallen as well as ensuring that the loved ones they leave behind have \nthe same economic opportunities afforded to that veteran.\n  We should be doing all we can to provide all of our Nation's small \nbusinesses with the tools needed to survive in this current economic \nclimate. Congress needs to stop worrying about the next election and \nput in place policies that will not only ignite economic growth, but \nalso get our country back to work.\n  While there are larger issues we must address, such as tax reform, \nthere are smaller commonsense measures, such as this bill, that we can \npass right now if given the opportunity. Measures such as this will \nmake a big difference in our Nation's veterans and job creators.\n  If it is any indication of how important these issues are to Nevada, \nI had a constituent, Dan Lyons, who walked from Reno, NV, to \nWashington, DC, because he didn't think Washington was doing enough for \nveterans. This was a 6-month walk from Reno, NV, to Washington, DC. He \nfelt he was not getting through to his elected officials via phone or \ne-mails. So Dan, with a tent, a map, and a plan, started walking across \nAmerica to see his elected officials face to face.\n  He walked 25 miles a day, battling treacherous weather, snakes, long, \nlonely miles, and probably a few blisters just for the chance to sit \ndown and ask that we do more to help struggling veterans.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to increase \nthe number of permanent faculty in palliative care at accredited \nallopathic and osteopathic medical schools, nursing schools, and other \nprograms, to promote education in palliative care and hospice, and to \nsupport the development of faculty careers in academic palliative \nmedicine; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the critical need \nin today's health care workforce for additional training related to \npalliative care. Palliative care is an interdisciplinary model of care \nfocused on relieving the pain, stress and other debilitating symptoms \nof serious illness, such as cancer, cardiac disease, respiratory \ndisease, kidney failure, Alzheimer's, AIDS, ALS, and MS. Its goal is to \nrelieve suffering and provide the best possible quality of life for \npatients and their families.\n  Many people mistakenly believe that palliative care is only \nbeneficial when a cure is not possible. Actually, palliative care is \nnot dependent on a life-limiting prognosis and may actually help \nindividuals recover by relieving symptoms--such as pain, anxiety or \nloss of appetite--while they are undergoing sometimes difficult medical \ntreatments or procedures, such as surgery or chemotherapy. Palliative \ncare is provided by a team of doctors, nurses, social workers, and \nother specialists who work with a patient's other health care providers \nto provide an extra layer of support, including assistance with \ndifficult medical decision-making and coordination of care among \nspecialists. Palliative care is appropriate for people of any age and \nat any stage in an illness, whether that illness is curable, chronic or \nlife-threatening.\n  There is a specific type of palliative care, called hospice, for \npeople for whom a cure is no longer possible and who likely have 6 \nmonths or less to live. Hospice care can be provided at one's home, a \nhospice facility, a hospital or a nursing home. Hospice care is about \ngiving patients control, dignity and comfort so they have the best \npossible quality of life during the time they have. Hospice care also \nprovides support and grief therapy for loved ones whose struggles are \noften cast aside or forgotten during treatment.\n  A growing evidence base has demonstrated that palliative care, \nincluding hospice, improves quality, controls cost and enhances patient \nand family satisfaction for the rapidly expanding population of \nindividuals with serious or life-threatening illness. Palliative care \nmay also prolong the lives of some seriously ill patients.\n  Over the last 10 years, the number of hospital-based palliative care \nprograms has more than doubled due to the increasing number of \nAmericans living with serious, complex and chronic illnesses and the \nrealities of the care responsibilities faced by their families. Studies \nsuggest that in states with more hospital-based palliative care \nprograms, patients are less likely to die in the hospital, are likely \nto spend fewer days in the ICU, have better pain management and higher \nsatisfaction with their health care.\n  As usual, Oregon is ahead of the curve and I am proud to say that in \na 2011 report ranking states on their citizens' access to hospital-\nbased palliative care programs, Oregon was among the seven states who \nearned an ``A'' rating, with 88 percent of Oregon hospitals offering \npalliative care.\n  Unfortunately, many seriously ill patients and their families lack \nthe access available to Oregonians. Palliative care is a relatively new \nmedical specialty and more must be done to ensure an adequate, well-\ntrained palliative care workforce is available to provide comprehensive \nsymptom management, intensive communication and a level of care \ncoordination that addresses the episodic and long-term nature of \nserious, chronic illness. I believe that, with Federal support, we can \nhelp address the workforce gap between those currently practicing in \npalliative care and hospice and the number of health care professionals \nrequired to care for this expanding patient population That is why \ntoday I am introducing the Palliative Care and Hospice Education and \nTraining Act or PCHETA. This authorizing legislation focuses on three \nkey areas to grow the palliative care and hospice workforce.\n  Education centers to expand interdisciplinary training in palliative \nand hospice care.\n  Training of physicians who plan to teach palliative medicine and \nfellowships to encourage re-training for mid-career physicians, and \nacademic career awards and career incentive awards to support \nphysicians and other health care providers who provide palliative and \nhospice care training.\n  With this legislation, patients and families who are facing serious \nor life-threatening illness will have access to the high-quality \npalliative care and hospice services that can maximize their quality of \nlife. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5215]]\n\n                                S. 3407\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Palliative Care and Hospice \n     Education and Training Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Health care providers need better education about pain \n     management and palliative care. Students graduating from \n     medical school have very little, if any, training in the core \n     precepts of pain and symptom management, advance care \n     planning, communication skills, and care coordination for \n     patients with serious, life-threatening, or terminal illness.\n       (2) Palliative care is interdisciplinary, patient- and \n     family-centered health care for people with serious \n     illnesses. This type of care is focused on providing patients \n     with relief from the symptoms, pain, and stress of a serious \n     illness, whatever the diagnosis. The goal of palliative care \n     is to relieve suffering and improve quality of life for both \n     patients and their families. Palliative care is provided by a \n     team of doctors, nurses, social workers, chaplains, and other \n     specialists who work with a patient's other health care \n     providers to provide an extra layer of support, including \n     assistance with difficult medical decisionmaking and \n     coordination of care among specialists. Palliative care is \n     appropriate at any age and at any stage in a serious illness, \n     and can be provided together with curative treatment. \n     Palliative care is not dependent on a life-limiting prognosis \n     and may actually help an individual recover from illness by \n     relieving symptoms, such as pain, anxiety, or loss of \n     appetite, while undergoing sometimes difficult medical \n     treatments or procedures, such as surgery or chemotherapy. \n     There were 1,623 hospitals with palliative care programs in \n     2012.\n       (3) Hospice is palliative care for patients in their last \n     year of life. Considered the model for quality compassionate \n     care for individuals facing a life-limiting illness, hospice \n     provides expert medical care, pain management, and emotional \n     and spiritual support expressly tailored to the patient's \n     needs and wishes. In most cases, care is provided in the \n     patient's home but may also be provided in freestanding \n     hospice centers, hospitals, nursing homes, and other long-\n     term care facilities. In 2010, an estimated 1,580,000 \n     patients received services from hospice or approximately 41.9 \n     percent of all United States deaths. Hospice is a covered \n     benefit under the Medicare program. There were 3,509 \n     Medicare-certified hospices in 2010.\n       (4) A 2005 study at Michigan State University found that \n     the formal training of United States doctors in palliative \n     care is ``grossly inadequate''. When the American Society of \n     Clinical Oncology surveyed their members, 65 percent said \n     they had received inadequate education in controlling \n     symptoms associated with cancer, and 81 percent felt they had \n     inadequate mentoring in discussing a poor prognosis with \n     their patients and families. Training in pediatric palliative \n     care is also seriously lacking according to physicians, \n     residents, and medical students responding to a survey \n     presented at a meeting of American Federation for Medical \n     Research.\n       (5) The American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) and \n     the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education \n     (ACGME) provided formal subspecialty status for hospice and \n     palliative medicine (HPM) in 2006, and the Centers for \n     Medicare & Medicaid Services recognized hospice and \n     palliative medicine as a medical subspecialty in October of \n     2008.\n       (6) As of June 2012, there were a total of 86 hospice and \n     palliative medicine training programs. Seventy-eight programs \n     have been accredited by the Accreditation Council for \n     Graduate Medical Education and seven programs have been \n     accredited by the American Osteopathic Association. For the \n     2011-2012 academic year, these programs were training 176 \n     physicians in hospice and palliative medicine. Some programs \n     include an additional track in research, geriatrics, or \n     public health.\n       (7) There is a large gap between those practicing in the \n     palliative medicine field and the number of physicians \n     needed. A mid-range estimate by the American Academy of \n     Hospice and Palliative Medicine's Workforce Task Force calls \n     for 6,000 or more full time equivalents to serve current \n     needs in hospice and palliative care programs. At maximum \n     capacity, the current system would produce roughly 4,600 new \n     hospice and palliative medicine certified physicians over the \n     next 20 years, during which time some 70,000,000 new Medicare \n     beneficiaries will enter the Medicare program. At the same \n     time, there is expected to be increasing acceptance of the \n     hospice and palliative approach to care among the general \n     population and health care providers.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to require the disclosure of all payments made under \nthe Equal Access to Justice Act; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Government \nTransparency and Recordkeeping Act along with Senator Vitter.\n  The purpose of this bill is to require that all records of individual \npayments under 31 U.S.C. 1304, which is the Judgment Fund, are reported \nto Congress and made available to the public. It further requires that \nagencies provide this information by keeping accurate and thorough \nrecords.\n  Simply put, most Americans have a checking account. When you write a \ncheck, you also record it in your checking book. This checking book is \nyour record of how much you paid and to whom you paid. Simply put, the \nFederal Government does not do this in terms of the Judgment Fund. The \nFederal government has not been keeping track of its Judgment Fund \npayments because they are not required to do so. In this age of \ntechnology, shouldn't the federal government keep track of its \nfinances?\n  If the Federal Government is named as a defendant and the plaintiffs \nare successful then the plaintiffs may be awarded for certain attorney \nfees and costs. Such payments are made from the Judgment Fund.\n  The Judgment Fund was created in 1956 and is a permanent fund \navailable to pay judgments against the government and settlements \nresulting from lawsuits.\n  As the Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, I had to request that GAO investigate how much the Judgment \nFund has paid related to the environmental statutes in our jurisdiction \nand get back to me. Even GAO had trouble getting complete records over \nthe past ten years. This is federal taxpayers' money that we are \nspending without keeping accurate and up to date records. This \ninformation needs to be readily available and accessible to the public.\n  Federal agencies that are impacted by these costs as well as \npolicymakers and taxpayers should be able to track payments from the \nJudgment Fund to determine who is suing a particular Federal agency, \nthe nature of their claims, how often agencies settle and agree to pay \nplaintiffs' legal fees, and so forth. If Congress and the public had \naccess to this information in a useable form, they could identify \nproblem areas and work to save taxpayer money by bringing loss rates \ndown.\n  Article I, section 9 of the U.S. Constitution provides ``that a \nregular Statement and Account of the Receipts of all public money shall \nbe published from time to time.'' The operation and payment of Judgment \nfund monies should not be an exception. This bill will ensure that \nCongress and the public have access to such information.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/19/senate-section/article/S5218-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5218-S5224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 52--SETTING FORTH THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET \nFOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2013 AND SETTING FORTH \n  THE APPROPRIATE BUDGETARY LEVELS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2014 THROUGH 2022\n\n  Mr. LEE submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nplaced on the calendar:\n\n                            S.

POLICY STATEMENT ON MEDICARE.\n\n       It is the policy of this concurrent resolution that \n     Congress and the relevant committees of jurisdiction enact \n     legislation to ensure a reduction in the unfunded liabilities \n     of Medicare as follows:\n       (1) In 2017, Medicare is reformed to provide a premium \n     support payment and a selection of guaranteed health coverage \n     options from which recipients can choose a plan that best \n     suits their needs overseen by a separate independent agency.\n       (2) Preserves the traditional Medicare fee for service \n     option administered by the Department of Health and Human \n     Services.\n       (3) For each region, the base Federal premium support would \n     be initially set at 88 percent of the average of 3 lowest \n     bids.\n       (4) Provides for enhanced risk adjustment to ensure \n     continuity in coverage and market stability.\n       (5) Raises the age of eligibility gradually over 10 years, \n     increasing from 65 to 68, resulting in a 3.6 month increase \n     per year and subsequently increased or decreased based on \n     longevity.\n       (6) The Federal-based premium support amount would be \n     reduced or phased out for upper income seniors and increased \n     for lower income seniors.\n\n     SEC. 503. POLICY STATEMENT ON MEDICAID.\n\n       It is the policy of this concurrent resolution that \n     Congress and the relevant committees of jurisdiction enact \n     legislation to ensure fiscal sustainability at the Federal \n     level while protecting the most vulnerable and promoting \n     beneficiary independence as follows:\n       (1) Medicaid is reformed to provide direct Federal premium \n     support for low-income, nondisabled, nonelderly individuals.\n       (2) The Federal Government would provide at least $2,000 \n     for an individual and at least $3,500 in premium support for \n     a family and up to $9,000 for the lowest income families.\n       (3) Current Federal Medicaid funding for acute and long-\n     term care services provided to the disabled and elderly (dual \n     eligibles) would be converted into a fixed payment to the \n     States adjusted on a per capita basis for medical inflation.\n       (4) States would be permitted to design and manage more \n     appropriate care and service delivery to the disabled and \n     elderly populations remaining in the program.\n\n     SEC. 504. POLICY STATEMENT ON TAX REFORM.\n\n       It is the policy of this concurrent resolution that \n     Congress and the relevant committees of jurisdiction shall \n     enact legislation to ensure the adoption of a new tax system \n     that replaces all existing taxes collected by the Federal \n     Government including but not limited to income, payroll, gift \n     and estate taxes, and excises except those dedicated to \n     specific Trust Funds, with a new flat tax featuring a \n     consumed-income tax base structure that is economically \n     neutral with respect to saving and investment, reduces tax \n     complexity, and provides for a globally competitive single \n     tax rate as follows:\n       (1) The new tax will have a single flat tax rate consistent \n     with and sufficient to collect the annual revenue levels \n     specified herein. The individual tax code shall include no \n     deductions, exemptions, exclusions, or credits except as \n     follows:\n       (A) A deduction for charitable contributions to \n     institutions qualifying as charitable organizations under \n     current law.\n       (B) An elective deduction for home mortgage interest \n     subject to the condition that if and only if the borrow \n     elects the deduction the lender would then owe tax on all \n     resulting income.\n       (C) A deduction for higher education tuition and fees.\n       (D) A standard deduction for seniors equal to the sum of \n     the flat Social Security benefit amount plus the value of the \n     Medicare defined contributions.\n       (E) An exclusion for seniors of up to $10,000 in wage and \n     salary income.\n       (F) The current law Earned Income Credit.\n       (G) A $3,500 nonrefundable tax credit for families ($2,000 \n     for individuals) to purchase health insurance. The new \n     individual tax would tax all income and other proceeds used \n     for consumption and exclude all savings.\n       (2) The business tax code shall apply the same rate as the \n     individual tax code, and shall levy tax on total revenue from \n     the domestic sale of goods and services less purchases of \n     goods and services from other firms less wages, salaries, and \n     related employee costs. All credits currently applicable to \n     business income would be repealed except the Alternative \n     Simplified Credit for research and development expenditures.\n       (3) Individuals and businesses would be subject to taxation \n     solely on income generated within the United States. A border \n     tax adjustment system would be developed in consultation with \n     the World Trade Organization to neutralize tax differences \n     for goods and services entering and leaving the United States \n     proper.\n\n[[Page S5224]]\n\n       (4) Tax reform shall be enacted with due care through \n     transition provisions to avoid insofar as possible \n     retroactive tax increases or decreases arising from the \n     accrued tax consequences of decisions made under current tax \n     law.\n\n     SEC. 505. POLICY STATEMENT ON GOVERNMENT ASSET SALES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Federal Government owns and controls vast assets, \n     including huge swaths of commercial land, especially in the \n     West; power generation facilities; valuable portions of the \n     electromagnetic spectrum; underutilized buildings; and \n     financial assets.\n       (2) Control of these numerous and varied assets is 1 key \n     expression of a government much too large and intrusive.\n       (3) Given the Federal Government's excessive spending, \n     which has driven trillion-dollar-plus deficits for 4 straight \n     years, and generated debt burdens that are stifling present-\n     day economic growth and threatening the Nation's future \n     prosperity.\n       (4) Divesting itself of these assets would make an \n     important contribution to reducing Government's debt and \n     interest costs.\n       (b) Policy on Asset Sales.--It is the policy of this budget \n     resolution that the House and Senate shall each develop a \n     package of asset sales and transfers of government activities \n     to the private sector. These proposals, which are to yield \n     revenues or savings of at least $260,000,000,000 through \n     fiscal year 2028, shall be submitted to the respective \n     chambers for enactment in fiscal year 2013.\n       (c) Assumptions Regarding Asset Sales.--The assets in the \n     package must include, though not be limited to, the \n     following:\n       (1) Land administered by the Bureau of Land Management and \n     the Department of Agriculture.\n       (2) Federal buildings and other real estate.\n       (3) Mineral rights.\n       (4) Electromagnetic spectrum.\n       (5) Facilities administered by the Power Marketing \n     Administrations and by the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n       (6) Federal loans and other financial assets.\n       (7) Amtrak.\n       (d) Assumptions Regarding Transfer of Government \n     Activities.--Transfers of government activities to the \n     private must include, though not be limited to, the \n     following:\n       (1) The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation.\n       (2) The Government Printing Office.\n       (3) The Architect of the Capitol.\n       (4) The Bureau of Reclamation.\n\n     SEC. 506. POLICY ON REPEALING OBAMACARE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The quality of United States health care, as well as \n     the stability of the nation's economy and the Federal budget, \n     depend on solving the genuine cost and delivery challenges in \n     the health sector.\n       (2) But the pervasive government intrusiveness and \n     $1,390,000,000,000 cost of Obamacare are precisely the wrong \n     prescription for problems that have developed grown from \n     faulty government policy, particularly on the part of the \n     Federal Government.\n       (3) Obamacare will generate fewer choices, less access, and \n     greater dependence on the Government for health care, while \n     increasing taxes, regulation and mandates on individuals and \n     businesses.\n       (4) A majority of Americans continue to oppose this one-\n     size-fits-all ``remedy,'' a Government takeover of one sixth \n     of the economy that was rammed through Congress despite a \n     clear lack of consensus.\n       (b) Policy on Obamacare.--It is the policy of this budget \n     resolution that Congress should repeal Obamacare and develop \n     a fresh strategy built on a patient-centered, market-based \n     solution.\n\n                      TITLE VI--SENSE OF CONGRESS\n\n     SEC. 601. REGULATORY REFORM.\n\n       It is the policy of this concurrent resolution that \n     Congress and the relevant committees of jurisdiction enact \n     legislation to ensure a regulatory reform as follows:\n       (1) Apply regulatory analysis requirements to independent \n     agencies.--It shall be the policy of Congress to pass into \n     law a requirement for independent agencies to abide by the \n     same regulatory analysis requirement as those required by \n     executive branch agencies.\n       (2) Adopt the regulations from the executive in need of \n     scrutiny act (reins).--It shall be the policy of Congress to \n     vote on the Regulations From the Executive in Need of \n     Scrutiny Act of 2011, legislation that would require all \n     regulations that impose a burden greater than $100 million in \n     economic aggregate may not be implemented as law unless \n     Congress gives their consent by voting on the rule.\n       (3) Sunset all regulations.--It shall be the policy of \n     Congress that regulations imposed by the Federal Government \n     shall automatically sunset every 2 years unless repromulgated \n     by Congress.\n       (4) Process reform.--It shall be the policy of Congress to \n     implement regulatory process reform by instituting \n     statutorily required regulatory impact analysis for all \n     agencies, require the publication of regulatory impact \n     analysis before the regulation is finalized, and ensure that \n     not only are regulatory impact analysis conducted, but \n     applied to the issued regulation or rulemaking.\n       (5) Incorporation of formal rulemaking for major rules.--It \n     shall be the policy of Congress to apply formal rulemaking \n     procedures to all major regulations or those regulations that \n     exceed $100,000,000 in aggregate economic costs.\n\n     SEC. 602. RESCIND UNSPENT OR UNOBLIGATED BALANCES AFTER 36 \n                   MONTHS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) any adjustments of allocations and aggregates made \n     pursuant to this resolution shall require that any \n     unobligated or unspent allocations be rescinded after 36 \n     months;\n       (2) revised allocations and aggregates resulting from these \n     adjustments resulting from the required rescissions shall be \n     considered for the purposes of the Congressional Budget Act \n     of 1974 as allocations and aggregates contained in this \n     resolution; and\n       (3) for purposes of this resolution the levels of new \n     budget authority, outlays, direct spending, new entitlement \n     authority, revenues, deficits, and surpluses for a fiscal \n     year or period of fiscal years shall be determined on the \n     basis of estimates made by the Committee on the Budget of the \n     Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/19/senate-section/article/S5224-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2561.
