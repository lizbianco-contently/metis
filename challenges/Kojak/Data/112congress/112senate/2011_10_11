The first vote will be on confirmation of the \nTriche-Milazzo nomination. That is a vote for a judge. We appreciate \nthe cooperation we have gotten on that.

Does the Senator have a question?\n  Mr. CORKER. I would like to ask a question, if I could.\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield to my friend for a question.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, it is my understanding that--first of all, \nI think most people in this body know it has been 995 days, and the \nfree-trade agreements are just now coming to the floor. I had a very \ngood conversation today with the majority leader, and I thank him so \nmuch for his courtesy. But it is my understanding, for all those who \nwant to see the free-trade agreements ratified prior to the time the \nSouth Korea President comes on Thursday to make his joint address--for \nall those who want to see that passed and in hand in advance of that--\nif we were to get on the jobs bill, as I understand it, we would have \nto stay on the jobs bill for 30 hours. So by getting on the jobs bill, \nit would actually preclude us from being able to successfully pass \nthose free-trade agreements in the time that all of us would like.\n  I would like for that to be verified by the leader, if that is \npossible.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, around here we can do anything by unanimous \nconsent. The work the Republican leader and I went through--perhaps a \nlittle easier on his side than mine--to get the trade bills in the \nposition they are in was fairly difficult, and it would take unanimous \nconsent to get off a particular piece of legislation we are on to move \nforward on the trade bills. That is my understanding. As I have \nindicated, we are looking forward to the votes this evening, and I will \nbe happy to be as cooperative as I can with everyone involved. But in \ndirect response to my friend's question, I think it is pretty clear it \nwould take unanimous consent to do that.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, my understanding is that unanimous consent \nwould be very unlikely considering the fact there are a number of folks \nwho actually do not want to see these trade agreements pass. The \nevidence is, if we were to get on the jobs bill--and I thank the leader \nfor talking with me about this--it is very unlikely the free-trade \nagreements will pass in the time all of us would like to see prior to \nthe President of South Korea being here.\n  I yield the floor and thank the majority leader for letting me have \nthis dialog and for having the dialog we had on Thursday evening.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say through the Chair to my friend, I was \nhappy to have that dialog. As we have\n\n[[Page S6360]]\n\nindicated, if at some time we get on a jobs bill, we will have--as I \nhave indicated, I appreciate the comments of a number of people in the \npress today. Specifically, I direct myself to Mr. John Cornyn, the \njunior Senator from Texas. He and I have not always seen the same \npicture on legislative matters, but I thought his statements in the \npress were very constructive. He, in effect, said he would hope we \ncould get on legislation and work on it the way we used to and that \nwould be to have some agreement on how we move forward with amendments. \nThe Republican leader and I are trying to do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/11/senate-section/article/S6360-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             UPCOMING VOTES\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this evening, the Senate will vote on \nlegislation to end the unfair practice of currency manipulation by the \nChinese Government. It is pretty clear by now that China undervalues \nits currency to give its own exports an unwarranted advantage in the \nglobal marketplace. This costs American jobs--lots of them. It costs \nlots of jobs by unjustly tilting the playing field against American \nmanufacturers.\n  America's trade deficit with China has ballooned from $10 billion in \n1990 to $273 billion today. It has cost 3 million American jobs \nalready. Two million of those lost jobs came from the manufacturing \nsector.\n  American businesses do not need special advantages to compete. They \njust need an even playing field.\n  Tonight we have the opportunity to stop China from continuing to \ncheat American workers, pump $300 billion into our economy, and support \n1.6 million Americans jobs.\n  This legislation has twice advanced in this Chamber with bipartisan \nsupermajorities. Thirty-one Republicans voted to move this legislation \nto the Senate floor early last week. I urge each of them to stand firm \nin their support for this job-creating legislation--to stand with \nAmerican workers rather than siding with China. I remind my Republican \ncolleagues that those who revoke support of this important measure for \nthe sake of partisan politics must answer, first of all, as we all do, \nto our constituents.\n  Today, the Senate will vote to proceed to the American Jobs Act, \nPresident Obama's plan to put Americans to work without adding a penny \nto the deficit. This legislation will also ask the richest Americans to \ncontribute their fair share to get our economy back on track.\n  The President's plan will put construction crews back to work \nbuilding the things that make our country stronger--roads, bridges, \ndams, sewers, water systems, and up-to-date schools where our children \ncan get the best education possible.\n  There are schools in our country that are not wired for the Internet. \nThe average school in America is a little more than 50 years old. \nTechnology has changed a lot since those schools were constructed, but, \nsadly, our schools have not. This work is essential, and Americans are \ndesperate for jobs it will create.\n  The American Jobs Act would also extend unemployment insurance for \nAmericans who are still struggling to find work. Economists agree this \nboosts the economy because the long-term unemployed spend the money \nimmediately on groceries, gas, and rent.\n\n  This legislation would cut taxes for middle-class families and \nbusinesses--something Republicans have long supported. The President's \nplan contains many ideas that Republicans have supported consistently \nover the years, especially when their party controlled Congress or the \nWhite House or both. Republicans oppose those ideas now, I guess, \nbecause they have a proven track record of creating jobs--all these \nprograms--but I guess Republicans think if the economy improves, it \nmight help President Obama. So they root for the economy to fail and \noppose every effort to improve it, and they resist anything the \nPresident proposes, no matter its common sense, including this jobs \nplan to create 2 million jobs, containing many of the issues the \nRepublicans have supported many times.\n  Americans have demanded Congress pass legislation to create jobs--and \npass it now. Americans support our plan to fund job creation by asking \npeople who make more than $1 million a year to contribute their fair \nshare by a margin of 3 to 1. That is 75 percent. Mainstream Americans \nagree we cannot ask seniors and the middle class to go on shouldering \nthe heaviest burden.\n  Today we will see whether Republicans have gotten the message or if \nthey still put the wants of millionaires and billionaires ahead of the \nneeds of seniors and middle-class families. The American people demand \nthat the Republicans finally admit that putting America back to work \nwill require shared sacrifice--especially from those who can best \nafford to be part of the solution.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/11/senate-section/article/S6360-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, a little later today, the Senate will \nvote on President Obama's second attempt to address our Nation's \nongoing jobs crisis with a stimulus bill, and Republicans actually \nwelcome the opportunity. If voting against another stimulus is the only \nway we can get Democrats in Washington to finally abandon this failed \napproach to job creation, then so be it.\n  The President has been calling for this vote for weeks, and, in my \nview, we cannot have it soon enough. In fact, on the previous bill, I \nkept trying to get a vote on the President's first version of the \nstimulus bill. We will be voting on the second sort of modified version \nof the stimulus bill this afternoon. This is a vote Republicans are \nanxious to have.\n  For nearly 5 years, Democrats have controlled the Senate. For the \nlast 3 of those years, they have also controlled the White House. By \nproposing a second stimulus, Democrats are showing the American people \nthey have no new ideas for dealing with our jobs crisis.\n  Today's vote is conclusive proof that Democrats' sole proposal is to \nkeep doing what has not worked--along with a massive tax hike we know \nwill not create jobs. So it is hard to overstate the importance of this \nvote.\n  The President's first stimulus was a legislative and economic \ncatastrophe. Nearly 3 years after passage, we are still learning about \nits failures and its abuses. We knew it was a bailout for States. We \nknew all about the absurd projects it funded. Over the past few weeks, \nwe have also learned that the Obama administration was doing the very \nthing with solar companies that it once rightly criticized many others \nfor doing on Wall Street: gambling with other people's money; the \nFederal Government playing venture capitalist with our tax money.\n  But there is only one thing we need to know about the first stimulus \nto oppose the second one and it is this: $825 billion later, there are \n1.7 million fewer jobs in this country than there were when the first \nstimulus was signed. That is the clearest proof it was a monstrous \nfailure, and it is the surest proof we have that those who support the \nsecond stimulus are not doing so to create jobs.\n  As I see it, that is what today's vote boils down to. Everyone who \nvotes for this second stimulus will have to answer a simple but \nimportant question: Why on Earth would we support an approach that we \nalready know will not work?\n  Of course, the truth is most Democrats know just as well as I do that \npassing another stimulus and tax hike is a lousy idea, which is why the \nDemocrats are having such a hard time convincing their colleagues to \nvote for it.\n  Here is what they have decided to do instead. Democrats have designed \nthis bill to fail--they have designed their own bill to fail--in the \nhopes that anyone who votes against it will look bad for opposing a \nbill they mistakenly refer to as a ``jobs bill.''\n  That is not just my interpretation. The senior Senator from New York \nhas\n\n[[Page S6361]]\n\nbeen out there telling reporters that what the Democrats are going for \ntoday is ``contrast.'' The senior Senator from New York said this is \nall about contrast--not about jobs, about contrast.\n  It does not seem to matter that this bill will not pass or that even \nif it did pass, American businesses would be stuck with a permanent tax \nhike. Forget about all of that. What matters most to the Democrats who \ncontrol the Senate, according to the stories I have been reading, is \nthat they have an issue to run on for next year. This whole exercise, \nby their own admission, is a charade that is meant to give Democrats a \npolitical edge in an election that is 13 months away.\n  Well, with all due respect to the senior Senator from New York, the \nAmerican people don't want contrast, they want jobs. They want the \nDemocrats who control the Senate to stop thinking about how they can \nimprove their own political prospects 13 months from now and start \nthinking about how they can help other people's job prospects right \nnow. They want Democrats to focus on job creation, not political \npreservation. So I have a better idea. How about we get this vote that \nDemocrats already know will not pass behind us so we can focus on real \njob-creating legislation that we actually know is worthy of passing \nwith bipartisan support. Republicans have been calling on Democrats to \nwork with us on bipartisan job-creating bills for 3 years, and every \nonce in a while we convince them.\n  Tomorrow, we will approve three free-trade agreements I have been \ncalling on the President to approve since his first day in office. \nThese agreements will not add a dime to the deficit, and they are \nexpected by Democrats and Republicans to create tens of thousands of \njobs. They will have strong bipartisan support, and they do not contain \na single job-destroying tax hike.\n  Both parties also came together earlier this year to pass a patent \nreform bill President Obama and Democrats in Congress touted as a job \ncreator, and Democrats and Republicans came together this summer to \npass a highway bill extension, FAA extension, that will lead to just \nthe kind of job creation that has bipartisan support. You don't hear \nmuch about any of this from the President. It gets in the way of his \ncampaign strategy. But that does not mean Republicans cannot continue \nto urge the President to work with us, and that is just what we plan to \ndo.\n  Over the next weeks and months, Republicans will continue to press \nour friends on the other side to work with us on legislation that will \nactually do something to create jobs in this country. Our first \ncriteria for any proposal is that it would actually lead to more jobs, \nnot fewer. I know that may seem crazy to some, but in our view it is \nnot a jobs bill if it leads to fewer jobs. Our second criteria is that \nit does not add to the deficit. There is no reason we need to \nexacerbate one crisis in an effort to tackle another one.\n  Democrats like to point out that the second stimulus we will have a \nvote on today is ``paid for with tax hikes'' and that it contains a \n``tax cut.'' What they do not tell you, of course, is the tax cut lasts \nfor 13 months, while the tax hikes last forever. They hide the fact \nthat over the next 5 years it will actually increase the deficit, by \nnearly $300 billion next year alone: Permanent tax increases, temporary \ntax cuts, increase the deficit by $300 billion next year alone.\n  Another thing the Democratic supporters of this bill fail to mention \nis that about four out of five of the people who would be hit with \ntheir new taxes are, in fact, businesses, including thousands of small \nbusinesses across the country--in other words, the very people \nAmericans rely on to create new jobs. So the legislation we will be \nvoting on today is many things, but it is not a jobs bill. Republicans \nwill gladly vote against any legislation that makes it harder to create \njobs right now.\n  The President's advisers have said they are counting on a do-nothing \nCongress. That is why we will be voting for legislation today that is \ndesigned to fail. If you ask me, this is a pretty sad commentary on the \nstate of the Democratic Party in Washington.\n  I think the American people deserve better. I think the 16.5 percent \nof Americans who are looking for work or who stopped looking for work \ndeserve better. I think the 4.5 million Americans who have been out of \nwork for more than a year deserve better. I think the nearly 15 percent \nof young Americans who cannot find work right now deserve better. \nAmericans deserve more than a clumsy political stunt. They deserve \nbetter than the same well-rehearsed talking points we have been hearing \nfrom Democrats over the past few weeks. Above all, they deserve a \ndifferent approach to this crisis than the one they have gotten from \nDemocrats over the past few years. For nearly 3 years, Democrats in \nCongress have done virtually everything the President asked of them--\neverything he asked of them. And I would remind everyone that they \nowned the government the first 2 years of the Obama administration. \nThey got everything they wanted. They passed his health care bill. They \npassed his financial regulations bill. They passed his stimulus. They \nwaved through all the regulations, the bailouts, and the massive \nspending bills. And what did we get? A bad economy became worse; record \ndeficits and debt; a first ever credit downgrade; and 1.7 million fewer \njobs. Democrats may have run out of ideas, but Republicans are ready to \nwork with them on a new approach. It is why we are here. And we are \nready to act.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/11/senate-section/article/S6361-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to talk a little bit about the \nconversation we just had on the floor.\n  There is no question that in the State of Tennessee and all across \nour country, I think the biggest item on anybody's mind is our economy \nand people having jobs in each of our States.\n  I still believe the very best thing we can do to create a sound \neconomy is for this deficit committee to do what it needs to do in \nNovember and December and for us to show the American people we have \nthe ability to deal with the big structural issues our country faces. I \nbelieve that with all my heart.\n  I don't think there is a business in our country today that is \nlooking for some sugary stimulus bill that will be here and gone, \nleaving us with lots of debt and increased taxes down the road. I \nbelieve that.\n  I guess I am disappointed that again we are in a situation, just as \nwe were last Thursday night, where we are really not here to solve \nproblems--neither side, candidly--we are here to have some political \nstunt take place.\n  I do want to say to my friends on both sides of the aisle that there \nare numbers of people here who have worked hard to get the free-trade \nagreements in the place they need to be, and I think we are all \nexpecting them to pass tomorrow. I think all of us who support these \nthree free-trade agreements that have been languishing for 995 days--by \nthe way, that includes lots of Senators on both sides of the aisle. I \nthink what we just heard the leader say--that if we were to get on this \njobs bill, as he is advocating we get on today, the likelihood of us \nactually taking up these free-trade agreements and passing them \ntomorrow is almost nil. I mean it is not going to happen. We know there \nare people who oppose the free-trade agreements, and I doubt very \nseriously that we are going to see a unanimous consent to move off a \njobs bill that everyone knows is really for show on to something that \nis serious, such as the free-trade agreements that some people oppose.\n\n  So I have had lots of conversations with Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle over the course of the last 72 hours regarding the need for \nus to have a real\n\n[[Page S6362]]\n\ndebate on jobs. I hope that at some point we will actually have a real \ndebate on a real jobs bill that people really want to pass. I would say \nthat to make that happen, that would actually mean the Republican \nleader and the Democratic leader would actually have to sit down and \ncraft a piece of legislation on which there is common ground. Of \ncourse, that is not what is happening, and we know that. And for all of \nus who have things we have done in life that are productive, and we \nhave chosen to come serve our country in this way--we have the ability \nto be productive in other ways--for all of us to come up here and to \nwatch this continual charade taking place in this body is \ndisappointing. It burns up a lot of time, and we accomplish nothing for \nthe American people.\n  So, candidly, I want to have a debate on jobs. I know that, again, \nmoving to the jobs bill tonight would negate the opportunity for the \nonly thing we could do recently to actually create jobs, which is \npassing these three free-trade agreements, and what they will do is \nenhance American manufacturers' ability to make and sell things \noverseas, enhance farmers across our country and their ability to sell \ntheir goods overseas. It is a one-way positive street for us because \nthese countries already have low trade tariff barriers in our own \ncountry. So it lowers those barriers for us into their country.\n  I am going to vote against proceeding to the jobs bill. I am \ndisappointed that we cannot do things--we know we have a Republican \nHouse, and we know that to pass something that is good for this \ncountry, it requires a negotiation between all of the players. So each \ntime we bring up these bills that are totally crafted in partisan ways, \nwe know all we are doing is wasting time.\n  I do have one glimmer of hope; that is, this deficit reduction \ncommittee. The fact is that this committee was put together with six \nRepublicans and six Democrats, so this committee has the ability to do \nsome things that no one can blame the other side for. I mean we are \ntalking about something that is totally split.\n  I will say one other thing. This committee was put together and \nsolely conceived by leadership in the Senate and the House. So we had \nfour people, the leaders of the House and Senate, who conceived of this \nsupercommittee, and they are the ones who appointed the members to this \nsupercommittee. They decided who the members of this committee were \ngoing to be. They set it up purposefully so that it was equally \nbalanced--six and six. Candidly, the success of this committee is \ntotally in the hands of our leadership. So it appears to me that for \nthe first time in a long time, we actually have within leadership's \nhands totally the ability to pass something that is great for our \ncountry, and anything short of getting to the $1.5 trillion that is \nlaid out in this legislation is totally a failure.\n  What I am sure of is that since this was totally set up in a \nbipartisan way by leadership on the Republican and Democratic side in \nboth the House and Senate and they choose the members, there is no \nquestion in my mind that this is going to be successful or, candidly, \nbe viewed by many as a failure--failure of leadership, candidly. So I \nam certain we are going to get to $1.5 trillion, and I am hopeful, as \nare a number of Republicans and Democrats within the Senate--I think we \nhave a list of over 40--that we are actually going to get to a $3 \ntrillion reduction in the deficit, that we are going to go big or, as \nsome have said, we end up with something that is qualitatively equal to \nthat. Many of us know that trying to get $3 trillion in savings over a \n10-year period might be difficult. I still hope it happens. I still \nthink it can happen. I think there are numbers of people in this body \nwho have worked to make that happen.\n  But some people have said: Well, maybe we can get some major reforms \nto Medicare and other kinds of programs in the second 10, and maybe \nqualitatively that is equally as good. I am certainly willing to look \nas one Senator at all of those things. It is a waste of time to be \nbringing up totally partisan bills in this body, knowing that to become \nlaw they have to pass the House of Representatives, which means anybody \nwho brings up something in this body today that is totally partisan \nknows that in advance. That is discouraging to me, discouraging to \nwaste time talking about something we know is never going to become law \nfor campaigns for House Members, Senate Members, and the President to \nrun on.\n  But at least I am hopeful that in November and December we are going \nto have something big happen because, again, this is totally in the \nhands of bipartisan leadership, who totally appointed the Members, who \ntotally are working with this group.\n  Again, Mr. President, to me, that is the best stimulus we can \npossibly create for this country. It is for small businesses and big \nbusinesses, for Republicans and Democrats all across this country to \nsee that this body actually has the ability to do something to create \nsome stability in this country and actually tackle the No. 1 issue that \ncan continue to dissipate our country's standard of living, which is \nour inability to deal with debt.\n  To me, that is the greatest job stimulus we can deal with. There are \nall kinds of regulatory issues and American energy issues and others \nthat, to me, we can take up in a true jobs bill. It is my hope we will \ndo that soon. All I had to hear today, in addition to knowing this is a \npartisan effort which, again, I hate to see ever taking place on this \nfloor--the fact is, for any Senator who wants to see the three free-\ntrade agreements that have been languishing, any Senator on the \nDemocratic side, any Senator on the Republican side who wants to see \nthe three free-trade agreements passed into law tomorrow as has been \nplanned, anybody who wants to see that happen must vote no on the jobs \nbill being debated because, as the majority leader stated today, if we \nbegin to debate the jobs bill, that means we cannot, without unanimous \nconsent--which we know will not happen in this body--pivot and go to \nthe trade agreements.\n  In addition to the fact that I know this is not a serious effort--\nalthough I would love to debate jobs--and the fact that I know if we \nget on this bill we cannot pass these free-trade agreements in time, I \ncertainly plan to vote no on proceeding to them and hope at a date when \nwe want to take up a true jobs bill, we will have a vigorous debate in \nthis body and actually have the ability to pass something that will \ncreate jobs.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/11/senate-section/article/S6362-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6362-S6365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             UPCOMING VOTES\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about two \nof the votes we will be casting at approximately 5:30 this afternoon, \nand to explain how I am going to vote and why. On the first, the \nlegislation regarding China's currency policy, I am going to vote no, \nand I want to explain why.\n  Managing our economic, military, and diplomatic relations with China \nis going to be one of the great challenges of this century. China is \nobviously a rising power today, though not one without problems, as I \nwill get to in a moment. We have come to a point--China and the United \nStates--where we not only interact and sometimes bump up against each \nother militarily, diplomatically, and economically, we also, in many \nways, have become dependent on one another. What each of us does has an \neffect on the other, and often a significant effect. That is why I say \none of the great challenges of this century will be to manage our \nrelations with China in a way that is certainly beneficial and \nprotective to the United States but, hopefully, to China, from its \nperspective, as well.\n  I say this as background to what I want to say about China's currency \npolicy. I am troubled by China's currency policy. China has obviously \nkept its currency too low. It is undervalued, and that has resulted in \nproducts being made in China selling elsewhere at a price that is lower \nthan other manufacturers can compete with, including American \nmanufacturers that are directly in conflict with China. So we are right \nto be upset about that policy. Our government has been expressing its \nfrustration, its anger, to the Chinese\n\n[[Page S6363]]\n\nGovernment. We have been negotiating, cajoling. I must say, in \nacknowledgment of reality, that the Chinese have slowly allowed their \ncurrency to rise approximately 30 percent in value over the last 6 \nyears, but it should be allowed to rise more.\n  On the other hand, I do want to say, in fairness, that China's \ncurrency policy does have effects that are not all bad for everybody in \nthe United States. The fact its currency is undervalued means some of \nthe products it brings into our country sell at a lower cost, and that \nis obviously particularly important to middle-income and lower income \nfamilies who are out buying products that otherwise would cost more. So \nI understand this legislation to be an expression of anger at the \nChinese Government and an attempt to pressure the Chinese Government to \nmore rapidly allow its currency to rise.\n  I would say, as I understand it, the legislation before us is \nintended as a warning shot across China's bow, as it were. But China \nmay, from its perspective, see this as an attempt to make a direct \nattack, a direct hit on its bow, and it may be tempted to retaliate \neconomically. And of course the worst result would be that we would end \nup in a mutually damaging trade war.\n  In some sense, it is no surprise we are considering legislation such \nas this now--though I think at any time we would be concerned about \nChina's currency policy--because throughout history, during times of \neconomic recession, such as the one we are in now--a recession that we \nare fighting to come out of and another recession we worry we are about \nto go into--nations have repeatedly become protectionist in their \neconomic and trade policies. But history also shows most of the time \nthat protectionist policy makes the economic problems worse, not \nbetter.\n  Today--and here I get back to what I said about China being a rising \npower but not one without problems--China's economy, in its way, is \nalso fragile. It is dealing with a bubble in real estate values that is \ngrowing. As the papers today indicate, its banks are losing their \ncredibility, inflation is rising, and unemployment is rising. So it \nwould be foolish for China to get into a trade war with us in response \nto legislation such as this. China, in fact, may be more vulnerable in \na trade war than we are. But China's vulnerability economically today \ncarries great risk for the United States and the world. If a trade war \nsends China's economy into a recession or worse, the resultant economic \ninstability would seriously hamper prospects for the global economic \nrecovery that everybody hopes for, and of course it would greatly \ndampen our hopes for an American economic recovery and creation of more \njobs here at home.\n  Bottom line: I think the risks this proposal will aggravate the \ncurrent global and American economic problems which concern us most are \ngreater than the rewards of again trying to force China to allow its \ncurrency to rise more rapidly, and that is why I will vote against the \nChina currency legislation when it comes before us later this \nafternoon.\n  I also want to speak about the American Jobs Act, which will come \nbefore us for a cloture vote. We are, obviously, hearing of Americans--\nrelated to what I have just talked about--going through what I think is \nthe most difficult economic period in our history since the Great \nDepression of the 1930s. Unemployment hovers at around 9 percent, which \ntranslates into millions and millions of people out of work, and \nmillions more who are worried they are going to be next to lose their \njobs. Confidence in our future among the American people, among \ncritical decisionmakers and businesses, is at a real low. Confidence in \nour national government is low and falling. Anger at our rising \nnational debt is high and rising. The American people are demanding we \ndo something, particularly to protect the jobs they have and create new \njobs if they have already lost them.\n  It is in that context the President proposed the American Jobs Act--a \nseries of interesting ideas aimed at creating jobs that will cost \nalmost $\\1/2\\ trillion. So what am I going to do on this one? On this \none, I am going to vote against the filibuster of the American Jobs \nAct, because I believe our country and our constituents need and \ndeserve a debate here in the Senate on what each of us, all of us, \nthink we should do to get our economy moving again. It should be an \nopen debate, without an effective limit on amendments, with many ideas \nbeing offered as to what we should do, and hopefully that will lead us \nto some consensus. So I am going to vote against filibuster in the hope \nwe will bring about such a debate.\n  But I must say, if cloture is granted and the filibuster is ended, I \nwill seek to amend the American Jobs Act down to a very few of its \nconstituent parts that I think are worth their cost. If a vote were \ncalled on the American Jobs Act as it is now--in other words, if the \ntree were filled and that is what happened--I would vote against the \nAmerican Jobs Act, and I want to explain why.\n  The bottom line here is I don't believe the potential in this act for \ncreating jobs justifies adding another $\\1/2\\ trillion to our almost \n$15 trillion national debt. In fact, I think the most important thing \nwe can do to improve our economy, reduce unemployment, and create jobs \nis to bring our national debt under control. The best way to do that is \nto adopt a tough, comprehensive, balanced debt reduction plan, such as \nthe one recommended by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission.\n  The Budget Control Act, which we adopted over the summer to deal with \nthe debt ceiling, created a so-called supercommittee, the Joint Special \nCommittee, and that committee of 12 now gives us another chance to deal \nwith our debt in a constructive and bipartisan way.\n  We all know it is not going to be easy, but the American Jobs Act \nwould make the task of the Joint Special Committee even more difficult \nbecause it spends almost $\\1/2\\ trillion we don't have, $\\1/2\\ trillion \nthe act now proposes to raise with a surtax on people making more than \n$1 million a year.\n  I don't have any objection to a tax increase of that kind. But if we \nuse it for the American Jobs Act, it is not going to be there to be \nused by the Joint Special Committee as part of an overall bipartisan \ndebt reduction plan. We desperately need to have some sources of \nrevenue, along with spending cuts, to adopt the kinds of reductions in \nour debt that the country's future urgently needs.\n  Let me come back to what I said a moment ago and try to explain \nbriefly why I believe these two great problems we have, our limping \neconomy, our persistent level of high unemployment and our national \ndebt, come together and, more explicitly, why I believe that reducing \nour debt is actually the best thing we can do to create jobs.\n  The jobs we need are going to come from the private sector. \nGovernment in our system economically never has created the jobs \nitself. It shouldn't. It can't, anymore, because we don't have the \nmoney to do so. The jobs always will come where most people have been \nemployed in our country, and that is in the private sector.\n  If you chart corporate investment on the same graph as job creation, \nyou will see the two lines follow each other almost exactly. This is a \nchart prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis at the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics of the Federal Government. Over the last 50 years, \nbeginning in 1961 and going to 2011, it charts two things. The gray \nline is investment in real equipment and software spending, and the \npurple line is private employment numbers.\n  When I saw this, I thought it was a stunning chart and very \ncompelling, because you can see that corporate and private business \ninvestment is almost exactly along the same line. There is a little bit \nof a digression here because jobs fell more than investment, but \ninvestment was falling and jobs fell at the same time for 50 years.\n  I think the single most significant predictor of job growth in our \ncountry is business investment. So we have to ask ourselves, how could \nwe stimulate that kind of business investment today. Because that is \nwhat we need, we need these jobs. I regret to say I don't believe we \ncan do it with the mix that is in the American Jobs Act. It seems to me \nlike a kind of ministimulus. The stimulus of $800 billion that was \nadopted a few years ago, which I supported, I think made the economy \nbetter than it otherwise would have been, but it didn't give the \neconomy what the President said he hoped and we all hoped it would \ngive,\n\n[[Page S6364]]\n\nwhich was a jolt. This American Jobs Act, which is kind of a \nministimulus that will cost $\\1/2\\ trillion, is less likely, for \nobvious mathematical reasons, to give the economy the jolt. But it will \ncost $\\1/2\\ trillion we won't have and will have to find somewhere to \nraise.\n  To me, what we have got to do is restore confidence in people in the \nbusiness sector to invest. That is what is missing today in our \neconomy. They don't have confidence in our economic future. They don't \nhave confidence in our government--us. They don't have confidence that \nwe will work together to reduce our debt, to create some predictability \nfor them in the years ahead.\n  That is why I say the best thing we can do to restore the confidence \nof the business community necessary for them to begin investing again--\nthey have got the money; they are just not spending it because they are \nnervous about the future--is for us to come together, hopefully led by \nthe Joint Special Committee, in a bipartisan debt reduction program. It \nis not this American Jobs Act. I know it has been put forward with good \nintentions, but I don't think it does the job we need it to do for \nAmerica, and I know it will cost another $\\1/2\\ trillion we desperately \nneed to reduce our debt which will do the job we need it to do to \ncreate new jobs for our fellow Americans.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, first, let me say there is a great deal the \nSenator from Connecticut just said that we are in nearly full agreement \non. I find it ironic that we are probably going to cancel ourselves out \non these two votes later in the day, for essentially the same reasons \nthat the Senator just gave. I thank the Senator for his comments, and \nparticularly on this second piece of legislation which I have been \nstruggling with and in exactly the same way the Senator from \nConnecticut has.\n  I wish to begin my comments today by expressing my strong support for \nthe majority leader in terms of how he handled a very difficult \ndiscussion on Thursday night.\n  I think we can all agree that the Senate at times has become quite \ndysfunctional over the past couple of years. I was very interested to \nhear Senator Corker's comments. He and I arrived at the Senate at the \nsame time, and I empathize with a lot of the comments he was making, \nalthough I guess looking for accountability depends on which end of the \ntelescope you are looking through.\n  For me, looking at the situation we faced on Thursday night, we have \nto start with the reality that these were not serious amendments that \nwere being offered at the end of the debate of this piece of \nlegislation. They in many ways epitomize the paralysis of serious \ndebate here in this body and how it affects all of our ability to get \nserious things done. Only one of those nine proposals was germane, and \nthat was the proposal from my good friend Senator Hatch. They were not \nrelevant. This is what the majority leader is being faced with time and \nagain. We are talking about one amendment on the bill with respect to \nChina currency that wanted to talk about the regulation of nuisance \ndust. We had another one that wanted to talk about the use of \npesticides in navigable waters, and another one that wanted to talk \nabout EPA regulation on cement manufacturing. There may be a time and a \nplace for that kind of discussion; but if you look at the impact of \nthis type of--and I have to agree with the majority leader's \ncharacterization--this type of dilatory conduct, it prevents \nresponsible, germane legislation from moving forward.\n\n  I will give you one example from my own attempt to amend this bill, \nand that was the amendment I offered last week that would have \nprohibited American companies from transferring intellectual property \nand technologies that were developed with the assistance of the \nAmerican taxpayer to such countries as China that require technology \ntransfer as a matter of doing business there. That amendment is not \ngoing to get a vote. I believe that amendment is something that most \npeople in this body and most Americans would want to see passed. But \nbecause we have been in this state of paralysis, these types of issues \nhave been deflected off the screen, off the debate on the Senate floor, \nand now we are moving forward with a bill that doesn't have these sorts \nof issues in it. I am going to vote for this bill, by the way.\n  With respect to the jobs bill, I wish to make a couple of comments \nhere, first associating with some of the comments that Senator \nLieberman made. But also, there is an issue here with respect to \neconomic fairness and the disparity in this country between top and \nbottom that I don't think is being properly debated in the context of \nthis bill.\n  In the end, as Senator Lieberman pointed out, I strongly believe the \nway to bring good jobs back is to improve our economy in the private \nsector, and that means more capital investment.\n  Winston Churchill once said something to the effect that, You can't \ntax your way out of an economic downturn any more than you can pick up \na bucket if you are standing in it.\n  There is a lot of money out there. The Senator from Connecticut \nmentioned that. We can't control whether that money is going to be \ninvested, but we can work to incentivize conduct that might encourage \ninvestment. I think people on both sides need to set aside the partisan \ndebate that is going on looking into next year's election and work \ntoward that end.\n  At the same time, there are two difficulties I have with this \nlegislation. The first is the timing. Senator Lieberman was very \neloquent in his concerns about the timing of this bill, with the \nsupercommittee working on these issues in a larger context, getting \nready to report out within the next month or so. Senator Corker made a \nvery valid point that I hadn't thought about, and that is that we have \nworked--and I have been one of those who has worked--to bring these \nfree-trade agreements to fruition. We have a very short window with the \nPresident of South Korea arriving this week and hopefully having a \nfree-trade agreement passed by the time he makes his presentation to a \njoint session of the Congress.\n  But there is another issue, and that is the pay-for. We are talking \nabout this millionaire surcharge, this 5.6 percent that would be put on \ntop of these other tax increases for the ``millionaires.'' But in many \ncases, this isn't even a tax on the wealthiest Americans it is designed \nto reach.\n  Let me preface what I am going to point out here by saying I believe \nI have been one of the loudest and most consistent voices on the issue \nof economic fairness and executive compensation in this body. I raised \nit in every speech during my Senate campaign. I put it on the table \nnationally when I responded to President Bush's State of the Union \nAddress in 2007. I put the issue of the disparity in executive \ncompensation from when I graduated from college when a CEO was making \n20 times what the average worker makes, to today, when it is about 400 \ntimes. I introduced a windfall profits tax after it became clear that \nthe money we put into TARP was going to be used to unjustly reward \nexecutives from the companies that had been bailed out by our \ntaxpayers. This was a very narrowly focused bill that said, If your \ncompany got $5 billion or more, you could get your compensation, you \ncould get a $400,000 bonus, and anything after that you had to share \nwith the people who bailed you out because they were bailing out the \neconomy. I couldn't get a vote.\n  Let's be fair. I couldn't get a vote because neither side wanted a \nvote. People don't want to take a vote on something that is that \ndirectly related to how they finance their campaigns. That is the \nhonest truth. I didn't get a vote on it, but I think my record on this \nissue is absolutely clear.\n  One thing I have stated from the first moment I ran for office is \nthat I do not believe we should raise taxes on ordinary earned income. \nWhen this proposal was first put in front of the American people, there \nwas a part of it in the pay-for that was called the Warren Buffet rule. \nBut what I just said is the Warren Buffett rule--and it has been \nmisrepresented in this debate. Warren Buffett has the same position.\n  My understanding of his position, and I have read it very carefully, \nis that we should not tax ordinary earned income. In fact, he made a \nclarification about a week ago. This is Warren Buffett on the Warren \nBuffett rule:\n\n\n[[Page S6365]]\n\n\n       My program would be on the very high incomes that are taxed \n     very low. Not just high incomes. Somebody making $50 million \n     a year playing baseball, his taxes won't change. If they make \n     a lot of money and they pay a very low tax rate, like me, it \n     would be changed by a minimum tax.\n\n  How do we do that, and does it matter? It matters a whole lot because \nwe are not talking about this distinction when we are addressing issues \nof fairness in society, the true nature of what has happened at the \nvery top in this country.\n  The proposal of the President looks good at first glance; it sounds \ngood on a TV bite. But in all respect to the people who put it forward, \nI do not believe it is smart policy, and it does not go where the real \neconomic division lies in our country. This is what Warren Buffett is \ntalking about.\n  If we look at the top .1 percent of our taxpayers, the very top, two-\nthirds of the money they take in is from capital gains and dividends. \nOnly one-third is from wages.\n  What does that mean with respect to this surcharge we are going to \nput down? This is what the surcharge on earned income for millionaires \nwill do: It will bring the tax on ordinary earned income from 35 \npercent--first, under the assumption of 39 percent, which is the \nfailure to renew the Bush tax cuts--and then to 45.2 percent, someone \nmaking wages.\n  Who is in this category? Very few people. Let's say someone is an \nathlete, as Warren Buffett mentioned, and they have 3 or 4 years in \ntheir career where they can make the money. They are going to get their \nincome, because it is ordinary earned income, taxed at 45 percent of \neverything they make, just for the Federal taxation, at the same time \nthat capital gains tax, which is where two-thirds of the top .1 percent \nof our earners make their money, is going to stay at 15 percent. That \nis what Warren Buffett is talking about.\n  He is sitting here saying: I make my money off of stock sales, basic \ntransactions where I get capital gains, and I am at 15 percent. My \nsecretary is paying double what I am. The people who have ordinary \nearned income are going to pay three times the rate of what somebody is \nmaking on capital gains, and that is two-thirds of what the people at \nthe very top make.\n  If we went after capital gains--let's just say, notionally, let's say \nwe allow the Bush tax cuts to expire on capital gains but keep them on \nordinary earned income. This margin would be 35 percent of ordinary \nincome versus 20 percent. What would that do? According to the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, over 5 years they could recoup $402 billion. \nThat is almost as much as this other surcharge could make over 10 years \nin order to pay for this legislation.\n  Most important, we are going into issues of fairness that we have \nbeen trying to bring to the table; that is, to truly focus on those at \nthe very top who have benefitted the most from what has happened in \nwhat is frequently becoming a fractured economic society.\n  I am going to vote the exact opposite way the Senator from \nConnecticut is going to vote, but I think he and I share many of the \nsame concerns. It is just how we get there. If people are ready to \ndiscuss capital gains, moving it back up to what it was, from 15 to 20 \npercent--if we are willing to discuss capital gains, I will know we are \nserious. If we are not willing to discuss capital gains, I think we \nhave seen this movie before.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the state of \naffairs and where we are in the Senate, particularly with regard to the \nDefense authorization bill. Right now in the Senate--I am a freshman \nMember of this body--it has been over 2 years since we passed a budget. \nWe have only passed one appropriations bill. Last week, the Democrats \nchanged the rules in the Senate because they did not want to vote on \namendments.\n  For the first time in my lifetime, the Defense authorization bill is \nnot being brought to the floor by the majority leader. This is at a \ntime when we are engaged in two wars and the threats to us and our \nallies from the Islamist terrorists remain. In fact, today authorities \nbroke up an alleged plot to bomb the Israeli and Saudi Arabian \nEmbassies in Washington and to assassinate the Saudi Arabian Ambassador \nto the United States. At a time such as this, when there is nothing \nmore important we can do in the Senate than to ensure the national \nsecurity of the American people, the majority leader is refusing to \nbring forward the Defense authorization bill to this floor because he \nobjects to one provision in it addressing detainees.\n  I am concerned that this is no longer the most deliberative body in \nthe world. I am new here, and I am often asked what has surprised me \nmost as a new Senator, and I have to say, honestly, how few votes I \nhave taken since I have been in the Senate. In fact, the number of \nvotes I have taken in the Senate since I have been here is far below \nwhat we took last year and what we took the year before.\n  What could be more important than voting on the Defense authorization \nbill when our country faces issues such as these in terms of our \nnational security?\n  I would ask my distinguished colleague from Arizona, who is a senior \nMember of this body, whether he has seen the Senate like this. Is this \nhow the Senate is supposed to operate?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to respond to my colleague--by the way, I \nnoticed she said it would be the first time in her lifetime that we had \nnot passed a Defense authorization bill. It would not be the first time \nin my lifetime since it has been 41 years.\n  I would say to my friend and colleague, who has played a very \nimportant and essential role on many issues before the Armed Services \nCommittee, not only because of the military background of her family, \nincluding a husband who is a distinguished A-10 pilot, but also as a \nformer attorney general of her State, you are very familiar with many \nof the detainee issues.\n  I would like to say to my colleague that it was her amendments that \nwere passed in the committee concerning detainee treatment that became \npart of the legislation. I believe the legislation in that section was \npassed by a vote of 25 to 1 in the committee. It is not as if there \nwere sharp divisions between both sides of the aisle on the issue of \ndetainee treatment. Yet apparently that seems to be the objection of \nthe administration not only to the bill but even to taking up the bill \nfor consideration before the full Senate, as the Senator from New \nHampshire has pointed out, for the first time in 41 years.\n  I would like to explore with her for a second this whole issue of \ndetainee treatment. Just in the last week or so, we were able to kill \none of the leading al-Qaida operatives. I think that action was \nsupported by the majority of opinion in America, thanks to passage of \nlegislation after 9/11 including the fact that the President had a \nfinding that this individual was a terrorist. Yet somehow the \nPresident's counterterrorism expert seems to say that under our \nlegislation, we would never be able to turn the page on Guantanamo--and \nI quote from his speech at Harvard--and he went on to say:\n\n       Our counterterrorism professionals would be compelled to \n     hold all captured terrorists in military custody.\n\n  First of all, I would ask my colleague, isn't there a national \nsecurity waiver the President could exercise if he wanted to in the \nlegislation? Second of all, is it not true that you would have to be a \ndesignated member of al-Qaida before you would be required to be held \nin military custody?\n  So my question is, Is Mr. Brennan misinformed or simply contradicting \nwhat is actually the case in the legislation we passed by a unanimous \nvote through the Senate Armed Services Committee?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Senator McCain, first of all, is absolutely right. This \nwas an\n\n[[Page S6366]]\n\noverwhelmingly bipartisan vote in support of the detainee provisions, \naccording to Senator Reid, and that is why they are not being brought \nforward to the floor.\n  In my view, the President's counterterrorism adviser, Mr. Brennan, \nhas it wrong. I am not sure he has read this legislation based on the \nobjections he has raised because we are giving the President authority \nto detain, which is very important authority which he can exercise \nbased on the national security of this country.\n  In order to have military custody, you have to be a member of al-\nQaida or an affiliated force and planning an attack against us or our \ncoalition partners. That is where the military custody comes in place, \nand I think that is very important because, of course, if you are a \nmember of al-Qaida and you are planning an attack against the United \nStates of America or our coalition partners, it seems to me that is a \nvery appropriate instance for military custody given that we remain at \nwar with al-Qaida and that the threats from al-Qaida are still very \ngrave to our country, as demonstrated by----\n  Mr. McCAIN. So the statement Mr. Brennan made in his speech on \nSeptember 16 at Harvard Law School saying that our counterterrorism \nprofessionals would be compelled to hold all captured terrorists in \nmilitary custody is not correct?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I am really concerned that Mr. Brennan, again, has not \nread this legislation because that statement is not correct. As the \nSenator knows--he worked very hard on a compromise with the chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee, Chairman Levin, and Senator Graham, and \nin that compromise provision that we passed in a very strong, \noverwhelmingly bipartisan vote to have military custody, you have to be \na member of al-Qaida and planning an attack against us or our coalition \npartners. It is limited to a very narrow category of very dangerous \nindividuals. It isn't every single terrorist who is encountered.\n\n  The important issue is that when you read Mr. Brennan's speech, did \nyou see anywhere in his speech to Harvard where he talked about this \ntopic where he ever mentioned what is happening with those who have \nbeen released from Guantanamo?\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is interesting that he didn't because those who have \nbeen released, the latest number I have is about a 20-percent, \nroughly--and I don't know if the Senator from New Hampshire has \ndifferent information, but at least one out of every five has returned \nto the fight and some of them in leadership positions of al-Qaida, \nwhich is, obviously, unacceptable.\n  Mr. President, I ask for an additional 3 minutes for the Senator from \nNew Hampshire and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I just want to mention very quickly--because in some \nrespects, the Senator from New Hampshire comes from a military family--\nthat it is so important that we care for the men and women in the form \nof pay raises, in the form of housing, in the form of benefits, in the \nform of all of the things that are Congress's obligation to the men and \nwomen who are serving in the military. Now we are telling those men and \nwomen: Well, because of one provision in this legislation, which should \nbe resolved through debate and amendments and votes, we are not going \nto take up the bill that authorizes the men and women the things that \nare necessary and vital for the men and women fighting in two wars.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Senator McCain is absolutely right. It is outrageous that \none provision that was a bipartisan provision is holding up the \nauthorization from coming forward when it addresses things such as pay \nraises for our military. It addresses services for our wounded \nwarriors. It addresses military construction that is needed for our \nsoldiers. Those are very important issues. To hold this up at a time \nwhen we are at war, at a time when our soldiers need to know we are \nfully behind them, does a huge disservice to our country. This is an \nissue that, if there are problems with the detainee issues, should be \ndebated on the floor. The American people deserve to know.\n  Guantanamo Director Clapper testified before the Intelligence \nCommittee that the recidivism rate now is 27 percent for those \nreengaging in the battle, detainees whom we have released who are \nencountering our soldiers and our coalition partners, trying to harm \nAmericans. So to not bring forward the Defense authorization bill, A, \nto help our soldiers and, most importantly, to do what is right for \nthem, but also, B, to have a rigorous debate over this very important \nissue of protecting our soldiers from those detainees who have gone \nback and making sure we are protecting them and that we have a place to \nput those who are captured now, seems to me to be a disservice to this \nbody and to our country.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire, who has played a \nvery important role in the Armed Services Committee, particularly on \nthe issue of detainee treatment, which is important to the American \npeople. As she just mentioned, one out of four returns to the fight. It \nis a badge of courage and legitimacy and leadership now in al-Qaida for \nsomeone who has been released from Guantanamo.\n  I hope the majority leader and our colleagues would agree that we \ncould sit down and bring this bill to the floor, have votes, \namendments, and then let the men and women who are serving and those \nwho have served, including our wounded warriors, know we care enough to \npass legislation that is vital to their ability to defend this Nation \nand to make sure they are properly equipped and properly compensated.\n  I thank the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank very much the Senator from Arizona. No one has \nbeen more dedicated to our military through his own service and the \nservice of his family but also as a ranking member of the Armed \nServices Committee who has worked across the aisle to bring forward \nthis Defense authorization bill. I would share in his comments, and I \nhope the majority leader will bring this forward. It is so important \nfor our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/11/senate-section/article/S6366-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6366-S6368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GULF OILSPILL\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. As the Senator from Arizona is in the back of \nthe Chamber, I just want to say this Senator appreciates his long \npublic service and his dedication to this country.\n  Mr. President, as one of the Senators from a State that borders the \nGulf of Mexico, naturally we have been quite concerned in the followup \nto the Deepwater Horizon oilspill. You will remember that was an \noilspill that at first BP said: Oh, it was only 1,000 barrels a day. It \nwas not until Senator Boxer, the chairman of the environment committee, \nand I were able to wrangle the actual streaming video from 5,000 feet \nbelow the surface and put it up on my Web site that the scientists \ncould then calculate how much oil was coming out. It was not anywhere \nclose to 1,000 barrels a day. In fact, it ended up being 50,000 barrels \nof oil a day that was gushing into the Gulf of Mexico. As a result of \nthat total number of days, almost 5 million barrels of oil has gushed \ninto the gulf, we can expect some serious economic and environmental \nconsequences and particularly the consequences on the critters.\n\n  It is hard to go down to 5,000 feet and get data, because of the \npressure there, about what is happening to the critters. But we have an \nopportunity to find out what is happening by where all that oil seeped \nin toward shore, onto the beaches and into the estuaries. Of course, \nthe estuaries that were closest to the oil spill were the ones along \nthe coastline of Louisiana and a lot of those marshes.\n  What I have learned in public service is that when we are addressing \na problem, if it is a problem of this enormous consequence to not only \nthe livelihoods of people who live up and down the gulf, whether their \nlivelihoods be tourism, as so much of our State of Florida was \naffected, or whether it be the health of the actual critters themselves \nand, therefore, the livelihoods of a lot of people because of the \nshrimping and the fishing industry, which is major, coming from the \ngulf--what I have learned over my years in public service is what we \nhave to do is dig down and start relying on science to inform us as to \nwhat is at the root of\n\n[[Page S6367]]\n\nthe problem and how we go about solving the problem. I can tell my \ncolleagues that even though they shut off the oil gushing in, the spill \nis not over yet. So we are going to have to do the kind of informed \nplanning as to what we are going to do to address this environmental \ndisaster, and science is the key to developing a plan.\n  We got a pretty good indication from former Gov. Ray Mabus, who is \nnow our Secretary of the Navy and whom the President had tapped to head \nthe task force on what is the best way to address the damage. Based on \nGovernor Mabus's recommendations, the President then issued an \nExecutive order, and it established an ecosystem restoration task force \ncomprised of the relevant Federal agencies and each Gulf Coast State.\n  In the meantime, what we have done is worked with our colleagues in \ntrying to figure out how to fund this important work. For this work, \nfor this Senator, science is one of the key components. I can tell my \ncolleagues from my experience in doing Everglades restoration in the \nState of Florida, if we don't have the science first to determine what \nto do, then we don't know how to do it; we waste a lot of money and a \nlot of time in the process. The science will help us make sure we \naccomplish what we are planning to do. Then our efforts are going to \npay off. In other words, when a patient is sick, the doctor is first \ngoing to determine what is wrong and then will figure out the treatment \noptions and then will monitor the patient's progress. Similarly, in \nthis case, to get the best outcome for restoring the gulf, we must use \nthe same scientific framework.\n  Why am I harping on this? Nine gulf coast Senators--minus only one \ngulf coast Senator--and all five State Senators signed up as cosponsors \nof this legislation headed by Mary Landrieu. When we filed this RESTORE \nAct, to take care of the money--in fact, most of the money is from the \nfine the Department of the Interior is going to level under the already \nexisting law of the Oil Pollution Act--whatever that fine turns out to \nbe, we have filed legislation to direct that money that comes from the \nfine. Naturally, some of it is for environmental restoration. Some of \nit is for economic restoration. Some of it is for planning for the \nfuture. A lot of it we hope will be going into the determination of \nscience. Even though some economic development will come out of this \nlegislation that passed unanimously out of the environment committee \njust a few weeks ago--even though economic development is going to be \npart of it--we have to know if we, in fact, are achieving our goal. The \nscience is the key to that.\n  So just this week I met with two scientist professors at Louisiana \nState University. I will not say what the outcome was of what happened \nin the football stadium that afternoon when the University of Florida \nmet with Louisiana State University, but that morning I met with these \ntwo LSU professors who received a RAPID grant from the National Science \nFoundation. In their research on what are called killifish, Dr. \nWhitehead and Dr. Galvez found that even in areas where the visible oil \nhas disappeared, these little fish--about that large--and their embryos \nsustained long-term genetic damage.\n  Let me show my colleagues what I am talking about. The killifish is a \nsmall egg-laying fish found in the Gulf of Mexico. They spawn from \nMarch to October in shallow water in the marsh grass beds. Killifish, \nwhich when adult are about that long, are a popular bait fish and they \neat a lot of mosquito larvae, so they become part of Mother Nature's \nnatural pest control. So in April of 2010, when the Deepwater Horizon \nbegan to gush the oil, it was in the midst of killifish spawning \nseason. When the oil continued to flow all summer, inching ever closer \nto the marshes, the killifish were exposed to it. Here is the proof.\n  The LSU researchers set minnow traps near the oiled areas off \nLouisiana in an area close to a barrier island between Barataria Bay \nand the Gulf of Mexico. This is what that particular marshy area looked \nlike. We can see all the oil on the surface in this photograph. The \nproblem is not the oil on the surface. When it gets into the marshes \nand gets into the grasses, this oil will eventually sink all the way \nthrough the water column and then it gets mixed up in the sediment. \nThese small fish that are part of the natural chain of fisheries out in \nthe gulf will root around down in that sediment.\n  I wish to show my colleagues now the gill tissue of healthy \nkillifish. This is the tissue taken from the gills that were not \nexposed to the oiled marsh. The LSU professors had set these traps in \nsix different locations, from Louisiana all the way to Alabama, where \nthe oil had come in. It went, of course, as far as on into Florida, but \nthey set these six locations. They found the area outside this area \nnear Barataria Bay was where there was very little exposure. So this is \na cross-section of some of the gills of killifish. Remember, for a \nfish, its gill is like our lungs. It oxygenates the blood and it \nremoves the carbon dioxide. It is like us breathing, except it is a \nfish that is breathing. This gill tissue looks as though it has the \nmain trunk and the branches coming off and they are evenly spaced. This \nwas outside the area where we found a lot of the oil down in the \nsediment, as in the previous picture of where that marsh was off \nLouisiana. What this healthy tissue does is it provides a lot of \nsurface area for oxygen to enter into the fish's bloodstream.\n  Let me show my colleagues the slide that shows the gill tissue of a \nkillifish from the marsh where all the oil was. The reddish brown we \nsee is the staining used by the researchers. There is a protein that \nwill react to the uptake of oil and show where there has been exposure. \nThat is the reddish brown we see on these branches coming off the \ntrunks. We can see just how dark it has stained.\n  Look at something else on this exposed tissue of the fish's gill. \nLook how disorganized and warped these branches now look. Compare that \nto the symmetrical shape of what we saw on the healthy fish. This, of \ncourse, is going to interfere with oxygen and carbon dioxide and the \nion transfer in the bloodstream of these fish, and it is going to make \nit harder for the fish to breathe.\n  So in an area that is as economically and ecologically important as \nthe gulf, this information is crucial to determining the extent of the \nharm. The gulf provides almost one-third of the Nation's gross domestic \nproduct--about one-third of the seafood--one-third of the Nation's \nseafood is coming from areas that are being exposed.\n  I asked the professors: Does that mean we can't eat the fish? They \nsaid there is no evidence it is harmful to eat the fish. But what it is \nshowing is that when their ability to breathe starts being incumbered, \nit means these fish are not going to live or they are going to be \nsignificantly reduced in size or the population is going to be \nsignificantly reduced. If that is happening to this little fish called \nthe killifish, can we imagine what is happening to the whole food \nchain?\n  I talked to one of the owners of one of the major New Orleans \nrestaurants. I said: Tell me about your fishing. Tell me about your \nshrimpers. He said that some of the shrimpers off Louisiana are having \nto go 200 miles away in order to get their catch of shrimp. Naturally, \nthat is having an economic effect because they are having to spend all \nthat much extra time and money and fuel to get their catch of shrimp.\n  In a region that is so economically and ecologically important as the \ngulf, as a producer of one-third of all this Nation's seafood, you can \nsee we potentially have a problem. Historically, we do not know much \nabout the gulf. It is, on the average, a mile and a half deep. Where \nthe Deepwater Horizon spilled, it is a mile deep. As the oil hit, we \nbegan to realize we did not have good baseline data about the resources \nthat are in jeopardy. So moving forward, science is going to have to be \na priority. We have to know the extent of the impacts so the American \npeople do not pay for BP or Transocean's actions. Why should the \nAmerican taxpayer pay for this? We have to find out how best to restore \nthe gulf so it can continue to be the source of the environmental and \neconomic wealth it has historically been to this country.\n  There are a number of us here who are going to continue to press for \nbaseline data collection, long-term monitoring, and innovative research \nto inform gulf coast restoration. I hope our colleagues are going to \njoin us in the first step toward that, which is the passage of the \nRESTORE Act, which has\n\n[[Page S6368]]\n\ncome out of the Environment Committee, which is bipartisan, supported \nby almost all the Senators from the gulf, and for which we need to \nallocate defined money so it will go to good uses instead of, under \ncurrent law, being poured into the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund.\n  We are going to have the opportunity in the coming weeks to pass it \nin the Senate, send it to the House, and see if we can get our \ncolleagues there to make a strong and bold step for letting science \ninform us as we try to restore the health of the gulf.\n  It is somewhat providential that my colleague from Alabama has come \nto the floor, probably to speak on another subject. But I would point \nout to the Senate he is a cosponsor of the RESTORE Act to try to \nrestore the health of the Gulf of Mexico and to understand the changes \nI have just talked about, some of the initial research that has come \nfrom--sourced by, funded by--the National Science Foundation. I thank \nthe Senator from Alabama for his cosponsorship, along with our other \ncolleagues from the gulf coast.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nAlabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Florida and \nappreciate his work on this issue. We have had a bipartisan effort. I \nwas pleased Chairman Boxer, at the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, of which I am a member, joined with us in moving the \nlegislation forward. I think it is time for us to do that now while we \nhave an opportunity to make a decision that is fair to all parties. I \nbelieve this legislation is a thoughtful way to do it that would make \nthe gulf a more healthy place. I thank the Senator for his leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/11/senate-section/article/S6368-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6368-S6369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CHINA CURRENCY LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am here to share a few thoughts as we \nmove to the final vote on the China currency legislation that I believe \nwe must pass. I find it difficult, almost impossible, to believe there \nis a universal acceptance of the fact that the manipulation of currency \nby the Chinese Government--their efforts to keep their currency low, \ntied directly to the U.S. currency, regardless of the economic forces \nin the world that would argue for and set a different relationship \nbetween those currencies--the net result of that has been to damage the \nAmerican economy, and I do not think anybody disputes it.\n  In fact, some of my colleagues in this body who have opposed the \nlegislation out of fear of a trade war or something else have all \nacknowledged that the currency factors set by China are not good. They \nall acknowledge it adversely impacts the economy of the United States \nand costs American jobs. It is not right. It is just not right, and we \nare losing jobs dramatically.\n  The Federal Reserve Chairman--I would ask us to ask ourselves: Is Mr. \nBernanke, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, a protectionist? Is he \nsomebody who does not believe in trade? Is he somebody who is trying to \nstop trade? I do not think so. This is what he said last week on the \nquestion of jobs in his testimony before the House:\n\n       Right now, our concern is that the Chinese currency policy \n     is blocking what might be a more normal recovery . . . in the \n     global economy.\n\n  Blocking a normal recovery from a recession. He goes on to say:\n\n       It is to some extent hurting the recovery.\n\n  That is the Federal Reserve Chairman. So I do not understand the \nthought that somehow--when we say we have an obligation to our \nconstituents to defend their legitimate interests on the world's stage \nin a global economy, to make sure the global economy, where trade is so \nvaluable to us, is conducted in a fair way--it is not a fair system and \nit has been going on for over a decade. Our leaders--former Presidents, \nPresident Obama--all of them, when the chips are down, do not do \nanything significant to confront this problem. They just allow it to \ncontinue, and we are hemorrhaging jobs. Maybe more than a million jobs \nhave been lost as to this one currency manipulation alone. I think it \nis unhealthy for the country.\n  I am worried about the middle class in America. I do not believe you \ncan have a middle class in America without a vibrant manufacturing \nbase. Many of those supporting free trade say we are going to become a \nservice economy. But I do not see people working in the service \nindustries making the kind of $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 a year salaries \nthat people do in major manufacturing companies. They just do not. \nThere are various benefits from some of those jobs, and some of the \npeople enjoy it, and it fits their skill level and what they want to \ndo, and it is fine to say that. But to acknowledge we no longer are \ngoing to be a manufacturing nation does not make sense to me.\n  I believe we have no choice but to develop a sustained, effective \npolicy to raise this question in a way that it cannot be avoided, and \nto confront our trading partners--China--with this manipulation and to \nsay we wish to have a great, positive relationship here, we are not \nafraid to trade, we are not trying to hamper your economy, we think the \nworld would be better if China's economy is healthy and growing, but \nnot at our expense, not in a way that unfairly places American \nmanufacturing at a disadvantage.\n  When your currency is 25 to 30 percent under value, it means that \nwhen we export a product, the product costs 30 percent more in China \nthan it would otherwise have cost if the currency were right. China is \nnot going to buy it if it costs 30 percent more. If you import a \nproduct from China--manufactured in China--to the United States, not \nonly do they have an advantage of lower wages, but they have a 30-\npercent, a 25-percent currency advantage. We are just going to say: \n``Oh, this is just the way of the world. There is nothing we can do \nabout it. We believe in free trade''?\n\n  Well, as I have said, I believe in trade. I believe in good trade. My \nrecord I think will indicate that. But I have told my constituents--and \nI think most of us in the Senate and in the House talking to our \nconstituents--we say we believe in trade, but we believe in fair trade. \nWe believe in defending our workers from unfair competition. We will \nstand up and take our lumps and we will take our gains in a fair \ncompetition. But we do not sit by and let our workers lose their jobs, \nhave our plants close as a result of an unwillingness on behalf of the \ngovernment in Washington to defend their interests. How much common \nsense is that?\n  Mr. Bernanke, the Wall Street Journal, all the others--the Club for \nGrowth--they all acknowledge this is an unfair trade practice. They all \nacknowledge it hurts us. But they say we cannot do anything about it. \nWell, we will keep on talking. We will let the administration keep \ntalking and maybe they can work this thing out. But it has been going \non for years and it has not been worked out, for reasons I am not able \nto understand.\n  A major American manufacturer can decide that: Well, China has lower \nwages and now they have a 30-percent advantage in currency, why, we \ncould close our plant here in New Mexico or we could close our plant in \nAlabama or Ohio and we will move it to China, and we will make that \nproduct over there, and we can import it with a 30-percent currency \nadvantage on top of labor, and we will make more money that way.\n  I think that is how decisions are being made in this country right \nnow. They are being made in that fashion. If you are a stockholder in \none of those companies, you would say: That makes common sense to me. \nBut I am not here as a stockholder in a company. I am here as a U.S. \nSenator, representing 4 million Alabama constituents, really \nrepresenting the interests of the United States of America, and I do \nnot think it is good for America. It might be good for this company or \nthat company, but it is not good for America. I do not think--in fact, \nI am confident it is not. It has to end, and we need to defend \naggressively on the world stage the legitimate interests of American \nmanufacturing and American workers. We have not done that. It has \ncaused a lot of frustration out there and it has caused a lot of job \nloss, in my opinion.\n  Well, they say, if you stand up here and you tell the Chinese, look, \nyou have had 9 percent growth last year and are looking for another 9 \npercent growth this year--you are the No. 2 economy now in the whole \nworld--if we tell them a lot of this has been the result of taking \nadvantage of U.S. trade policy, and they have to stop, this will \nsomehow make them mad and this will\n\n[[Page S6369]]\n\nmake them angry and they will commence a trade war against us. That is \nwhat the argument basically is.\n  And they say: Oh, you remember during the Depression the Smoot-Hawley \nTariff Act. That created a tariff war around the world and helped \nprolong the Depression. And it did. Well, let me tell you, this is not \nthe Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. It is not. First of all, the United States \nwas a major exporting juggernaut in the 1930s, and we placed tariffs on \ngoods coming into our country to try to give an advantage to our folks, \nand others retaliated, and we, as an exporting nation, ended up losing \nmore than they did. It was stupid policy and it redounded to our \ndisadvantage.\n  It was a worldwide tariff we placed on all products. Hopefully, there \nwill not be any tariffs imposed under this legislation. Hopefully, as \nthe process goes forward our Chinese trading partners will begin to \nretreat from their indefensible position, and it will not happen. But, \nagain, it is only targeted where we have major currency manipulation.\n  It is not a worldwide tariff, No. 1; and, No. 2, as Mr. Gordon Chang, \nwriting in Forbes magazine, noted, indisputably: China is the exporting \njuggernaut in today's world. We are the world's biggest importer.\n  I don't guess there has ever been in the history of the world a \nlarger trade imbalance than between the United States and China. We \nimport, they export. So as he noted, in a trade tariff situation, which \nis bad for everybody, I acknowledge the nation that is hurt the worst \nis the exporting nation. That would be China.\n  So why would China, despite their bluster, why would they create a \nreal trade war with the United States? One-third of their exports or \nmore go to the United States. This is a huge part of their growing \neconomy, and I am happy that China is making financial progress. I \nsincerely hope they will be able to continue to do so, but it cannot be \ndone at our expense.\n  So I would say the Smoot-Hawley argument is not a good one. Neither \nis the fact that China would execute a trade war with the United \nStates. It just makes no sense for them to do so. They would be cutting \noff their noses to spite their faces.\n  One thing that is good in a manufacturing economy is that we sell \nproducts and we bring home wealth. If we can manufacture and we can \nexport that product, we can bring home wealth, and that wealth can be \nused to purchase other foreign products and bring those into the \ncountry. It is the kind of thing that can, if properly conducted, \nbenefit the entire world.\n  I tease my free-trade colleagues--those for whom free trade is a \nreligion--that they believe that trade, once it breaks out in the \nworld, peace will abound and cancer will be cured. That is all we have \nto do is eliminate all trade barriers. But the trade barriers are not \nbeing eliminated. That is the problem.\n  One of the biggest trade barriers we have is the currency \nmanipulation by China. It is by far--they do a lot of things. They \nsteal our manufacturing copyrights and secrets and techniques in \nviolation of international law. They subsidize domestic manufacturing \nin many different ways. If we want to do business in China, we have to \npartner with a Chinese company and give them half the company. They \nblock the sale of rare earth minerals around the world. They do all \nkinds of things that are not the kinds of things good trading partners \nought to be doing, not to mention their foreign policy which buddies up \nwith North Korea, Iran and other rogue nations.\n  China needs to be participating positively in the world community, \nnot trying to take advantage of other countries, making bucks off them, \nand trying to do things that seem, at times, for no other purpose than \nto frustrate the legitimate interests of the United States and the \nworld community.\n  So China has some problems. It is time for them to get straight. I \nurge them to do so. They cannot continue currency manipulation. That is \ndestroying jobs in the United States, and we will not have it. When we \nhave this vote that will be coming up before long, I think it will be \nmore than just a normal vote around here. I believe it will be a vote \nthat says to the whole world: The United States is waking up. We are \nfree traders, all right, but not any trade agreement is going to be \ngood in the future. If you are not complying with your promises under \ntrade agreements, we are going to hold you accountable. We will do what \nit takes to hold you to the agreement, and we will not trade with you \nif you manipulate the trade rules. We insist that the world economy \noperate on a fair and lawful basis, that is healthy for us.\n  If we do this right, we can do it in a way that is not protectionist, \nnot antitrade, but creates the foundations for even more and healthier, \nbetter trade for the whole world. That is my vision of where we are \ntoday. I think we should move forward and pass this legislation. I urge \nmy colleagues in the House to do likewise. In the long run we will \nbenefit.\n  I thank my Republican colleague, Senator Graham, and others on this \nside who voted for it, and Senator Schumer and Senator Brown and \nSenator Stabenow and others on the Democratic side who have been \nleaders in this effort. I believe it is time for the President to get \nthe message. I think it is time for Wall Street to get the message. I \nthink it is time for the American people to get focused that there are \nsome decisions being made now--without protectionism, without nativism, \nbut legitimate public interests that will create jobs in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/11/senate-section/article/S6369-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6369-S6370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AMERICAN JOBS ACT\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nAmerican Jobs Act. Rarely is our economy discussed these days without \nmention of the 14 million Americans who are currently out of work and \nsearching for a job. But as you know, I am from your home State. This \nis not just a statistic. It is real people--people who are struggling, \npeople who have had their hours cut, people who may have worked at a \njob for a very long time and, poof, it is gone away. That is what this \nis about.\n  Two years after the recession officially ended, unemployment is still \nstubbornly high, at 9.1 percent--9.1 percent. When we factor in those \nwho are working part time because they cannot find a full-time job, \nthat number goes much higher, up toward 16 percent.\n  Now, my home State, the State of Minnesota, is much better. We have \nan unemployment rate of 7.2 percent. But there are still too many \npeople out of work or who are struggling with reduced hours at their \njobs. While no group of workers has been spared by the high rates of \nlong-term unemployment, the hardest hit have been older workers, those \nwith a high school diploma, and then those I am sure you have seen in \nthe construction trades. They have been hit very hard.\n  We also have had issues with our timber industry in northern \nMinnesota. We have had some trouble in our iron ore mines, but they are \nbouncing back. The biggest problem I have heard of is for those in the \nconstruction industry.\n  It is my firm belief that the role of Congress is to promote the \ninterests of the American people, and the American people have said \nloudly and clearly that we need to focus on initiatives that stimulate \njob creation--in particular, private sector job creation. In fact, the \nmajority of Americans want us to pass the American Jobs Act that we are \ndebating today.\n  When Americans are asked about specific provisions in the bill, that \nmessage is even clearer: 74 percent say they support providing money to \nState governments to allow them to hire teachers and first responders; \n65 percent say they support cutting the payroll tax for all American \nworkers; 64 percent say they support increased spending to build and \nrepair roads, bridges, and schools.\n  Of course, no one knows that better than me and my State. I live just \na few blocks from that bridge that collapsed in the middle of a summer \nday. I said that day: A bridge should not just fall down in the middle \nof America. But that is what happened. So, obviously, people in my \nState understood the need to continue funding bridges and roads.\n  Fifty-eight percent of Americans say they support cutting the payroll \ntaxes\n\n[[Page S6370]]\n\nfor all American businesses. But passing this bill is not the right \nthing to do just because it is popular. It is the right thing to do \nbecause it will have a positive impact on our economy.\n  Economists from across the political spectrum agree that steps taken \nin this legislation would increase economic activity and add jobs. \nAccording to Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's:\n\n       The plan would add 2 percent points to GDP growth next \n     year, add 1.9 million jobs, and cut the unemployment rate \n     by a percentage point.\n\n  That is an economist's words, not mine. It would accomplish this by \ninitiating targeted measures, many of which have garnered overwhelming \nbipartisan support in the past. The employee payroll tax cut that would \nbe extended under the American Jobs Act was originally introduced by my \nfriends, Senator Schumer and Senator Hatch. It was ultimately included \nin the HIRE Act, which ultimately passed the Senate by a 68-to-29 vote \nearly in 2010. Just over a year ago it was extended again. This time, \n139 House Democrats and 138 House Republicans joined to support it. In \nthe Senate, 37 Republican Senators joined 43 Democratic Senators in \nvoting for the extension.\n  Cutting the payroll tax for all American businesses is another idea \nthat has gained strong bipartisan support. In fact, it has been the \ncenterpiece of several jobs packages put forward by my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle.\n  We all know the neglected state of our Nation's infrastructure. \nCrumbling infrastructure just does not threaten public safety, as it \ndid in Minnesota when that bridge collapsed, it also weakens our \neconomy. Congestion and inefficiencies in our transportation network \nlimit our ability to get goods to market.\n  We all know one of the main ways we are going to get out of this \ndownturn is with exports. Well, to truly have the kind of exports we \nwant to see in this country, we have to be able to get our products on \na truck or get them on a train and get them to a port and get them \nacross the sea or get them on an airplane. The only way we are going to \ndo that is if we have a transportation system that matches the economic \nsystem we want to have.\n  The congestion, the inefficiencies in transportation exacerbate the \ndivide between urban and rural America. They constrain economic \ndevelopment and competitiveness. They reduce productivity as workers \nidle in traffic.\n  Americans spend a collective 4.2 billion hours a year stuck in \ntraffic--4.2 billion hours a year stuck in traffic--at a cost to the \neconomy of $78.2 billion or $710 per motorist. Think about that, over \n$700 per motorist simply because of people waiting in line on our \nhighways.\n  What better way to get our struggling economy back on track than to \nbuild the 21st-century transportation network our economy demands, \nwhile creating jobs in the construction industry, which, as I \nmentioned, has been one of the hardest hit industries. The American \nJobs Act would establish the infrastructure bank as a new financing \nauthority to help address some of our Nation's most important \ntransportation projects. Roads, freight rail, and water projects in my \nState of Minnesota and across the Nation would benefit from access to \nloans and loan guarantees from this public-private partnership.\n  This approach has bipartisan support in the Senate, as do the other \nproposals I discussed. In March of this year, U.S. Chamber of Commerce \nPresident Tom Donohue endorsed the idea saying this:\n\n       A national infrastructure bank is a great place to start \n     securing the funding we need to increase our mobility, create \n     jobs and enhance our global competitiveness.\n\n  So pieces of this bill have been supported by the chamber; pieces of \nthis bill have been supported by my Republican colleagues. In fact, the \nmajor provisions of this bill have been supported on a bipartisan \nbasis. There are other great ideas in this bill as well, such as an \nextension of the bonus depreciation, which would allow businesses to \ncontinue to immediately write off the cost of investments in new \nproperty and equipment.\n  I have to say this was the one thing--when I met with our small \nbusinesses over the last few years, this was the one thing they kept \nmentioning, that this was very helpful for them and would create an \nincentive for them to invest in equipment.\n  This bill includes a returning heroes tax credit for veterans, which \nwould provide a tax credit up to $9,600 to encourage companies to hire \nunemployed veterans. At a time when the percentage of unemployed \nveterans of Iraq stands at 11.7 percent, the importance of a provision \nsuch as this is clear. There is no reason that those people who have \nserved our country should have to come back to the United States and \nnot have a job. When they signed up to serve our country, there wasn't \na waiting line. When they come back to America and they need a job or \nthey need college or they need health care, there should not be a \nwaiting line. I am glad this provision is included in the bill to \ncreate an incentive to hire returning veterans. The post-9/11 time \nperiod is most important when you look at the unemployment rate.\n  With our economy struggling and 14 million Americans still out of \nwork, Minnesotans want Congress to put the politics aside and come \ntogether to move our economy forward. It is time to step forward and \nshow some leadership, and it is time for us to work together to show \nthe American people that Washington isn't broken--that, instead, we are \nwilling to put aside politics to do what we were elected to do, to do \nwhat is right for America.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this important piece of legislation \nthat would put Americans to work and help our struggling economy get \nback on track.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, we are in morning business, right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/11/senate-section/article/S6370-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6370-S6371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CHINA'S CURRENCY POLICY\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, in an hour or so, the Senate will \nbe voting on our currency bill, S. 1619, the bipartisan bill I am a \nprime sponsor on, along with Senators Schumer, Graham, and Sessions, \nand a host of other Senators in both parties, including Senators \nStabenow, Snowe, Collins, and Hagan.\n  I thank my colleagues for the vote last week of well in excess of 60 \nbipartisan votes, allowing us to consider this measure. I am struck by \nsome of my colleagues who dismiss this bill as a ``message'' bill. \nThere are opponents of the bill, and there are always people who don't \nwant to stand up to China. I think they are undercutting our ability to \nstop the hemorrhaging of our manufacturing jobs. That is their decision \nto make. Again, I am struck by how some of my colleagues dismiss this \nas a message bill. I don't know what a message bill means to anybody \noutside of Washington. I know this bill is a jobs bill. I was talking \nto an anchor on MSNBC, who said we lost almost 3 million jobs to China \nin the last decade, most of them manufacturing jobs. This is \nlegislation that will stand up to the Chinese and say: You are not \ngoing to game the currency system or export from China into our market \nand have a 25-, 30-, 35-percent subsidy, and you are not going to put \nup a tariff using currency as that tariff, by and large, in effect, to \nadd 25, 30, 35 percent to the cost of an American good sold into China.\n  This legislation is all about jobs in industries that have been \nholding on for their life, such as paper, steel, tires, and aluminum. \nBut it is not just paper, steel, and tires; it is no longer a trade \ndeficit in T-shirts and bicycles. This trade deficit, which has more \nthan tripled in the last decade, is now almost $800 million a day. That \nmeans every day companies buy $800 million more in Santa Fe and in \nDayton than we sell to China. We buy $800 million more than we sell. We \ncannot keep doing that.\n  This trade deficit has risen through the economic food chain all the \nway to advanced technology products. It is not just tires and steel, as \nimportant as they are to many workers in this country; it is also jobs \nin solar, wind, and clean energy components manufacturing, and in the \nauto supply chain. Those are millions of jobs in our country. What this \nlegislation means in so many ways is that we can be competitive on all \nfronts with China, Germany, and Japan. We can compete on productivity. \nWe have skilled workers and\n\n[[Page S6371]]\n\nworld class infrastructure. But how do you compete against a 25-, 30-\npercent subsidy? How can workers in Findlay who make tires or in \nChillicothe who make paper or in Defiance who make engines compete with \n$1 billion in subsidies? As a leader in this effort, Senator Merkley \nnoted currency manipulation is a 20- to 30-percent tax on our exports. \nIf a company in Albuquerque or Atlanta or Ashtabula makes a product and \nsends it to China, it costs 25, 30 percent more because they put a \ncurrency tariff on that product.\n  I find it hard to believe that some of my colleagues--about 30 of \nthem--would want to continue this tax on our exporters. It is, pure and \nsimple, a tariff and a tax on our exporters trying to sell products \ninto the Chinese market.\n  Senator Feinstein spoke about the compelling image she saw from her \nSan Francisco home. Looking out at the San Francisco Bay, she counted \nthe cargo ships departing for Asia, half filled with mostly scrap paper \nand other scrap, while the incoming ships are filled with goods. That \ntells you that we buy $800 million a day more from China than we sell \nto China. It is not because our workers are not productive or that our \ncompanies are not efficient or because our scientists and researchers \naren't the most innovative in the world; it is because China has a 25-, \n30-, 35-percent tax on our products and a subsidy on their products. \nThat is pure and simple.\n  For a State such as mine, trying to get a foothold on clean energy \ntechnology research and production, the race against China will only \naccelerate in the coming years. That is why it is imperative that we \nnot sit idly by while China subsidizes its exports through its currency \nregime. This is no message bill. This is level-the-playing-field \nlegislation.\n  Let me speak about some other charges that have been made. Some of my \ncolleagues note that China's currency has increased about 30 percent in \nrecent years. No doubt the RMB has appreciated about 30 percent. Since \nthe Senate acted in 2005, the Chinese currency, the RMB, has \nappreciated about 30 percent. But as the Peterson Institute for \nInternational Economics has shown--which is not an anti-free trade, \npro-fair trade, liberal, progressive, socialist organization; it is a \nmiddle-of-the-road, mostly free trade organization, staffed by sort of \nelite economists in the Northeast--Even the Peterson Institute for \nInternational Economics has shown that the RMB is more undervalued than \na year ago because of China's rapid growth in the past few years, as \nwell as inflation and productivity. The Peterson Institute estimates \nthat China's currency manipulation increased from 24.2 percent in 2010 \nto 28.5 percent in 2011, despite the fact that China's real exchange \nrate appreciated over the past year. That means it is getting worse. If \nwe want to call it a message bill, it may work with some in this \ninstitution but not with the American public. This is getting worse and \nworse for our manufacturers. I will tell you about one, the Bennett \nbrothers in Brunswick, Ohio, who came to me. I was talking to them in \nnortheast Ohio a couple weeks ago. They run a family company that has \nbeen around for about 35 years in northeast Ohio. This company is \ncalled Automation Tool and Dye. They were about to have a million \ndollar sale to an American company looking for their product and, at \nthe last minute, the Chinese came in and undercut them by 20 percent. \nWhy? Because they got a 25-percent, 30-percent subsidy bonus because of \ntheir currency.\n  The point is that China is massively and increasingly intervening in \nits currency. The International Monetary Fund knows it. The IMF has \nestimated that China's global current account surplus--the broadest \nmeasure of its trade balance--will more than double from $305 billion \nin 2010 to $852 billion in 2016. The problem is getting worse.\n  If one thing is clear since the Senate voted in 2005 to slap tariffs \non Chinese goods, it is this: The RMB is pegged to American political \npressure. If we can predict anything, we know that if we take the \npressure off, China will get worse. If we can predict another thing, we \nknow that if this passes and begins to work its way through the House \nto the President's desk, the Chinese will respond by significantly \nappreciating their currency.\n\n  Some of my colleagues wring their hands, saying we might set off a \ntrade war, and that this is the second coming of Smoot-Hawley. The \nfacts are clear that this is very different. When Smoot-Hawley was \nenacted by Congress, in those days the United States had a trade \nsurplus. So countries around the world were angered that while we had a \ntrade surplus we were enacting Smoot-Hawley, more tariffs. Today, we \nhave one of the largest trade deficits in world history, so we are in a \nvery different position.\n  As Senator Sessions said, when he heard this criticism that we might \nset off a trade war, we have been in a trade war for a long time. The \nChinese seem to be doing very well. They have declared a trade war. \nThat is why they subsidize water, paper, steel, capital, and land. This \nfeatures spies, features theft of intellectual property, and that 30-\npercent stealth subsidy that gets applied to every export China sends \nto the United States. So we are already in a trade war. The only \ndifference is that today on the floor of the Senate we have taken a big \nstep toward abandoning the failed tactics of unilateral disarmament.\n  Workers in my State know that we have been waving the white flag in \nthis trade war. I remind my friends that the United States has more \nleverage than any of China's trading partners, as China is overly \ndependent on access to our market to maintain its own exports and jobs.\n  This isn't Smoot-Hawley, as some want you to believe. This \nlegislation does not mandate sanctions against China or any other \nnation. It does not slap an across-the-board tariff on Chinese imports \ntomorrow as China has effectively done to ours. In fact, if this bill \nbecomes law, the duties would apply to less than 3 percent of Chinese \nimports.\n  When you think about this, of all Chinese exports, about one-third \ncome to the United States. If Senator Durbin is in business in Chicago, \nand he has a company--or he has a customer in his company who buys one-\nthird of all of their goods, he is going to be good to that customer. \nHe will not declare war on them. The Chinese won't declare economic \ntrade war on us, because we buy so many of their exports.\n  I will close with this. If China is found to be manipulating its \ncurrency, this bill sets in motion a series of steps to place pressure \non the Chinese Government to stop rigging the exchange rate in its \nfavor. It is simple.\n  According to a recent New York Times op-ed by C. Fred Bergsten of the \nPeterson Institute:\n\n       To be sure, some American corporations will fret that these \n     actions would needlessly antagonize the Chinese and threaten \n     a trade war. . . . I believe these fears are overblown. The \n     real threat to the world trading system is protectionist \n     policies, including undervalued currencies, of other \n     countries, and the vast trade imbalances that result.\n\n  As Presidential contender Mitt Romney put it, taking action to remove \nprotectionist market distortions would not result in a ``trade war,'' \nbut failing to act will mean the United States has accepted ``trade \nsurrender.''\n  We can vote yes today and it will mean we will stand up to the \nChinese and, more importantly, it will be a victory for American \nworkers, and especially American small manufacturers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to talk briefly about the breaking \nnews today that the Justice Department and Attorney General Eric Holder \nannounced that a plan was conceived, sponsored, and directed from Iran \nto conduct bombings in Washington, DC, and potentially also in Buenos \nAires, Argentina. This is from a government that Secretary of State \nClinton designated as a state sponsor of terror. It is what I would \nthink of as a very audacious, forward-leaning plan to attack the United \nStates, its people, and foreign embassies in the Nation's capital.\n  Tomorrow, in the Senate Banking Committee, we will meet with our \nUnder Secretary of the Treasury, a very able man named David Cohen. I \nurge the administration to look at what is the most effective sanction \ncurrently pending on our docket against the terrorists in Iran.\n  Earlier this year, we had 92 Senators--just about the entire Senate--\n\n[[Page S6372]]\n\nsign a letter to the President calling for the Treasury Department to \nexecute a strategy to collapse the Central Bank of Iran.\n  These are the pay masters of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps \nand the intelligence service of Iran--the MOIS--that appear to be \ninvolved in the plot that the Attorney General revealed today. It is \nthat action--to cut the Central Bank of Iran off from the central \npayment backbone of the Federal Reserve; obviously, to do it in \ncooperation with Saudi and Israeli officials, and given indications \nfrom London, from Paris, and from Berlin, probable action by our NATO \nallies as well--to cripple Iran's currency, to make sure what is called \nBank Markazi has no access to the payment mechanisms of the West that \nwill lead to a collapse of its currency.\n  I applaud David Cohen for designating at least five individuals as \nsponsors of terror who were part of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard's \nforce--Quds Force--but I think this doesn't go far enough. With the \nAttorney General of the United States directly blaming the Government \nof Iran for this bomb plot against targets in the capital city of the \nUnited States, it is clear, with overwhelming bipartisan support and 92 \nSenators behind the effort to collapse the Central Bank of Iran, that \nwould be an effective nonmilitary way to address what is clearly an \nutterly irresponsible and largely out of control IRGC and MOIS, who \nwere seeking to attack American targets.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Before speaking on the issue of the bombing, let me \ncommend my colleague from Illinois for speaking out on this Iranian \nplot, state-sponsored Iranian plot, to destroy the Saudi and Israeli \nEmbassies in Washington, DC. It is an outrage that they would reach \nthis far, obviously, into the United States. We know they have backed \nterrorism forever, as my colleague said, having been recognized by our \ngovernment as a state sponsor of terrorism. We need to heighten the \nsanctions on Iran and make it clear this type of action will not be \ncountenanced.\n  Many of us still recall it is only a few days after the 10th \nanniversary of 9/11, the last time terrorists decided they would strike \nin the United States. Regardless of whether the Embassy is for the \nUnited States, it is in the United States. Being here, it is protected \nproperty of our Nation.\n  I would say to the administration--to back my colleague from \nIllinois--let's look for every available means to let the Iranians know \nthis conduct is not only unacceptable but we will do everything we can \nto disable them from any further actions along these lines through \nsanctions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/11/senate-section/article/S6372-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6372-S6373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE AMERICAN JOBS ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this afternoon, the Republican leader of \nthe Senate came to the floor to talk about a vote we will have later \nthis afternoon. It is a vote which is historically important. We all \nknow the state of our economy. We are in a position now with 14 million \nAmericans out of work, 9.1 percent unemployment and private-sector jobs \ngoing up so slowly, it isn't getting us back into the kind of economic \nprogress we need. We listen monthly as the unemployment statistics come \nout, and we are reminded of the weakness of our economy. We have to do \nsomething. The choices are to allow this economy to languish or decline \nor to step up and do something.\n  President Obama has decided he needs to lead on this issue and bring \ntogether Democrats and Republicans for that purpose. He spoke to a \njoint session of Congress which we all attended. It was widely \nreported. He said: I am going to put my best ideas on the table, and I \ninvite the Republicans to do the same. We cannot stand idly by and do \nnothing.\n  So the President put his proposal forward. It was clear what he \nwanted to do, and he reminded the Republicans that many of the things \nhe proposed were actually ideas they had proposed in the past. Then we \nwaited and we waited. At the end of the day, I am afraid when this vote \nis taken, we will find few, if any, Republican Senators will support \nany effort to try to create jobs in the United States, as President \nObama has proposed.\n  The President has made his position clear. Those of us who will vote \nin support of the President's plan have made our positions clear. But \nthe position on the other side of the aisle is becoming increasingly \nclear as well, and it comes down to two things: First, the Republicans \nwill not countenance, approve or even consider $1 more in taxes for the \nwealthiest people in America. For them, that is unacceptable. It is \nbetter to do nothing than to impose $1 more in taxes on people making \nover $1 million a year. They have said that consistently, at every \nlevel of the Republican Party.\n  That position doesn't reflect the feeling of Republicans in America, \nwith 59 percent of them believing the President is right. It is not \nunfair to ask those who are making over $1 million a year to share the \nburden and sacrifice of moving the economy forward. Independents feel \nstrongly about it, and obviously Democrats do as well. The only \nRepublicans who don't share that belief happen to serve in the Senate, \nand they believe $1 more in taxes to pay for the President's jobs \nprograms--if it came from the accounts of people making over $1 million \na year--is unfair. So we know they are clear on that position.\n  But there is a second position the Republicans have taken that is \nequally clear. They are prepared to oppose any ideas coming from the \nObama administration, even ideas they have conceived and voted for in \nthe past. I asked my staff to take a look at some of the proposals of \nPresident Obama in his jobs bill, which will come up later this \nafternoon, to see what the record on the Republican side has been, and \nit is interesting.\n  Senator McConnell and 32 of his Republican colleagues supported \nPresident Bush's Economic Stimulus Act of 2008. It included tax rebates \nfor individuals, which we find in the Obama plan; tax cuts for small \nbusiness, which we find in the Obama plan--and no offset, incidentally. \nIt wasn't paid for. It added directly to the deficit. Senator McConnell \nand 32 of his Republican colleagues voted for that because it had \nPresident Bush's name associated with it. I am afraid most, if not all \nof them, will vote against this proposal because President Obama has \nbrought it forward.\n  Republicans have supported a payroll tax consistently in the past. \nHere is what Senator McConnell said on FOX News in January of 2009:\n\n       If you want a quick answer to the question of what would I \n     do, I'd have a payroll tax holiday for a year or two that \n     would put taxes in the hands of everybody who has a job, \n     whether they pay income taxes or not. And, of course, \n     businesses pay the payroll tax too, so it would be both a \n     business tax cut and individual tax cut immediately.\n\n  That is the centerpiece of President Obama's jobs plan. It is a plan \nthat was criticized on the floor this morning by Senator McConnell. The \napproach the President is taking is exactly what Senator McConnell said \nwhen he was speaking in the bosom of the lodge at FOX News in January \nof 2009. Republicans have supported Federal help to States. I will not \ngo through the list, but they have in the past.\n  Incidentally, it used to be dogmatic when it came to building \ninfrastructure in America--roads and highways and bridges and ports and \nairports. It was a bipartisan issue. When the President puts it in his \njobs bill, it is rejected. You know what the Republicans say about the \nPresident's jobs bill? We have tried all this before and it didn't \nwork, so let's not try it again. So they are summarily rejecting \npayroll tax cuts they have supported in the past for families, they are \nrejecting tax cuts for businesses to hire the unemployed--even \nunemployed veterans, which they have supported in the past; they are \nrejecting the notion we need to build America's infrastructure for the \nfuture of our economy; and they have basically said, when it comes to \ntrying to make this economy move forward, the only thing they want to \ndo is to pass a trade agreement.\n\n  We will consider three of those trade agreements tomorrow. At least \ntwo, maybe all of them, are likely to pass. How quickly do the \nRepublicans think there will be a turnaround in the economy if we start \nincreasing our trade with Korea, Colombia or Panama? It may increase \ntrade but certainly not in the near term and certainly not to the\n\n[[Page S6373]]\n\nbenefit of 14 million Americans who are currently unemployed.\n  It comes down to this. We are going to have a vote later this \nafternoon. It is going to be a vote on President Obama's jobs proposal. \nHe has spoken to it clearly in a joint session of Congress. He has \ntaken his case to the American people. He has included provisions which \nthe Republicans have historically supported but that I am afraid they \nare going to walk away from on this. The Republican approach to this is \nto do nothing--absolutely nothing. Protect millionaires from tax \nincreases and don't give President Obama a victory.\n  I will say this. This is not about a victory for President Obama. It \nis a victory for unemployed people across America that we would do \nsomething specific, something direct, and something that would have a \nmeasurable impact in creating jobs. I am troubled the Republican \napproach, as Senator McConnell described it, is one of ``just say no.''\n  That is the Republican answer to the weakness of our economy. He \ntalks about the tax hike that is included in our bill. That tax hike is \na surtax--on those making over $1 million in income--of 5.6 percent. It \nis not too much a sacrifice to ask from those who are most well off in \nAmerica.\n  When the Senator from Kentucky comes and tells us the earlier \nstimulus bill failed, I would say to him: Remember, over 40 percent of \nthat bill consisted of tax cuts, something most Republicans usually \nsupport. It also invested in America in ways that will pay off for \nyears to come. For example, the stimulus bill paid for and built a new \nterminal at the Peoria National Airport--a terminal that created jobs \ntoday and will serve that community for decades to come. That stimulus \nbill also led to the creation of an intermodal center in Bloomington, \nin downstate Illinois, a proposal that will create jobs now for \nconstruction and build for transportation in that community for decades \nto come.\n  So for that stimulus to be dismissed as not creating results, I am \nafraid Senator McConnell needs to journey a little north of Kentucky, \nand we will show him results in Illinois and all across the United \nStates.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois for \nhis remarks. In a few minutes, we are going to vote on a bill that \ncould actually change the course of how we trade with China. For a \ndecade, getting worse every year, China has taken advantage of America \nin every way. Currency is at the top of the list, but it has been the \ntheft of intellectual property, it has been the subsidy of indigenous \nChinese businesses, it has been monopolizing things such as rare earth, \nand it has been excluding American products from China when those \nproducts would have a competitive advantage. For the first time, this \nbody, in a bipartisan way, has the ability to say enough is enough. \nUncle Sam is no longer Uncle Sap. We are going to create fair trade \nwith China.\n  This relates to our future because it no longer is competition over \nshoes or clothing or furniture--labor-intensive businesses. It is \ncompetition over the most high-end things we do. Our companies can win \nand create jobs here in America if China plays by the rules and plays \nfairly. But everyone who has been up close and seen the way the Chinese \noperate know that will not happen by persuasion, by multilateral talks, \nby wishing it were so or even by the healing of time. It will only \nhappen if America stands up for itself--for fairness, for equal \ntreatment. For the first time, we have the opportunity to get that to \nhappen.\n  Some say this is a symbolic bill. It is not. If we pass this bill by \na bipartisan majority, I will tell everybody what will happen. The \nHouse will vote on something--hopefully strong--and we will have a \nconference committee with something going to the President's desk. Long \nbefore that occurs--long before that occurs--the Chinese will begin to \nstep back from their unfair trade policies. So we can indeed win the \ntrade argument with China.\n  Some say it will create a trade war. We are already in a trade war, \nand we are losing. We are getting our clocks cleaned. But we can stop \nit, and this is the opportunity.\n  Mr. President, every one of us has spoken to companies that make \nhigh-end products throughout our States, and that China competes \nunfairly and takes jobs and wealth away from America, we know that. No \none disputes that. No one disputes that they manipulate currency. No \none disputes that they take jobs and wealth unfairly from America. The \nissue is what to do about it.\n  Some say talk to the Chinese. We have done that for 7 years. Some say \nhave multilateral agreements. We have tried that; China just doesn't \nlisten. The only way to get China to change its policies is by \nrequiring them to do so by putting in place a system that says: If you \ndon't, the consequences will be worse for you than if you do. That is \nhow China operates. Unfortunately, my belief is the new leadership in \nChina, without any reformers on the executive committee of the \nPolitburo, will get worse, not better, unless we, together, Democrats \nand Republicans, say to China: Enough is enough.\n  American workers have said enough is enough. American businesses have \nsaid enough is enough. When is the Congress, when is this government \ngoing to say enough is enough instead of just twiddling our thumbs and \nhoping and praying China might change out of the goodness of their \nhearts? Well, the time is now. This is a unique opportunity not simply \nto have a symbolic vote. Believe me, this is not at all political to \nme. Senator Graham and I have tried to keep this a bipartisan issue \nreligiously for 7 years. To me, this is something that relates to the \nvery future of our country, like educating our kids, like creating jobs \nso that the next generation has a better opportunity than this, like \nthe greatness of America itself.\n  We are in a tough world. We know that. But America always wins in a \ntough world. We compete and we survive. The only way we won't is if the \ndeck continues to stay stacked against us. My colleagues, even up the \nplaying field. This legislation will start us on the road to doing that \nso that our children and our grandchildren will have a better future \nthan they will if we continue the present policies and let China take \nindustry after industry unfairly away from us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                             SENATOR COBURN\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I just learned that my friend, Senator Tom \nCoburn, has undergone surgery to treat prostate cancer. The junior \nSenator from Oklahoma is expected to make a full recovery. His cancer \nwas in the early stages, and he should be back to work in a few weeks. \nSenator Coburn has battled cancer twice before, and he has beaten the \ndisease twice before. Those of us who know Tom Coburn know with \ncertainty that this fighter will beat it again.\n  My thoughts are with Senator Coburn and his family, and I wish him a \ncomplete and speedy recovery. I understand how difficult a cancer \ndiagnosis can be on the patient as well as the family. The entire \nSenate community is pulling for Senator Coburn, his wife Carolyn, and \ntheir three children and five grandchildren.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would like to take a few moments before we have a \nvote this afternoon to discuss a serious concern I have about the \noriginal stimulus package, and I want the Senate to consider my remarks \nand my research as we consider the President's latest modified so-\ncalled jobs bill--in actuality, stimulus bill No. 2. I want to ensure \nthe taxpayers' money is spent responsibly on programs that create \nviable, long-term jobs, not lost to waste, fraud, and abuse. The \nmarching orders for the stimulus funding under the Obama administration \nhave been ``spend now, chase later.'' But when governments spend money \nquickly, it\n\n[[Page S6374]]\n\nleads to massive waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  President Obama promised us he would use ``the new tools that the \nRecovery Act gives us to watch the taxpayers' money with more vigor and \ntransparency than ever'' before. He also said that ``if a Federal \nagency proposes a project that will waste that money,'' he would ``put \na stop to it.'' It is past time for the President to live up to his \nwords because we all know, up to now, that certainly hasn't been the \ncase. I will give several examples.\n  A year ago, I asked the Department of Labor to explain why $500 \nmillion in green job training grants had been spent when the Department \nhad just asked the public to help them define just what a green job is. \nNow, over a year later, the Department of Labor's inspector general \nissued an audit report showing that the President's promises are much \ndifferent from reality. The reality is that only 8,000 program \nparticipants found employment--only 10 percent of the promised results. \nThe reality is that $300 million still remains unspent in the program. \nThe reality is that this money won't be spent or produce the jobs \nbefore the grants expire. But instead of learning from this failure and \nusing this money for more effective job training, the administration \ncontinues to push good money after bad into so-called green jobs, which \nI don't think has actually even yet been defined to this very day.\n  The administration left much of stimulus 1 oversight to the inspector \ngeneral offices of the respective departments but has largely \ndisregarded their findings and recommendations. I strongly support \nefforts of our inspectors general and am extremely frustrated that the \nadministration ignores rather than enforces the recommendations of the \nvarious inspectors general.\n  Thanks to the audit work performed by these IGs, I have also \nquestioned the administration's ability to track stimulus funding after \nit was distributed to the first recipients. For instance, the \nDepartment of Education provided $1.7 billion to the State of New York \neven though the inspector general reported that the State has ``serious \ninternal deficiencies'' that would make tracking the money extremely \ndifficult.\n  The Housing and Urban Development Office of Inspector General \nreleased a series of reports that questioned why additional funding was \ngiven to troubled housing authorities with significant financial and \nmanagement problems. HUD Secretary Donovan stated that these housing \nauthorities needed that money to improve their inventory and make \nneeded upgrades.\n  The weatherization program has also been fraught with waste. The \ninspector general found that in many cases contractors never did the \nwork, and some work was so shoddy that it endangered the health and \nsafety of the owners.\n\n  I continue to raise strong concerns about the Department of Energy's \nfailure to monitor State and territory programs.\n  I am not aware that the administration has ever demanded any of the \ntaxpayers' money back, even for the blatant cases of waste, fraud, and \nabuse.\n  The administration also spent $84 million of the stimulus funding to \nestablish the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board to guard \nagainst wasteful spending. The Recovery Accountability and Transparency \nBoard can hold hearings and compel testimony about stimulus fund waste. \nI have referred two cases to this board, but so far it has refused to \nuse this authority. In the first case, HUD's Office of Inspector \nGeneral questioned nearly $32 million of stimulus money spent by the \nPhiladelphia Housing Authority to rehabilitate scattered-site housing. \nAccording to the inspector general's report, most of the work was never \ndone and the housing authority couldn't provide detailed invoices to \nshow what the contractors were charging the government for.\n  I also referred the $535 million loan guarantee from the Department \nof Energy to Solyndra because I understand the board may have detected \npossible problems with guarantees.\n  So President Obama made lots of promises about transparency and \naccountability when he asked Congress to pass the first stimulus bill. \nBefore we consider giving him another over $400 billion, the President \nneeds to turn his promises into reality or it is the American taxpayers \nwho will lose once again, even beyond the examples I have already \ngiven.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the motion to proceed to this latest \nmodified tax-and-spend proposal that even the Washington Post has \ncalled ``political.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                              SENATE RULES\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about \nchanging our Senate rules by a simple majority vote. That is what we \ndid last week.\n  Mr. President, as you know, the new classes that came in in your year \nand the year after have worked on these rule change issues, and the \nlast 2 years, I have been working to find a way for the Senate to break \nthrough the gridlock and to function on behalf of the American people, \nto focus, as we are doing with this bill, on jobs for the American \npeople.\n  Last week, the Senate took the step of changing our rules with a \nsimple majority vote. This was done in accordance with the \nConstitution, article I, section 5. The Senate has done this on many \noccasions in the past, and, like those previous rule changes, the \naction taken last week was not intended to destroy the uniqueness of \nthe Senate but, instead, to restore the regular order of the body.\n  I applaud the majority leader for getting us back on track. The \nSenate should be focused on the jobs agenda of the American people, and \nMajority Leader Reid has put us on the right path. He may be forced to \ndo this again, but it is important that he stay focused on that agenda \nand all of us stay focused on the jobs agenda of the American people.\n  At the beginning of this Congress, I, along with Senators Harkin and \nMerkley, tried to do that. Ultimately, our success was limited. We \ndidn't achieve the broad reforms we wanted . . . but we did initiate a \ndebate that highlighted some of the most egregious abuses of the rules, \nand resulted in a ``gentleman's agreement'' between Majority Leader \nReid and Minority Leader McConnell.\n  There was some hope that the agreement would encourage both sides of \nthe aisle to restore the respect and comity that is often lacking in \ntoday's Senate. Unfortunately however, that agreement rapidly \ndeteriorated and the partisan rancor and political brinksmanship \nquickly returned.\n  What unfolded last Thursday in this chamber is yet another example of \nwhat this body has become. The Senate had invoked cloture on the \nChinese currency bill, thus limiting further debate on the measure to \n30 hours. It was at this point Republicans moved to offer a potentially \nunlimited number of nongermane amendments to the bill.\n  Each of these amendments would have required a suspension of the \nSenate rules, meaning the approval of 67 Senators rather than 60, in \norder to consider them. This was not an effort to improve the bill but \nsimply a procedural strategy to score political points and force votes \non unrelated legislation. Majority Leader Reid raised a point of order \nthat motions to suspend the rules post-cloture were dilatory, which was \nrejected by the Chair. A majority of Senators then voted to overturn \nthe decision of the Chair, thus changing the precedent and limiting how \namendments can be considered once cloture is invoked.\n  As expected, many of my Republican colleagues called last week's \naction by the majority a power grab and ``tyranny of the majority.'' \nThey decried the lack of respect for minority rights. I agree: We must \nrespect the minority in the Senate. But respect must go both ways. When \nthe minority uses their rights to offer germane amendments, or to \nextend legitimate debate, we should always respect such efforts. But \nthat is not what we have seen. Instead, the minority often uses its \nrights to score political points and obstruct almost all Senate action. \nInstead of offering amendments to improve legislation, we see \namendments that have the sole purpose of becoming talking points in \nnext year's election.\n  It is hard to argue that the majority is not respecting the \ntraditions of the Senate, when the minority is paralyzing this body \npurely for political gain.\n  During the debate over rules reform we had in January, many of my \ncolleagues argued that the only way to\n\n[[Page S6375]]\n\nchange the Senate rules was with a two-thirds supermajority. As we saw \nlast week, that's simply not true. Some call what occurred last week \nthe ``constitutional option,'' while others call it the ``nuclear \noption.'' I think the best name for it might be the ``majority \noption.''\n  As I studied this issue in great depth, one thing became very clear--\nSenator Robert Byrd may have said it best during a debate on the floor \nin 1975 when he said, ``at any time that 51 Members of the Senate are \ndetermined to change the rule . . . and if the leadership of the Senate \njoins them . . . that rule will be changed.''\n  We keep hearing that any use of this option to change the rules is an \nabuse of power by the majority. However, a 2005 Policy Committee memo \nprovides some excellent points to rebut this argument. And just to be \nclear, these citations are from a Republican Policy Committee memo.\n  Let me read part of the Republican memo:\n\n       This constitutional option is well grounded in the U.S. \n     Constitution and in Senate history. The Senate has always \n     had, and repeatedly has exercised, the constitutional power \n     to change the Senate's procedures through a majority vote. \n     Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd used the constitutional option \n     in 1977, 1979, 1980, and 1987 to establish precedents \n     changing Senate procedures during the middle of a Congress. \n     And the Senate several times has changed its Standing Rules \n     after the constitutional option had been threatened, \n     beginning with the adoption of the first cloture rule in \n     1917. Simply put, the constitutional option itself is a \n     longstanding feature of Senate practice.\n       The Senate, therefore, has long accepted the legitimacy of \n     the constitutional option. Through precedent, the option has \n     been exercised and Senate procedures have been changed. At \n     other times it has been merely threatened, and Senators \n     negotiated textual rules changes through the regular order. \n     But regardless of the outcome, the constitutional option has \n     played an ongoing and important role.\n\n  The memo goes on to address some ``Common Misunderstandings of the \nConstitutional Option.''\n  One misunderstanding addressed a claim we heard last week that, ``The \nessential character of the Senate will be destroyed if the \nconstitutional option is exercised.''\n  The memo rebuts this by stating:\n\n       When Majority Leader Byrd repeatedly exercised the \n     constitutional option to correct abuses of Senate rules and \n     precedents, those illustrative exercises of the option did \n     little to upset the basic character of the Senate. Indeed, \n     many observers argue that the Senate minority is stronger \n     today in a body that still allows for extensive debate, full \n     consideration, and careful deliberation of all matters with \n     which it is presented.\n\n  Changing the rules with a simple majority is not about exercising \npower but it is about restoring balance. There is a fine line between \nrespecting minority rights and yielding to minority rule. When we cross \nthat line, as I believe we have many times in recent years, the body is \nwithin its rights to restore the balance.\n  This is not tyranny by the majority, but merely holding the minority \naccountable when it abuses the rules to the point of complete \ndysfunction. Neither party should stoop to that level.\n  Many of my colleagues argue that the Senate's supermajority \nrequirements are what make it unique from the House of Representatives, \nand other legislative body around the world. I disagree. If you talk to \nthe veteran Senators, many of them will tell you that the need for 60 \nvotes to pass anything is a recent phenomenon. Senator Harkin discussed \nthis in great detail during our debate in January and I highly \nrecommend reading his statement.\n  Senator Leahy raised the issue on the floor last week when he said;\n\n       I keep hearing this talk about 60 votes. Most votes you win \n     by 51 votes, and this constant mantra of 60 votes, this is \n     some new invention.\n\n  I think this gets at the heart of the problem. We are a unique \nlegislative body but not because of our rulebook. Complete gridlock and \ndysfunction can't be what our Founders intended. Rather than a body \nbound by mutual respect that moves by consent and allows majority votes \non almost all matters, we have become a supermajoritarian institution \nthat often doesn't move at all.\n  With the tremendously difficult economic circumstances facing this \ncountry, the American people cannot afford a broken Senate. They are \nfrustrated. And they have every right to be. This is not how to govern, \nand they deserve better. Both sides need to take a step back and \nunderstand that what we do on the Senate floor should not be about \nsetting up the next Presidential election or winning the majority next \nNovember but about helping the country today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe Executive Summary of The Constitutional Option.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      The Senate's Power To Make Procedural Rules by Majority Vote\n\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       The filibusters of judicial nominations that arose during \n     the 108th Congress have created an institutional crisis for \n     the Senate.\n       Until 2003, Democrats and Republicans had worked together \n     to guarantee that nominations considered on the Senate floor \n     received up-or-down votes.\n       The filibustering Senators are trying to create a new \n     Senate precedent--a 60-vote requirement for the confirmation \n     of judges--contrary to the simple-majority standard presumed \n     in the Constitution.\n       If the Senate allows these filibusters to continue, it will \n     be acquiescing in Democrats' unilateral change to Senate \n     practices and procedures.\n       The Senate has the power to remedy this situation through \n     the ``constitutional option''--the exercise of a Senate \n     majority's constitutional power to define Senate practices \n     and procedures.\n       The Senate has always had, and repeatedly has exercised, \n     this constitutional option. The majority's authority is \n     grounded in the Constitution, Supreme Court case law, and the \n     Senate's past practices.\n       For example, Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd used the \n     constitutional option in 1977, 1979, 1980, and 1987 to \n     establish precedents that changed Senate procedures during \n     the middle of a Congress.\n       An exercise of the constitutional option under the current \n     circumstances would be an act of restoration--a return to the \n     historic and constitutional confirmation standard of simple-\n     majority support for all judicial nominations.\n       Employing the constitutional option here would not affect \n     the legislative filibuster because virtually every Senator \n     supports its preservation. In contrast, only a minority of \n     Senators believes in blocking judicial nominations by \n     filibuster.\n       The Senate would, therefore, be well within its rights to \n     exercise the constitutional option in order to restore up-or-\n     down votes for judicial nominations on the Senate floor.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico.

Mr. President, today we are going to consider the \nnomination of Jane Margaret Triche-Milazzo to be U.S. district judge \nfor the Eastern District of Louisiana. Before I make my remarks \nregarding the nomination, I want to respond to some comments made on \nthe floor last Thursday evening because I am really amazed and very \ndisappointed by the continuing allegations that Senate Republicans are \ndelaying, obstructing, or otherwise blocking judicial nominations. One \nMember stated that we ``filibuster everything and require 60 votes on \neverything, including judges.'' That statement is without merit, and so \nI am here to set the record straight.\n  We are making very good progress in the consideration and \nconfirmation of President Obama's judicial nominations. In fact, we \nhave taken positive action on 84 percent of President Obama's judicial \nnominees. We heard from five judicial nominees in committee last week, \nreported five more to the floor, and continue to hold regular votes on \njudicial nominees. President Obama's circuit court nominees are \nwaiting, on average, only 66 days to receive a hearing. Now, compare \nthat to the 247 days President Bush's circuit nominees were forced to \nwait. The same can be said for district court nominees, who have only \nwaited 79 days under President Obama. Nominees\n\n[[Page S6376]]\n\nfrom President Bush waited on average 100 days for a hearing. You can \nunderstand why I am disturbed because some people say there is a \nRepublican effort not to cooperate on moving these judges.\n\n  The reporting process has also favored President Obama's judicial \nnominees. On average, President Obama's circuit court nominees have \nonly waited 116 days to be reported out of committee. President Bush's \ncircuit court nominees waited over 369 days to be reported. District \ncourt nominees are no different. President Obama's nominees for the \ndistrict courts have waited 129 days, while President Bush's district \ncourt nominees waited over 148 days.\n  The accusations that we are filibustering or requiring 60 votes on \neverything including judges is not supported by the facts. We have \nconfirmed 43 judicial nominees this year. With the vote today we will \nhave confirmed over 66 percent of President Obama's judicial nominees \nsince the beginning of his administration. During our consideration of \nthe 98 judicial nominations submitted during this Congress, there have \nbeen two cloture votes. One of those nominees was confirmed. The other \nwas withdrawn.\n  In the last Congress there were four cloture motions made in \nrelationship to 105 judicial nominations submitted. I remind my \ncolleagues that at least 18 of President Bush's judicial nominations \nwere subjected to cloture motions, many of them having multiple cloture \nvotes. According to my count, there were approximately 30 cloture votes \non Bush judicial nominees.\n  There has to be a double standard on the part of my colleagues who \nsomehow forget the history or somehow do not know how to count or \nsometimes, if they do read the numbers, do not know what the numbers \nmean.\n  Another colleague of mine stated last Thursday night that he could \nnot remember a time during his long service in the Senate when judges \nwould sit on the calendar for months. It was not that long ago, while \nthe current majority party was in the minority, when qualified nominees \nsat on the Senate calendar for months. In most cases, when finally \nafforded a vote, they received unanimous support. These included Juan \nSanchez, who was nominated for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania; \nWilliam Duffey, Jr., who was nominated for the Northern District of \nGeorgia; Mark Filip, who was nominated for the Northern District of \nIllinois; Gary Sharpe, who was nominated for the Northern District of \nNew York; and James Robart, who was nominated for the Western District, \nState of Washington. These are just a few of President Bush's district \ncourt nominees who sat on the calendar for well over 3 months, yet \nreceived unanimous support in their confirmation votes.\n  I wonder if my colleagues remember William Haynes, President Bush's \nnominee to sit on the Fourth Circuit. He waited 638 days on the Senate \ncalendar in the 108th Congress alone before being returned to the \nPresident. All in all, Mr. Haynes put his life on hold for 1,173 days \nwithout ever receiving an up-or-down vote.\n  Another of President Bush's circuit court nominees, Raymond \nKethledge, waited 23 months before being confirmed by the Senate and \nwas then confirmed--can you believe it--on a voice vote.\n  I am not providing these facts to engage in a tit-for-tat, but when I \nhear colleagues misstate facts and can't understand numbers and can't \ncount, I have to set the record straight.\n  Shortly we will vote on Jane M. Triche-Milazzo, who is nominated to \nbe the U.S. district judge for the Eastern District of Louisiana. She \ngraduated magna cum laude with a bachelor's degree from Nicholls State \nUniversity in 1977 and then worked for some time as an elementary \nschool teacher before beginning to work in her father's law office. In \n1992, Judge Triche-Milazzo graduated with a juris doctorate from \nLouisiana State University, Paul M. Herbert Law Center. She spent the \nentirety of her legal career practicing at Risley Triche, LLC, first as \nan associate and later to become a partner.\n  In 2008 she was elected judge for Louisiana's 23rd judicial district. \nShe is a Louisiana State District Court judge for Division D of the \n23rd judicial district bench. She was the first female judge elected to \nthat judicial district bench. Judge Triche-Milazzo received a unanimous \n``qualified'' rating from the ABA Committee on the Federal Judiciary, \nso I am pleased to support this fine nominee and thank her for her \nservice.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in a few moments the Senate has the \nopportunity to proceed to the American Jobs Act. The bill the President \nasked us to pass a month ago includes bipartisan proposals that have \nreceived broad approval in the past from Members of both parties, \nincluding road and bridge repairs, teacher retentions and extensions of \ntax relief for businesses to encourage hiring. We should answer the \nPresident's call and the American people's needs and act to help get \nAmericans back to work and grow the economy.\n  There is another unacceptable rate that we can help change to the \nbenefit of all Americans. That is the judicial vacancy rate. It now \nstands at nearly 11 percent, with 92 vacancies on Federal courts around \nthe country. I will ask to have printed in the Record an editorial on \nthis topic entitled ``The Other Federal Crisis'' that appeared in \nMcClatchy--Tribune papers last week.\n  We can act today to bring down that rate dramatically by considering \nand confirming 26 judicial nominations approved by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee that are awaiting final Senate action.\n  Today we are voting on only one of those judicial 26 nominees. With \nRepublican agreement, all 26 could have been voted on today. Of the 25 \njudges who will remain on the Executive Calendar after today's vote, 21 \nwere reported with the unanimous support of all Democrats and all \nRepublicans serving on the Judiciary Committee. All of them have the \nsupport of their home State Senators, 10 include Republicans home State \nSenators.\n  Today, the Senate will finally vote on the nomination of Jane Triche-\nMilazzo to serve as a district judge in the U.S. District Court for the \nEastern District of Louisiana. While I am pleased that we are finally \nhaving a vote on Judge Triche-Milazzo's nomination, after 3 months of \nunnecessary delay, more than two dozen well-qualified, consensus \nnominees still await a Senate confirmation vote. At a time when \nvacancies on Federal courts throughout the country have remained near \nor above 90 for more than 2 years, delaying votes on these nominees \nneedlessly undermines the ability of our Federal courts to provide \njustice to Americans around the country.\n  The Senate could take significant steps today to address this ongoing \ncrisis in judicial vacancies just by acting on the nominations \nthoroughly vetted by the Judiciary Committee and reported with \nbipartisan support. This week, with Republican cooperation, the \nJudiciary Committee could report five more consensus nominees to fill \njudicial emergency vacancies on the Eleventh Circuit and in Utah, as \nwell as vacancies in Missouri, Nebraska, and Washington. I have \nrepeatedly noted Senator Grassley's willingness to work with me to make \nsure that the Judiciary Committee makes progress on nominations. \nRegrettably, the Judiciary Committee's efforts to act on nominations \nhave not been matched by action by the Senate, where the Republican \nleadership has refused promptly to consider even consensus nominations. \nThey are delayed for months. The Republican leadership's refusal to \npromptly schedule votes on pending judicial nominations is a departure \nfrom the Senate's action in regularly considering President Bush's \nnominations, which we did whether the Senate had a Democratic or \nRepublican majority. At this point in George W. Bush's presidency, the \nSenate had confirmed 162 of his nominees for the Federal circuit and \ndistrict courts, including 100 during the 17 months that I was chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee during his first term. By this date in \nPresident Clinton's first term, the Senate had confirmed 163 of his \nnominations to circuit and district courts. In stark contrast, after \ntoday's vote, the Senate will have confirmed only 105 of President \nObama's nominees to Federal circuit and district courts. In the next \nyear, we need to confirm 100 more of his circuit and district court \nnominations to match the 205 confirmed during President Bush's first \nterm.\n  We can and must do better to address the serious judicial vacancies \ncrisis affecting Federal courts around the\n\n[[Page S6377]]\n\ncountry. Nearly half of all Americans--136 million--live in districts \nor circuits that have a judicial vacancy that could be filled today if \nthe Senate Republicans just agreed to vote on the nominations currently \npending on the Executive Calendar. As many as 21 states are served by \nFederal courts with vacancies that would be filled by nominations \nstalled on the Senate calendar. Millions of Americans across the \ncountry are being harmed by delays in overburdened courts. The \nRepublican leadership should explain to the American people why they \nwill not consent to vote on the qualified, consensus candidates \nnominated to fill these extended judicial vacancies.\n  The unnecessary delays in our consideration of judicial nominations \nhave contributed to the longest period of historically high vacancy \nrates in the last 35 years. The number of judicial vacancies rose above \n90 in August 2009, and it has stayed near or above that level ever \nsince. Vacancies are twice as high as they were at this point in \nPresident Bush's first term when the Senate was expeditiously voting on \nconsensus judicial nominations. We must bring an end to these needless \ndelays in the Senate so that we can ease the burden on our Federal \ncourts so that they can better serve the American people.\n  Last week, the Senate voted to confirm Judge Jennifer Guerin Zipps, \nwho was nominated to fill the emergency judicial vacancy created by the \ntragic death of Judge Roll in the Tucson, AZ, shootings. I was pleased \nthat, with cooperation from Republican Senators, the time from when the \nJudiciary Committee reported Judge Zipps' nomination to full Senate \nconsideration was less than a month even including a recess period. All \nnominations should move at that rate. It should not take a tragedy to \nspur us to action to fill a judicial emergency vacancy. Indeed, the \ntime it took the Senate to consider Judge Zipps' nomination was in line \nwith the average time it took for the Senate to consider President \nBush's unanimously reported judicial nominations, 28 days. Her \nnomination would not have been an exception during those years as it \nregrettably has become today. President Obama's consensus nominations, \nreported with the unanimous support of every Republican and Democrat on \nthe Judiciary Committee, have waited an average of 79 days on the \nExecutive Calendar before consideration by the Senate. Today's nominee \nis a good example. She was reported unanimously on July 14. That was \nnearly 3 months ago.\n  Last week, I invited Justice Scalia and Justice Breyer to appear \nbefore the Judiciary Committee and discuss the important role that \njudges play under our Constitution. Justice Scalia agreed that the \nextensive delays in the confirmation process are already having a \nchilling effect on the ability to attract talented nominees to the \nFederal bench. Chief Justice Roberts has also described the \n``persistent problem of judicial vacancies in critically overworked \ndistricts.'' Hardworking Americans are denied justice when their cases \nare delayed by overburdened courts. While people appearing in court are \nwaiting years before a judge rules on their case, they feel they are \nbeing forced to live the old adage ``justice delayed is justice \ndenied.''\n  Today the Senate will confirm an experienced, consensus nominee who \ncould and should have received a vote prior to the August recess. Jane \nTriche-Milazzo is nominated to fill a vacancy in the U.S. District \nCourt for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Currently a Louisiana \nState court judge, she previously spent 16 years in private practice in \nher family's law firm in Napoleonville, LA. Judge Triche-Milazzo has \nthe bipartisan support of her home State Senators, Democratic Senator \nMary Landrieu and Republican Senator David Vitter. The Judiciary \nCommittee favorably reported her nomination without a single dissenting \nvote almost 3 months ago. I expect that the Senate will confirm her \nunanimously today.\n  We must do more to make progress in considering the other 25 judicial \nnominations pending on the Senate's Executive Calendar. The excessive \nnumber of vacancies has persisted in Federal courts throughout the \nNation for far too long. The American people should not have to wait \nfor the Senate to do its constitutional duty of confirming judges to \nthe Federal bench. With millions of Americans currently affected by the \nvacancy crisis in our courts, there is serious work to be done.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe editorial to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Miami Herald, Oct. 2, 2011]\n\n                        The Other Federal Crisis\n\n       In the month since Congress returned from the summer \n     recess, the crisis over the deficit and federal spending has \n     been the focus of attention, with ideological gridlock \n     obstructing progress. But partisan politics has also produced \n     a separate crisis in the nation's federal courts.\n       During September, the Senate confirmed a grand total of \n     three federal judges--leaving 95 vacancies in courthouses \n     around the country. This means that there are simply not \n     enough federal judges to handle the judicial workload, \n     resulting in justice delayed in both criminal and civil \n     cases. In 35 of those instances, including two district seats \n     in the Southern District of Florida, the courts have declared \n     a judicial emergency, meaning the dockets are overloaded to \n     the breaking point.\n       According to a recent report by the Congressional Research \n     Service, this is a historically high level of vacancies, and \n     the prolonged slowness in filling the empty seats makes the \n     Obama presidency the longest period of high vacancy rates in \n     the federal judiciary in 35 years.\n       Clearly, the Senate is not fulfilling its constitutional \n     duty to confirm judges. Some 58 Obama administration nominees \n     are pending in the Senate to fill the 95 vacancies. \n     Republican senators have complained that there should be a \n     nominee for every vacancy--fair enough--but that does not \n     explain why so many of the nominations have been stalled for \n     so long.\n       The Senate, of course, has a duty to ensure that nominees \n     are qualified. No one wants a ``fast-tracked'' judge hearing \n     cases. But it's hard to escape the conclusion that partisan \n     politics rather than the quality of the nominees is the root \n     of the problem when even consensus candidates must wait for \n     prolonged periods.\n       This Monday, for example, the Senate is expected to fill \n     some of those vacancies when six of the nominations go to the \n     floor for a vote, meaning there has been a preceding \n     agreement not to block the vote.\n       That generally leads to confirmation. Of those six, five \n     have been pending since May and June--and all of them were \n     approved with a unanimous vote by Democratic and Republican \n     members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In other words, \n     there is no question that the nominees have the \n     qualifications to do the job--so why the delay?\n       In the past, Democrats have been slow to approve nominees \n     from Republican presidents. But the record shows that \n     approvals for nominees by the last Republican president, \n     George W. Bush, moved faster even when Democrats had the \n     power to block confirmation.\n       At this point in the presidency of President Bush, 144 \n     federal circuit and district court judges had been confirmed. \n     By comparison, according to Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, \n     chairman of the Judiciary Committee, total confirmations of \n     federal circuit and district court judges during the first \n     three years of the Obama administration have been only 98. \n     ``The Senate has a long way to go before the end of next year \n     to match the 205 confirmations of President Bush's judicial \n     nominees during his first term,'' he said.\n       This is a problem senators can solve easily. First, vote on \n     all 27 pending nominees who have already won committee \n     approval, beginning with those who received a unanimous vote. \n     Then move the other nominations to the floor without \n     unreasonable delay. The deterioration of the federal \n     judiciary because of partisan politics is inexcusable.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

REPEAL OF THE EXCHANGE RATES AND ECONOMIC POLICY \n                   COORDINATION ACT OF 1988.\n\n       The Exchange Rates and International Economic Policy \n     Coordination Act of 1988 (22 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.) is \n     repealed.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the recent \nvote on the Currency Exchange Rate Oversight Reform Act of 2011 that \njust passed in the Senate. The issue of currency misalignment and \nmanipulation has brought to the surface a myriad of concerns that face \nour country's workers and businesses.\n  Coloradans are concerned that American businesses and producers are \nunable to compete fairly in the global marketplace when foreign \ncountries keep the value of their currency artificially low. Those who \nhave both supported and opposed this legislation agree that the \nartificial undervaluation of foreign currency has had a negative impact \non the competitiveness of U.S. exports and that it needs to be \nremedied. In the case of China, numerous economists have estimated that \nits currency is undervalued by anywhere from 12 to 50 percent. The \nInternational Monetary Fund and the U.S. Treasury are also among those \nwho have determined that the undervaluation of Chinese currency is \nreal.\n  The implications of this artificial undervaluation include a \ndetrimental effect on the competiveness of U.S. products abroad, making \nChinese products artificially cheaper than U.S. products. The National \nAssociation of Manufacturers has affirmed ``that the excessive \nvaluation of the dollar [relative to foreign currencies] simply prices \nU.S. exports out of the market.'' They highlight that their members \n``have made it clear that the number-one factor affecting their exports \nis the value of the dollar.''\n  We can agree that artificial undervaluation of currency is a serious \nproblem that harms our economy, our worldwide competitiveness, and our \nAmerican workers. And it needs to be addressed. Yet the principle \nchallenge here has been how we should ultimately go about making sure \nour economic partners, such as China, are honoring shared commitments \nto compete on a level playing field.\n  I understand the concerns of both sides in this debate and I know \nthat many American businesses that have a presence in China and across \nour globe are concerned about the potential for retaliatory action from \nChina. These companies, many of which also face ongoing issues of \ninadequate protection of intellectual property, discriminatory \nindigenous innovation and other industrial policies that limit access \nto Chinese markets, are understandably worried that China would further \nrestrict their markets to fair competition.\n  I have also heard the frustration of domestic producers and U.S. \nworkers who, together, produce a whole host of products in the U.S. and \nhave felt the direct effect of being unable to compete fairly due to \nthe discounting effect that China's currency undervaluation has on \nChinese imports.\n  All of these concerns are valid, and despite some of my Senate \ncolleagues' disagreement on whether to support the legislation that \ncame before us, the common denominator in this debate has been a desire \nfor fairness. And I believe that we will move closer to achieving \nfairness in the market place with a clearer commitment to a market-\nbased exchange rate from our trade and economic partners.\n  As sovereign nations, we all have the economic well being of our \nrespective countries at heart, but that does not justify the use of \nunfair trade practices, and we cannot turn a blind eye when this \nhappens. Nor should we allow the specter of a ``trade war'' to distract \nus from the fact that China is not abiding by the international rules \nthat were put in place to help prevent trade wars in the first place. \nChina agreed to abide by these rules of the international community--\nincluding rules about intellectual property rights and unfair \nrestrictions to market access, as well as rules against intentional \ncurrency misalignment--and we should not accept their adherence to \ncertain rules but not others. They all apply.\n  After taking a closer look at the issue of China's currency \nundervaluation, taking into consideration the concerns that I have \nheard on this issue from a range of Coloradans, and reviewing the \nlegislative proposal that was before us, I believed that the U.S. \nSenate needed to send a signal to China, and others who may be \nintentionally undervaluing their currencies. The message is that \nAmericans value playing by the rules and that we expect our trade \npartners to live up to our shared commitment to compete fairly in the \nglobal marketplace.\n  I ultimately came to the conclusion that this bipartisan legislation, \nknown as the Currency Exchange Rate Oversight Reform Act of 2011, was \nan appropriate way to send a signal that we are serious about working \nbilaterally and/or multilaterally, in a manner consistent with World \nTrade Organization agreements, to develop a responsible plan so that \ncurrencies identified as fundamentally misaligned can be valued \nappropriately based on relevant market factors. In the event that the \nmisaligned currency goes unresolved, the legislation also authorizes \nthe administration to take action to protect American businesses and \nworkers from the discounting effect that the undervaluation of the \ncurrency can have on imports from the respective country. I believe \nthat the mechanisms built into this legislation can promote a \ncollaborative effort to address any undervaluation of a foreign \ncurrency, while also sending the message that we cannot allow American \nbusinesses to be undercut.\n  My choice to support this legislation aligns best with the common \nsense and pragmatic thinking of Coloradans. Unfortunately, China \ncontinues to characterize efforts on the part of the United States to \nensure a level playing field for international trade as \n``protectionist.'' Supporting fair competition, fair access to markets \nand fulfillment of the commitments of our shared expectations among \neconomic and trade partners is far from protectionist. As former \nPresident Ronald Reagan once stated, ``To make the international \ntrading system work, all must abide by the rules.'' I urge China to act \nin good faith and to remain committed to reaching economic stability \nthrough cooperative action that encourages fair competition. The \nlegislation I just supported is one component to reaching that goal, \nand I believe it supports the American businesses and workers who are \npropelling our nation to continue to be the leader in the global \neconomic race.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss S. 1619, known as \nthe China Currency bill. I voted for that bill today because China has \nnot made the progress that the U.S. and other countries have sought on \ncurrency issues. These currency issues can lead to economic distortions \nthat cost the American economy jobs and increase economic risks for the \nglobal economy. Ideally, we would address these problems through \nnegotiations with China and some other countries, but that course that \nhas not yet yielded significant results. I hope we will make better \nprogress on these currency issues in the future, and then perhaps \nlegislation such as this won't be necessary. This bill is not perfect; \nideally it would more clearly distinguish countries with unhelpful \ncurrency policies, from those which have taken a more measured course \nin managing their economies and currency. I would rather not resort to \nsanctions or countervailing duties, but the lack of progress on \ncurrency issues has made it appropriate to consider the steps set forth \nin this bill. While the final version of this legislation is not \nprecisely as I would have written it, it is appropriate for the \nCongress to be heard on this issue, so tonight I voted for this bill. I \nhope that in the near future, we can resolve all of our currency issues \nwith China and other nations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/11/senate-section/article/S6382-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6382-S6384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         AMERICAN JOBS ACT OF 2011--MOTION TO PROCEED--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we would yield back our time and use leader \ntime for a colloquy between the two of us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have done a lot of sparring back and\n\n[[Page S6383]]\n\nforth over the last week trying to get a vote on the President's so-\ncalled jobs proposal, and now we have before us cloture on the motion \nto proceed to the second version of the President's so-called jobs \nproposal. It strikes me it would be appropriate to try one more time to \nsee if we could get a vote on the actual proposal. So I have indicated \nto my good friend the majority leader that I am going to ask unanimous \nconsent that we vote on both the original President Obama jobs proposal \nand the revised Obama jobs proposal upon which we currently have \npending cloture on the motion to proceed. It strikes me this would \nexpedite the process. The President has been out on the campaign trail \nasking us to vote on his proposal and vote on it now without change. If \nthat is a vote our friends on the other side do not want to have, we \nwould be happy to have a vote on the President's proposal as changed, \nwhich I gather he also supports.\n  So bearing that in mind, I now ask unanimous consent that the cloture \nvote on the motion to proceed to S. 1660, the newly introduced jobs \nact, be vitiated, the Senate proceed to its consideration, the bill be \nread a third time, and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the \nbill, with no intervening action or debate; provided further that if \nthe bill does not receive 60 votes on passage, the bill then be placed \nback on the calendar.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that immediately following that vote, \nthe Senate proceed to the consideration of S. 1549, the President's job \npackage; that the bill be read the third time and the Senate proceed to \nvote on passage of the bill, with no intervening action or debate; \nprovided further, that if the bill doesn't receive 60 votes on passage, \nthe bill then be placed back on the calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, everyone \nshould understand, on Thursday, on this side we agreed to a vote on the \nPresident's jobs bill. There have been a number of things that have \noccurred since then.\n  We seek today, with this motion, to proceed to get to the jobs bill--\na good jobs bill. We seek to begin a legislative process. Senators from \nmy side and Senators from the other side--the Republican side--have \nsaid they want to be able to get a bill where they can offer ideas to \ncreate jobs. I think that is commendable. That is what we seek to do to \nget on this bill.\n  I ask my colleague, the Republican leader, if he might modify his \nrequest to allow the Senate to proceed to the bill so we might begin \nconsideration of an amendment to the bill. I also say, in response to \nmodification, I have said to my friends on the Republican side of the \naisle and on the Democratic side, as I said last Thursday, the \nPresident's original package we have talked about for some time. If \npeople want to vote on that, they can vote on that. I think it would be \nto everyone's best interest to move to proceed to this so we can make \nthis legislation even better than it now is. I ask for that \nmodification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Republican leader so modify his \nrequest?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I have been trying for a over a week to get a vote on \nthe President's so-called jobs proposal, which he has been asking us to \ngive him repeatedly. Our friends on the other side are not only \nobjecting to voting on the President's original jobs proposal but his \njobs proposal as modified.\n  The practical result, however, of voting for cloture on the motion to \nproceed, rather than going on and voting on the bill, as the President \nhas asked us to do on 12 occasions out on the campaign trail, is we \nwill not be able to proceed to one of the things that is rare here--we \nactually have a bipartisan agreement to go forward on these important \ntrade agreements, pass them tomorrow night, and then have the President \nof South Korea address a joint session of Congress. South Korea is one \nof our most important allies--probably the most important ally in Asia. \nWhy would we not just want to vote on the proposal tonight? I am sorry \nwe will not be able to do that.\n  I will continue to look for opportunities to give the President the \nvote he has asked for repeatedly--not a procedural vote but a real vote \non the matter he requested.\n  I object.\n  Mr. REID.

On this vote, the yeas are 50, nays are 49. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the vote by \nwhich cloture was not invoked.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I strongly oppose S. 1660, the American \nJobs Act of 2011.\n  I am eager to work with Members of both parties to find common ground \non policies that will help grow the economy at a time when our nation \ncontinues to struggle with high unemployment and low economic growth. \nTo be clear, there are certain proposals in the American Jobs Act that \nI would support individually, including an extension of the payroll tax \ncut, allowing businesses to fully expense the cost of acquiring new \ncapital, and a delay of the three percent withholding penalty on \ngovernment contractors. These provisions would provide piecemeal relief \nto the economy.\n  Unfortunately, the positive provisions in the American Jobs Act are\n\n[[Page S6384]]\n\novershadowed by a massive $453 billion tax hike that would be highly \ndamaging to the ability of businesses that pay individual tax rates to \nexpand operations, hire new workers and compete internationally. \nAccording to data from the Department of the Treasury, 80 percent of \ntaxpayers affected by this new 5.6 percent tax increase would be \nbusiness owners. Furthermore, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates \nthat 34 percent of business income would be ensnared by the job-\ndestroying tax increase in S. 1660.\n  Worse, if the 2001 tax relief expires as scheduled in 2013, this new \ntax surcharge would push the top marginal tax rate to nearly 50 percent \nwhen accounting for the new 3.8 percent Medicare tax on unearned income \nin the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It would also \nsharply increase taxes on capital gains and dividends investment, \nhurting small businesses and investors.\n  Small businesses have been burdened by more than $1 trillion new \ntaxes and penalties in the health care law and regulatory agencies have \nchurned out over 60,000 pages of new Federal regulations this calendar \nyear alone. Simply put, they cannot afford the burden of another tax \nhike from Washington under the guise of job creation.\n  This is why the Nation's leading business groups representing \nmillions of American business owners, including the National Federation \nof Independent Business and the National Association of Manufacturers, \nall strongly oppose the permanent tax hike in S. 1660. This is why a \ngrowing group of Democrats vocally oppose this legislation, and why I \noppose proceeding to it.\n  Since I joined the Senate 9 months ago, I have maintained my strong \nbelief that Democrats and Republicans should work together to pass \npolicies proven to boost economic growth like progrowth tax and \nregulatory reform, lowering barriers to free trade, and cutting \nspending to avert our looming debt crisis. Unfortunately, the huge tax \nincreases on job creators and more debt-financed stimulus spending in \nthe American Jobs Act would move our Nation in squarely the wrong \ndirection.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, this evening, I cast my vote in favor \nof the Senate moving forward with critical job-creation legislation. \nWith 61,000 Rhode Islanders and millions of Americans currently looking \nfor jobs, we must take swift action to help put people back to work. \nSadly, as they have all-too-many times this Congress, Republicans chose \nto obstruct our efforts by blocking us from even debating the American \nJobs Act.\n  This filibuster is particularly disappointing because the American \nJobs Act, as introduced in the Senate by Leader Reid, represents a \nbalanced and already-tested approach to job creation. Indeed, the bill \nincludes a host of provisions that have received wide bipartisan \nsupport in the past. It may not be the exact bill each of us would \ndraft on our own, but it is a thoughtful and reasonable place to begin \nworking on a Senate jobs plan.\n  I say the bill is ``balanced'' because it includes a full range of \njob-creating provisions from tax credits to help businesses hire, to \ninfrastructure programs that will put people to work updating and \nupgrading our roads, bridges, and schools.\n  In addition to being ``balanced,'' I say the American Jobs Act is \n``tested'' because it includes programs that have worked in the past. \nFor example, the Federal Highway Administration estimated that $1 \nbillion invested in our highways supports about 28,000 jobs. That means \nthat the President's proposed investment of $27 billion would generate \nor save over 750,000 jobs. In addition to the upfront investment, the \nbill would deposit another $10 billion in a National Infrastructure \nBank which could leverage the money with private investments to create \nhundreds of thousands of additional jobs. We know how well the National \nInfrastructure Bank would work from the experiences of local revolving \nfunds like Rhode Island's Clean Water Finance Agency.\n  We also know that funds provided by the bill would prevent hundreds \nof thousands of teachers, police officers, and firefighters from losing \ntheir jobs. According to the Department of Education, $10 billion in \nemergency funds provided last summer have already spared 114,000 \nteachers' jobs. The $35 billion included in the American Jobs Act would \nkeep hundreds of thousands of additional teachers and first responders \nfrom getting pink slips. A lot of small businesses count on teachers \nand firefighters and police officers with paychecks coming in to do \nbusiness.\n  We are not just talking about statistics in this debate. The millions \nof jobs that would be created or preserved under the American Jobs Act \nwould hit home for families who have been trying to find work for so \nlong.\n  Just last week, I held a telephone town hall with Rhode Islanders \nfrom all across our State. We took questions from folks on issues from \njobs to the future of Medicare and Social Security. There was one call \nin particular that really stuck with me. It was from a woman named \nDiane in Narragansett. Diane, a Marine veteran, and her husband are \nboth out of work and struggling to put food on the table for their \nthree young children. Her husband a trained heavy equipment operator \nand welder has taken temporary employment as a landscaper and a \nfisherman, but can not find a steady paycheck. They have missed bill \npayments and have struggled to keep a roof over their heads. On the \ncall Diane said, ``[o]ur dream of owning a house is shot out the window \n. . . [We] don't know where to go [We] don't know what else to do.'' \nDiane and her husband are hardworking people doing their best to \nsurvive in a frustratingly sluggish economic recovery. They are just \nasking for a fair chance to provide for their kids and reclaim their \nportion of the American dream. We owe it to Diane and her family to set \naside our differences and focus on getting something done to create \njobs for the American people. It is not too late for us to work \ntogether to help solve our Nation's jobs crisis. Let us cut the \npolitics and delay tactics and begin that critical work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/11/senate-section/article/S6384-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, today I join my colleagues and so many \naround the world in paying tribute to Apple chairman and cofounder \nSteve Jobs, the Silicon Valley pioneer who died at age 56 after a long, \nbrave fight with pancreatic cancer. I send my deepest condolences to \nSteve Jobs' family and friends on this devastating loss.\n  Steve was a California icon and one of America's greatest innovators \nwho changed the way we work, communicate, and live our daily lives. \nBillions of people around the world have been touched by the power of \nhis ideas.\n  His true genius lay in knowing what consumers wanted and needed \nbefore they themselves knew it, and then giving them simple, elegant \nproducts to meet those needs. Many of us who never knew we needed an \niPad or an iPod now can't do without them.\n  Steve was a Californian through and through: He was born in San \nFrancisco, raised in Los Altos, and changed the world from Cupertino. \nHe embodied California's entrepreneurial spirit of creativity and \noptimism. In the process, he created millions of jobs in industries \nthat he himself helped to create.\n  Even in the face of a deadly disease, Steve never lost his grace, his \nsense of humor, and his optimism. In a commencement address at Stanford \nUniversity in 2005, he talked openly about his illness and urged \ngraduates to devote their lives to following their passions. ``Your \ntime is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life,'' he \ntold them. ``Don't be trapped by dogma--which is living with the \nresults of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' \nopinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the \ncourage to follow your heart and intuition.''\n  These were the principles he lived by. This was the guiding \nphilosophy that helped create a revolution in communications. And these \nare the lessons that still inspire so many all across the world.\n  All of us are deeply grateful to Steve Jobs, who showed us once again \nhow one person really can change the world.\n\n[[Page S6385]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/11/senate-section/article/S6385-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                              IRAN CAPTIVE\n\n  Mr. Blunt. Mr. President, I draw the Senate's attention to a \ntroubling situation abroad. By now, many following the news have heard \nof the name Youcef Nadarkhani. Pastor Youcef is a Christian in Iran who \nhas been sentenced to death for refusing to deny his faith. He was \noriginally arrested in October 2009 while attempting to register his \nchurch. He allegedly questioned the Muslim monopoly on the religious \ninstruction of children in the state.\n  To Iran, his crime is his Christian faith and evangelism, and the \npunishment is death. For as many problems as we face in America, we are \nblessed that this is not one of them. The American Center for Law and \nJustice and other national groups have been diligently working on the \ncase since it was first reported earlier this year. At any moment, \nPastor Youcef could be executed without notice to his family or the \npublic. I would like to take this time to add my name to the list of \nthose calling for his immediate, unconditional release.\n  This past weekend, Iran began to claim that Pastor Youcef's crimes \nwere not of religion but of rape and threats to national security. \nThese new allegations appear to be a new and unfounded attempt to \njustify his execution. None of these crimes were mentioned in his trial \nover the past 2 years.\n  While ``religious freedom'' may be the law of the land in Iran, it is \ncertainly not the practice. This audience is well aware of the \npersecution of religious minorities and Christians abroad. We should \nnot forget the plight of religious minorities throughout this region, \nespecially the Coptic Christians in Egypt, Chaldo-Assyrian Christians \nin Iraq, the dwindling Christian population in the Holy Land, and other \nreligious minorities in the Middle East.\n  I believe we can and we must do more to advance religious freedom \nabroad. Earlier this year, in coordination with Congressman Frank Wolf \nin the House and my Senate colleague, Mr. Levin, I introduced the Near \nEast and South Central Asia Religious Freedom Act. The bill creates a \nSpecial Envoy on religious freedom in the State Department to monitor \nthe status of religious minorities in these particularly vulnerable \nregions. I am sincerely committed to this effort and believe that it is \nessential to promoting the God-given right to liberty around the world. \nI am hopeful that the Senate can soon join the House in passing this \nimportant legislation.\n  I ask that other Members of the Senate join me in this call to save \nPastor Youcef Nadarkhani's life and condemn Iran's denial of the \nuniversal right to religious freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/11/senate-section/article/S6385-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF THE WASHINGTON PARISH FAIR\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, located on the eastern edge of \nLouisiana, Washington Parish plays a central role in celebrating our \nState's unique culture and history. Every October, residents and \nleaders of the parish host the annual Washington Parish Fair, which \nmarks its 100th anniversary this month.\n  This quiet but remarkable parish is known for its agriculture, its \nscenic rivers, and its thriving workforce, which spans across a number \nof industries, including paper and timber production. Once the center \nof the dairy industry, the area boasts a relatively low unemployment \nrate, with nearly 75 percent of its workforce belonging to the \ncommunity's private sector.\n  The parish is also known for its genuine hospitality. Its residents \nvolunteer tirelessly for the annual Washington Parish Fair, which is \nbelieved to be the largest fair of its kind in the country. The 5-day \nevent, which began in 1911, now attracts families from all over the \nState. They spend the weekend enjoying the wide range of activities the \nfair has to offer--including a livestock show, a rodeo and carnival \nrides--while taking in the unique Louisiana scenery.\n  This popular event is a model of the community spirit and a prime \nexample of the cultural and economic advancement that can be achieved \nwhen neighbors work together for a common goal. Every year, Washington \nParish leaders and residents commit themselves to the success of the \nevent, and I commend them for their efforts to continue such a first-\nrate Louisiana tradition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/11/senate-section/article/S6385-3", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6385-S6386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CHILDHOOD OBESITY AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, as September ended, so did \nChildhood Obesity Awareness Month. While it is important to set aside a \nmonth for special attention to this epidemic, we must not forget that \nchildhood obesity is a year-round battle.\n  The facts about childhood obesity are startling. Obesity rates have \nmore than tripled in the last 30 years. In Ohio, more than 30 percent \nof children and adolescents are overweight or obese. Our children \nliving with obesity experience lifelong health problems, including type \n2 diabetes, heart problems, and bone and joint problems.\n  Combating childhood obesity might seem like an uphill battle, but \nwith national attention on the issue, we can meet this urgent need. And \ncommunities across Ohio and the Nation are doing their part. Public and \nprivate partnerships are joining forces to unite in the fight against \nchildhood obesity.\n  We see it with the U.S. Surgeon General's healthy youth for a healthy \nfuture initiative promoting healthy eating and physical activity to the \nDo Right! Campaign in communities in greater Cincinnati. We see it with \nLet's Move! events throughout the State, and collaborations between \nFederal and State governments and local communities, organizations, and \nindividuals.\n  Last year, the Senate passed landmark child nutrition legislation, \nthe Healthy, Hunger Free Kids Act, to help promote health and reduce \nchildhood obesity. This bill will improve the nutritional quality of \nschool meals through an increase in Federal reimbursement for school \nlunches. It also establishes national nutrition standards for all foods \nsold in schools so that vending machine food and snacks in the a la \ncarte line are healthy and nutritious. The Healthy, Hunger Free Kids \nAct will connect more children to healthy, locally grown produce \nthrough farm-to-school programs with the dual benefit of making sure \nchildren know how their food is grown and supporting Ohio farmers.\n  Also worth noting is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's, USDA, \nprogress in updating the nutrition standards for school meals so they \nare in line with current nutrition science. I commend the USDA for its \nefforts and urge it to finalize these new school lunch rules quickly so \nthat children across the country get the benefit of more fruits, \nvegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products.\n  I am also proud of the proactive efforts of Ohio hospitals in \nacknowledging their ability to combat the epidemic of childhood \nobesity.\n  The Cleveland Clinic's 5 to Go! Program is a comprehensive childhood \nwellness program. A partnership with family health centers, hospitals, \nschools, and neighborhood partners, 5 to Go! is working in Cuyahoga \nCounty to keep children healthy by encouraging them to get 1 hour of \nexercise a day and consume more fruits and vegetables in their meals.\n  University Hospitals Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital is a \nnational leader in addressing childhood diabetes--one of the more \nserious side effects of obesity. Through funding awarded by the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention, Rainbow is home to the Center of \nExcellence for Childhood Diabetes, Activity, and Nutrition. Rainbow is \nholding workshops to educate school nurses on childhood diabetes and \nhosting events with patients and their family focusing on breakthroughs \nin treatment and disease management.\n  By teaming up with the Kohl's Community Youth Fitness Program, Akron \nChildren's Hospital is teaching 8 to 13-year-olds about healthy fitness \nand eating habits through participation in activities and games.\n  In Toledo, ProMedica is focusing its attention on community-based \nnutrition programs. The Fields of Green Program includes everything \nfrom hydroponic and community gardens tended to by neighborhood \nchildren to a scholarship program for high school students. And, \nthrough a partnership with the YMCA and the United Way, the Summer \nFeeding Program has increased the number of meals served to children \nunder 18 from 1,500 to over 45,000 in only 1 year.\n\n[[Page S6386]]\n\n  Nationwide Children's in Columbus is an Ohio Healthy Weight Outcome \nmember, one of ten teams selected to participate in the National Health \nWeight Collaborative. Funded through the Affordable Care Act, the \nCollaborative's mission is to optimize health outcomes in children by \nimplementing a multilevel obesity prevention and treatment \ndemonstration project in a low-income area. Nationwide and the Ohio \nHealthy Weight Outcomes Program are implementing the Healthy \nNeighborhood Healthy Family (HNHF) zone with the goal of reducing the \nobesity rate in Columbus fifth graders by 10 percent in 5 years.\n  And Cincinnati Children's Hospital is working with both children and \ntheir parents to make simple yet effective dietary changes. The \nhospital is also working with local school districts to increase \nchildren's consumption of fruits and vegetables and replace sugary \ndrinks in school lunches. Additionally, through a partnership with U.S. \nBank and the Boys and Girls Club, over 3,000 children participated in \nCincinnati Children's kids' marathon--an incremental marathon over an \n8-week period that included running as well as nutrition and health \neducation.\n  September brought an end to Childhood Obesity Awareness Month, but I \nlook forward to continuing to work with schools and hospitals, teachers \nand parents, and all Ohioans to combat childhood obesity and ensure a \nhealthier future for our Nation's children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/11/senate-section/article/S6386-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ARTS AND SCIENCES\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and \ncongratulate the Pennsylvania Avenue African Methodist Episcopal, AME, \nZion Church in Baltimore as the congregation celebrates the church's \n170th anniversary. Founded on May 31, 1841, Pennsylvania Avenue AME \nZion Church has flourished for many decades under the guidance and \nspiritual leadership of its anointed pastors since it was founded on \nMay 31, 1841.\n  Records from 1904 reveal that Reverend B.J. Bolding and 200 church \nmembers purchased Zion's first building at 1125 Pennsylvania Avenue for \n$16,000. Reverend Bolding served for 27 years until Rev. George Marion \nEdwards became the pastor in May 1931. Twenty-eight years later, on \nOctober 4, 1959, Rev. Clinton Rueben Coleman was chosen as Zion's new \nspiritual leader and served during the tumultuous years of the civil \nrights movement. Reverend Coleman was responsible for the renovation of \nthe old Zion Church building and started the course toward planning and \nbuilding a new church building. On May 12, 1972, he was elected to the \nAME Zion Church's 12-member Board of Bishops, the denomination's 72nd \nbishop in succession.\n  In 1972, Rev. Marshall H. Strickland was selected to lead Zion, and \nthe journey continued towards constructing a new church. Three years \nlater, Reverend Strickland led the groundbreaking ceremony at the \nsouthwest corner of Pennsylvania Avenue and Dolphin Street. On Sunday, \nApril 10, 1977, after 16 years of vision, perseverance, and hard work, \na jubilant congregation marched into the new church building. Eleven \nyears later, on May 15, 1988, the mortgage note for the church was \nburned. On July 31, 1992, Reverend Strickland was elected the 88th \nbishop in succession in the AME Zion Church.\n  In September 1992, continuing the legacy of an historic church with \ngreat spiritual leaders, the Reverend Dr. Dennis Vernon Proctor was \nappointed pastor of the Pennsylvania Avenue AME Zion Church. Dr. \nProctor's leadership and pastoral abilities, steadfastly applied for \nover a decade, increased the church's membership to over 1,800 \ncongregants. After 16 years of faithful service to Zion Church, Dr. \nProctor was elected the 97th bishop in succession during the \nQuadrennial Convention in Atlanta, GA, on July 18, 2008.\n  On September 14, 2008, less than 2 months before our Nation elected \nits first African American President, the Right Reverend Warren M. \nBrown, presiding prelate of the Mid-Atlantic II Episcopal District, \nannounced the current pastor of the Pennsylvania Avenue AME Zion \nChurch, Rev. Lester Agyei McCorn, to a standing-room-only congregation.\n  Pennsylvania Avenue AME Zion Church, located in Baltimore's Upton \ncommunity, is committed to providing spiritual leadership and support \nto help people overcome the political, social, and educational \nstruggles affecting them in the communities that the church serves. It \nis a Kingdom-focused church, whose legacy continues with a renewed \nvision to make new disciples, help believers to mature in their faith, \nand multiply outreach and service ministries.\n  I encourage all Senators to join me in congratulating Pennsylvania \nAvenue AME Zion Church on its 170th anniversary and its even brighter \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/11/senate-section/article/S6386-3", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6386-S6387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DICK WILKERSON\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the \nachievements of one of South Carolina's most respected citizens.\n  Greenville, SC, is the home of Michelin's North American \nheadquarters. One of the largest tire manufacturers in the world, \nMichelin has had a presence in the state for over thirty years and \ncurrently employs nearly 8,000 South Carolinians. Michelin is known for \nits innovation and the quality of its products. It is also one of the \nfinest corporate citizens we have in South Carolina.\n  Dick Wilkerson, the current chairman and president of Michelin North \nAmerica, will retire at the end of 2011 after 31 years with the \ncompany, the last 3-plus years in his current role. Upon his \nretirement, he will become chairman emeritus of Michelin North America, \nin recognition of his remarkable career and strong and effective \nleadership during a very difficult economic time.\n  Under Dick's leadership, Michelin became the largest tire maker in \nNorth America by sales and has remained the most profitable tire maker \nin North America for 7 consecutive years. That is quite an achievement \ngiven the tough economic circumstances.\n  Wilkerson also led the creation of major community programs, \nincluding Michelin Development Upstate South Carolina and Michelin \nChallenge Education.\n  Michelin Development provides low interest loans and access to our \nconsiderable business expertise to create quality sustainable jobs and \npromote economic growth. To date, investments in Upstate South Carolina \ntotal more than $2 million, 33 loans have been supported, and more than \n750 potential jobs have been created inspiring new economic growth.\n  Michelin Challenge Education focuses on the support of public \nelementary schools located in close proximity\n\n[[Page S6387]]\n\nto major Michelin facilities. By forming a true partnership between \neach facility and its adopted school, Michelin provides support to meet \nthe specific needs of each school. Several of these include low-income \nschools receiving Federal title I funds. The program formalizes an \nopportunity for Michelin's nearly 8,000 South Carolina employees to \nmake a personal contribution to the improvement of public education \nthrough hands-on involvement. Michelin employees serve as mentors, \ntutors and volunteers.\n  Dick currently serves as chairman of the South Carolina State Chamber \nof Commerce Board of Directors. He also serves on the Clemson \nUniversity President's Advisory Board and the University of South \nCarolina National Advisory Council. Nationally, he serves on the board \nof the Rubber Manufacturers Association and Board of Directors of the \nYellowstone Park Foundation.\n  He is active in the Greenville, SC community, serving as chairman-\nelect of the United Way of Greenville County Board of Trustees. \nPreviously, Dick served as chair of the United Way of Greenville County \nfundraising campaign. He has served on the boards of the Greenville \nUrban League, the chamber of commerce, the University Center, and the \nGreenville Symphony.\n  Dick has been a true leader in the State's business community. \nMichelin has turned in strong financial results, which reflects their \nstrong commitment to their shareholders. Beyond that, is the company's \ncommitment to its employees and the fact that Michelin is a true \npartner with the communities where their employees live and operate \nmanufacturing facilities. Michelin is a superb example of how a good \ncorporate citizen behaves. We are proud of the fact that Michelin calls \nSouth Carolina ``home.''\n  Dick, congratulations to you on your 31 years with Michelin. Thank \nyou for your past contributions to South Carolina, and I look forward \nto continuing our work together to make South Carolina a great place to \nlive and work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/11/senate-section/article/S6387-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING HANNAH SOLOMON\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I come before you today with a \nheavy heart, as another of Alaska's treasured elders has passed. \nYesterday would have marked the 103rd birthday of Hannah Solomon, a \nrevered Athabascan elder and Gwich'in matriarch. Hannah passed away \npeacefully at her home in Fairbanks, September 16, 2011.\n  Grandma Hannah, as she was lovingly referred to, was surrounded by \nfamily and loved ones as she passed from this world. She spoke her last \nwords softly, saying to family in Gwich'in, her traditional language, \nthat it was time.\n  Hannah was known for her devotion to God. She was a very familiar \nface at St. Matthew's Episcopal Church in Fairbanks, and it is said \nthat she was the last person alive to remember the sound of \nEpiscopalian Archdeacon Hudson Stuck's voice. In the days following her \npassing, a red rose sat atop a crocheted pink and blue pillow in the \nempty pew seat where Hannah sat in devotion for so many years.\n  She was also well known for her beautiful and intricate beadwork; \nmany of her pieces can be seen in museum collections around the world. \nHannah was not only an artist but a culture bearer. She was born in the \nInterior of Alaska near the Porcupine River and raised 14 children in a \ntraditional subsistence lifestyle. With no running water or \nelectricity, the family enjoyed all the wealth their traditional \nhomelands offered and never considered themselves to be poor.\n  Hannah may be best remembered for her social activism. With the \nwellbeing of her Gwich'in people always in mind, she and her husband \nPaul Solomon, Sr., helped to form many Alaska Native organizations, \nincluding the Fairbanks Native Association and Denakkanaaga. Fluent in \nher Native language, Hannah also worked as one of the first early \nsocial workers in Alaska, helping to create services for those in need.\n  Her passing will leave a void in our hearts that is difficult to \nfill. With the passing of each Alaska Native elder we lose a connection \nto the past and our unique history. Hannah took her responsibility as a \nculture bearer very seriously, ensuring that future generations knew \nthe stories and traditions of the Gwich'in culture. She was a role \nmodel, matriarch, and a leader of exceptional courage and strength, \ninspiring people to appreciate and love one another.\n  I would like to offer Hannah's Solomon's family and countless friends \nmy heartfelt condolences. She served the Native people and our beloved \nState of Alaska brilliantly over the course of her entire life. It is \nmy hope that her extraordinary life will continue to serve as an \ninspiration to all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/11/senate-section/article/S6387-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING ERNEST HOUSE, SR.\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I honor of my \nfriend, Ernest House, Sr. I am deeply saddened by his death and I would \nlike to take a few minutes to speak in his honor.\n  Mr. House was a member of the Weeminuche Band of the Ute Mountain Ute \ntribe. He was born and raised in Mancos Canyon, CO, in what is now the \nUte Mountain Tribal Park in the Four Corners region of our State. Mr. \nHouse is the father of Michelle House, Jaque House Lopez, and Ernest \nHouse, Jr. He is the grandson of Chief Jack House, the Ute Mountain \nUte's last hereditary chair. Ernest House, Sr., held a prominent role \nin the tribe's leadership over the course of the last three decades, \nserving several times as chairman and also as a tribal council member. \nIn addition to his service with the tribe, he was also a veteran of the \nColorado Army National Guard of the Special Forces Airborne Group, and \nhe worked for the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the National Park \nService through the U.S. Department of the Interior.\n  I have admired Mr. House's leadership for many years. He was renowned \nacross Indian Country for his gentle but effective leadership. At the \nheart of all of his efforts was the goal of improving the lives of his \npeople, which he accomplished on a daily basis. His tireless advocacy \nfor tribal businesses and enterprises led to the completion of several \nbuilding projects, including the creation of the National Indian Health \nService's Tribal Epidemiology Center in New Mexico. His eloquent \ntestimony before Congress on the Dolores and Animas La Plata water \nprojects led to the creation of two water compacts that are critical to \nthe tribe's development. During the latter part of his career, Mr. \nHouse focused much of his energy on tribal safety, helping to increase \nthe tribal police force from two officers to more than a dozen.\n  Mr. House had a wide circle of friends within his tribal community, \nbut he was well respected throughout Colorado and Native American \ncommunities across our country. I can feel the sorrow of his friends \nand family as we collectively grieve for the loss of a truly visionary \nleader, a kind human being, and a wonderful friend. His legacy of \nworking across tribal, ethnic, and party lines is something we should \nall take to heart as we try to rise to the challenges before us.\n  We are all shocked by the sudden loss of someone so important to our \ncollective community. My uncle, Stewart Udall, served as Secretary of \nthe Interior under President Kennedy, and he was also a champion for \nthe rights of Native peoples. He once said that we are not measured by \nthe things we accomplish but by how we treat people. In both regards, \nMr. House was an outstanding person, and while he will be dearly \nmissed, his legacy of dedication to his people will live on. We will \nthink of him as we continue to strive to improve the quality of life \nfor native people everywhere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/11/senate-section/article/S6387-3", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6387-S6388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            STATUE UNVEILING\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today we remember John \nOtto and the contributions he made to one of our State's natural \ntreasures the Colorado National Monument.\n  One of western Colorado's most influential historical figures, a \ntrailblazer and ever an eccentric, he was unwavering in his commitment \nto opening up public lands for all people and generations to enjoy. \nOtto, a solitary man, took up residence in the commonly known Monument \nCanyon in 1906. There he began building the first trails in the area, \nworking with tenacious skill throughout the rocky spires and\n\n[[Page S6388]]\n\nsmooth-faced red rock canyons, which were created by millions of years \nof erosion.\n  Otto was among the first to truly appreciate the full beauty of this \nred-hued gem spanning thousands of acres across western Colorado lands. \nTo President Taft, Otto wrote a letter carrying a message of the unique \nwonders hidden just beyond the fruit orchards and small settlements of \nthe Grand Valley. His enthusiasm took hold and spread, and President \nTaft established the Colorado National Monument with the issuance of a \nproclamation in 1911.\n  Otto singlehandedly scaled rock faces, hauled timber, and blasted \nthrough layers of Wingate and Entrada sandstone to carve out what would \nbe the monument's first trails, and for $1.00 a month he would be the \npark's first custodian, ushering in people from every corner of the \nState and beyond to experience its natural grandeur.\n  This year we celebrate the monument's centennial, and it is only \nfitting that John Otto be a part of the occasion. With the unveiling of \nhis statue, the last in a series of five Legends of the Grand Valley, \nhis story and that of the monument will be preserved in the heart of \ndowntown Grand Junction for generations to come. I am proud, and \nColorado can be proud, of the stewardship and dedication Otto modeled \nin his journey to opening up this special place in the West.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/11/senate-section/article/S6388-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/11/senate-section/article/S6388-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/11/senate-section/article/S6388-3", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:04 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2681.
