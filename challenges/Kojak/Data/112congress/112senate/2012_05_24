Mr. President, we are now considering S. 3187, the FDA user \nfees legislation. There is an agreement now reached to complete this \nlegislation today. Under the agreement, debate time will expire at 2 \np.m. today, but if we are able to yield back time, up to 12 rollcall \nvotes could begin earlier in order to complete action on the bill and \nto have a couple of votes in relation to the student loan interest rate \nhike. We will notify everyone if time is yielded back, but people \nshould be aware of the need to come here--we hope before noon--to have \na couple of votes. There will be no votes between 1 and 2 o'clock \nbecause of meetings both sides have.\n  We also worked out a tentative agreement yesterday on flood \ninsurance, which is important to 6 million people. We need to get that \ndone today also. I hope we can get that done.\n  I was pleased yesterday to reach an agreement with the Republican \nleader on how to move forward with this FDA bill. This legislation \naddresses shortages of lifesaving medicines by establishing a protocol \nto accomplish just that. It will ensure that FDA resources are there to \napprove new drugs and medical devices quickly and efficiently. We are \ngoing to consider, as I indicated, a number of relevant amendments. I \nam optimistic we will pass this strong, bipartisan bill.\n  This week has been productive. We have not had to break or try to \nbreak a single Republican filibuster. That is a good day in Washington. \nIt doesn't happen very often. I hope it happens more often. If this \ntrend continues, we could return to the way we used to be; that is, do \nwhat is good for the country and not be trying to stop everything that \ncomes along.\n  I am also hopeful that this week the Senate will be able to find a \npath ahead to temporarily renew the Flood Insurance Program, as I have \nalready indicated. We need a long-term solution to this problem. We \nhave about 40,000 loans every day that are approved, and they are \napproved because you can make that check that you do have flood \ninsurance. If there is no way to buy flood insurance, you cannot make \nthat check in that box and you cannot get a loan. This would be \ndevastating to our fragile economy, so we have to\n\n[[Page S3536]]\n\nget this done and get it done before the end of this month.\n  The collaborative work on that measure and the FDA bill renews my \nhope that Congress will reach an agreement to prevent student loan \ninterest rates from doubling for 7 million young men and women. We will \nmove to two proposals to freeze student interest rates at their current \nlevels. The Republican proposal is paid for by stripping Americans of \nlifesaving preventive health care. I can't say it any more clearly than \nthat. It would be a shame to use that pay-for. That program has already \nbeen stripped bare. To take any more from it would really hurt the \nhealth of America. Our proposal is paid for by closing a loophole that \nallowed wealthy Americans to dodge their taxes. I am certainly aware of \nhow things work around here. Neither one of these is going to pass, I \nam sorry to say. These two proposals were not created equal. But I hope \na few reasonable Republicans will join with us. We should not \nput Americans' health at risk. We need to come to an agreement on the \nstudent loan issue. We only have until the end of June to do this.\n\n  I also hope to resolve an issue dealing with paycheck fairness over \nthe next work period. In addition to that, we are going to deal with \nthe farm bill, flood insurance, as I have talked about, a small \nbusiness tax relief program, cybersecurity, and some appropriations \nbills.\n  In the last Congress we passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, \nnamed after a stalwart woman from the South who was in effect cheated \nout of pay she deserved. She did the same work as men for many years \nbut didn't get the same money. She sought redress in the courts, and \nthey said: No, you can't do that; you should have done that when you \nfirst started working there. She didn't know she was being cheated at \nthat time. We changed the law. Now people in the same situation as \nLilly Ledbetter are not going to be bound by some phony set of rules \nthat prevent someone from filing a lawsuit when they have been \naggrieved.\n  While the wage gap has narrowed in the five decades since Congress \ndeclared women entitled to equal pay for equal work, gender \ndiscrimination remains a serious problem in the workplace. The work we \ndid with Lilly Ledbetter was the single most important piece of \nlegislation to ensure women have a chance to protect themselves. It is \nsomething we should have done before. We didn't. It is done now. Women \nmake up about half of today's workforce. More than half the students in \nour law schools are women. More than half the students in medical \nschools are women. They still, though, will only earn 77 cents on every \ndollar compared to their male colleagues for doing the same work, and \nwith an increasing number of women leading American households, this is \na problem that affects children and families across the country.\n  The legislation, led by Senator Barbara Mikulski, the Paycheck \nFairness Act, is a logical extension of protections under the Equal Pay \nAct. It will help close the gap by empowering women to negotiate for \nequal pay and creating strong incentives for employers to obey the laws \nalready in place.\n  Republicans deny waging war on women. Yet they have launched a series \nof attacks on women's access to health care and contraception this \nyear. Now they have an opportunity to back up their excuses with \naction, and we are going to give them that opportunity. We hope they \nwill join us and send a clear message that America values the \nincredible contributions women make every day.\n  Would the Chair be so kind as to announce the work we are going to do \nhere today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/24/senate-section/article/S3536-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this is not a new issue. This has been \nbefore this body on several occasions. I want to assure my colleagues \nthat if the lobbyists for the pharmaceutical companies in this town are \nable to block this, we will be revisiting this issue. This is an issue \nof fundamental fairness and decency and giving Americans the \nopportunity to have access to very important medication that in many \ncases is lifesaving. It has been blocked by one of the most powerful \nlobbies in Washington, that of the pharmaceutical companies.\n  For years, along with many other Senators and the current occupant of \nthe White House--the President of the United States, when he was a U.S. \nSenator, supported this amendment. I would love to see the \nadministration weigh in and take the same position that then-Senator \nObama took on this issue of basic and fundamental decency and fairness \nto people who are badly in need of medicine to, in many cases, \nliterally save their lives.\n  Industry opponents of the comprehensive importation proposals have \nfound various ways to confuse the issue, raise red herrings about \nsafety, or cut secret deals to block passage of reasonable and widely \nsupported prescription drug importation programs.\n  Let me give an example--this recently came up--of the activities of \nthe pharmaceutical companies in the formulation of ObamaCare. ``GOP \nprobe uncovers deal between Obama and drug companies,'' by Philip \nKlein, the senior editorial writer of the Washington Examiner.\n\n       Three years ago, President Obama cut a secret deal with \n     pharmaceutical company lobbyists to secure the industry's \n     support for his national health care law. Despite Obama's \n     promises during his campaign to run a transparent \n     administration, the deal has been shrouded in mystery ever \n     since. But internal emails obtained by House Republicans now \n     provide evidence that a deal was struck and GOP investigators \n     are promising to release more details in the coming weeks.\n       What the hell?'' White House Deputy Chief of Staff Jim \n     Messina, who is now Obama's campaign manager, complained to a \n     lobbyist for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of \n     America (PhRMA) in January 15, 2010 email. ``This wasn't part \n     of our deal.''\n       This reference to ``our deal'' came two months before the \n     final passage of Obamacare in an email with the subject line, \n     ``FW: TAUZIN EMAIL.''\n       At the time Billy Tauzin was president and CEO of PhRMA--\n\n  And I might add, one of the highest paid lobbyists in history, \nmillions of dollars--\n\n     the e-mail was uncovered as a part of Obama's closed-door \n     health care negotiations that was launched by the House \n     Energy and Commerce Committee oversight panel:\n       ``In the coming weeks the Committee intends to show what \n     the White House agreed to do as part of its deal with the \n     pharmaceutical industry and how the full details of this \n     agreement were kept from both the public and the House of \n     Representatives,'' the committee's Republican members wrote \n     in a memo today.\n       On June 20, 2009, Obama released a terse 296-word statement \n     announcing a deal between pharmaceutical companies and the \n     Senate that didn't mention any involvement by the White \n     House.\n       ``The investigation has determined that the White House, \n     primarily through Office of Health Reform Director Nancy Ann \n     DeParle and Messina, with involvement from Chief of Staff \n     Rahm Emmanuel, was actively engaged in these negotiations \n     while the role of Congress was limited,'' the committee \n     members wrote. For example, three days before the June 20th \n     statement, the head of PhRMA--\n\n  That is Mr. Tauzin--\n\n     promised Messina, ``we will deliver a final yes to you by \n     morning.''\n       Meanwhile, Ms. DeParle all but confirmed that half of the \n     Legislative Branch was shut out in an e-mail to a PhRMA \n     representative: ``I think we should have included the House \n     in the discussions, but maybe we never would have gotten \n     anywhere if we had.''\n\n  What went on in the formulation of ObamaCare is still one of the \nworst, sleaziest exercises I have seen in my many years here, and this \ninvolvement by the pharmaceutical companies was probably the most \negregious. All this amendment does is allow U.S. consumers who need \nmore affordable prescription drug options to either go without their \nmedications or pay higher prices than they could get from legitimate \nCanadian pharmacies. But that is not a reason. It is not a reason for \nus to stop fighting for those in the United States who need more \naffordable prescription medications.\n  There are Americans in this country today who cannot afford their \nmedications. They have a choice between eating or taking their \nprescription drugs. Meanwhile, there is a way for them to get much \ncheaper drugs, and this amendment does that.\n  We will hear from the pharmaceutical company supporters in the Senate \nwho will talk about safety and how Canadians don't have the same \nstandards we do. Really? Do we really believe the Canadian regulations \nand oversight are any better or worse than the United States? To ensure \nthat U.S. patients have at least one option, this amendment takes a \nvery narrow approach to safe importation by focusing on legitimate \nCanadian pharmacies.\n  Under this amendment the Secretary of Health and Human Services will \ncertify ``approved Canadian pharmacies'' based on certain safety and \nquality criteria. To ensure that patients are not exposed to unsafe \nmedications ``approved Canadian pharmacies'' can only sell drugs to \nU.S. customers that are the same as U.S. approved drugs. To protect \nU.S. patients against rouge distributors, a list of approved Canadian \npharmacies must be published by the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices so Americans know which Canadian pharmacies are legitimate.\n  The cost of health care, including prescription drugs, continues to \nincrease. However, there is nothing in the underlying FDA bill that \nwill bring down the cost of prescription drugs. I wonder if the bill \nshould be enacted when it doesn't do anything to address costs. The \nquality of pharmaceuticals in this country is outstanding, and I \nrecognize that. But don't we all know how expensive it is?\n  For example, don't we know that in the United States of America, \nNexium, 20-milligram, 30 tabs, is $195.99. The Canadian brand is \n$108.55, and Canadian generic is $69. For Plavix, the U.S. brand is \n$195; the Canadian brand, $132.\n  I am sure many Americans whose health coverage does not include these \nvery expensive pharmaceuticals would be eager to take advantage of the \nsame quality brand of prescription drugs that are available at these \npharmacies in Canada.\n  As we all know, unemployment remains over 8 percent, and millions of \nfamilies have mothers and fathers who remain unemployed or \nunderemployed and have no health insurance coverage. But the unemployed \nand uninsured still have health conditions, and they need medications. \nMillions continue to search for more affordable ways to get their \nneeded prescription drugs.\n  Unfortunately, in my State many of my fellow citizens who cannot \nafford it go to Mexico to get drugs, and I cannot guarantee what they \npurchase there will always be what it is purported to be. That is not a \ncriticism of my friends south of the border. But the fact is in Canada \nthey have the same kind of process we do. Despite there being no \nofficial program to import medications from Canada, approximately 1 \nmillion U.S. consumers use\n\n[[Page S3538]]\n\ntheir own money to safely get their medications from legitimate \nCanadian pharmacies.\n  In Arizona, over 20,000 patients purchase their medications safely \nfrom Canadian pharmacies. In Florida over 85,000 patients purchase \ntheir medications safely from Canadian pharmacies. A recent study from \nRoger Bate, an AEI scholar, confirms that in drugs dispensed from \nlegitimate Canadian pharmacies there was no failure of authenticity \nbetween drug samples obtained online from U.S. pharmacies compared to \nthe same drug from Canadian pharmacies. Within the verified pharmacies \nU.S. prices on average were 52.5 percent higher than Canadian pharmacy \nprices. In other words, the drugs from Canadian pharmacy sites are the \nsame dosage, form, and potency as drugs in the United States, only much \nless expensive.\n  The drugs are the same as I mentioned. This amendment doesn't \nauthorize insurance companies, huge pharmacy chains, or drug \nwholesalers to import massive quantities into the U.S. system. This is \nabout safely allowing uninsured, unemployed, and the underemployed to \nindividually import these drugs they need.\n  So, please, somebody explain to me how we tell the struggling family \nwho needs their medications that they cannot use their own money to get \nthe same drug from legitimate Canadian pharmacies where the costs can \nbe more than 50 percent lower than U.S. prices. It is not about the \nalarms of safety because this amendment requires the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to promulgate regulations permitting \nindividuals to safely import medications from Canada, and the following \nsafety criteria must be met for a patient to import drugs from FDA-\napproved Canadian pharmacies: The prescribed drug must be dispensed by \na licensed Canadian pharmacist; the prescribed drug must be for \npersonal use in quantities that don't exceed a 90-day supply; the \nprescribed drug must be dispensed in accordance with a valid \nprescription issued by a physician licensed to practice in the United \nStates; the imported drug must have ``the same active ingredient or \ningredients, route of administration, dosage form, and strength as a \nprescription drug approved by the Secretary.''\n\n  The amendment recognizes that approved Canadian pharmacies meeting \nsafety criteria can and should provide needed alternatives to U.S. \npatients using their own money to affordably obtain their medications. \nThe Secretary is required to publish on the FDA Web site a list of \n``approved Canadian pharmacies'' that meet the following stringent \ncriteria: The pharmacy has been in existence for 5 years prior to \nenactment of the program and has a purpose other than to participate in \nthe U.S.-Canadian safe drug importation program; the pharmacy operates \nin accordance with provincial pharmacy rules and regulations; the \npharmacy complies with all inspection and data reporting procedures; \nthe pharmacy agrees that labs approved by the Secretary shall be used \nto conduct product testing to determine the safety and efficacy of \nsample pharmaceutical products; the pharmacy does not resell products \nfrom online pharmacies located outside Canada to consumers in the \nUnited States.\n  Safe drug importation is a bipartisan issue. People in all of our \nStates are still struggling with family budgets, and the Senate cannot \ndo anything to give patients more choices about where they can get \ntheir needed drugs because the drug industry opposes allowing \nindividual Americans to use their own money to safely get the same \ndrugs from Canada, and it doesn't make sense.\n  Just a word about the types of medications that are eligible. I have \nbeen asked by colleagues whether biologic medicines can be part of the \nprogram. The answer is not unless they can be safely imported under the \nprovisions of the amendment and regulations issued by the Secretary.\n  The amendment doesn't discriminate against the type of conditions or \nmedicines that patients should be able to safely import under this \nprogram. Not all biologics are the same. Some biologic medicines are \navailable in capsules; others are injectable medications that require \nrefrigeration. Some injectables don't require refrigeration and are \nshipped to patients throughout the United States every day.\n  I don't believe U.S. patients should be necessarily prevented from \nsaving money on biologics. If a biologic medicine cannot meet the \nvarious safety provisions in the amendment, it should not be eligible. \nIf it can meet the requirements of the amendment, then a biologic can \nbe available to U.S. patients.\n  If the past is a prologue, then obviously this amendment will go \ndown. Then after this amendment is rejected, I hope none of my \ncolleagues have any curiosity about the way the American people feel \nabout us; about the incredible, inordinate, illegitimate, outrageous \ninfluence of the pharmaceutical companies in America over the average \nAmerican citizen. American citizens should be able to purchase \npharmaceuticals from an approved pharmacy in Canada that many times is \nsaving them half the money.\n  I am sure the distinguished chairman, my friend from Iowa, knows how \nmany families do not have prescription drug coverage who are making a \nchoice today between eating and medicine. What are we going to do? We \nare going to turn down this commonsense amendment.\n  Congratulations ahead of time to the corrupt pharmaceutical companies \nand their influence in the United States Senate and Capitol.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand the Republican leader is \nabout to come to the floor to give his leader remarks.\n  I just wish to let Senators know we are moving ahead on the bill. \nSenator McCain just brought up his amendment and spoke about it. I know \nthere are some who want to speak in opposition to the McCain amendment. \nWe still have amendment No. 2111 by Senator Bingaman to be called up. \nWe have two amendments, No. 2146 and No. 2145, by Senator Portman that \nneed to be called up. I ask Senators to please come over and call up \ntheir amendments so we can debate them and move ahead to expeditiously \nvoting on those amendments and final passage of the bill.\n  I see the Republican leader is on the floor, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I think we are under a time agreement \non the bill; is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The leader is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I wish to proceed under my leader time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has that right.\n\n\n                      Student Loan Interest Rates\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today we will once again attempt to \nprevent student loan interest rates from going up. This problem could \nhave been solved literally weeks ago, but our friends on the other side \nwere not interested in solving the problem; they wanted a scapegoat \nmore than a solution.\n  So this afternoon we will vote on two different ways of addressing \nthe issue. The Democratic plan is designed to fail. In order to cover \nthe cost of a temporary rate freeze that both parties actually want, \nthey propose to divert $6 billion from Medicare and to raise taxes on \nsmall businesses, hurting the very companies we are counting on to hire \ntoday's college graduates. They have known for months that we would not \nsupport this tax hike and that it couldn't pass this Chamber or the \nHouse of Representatives. It has already failed, but they are proposing \nit anyway, for a second time.\n  If our Democratic friends would allow it, the chairman and ranking\n\n[[Page S3539]]\n\nmember could write a bill that could actually pass. But since passage \nisn't their goal, our friends on the other side huddled behind closed \ndoors, out of sight of the public and the press, and produced the tax \nhike instead of letting the committee actually do its work.\n  We already know how this story is going to end. We know exactly, \nalready, how the story will end. So why are the Democrats forcing us to \nvote on their failed proposal yet again? Because, as I have said, they \nare more interested in drawing our opposition--of trying to create a \nbad guy--than in actually solving the problem.\n  When it comes to college graduates today, the bigger issue is the \nPresident's economic agenda which has created an environment in which \nmost of them can't find a decent job. So I can understand why our \nDemocratic friends want to change the subject, but if we are actually \ngoing to do something to solve the problem, we are going to need to get \npast the political theatrics.\n  If Senate Democrats reject the bipartisan fix the House already \npassed--one that doesn't raise taxes or divert a single dollar away \nfrom Medicare and is an offset they have used themselves before--then I \nhope they will turn around and work with us on a bipartisan fix that \ndoesn't tax small businesses--a proposal that is actually designed to \npass and become law.\n  But let's be clear about something. The real issue isn't the fact \nthat certain students are going to see an interest rate hike because we \nwill address that concern; it is that so many young people today can't \nfind a job that will enable them to pay off their loans in the first \nplace. That is the much larger problem. The solution is a progrowth \nagenda that would make it easier for U.S. businesses to hire, not a tax \nhike that will actually make it harder for them to hire.\n  In the short term, Republicans are ready to work to offer this \ntemporary relief, but we are still waiting on the Democratic leadership \nto propose a solution of their own that can actually pass either one or \ntwo Chambers of Congress.\n  I would, once again, urge the President to get involved. If the \nPresident has time to run around to late-night comedy shows and college \ncampuses talking about this issue, then he can pick up the phone and \nwork out a solution with Democrats in the Senate.\n  Last week at the White House, I pressed the President to get involved \nin order to prevent the student interest rates from going up--a goal we \nall share. Think about it. If the President wants to pass this bill so \nbadly, then why on Earth hasn't he picked up the phone and called the \nchairman or ranking Republican of the relevant committee? As with so \nmany pressing issues, the President has not led on this issue. He has \ncampaigned on it, but he has not worked to actually fix it.\n  The American people are tired of the posturing and the games. It is \ntime for the President to lead. It is time for Senate Democrats to stop \nthe political theater and to find a real solution.\n\n\n                         Thanking Senator Enzi\n\n  Mr. President, on another matter, I wish to take a moment to thank my \ngood friend, the senior Senator from Wyoming, Mike Enzi, for the work \nhe has done shepherding the FDA bill through the markup and across the \nSenate floor. This is an incredibly complex piece of legislation that \nstrikes a difficult balance of protecting consumers while avoiding the \nstifling regulation that slows the process of bringing lifesaving drugs \nand devices to market.\n  Throughout a lengthy process, Mike has shown the command of complex \ntopics, steady leadership, and interest in his colleagues' priorities \nthat have characterized his tenure at the HELP Committee. For that, \nthose of us on this side of the aisle would like to thank him very \nmuch.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n                       Specialist David W. Taylor\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to address one other matter. I \nhave a sad task today of informing my colleagues that a valued and \nhonorable Kentuckian who enlisted in the U.S. Army has fallen in the \nperformance of his duty. On March 29, 2012, SPC David W. Taylor of \nDixon, KY, died from injuries sustained in an accident at an \nammunitions supply point in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan. He was 20 \nyears old.\n  For his service in uniform, Specialist Taylor received several \nawards, medals, and decorations, including the Army Commendation Medal, \nthe Army Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the \nAfghanistan Campaign Medal with Bronze Service Star, the Global War on \nTerrorism Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, the Overseas Service \nRibbon, the NATO Medal, the Parachutist Badge, and the Overseas Service \nBar.\n  After his tragic death at entirely too young an age, one of \nSpecialist Taylor's commanders, Sergeant Addington, delivered a tribute \nto his fallen brother in arms. This is what he said:\n\n       When his country called for young lives to offer themselves \n     up for the preservation of freedom, young David Taylor \n     answered the call and said, ``Here am I, take me.'' \n     Specialist Taylor was my soldier, my battle buddy, and my \n     friend. He was a fast learner and my greatest student. He \n     sacrificed himself so we might be free.\n\n  Before he was a soldier, his mother Sarah Taylor recalled that David \nwas a compassionate, dedicated young man. From a young age, he was \nalways looking for ways to help others. Sarah says of her son: ``One \nChristmas he had received a large amount of gifts.''\n  David asked his parents ``if he could give some of his gifts to a \nclassmate of his who he knew would not receive many items.''\n  David was a great athlete who played football and soccer and ran \ntrack. He loved to hunt and hunted turkey and deer, but his real \npassion was for duck hunting. He had many friends, was the life of the \nparty, and he was popular with the girls. David ``would change outfits \nmultiple times before going to school, as his hair and clothes had to \nbe perfect,'' Sarah says.\n  David was also very dedicated to physical fitness. He worked out \nmultiple times a week to stay in shape. Perhaps that is because young \nDavid knew his body was his instrument, and he had made up his mind to \njoin the military by age 14.\n  David's high school did not have an ROTC program, so David worked \nhard to graduate 6 months early and eagerly enlisted. He skipped both \nthe prom and graduation to take up his more important pursuit, \nenlisting in January 2010. He even waived his signing bonus saying, \n``It is every young man's duty to serve.''\n  David planned to make the military his career and hoped to go into \nthe medical field. He dedicated himself to the military handbook and \ndoing everything ``by the book.'' He went on to serve as a paratrooper \nin a parachute infantry regiment, one of the most demanding specialties \nin the Army.\n  LT Eric Fitzgerald was Specialist Taylor's platoon leader. He says:\n\n       David was one of the most outstanding paratroopers in the \n     whole platoon, just striving to be the best. When you wanted \n     something done, when you wanted it done right, you went to \n     Taylor for it.\n\n  CPT Brian Bifulco, David's company commander, concurs:\n\n       It was evident since the day I met him that David had all \n     the qualities desirable in a paratrooper: Smart, aggressive, \n     committed, and reliable. He displayed them readily in \n     everything he did.\n\n  David maintained his rigorous workout schedule in the Army by \nfollowing the Crossfit physical fitness programs 5 to 6 days a week so \nhe could excel at the Army's physical fitness test. He could run his 2-\nmile fitness test in a full minute faster than anyone else in his \nplatoon. Specialist Taylor was assigned to D Company, 2nd Battalion, \n508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division, based out of \nFort Bragg, NC. He deployed to Afghanistan for Operation Enduring \nFreedom in February of this year for what would be his first and only \ndeployment.\n  David's fellow soldiers from his platoon named the small gym in their \nAfghanistan outpost in his honor as a remembrance of David's commitment \nto excellence. Nearly every soldier in the platoon wears a metal \nbracelet honoring Specialist Taylor. SFC Russ Kelley had this to say:\n\n       For many of the guys, this is the first friend they've ever \n     lost to combat. They wear the bracelets to remember.\n\n  At this time we are thinking of SPC David W. Taylor's family and his \nfriends as I recount his story for the Senate, including his mother \nSarah Taylor, his grandmother Laura Klutey,\n\n[[Page S3540]]\n\nand many other beloved family members and friends. David was preceded \nin death by his father Kevin Taylor.\n  David's mother Sarah says David loved the Army and was excited to be \nin Afghanistan.\n  Sergeant Addington remembers:\n\n       David seemed to live for the job, and while others would \n     whine and complain in the field, David would just sling up \n     his hammock and settle in. He was at home in the woods, a \n     natural outdoorsman.\n       David, who grew up in the woods, fit in perfectly. He \n     seemed born to do this job, and I felt sorry for any Taliban \n     that he was bound to run into in Afghanistan. The Taliban got \n     lucky this time.\n\n  Even if that is the case, the tragedy of Specialist Taylor's death is \ncertainly not lucky for anyone else, most of all not for the family he \nhas left behind or his friends and fellow soldiers.\n  I know it is small solace in place of what they have lost, but I want \nthem to know this Senate holds SPC David W. Taylor in the highest \nregard for his service on behalf of our country. We are honored, just a \nfew days before Memorial Day, to recognize his enormous sacrifice on \nbehalf of this Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr President, I rise in strong support of the \nunderlying bill we are debating, the Food and Drug Administration \nSafety and Innovation Act.\n  This legislation, which has been the model of bipartisanship and \neffective legislating on the part of Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member \nEnzi, is critically important to the people of New Jersey and the \nNation.\n  This bill is about more than drug safety. It is about more than \nprotecting patients. It is about improving the approval process to \nspeed access to new lifesaving, life-enhancing drugs and devices, and \nmaking sure the FDA is a partner in the production of safe and \neffective products.\n  This bill does this and accomplishes several key goals that are \ncritically important to our Nation's health care system. Not only does \nit reauthorize the key user fee agreements for prescription drugs and \nmedical devices, but it establishes agreements for generic drugs and \ngeneric biologic drugs called biosimilars.\n  Together, these user fee agreements will provide the FDA with the \nresources necessary to improve the drug and device approval process to \nmore quickly and efficiently bring new products to market. It will \nenhance communication between manufacturers and the agency to foster a \nmore cooperative environment, and it will allow for better and more \nthorough postmarket reviews to ensure continued patient safety and \nproduct efficacy.\n  There is more to this bill than the FDA user fees.\n  It permanently reauthorizes two vital programs that are a lifeline to \nour Nation's children--the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act and \nthe Pediatric Research Equity Act, which are incredibly important to \nour children. It helps reduce and mitigate the ongoing problem of drug \nshortages we have heard about throughout the country. It provides for \nenhancements to the prescription drug supply chain and increases the \naccountability and transparency of the Food and Drug Administration.\n  It is good for children. It is good for business. It is good for \npatients. It makes the FDA a more effective partner in the process, and \nit demonstrates that we can reach across the aisle and work together to \ntackle tough issues and find solutions that benefit the people we \ncollectively represent.\n  This just touches the surface of what this bill will accomplish. \nHowever, this incredibly hard work could very easily be unraveled by \nsome of the amendments being considered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2107\n\n  It seems that, once again, despite the countless times--the countless \ntimes--the Senate has rejected the policy my friend from Arizona \npursues, he has brought us an amendment that I believe puts Americans \nat risk, undermines FDA's authority, and would have a devastating \nripple effect throughout our country's drug supply by allowing \nuntraceable foreign pharmaceuticals into our country.\n  This amendment would ostensibly only allow drugs from Canada into the \nUnited States. However, nothing in the amendment comes close to \nensuring that is the case. In fact, this amendment would easily allow \nWeb-based pharmacies within Canada to provide untraceable, \nunaccountable drugs from all over the globe into the U.S. market \nwithout any FDA oversight whatsoever.\n  This amendment does not provide the FDA with any additional resources \nto monitor the drugs coming in from Canada, and even the Canadian \nauthorities have said they cannot be expected to monitor all the drugs \ncoming through their country and into ours. Once one of those drugs \nhits and causes consequences to some family, then we will all be \nrunning and saying: How did we allow that to happen?\n  The Senate has soundly and repeatedly voted against this type of drug \nimportation because we understand the implications it has on bringing \ncounterfeit and dangerous products into our Nation. As we work to \nstrengthen the FDA, I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing this \namendment, which would significantly weaken the agency and put \nAmericans at risk.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2109\n\n  Additionally, I wish to address another critically important issue \nbrought up by my friend from Vermont. The Sanders amendment would lead \nto a radical change in how our Nation's biotech and pharmaceutical \nindustry achieves the process of bringing lifesaving, life-enhancing \ndrugs into the marketplace.\n  I certainly respect the passion for the issues he pursues. But there \nare over 200,000 people in New Jersey who work in the biopharmaceutical \nindustry every day who take pride in the work they do creating \nbreakthrough, lifesaving, life-enhancing drugs, and I take issue with \nthis characterization of an industry which is responsible for some of \nthe world's most important medical breakthroughs that have saved \nmillions of lives. If you are one of those people waiting for one of \nthose drugs to come to the marketplace, hoping that for your mother's \nAlzheimer's--the Alzheimer's that took my mother's life--we will \nfinally have a breakthrough; that for your husband with Parkinson's, we \nwill finally have a breakthrough; that for your loved one with cancer, \nwe will finally have a breakthrough, you want to see that come to the \nmarketplace.\n  This industry is responsible for finding the cures and treatments for \ndiseases that kill people and destroy family incomes. This is the \nindustry that has more than 1,600 active clinical trials in New Jersey \non drugs to treat cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, \nmental and behavior disorders, and, especially important to me \npersonally, trials for drugs treating Alzheimer's and other forms of \ndementia. Families look forward to those breakthroughs coming to the \nmarket to help cure their loved ones.\n  This work is what keeps our Nation competitive and on the cutting \nedge of medical science, providing billions of dollars in economic \nimpact annually--roughly $900 billion nationally and more than $35 \nbillion in New Jersey--and it provides countless people across the \nglobe with lifesaving medications.\n  The amendment being offered could have a chilling effect on all \nthis--all the hope for new treatments and perhaps new cures for \ndiseases, having an opportunity for that to be turned around, to stop \nhaving those families lose a loved one who succumbs to a disease, \nruining countless lives. It has the potential to dry up investment in \nthe next cure and severely curtail the number of high-skill, high-\npaying jobs and billions of dollars in economic investment in \nthe biopharmaceutical industry.\n\n  I know my friend from Vermont wants to prevent fraudulent behavior, \nand I wholeheartedly agree that bad actors who willfully commit fraud \nneed to be punished, which is why we have the most incredible, stiff \ncivil and criminal penalties in current law to prosecute those who \ncommit fraud. But ultimately taking away the incentives we have in \nplace to attract investment in this important research, especially when \nthe penalties could be triggered by a minor, unrelated offense--the way \nthe amendment is written--is just plain and simple bad policy. It is \nakin to having the death penalty for a simple assault.\n\n[[Page S3541]]\n\n  The current intellectual property laws that protect pharmaceutical \nproducts provide researchers and their investors with a stable and \npredictable timeline that allows them to recoup the risky investments \nin research and development of new drugs.\n  We only think about the drugs that have success. But remember, out of \nevery 5,000 to 10,000 potential drug compounds identified, only 1--only \n1--of those 5,000 to 10,000 potential drug compounds will result in a \nnew medicine on the market.\n  Do we want the companies not to take the risk of going through all \nthose thousands and thousands of compounds to come up with the one that \ncan be the cure for so many lives and save so much money in the \ngovernment under Medicare and Medicaid and in our entire health care \nsystem? That is risky investing by anybody's standard, so removing \nincentives is bad policy for the public health of the United States.\n  This amendment will lead to uncertainty among investors. It will dry \nup capital. It will further delay access to new medical products. It \nwill pull us back from the cutting-edge research and development that \nhas always made this Nation great.\n  As I have said--and as my friends who are managing this bill have \nsaid--this FDA reauthorization is too important not to pass. So I urge \nmy colleagues to reject these harmful amendments so we can move forward \nand have an FDA that has the ability to do its job on behalf of the \nAmerican people to create a process that will be safe but will give us \nthe lifesaving, life-enhancing cures that ultimately will lead to a \nbetter life for all of us.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time in \nquorum calls be evenly divided on the McCain amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I again say we are rapidly coming to a \nclose. Again, the sooner we can get to voting, the sooner we will close \nout the business for the day and probably for the week.\n  I again would point out that we have Senator Bingaman's amendment No. \n2111 yet to be called up. Senator Portman has two amendments--Nos. 2146 \nand 2145. Those basically are the only ones left to be brought up. So I \nwould urge them to come and others who have indicated they want to come \nand speak on the amendments that are pending. The McCain amendment, the \nSanders amendment, the Murkowski amendment, the Durbin amendment, and \nthe Paul amendment are still pending. People have indicated they want \nto come over and speak on these various amendments. I would hope they \nwould do so, so we can perhaps get to voting on the amendments and \nfinal passage of the bill sooner rather than later.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2107\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I support Senator McCain's amendment. \nThat amendment would allow drug importation from approved pharmacies in \nCanada. I have been a long-time proponent of safe drug importation. I \nam currently a cosponsor of the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug \nSafety Act, a bill I have worked on for many years with Senator Snowe \nand Senator McCain.\n  In 2002 and 2003, I supported amendments similar to the one before us \ntoday that would permit the importation of prescription drugs from \nCanada. In the year 2004, the late Senator Kennedy and I worked \ntogether on a bill that would authorize drug importation, but it did \nnot survive the partisan politics of this Chamber.\n  I then introduced my own comprehensive drug importation bill in 2004. \nI entitled that bill the Reliable Entry of Medicine and Everyday \nDiscounts Through the Importation of Effective Safeguard Act, and that \nnaturally works out to an acronym. we called it the REMEDIES Act.\n  In 2005, I combined that bill with the proposal sponsored by then-\nSenator Dorgan and Senator Snowe. And in 2007 and 2009, we reintroduced \nthe version of that legislation with hopes that our combined efforts \nwould finally lower the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans.\n  During the health care reform debate in 2009, drug importation had a \nmuch better chance to pass than ever before. We had a Democratic \nsupermajority in Congress and we had a Democratic President who \nsupported drug importation in the past. But in backroom deals between \nthe Obama White House and the pharmaceutical industry, those deals \nprevented us from finally lowering the drug costs for all Americans.\n  So after all of this decade-and-a-half effort, we are back here again \ntrying to accomplish the same goal with Senator McCain's amendment. I \nhave always considered drug importation a free-trade issue. Imports \ncreate competition and keep domestic industry more responsive to \nconsumers. Consumers in the United States pay far more for prescription \ndrugs than those in other countries.\n  For instance, U.S. prices are, on average, 52\\1/2\\ percent higher \nthan Canadian pharmacy prices. If Americans could legally and safely \naccess drugs outside the United States, then drug companies would be \nforced to reevaluate their pricing strategies. They would no longer be \nable to gouge American consumers by making them pay more than their \nfair share for the high cost of research and development. Because that \nis a fact. We pay for most of the research and development of new drugs \nbecause other countries are getting by dirt cheap and there is not \nenough money coming in from those countries to pay for all of the \nresearch it takes, because, as you know, most of the cost of a drug is \nthe research and development, it is not the manufacture of that little \npill or a big pill, for that matter.\n  In the United States, it is a fact. We import everything consumers \nwant. So why not pharmaceuticals? In fact, I look back at all my years \nworking on trying to free up trade around the world through efforts to \npass free-trade agreements, through efforts to get the President trade \npromotion authority, everything that would make global policies \navailable to American consumers, and I can only think of two things our \nlaw prevents consumers in America from importing from other countries \nwhen everything else the consumers buy they can buy anywhere in the \nworld if they want to--but not for pharmaceuticals or not for Cuban \ncigars.\n  Some opponents of this amendment have concerns about what drug \nimportation would mean to the safety of drugs. Obviously, we have to be \nconcerned about drug safety because that is what the FDA is all about--\ntwo things, making sure drugs are safe, and, No. 2, to make sure they \nare effective.\n  Everyone who knows me knows I care deeply about the safety of drugs. \nI would not be standing here today urging support for Senator McCain's \namendment if I did not think it would properly protect the safety of \nthe Nation's prescription drug supply chain. The fact is that the \nunsafe situation is what we have today. Today patients who need a \ncheaper alternative are ordering drugs over the Internet from who knows \nwhere, and the FDA does not have the resources to do much of anything \nabout it. The fact is the McCain amendment would not only help to lower \nthe cost of prescription drugs for all Americans but will also \nestablish a system where American patients can be certain that the \ndrugs they are importing are safe.\n  The amendment has requirements that a pharmacy must meet before the \nSecretary may approve them for participation. This includes product \ntesting in labs designated by the Secretary. A list of approved \npharmacies\n\n[[Page S3542]]\n\nwill be published on the FDA Web site. Patients who are already forced \nto purchase their medications outside the United States would be able \nto access the list to choose a safe option. Additionally, the amendment \nlays out criteria that must be met before any patient may import drugs \nfrom an FDA-approved pharmacy. Patients must have a valid prescription \nfrom a physician licensed to practice in our country. The purchase must \nbe for personal use, and the drug must have the same active ingredient, \nroute of administration, dosage form, and strength as a prescription \ndrug approved by the Secretary of HHS.\n  The McCain amendment would improve drug safety, it would not threaten \ndrug safety. It would open trade to lower-cost drugs, and it would make \nother consumers around the world start paying for some of the research \nand development the American consumer is paying such a high price to \nprovide. We should do all we can to get miracle drugs originated and \ndeveloped, but the American consumer should not be paying the entire \nbill. We need to make sure Americans have even greater, more affordable \naccess to lifesaving drugs by opening the doors to competition in the \nglobal pharmaceutical industry.\n  Obviously, after a decade and a half, I am continuing to urge my \ncolleagues to join in this effort on the importation of drugs, and in \nthis particular area to give support to Senator McCain and support his \namendment. I applaud him for the leadership he has shown in this area \nover a long period of time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the McCain amendment \nNo. 2107, which would facilitate the importation of prescription drugs \nfrom Canada. We are not talking about bus trips of seniors to reputable \nbrick-and-mortar pharmacies right across the border. We are talking \nCanadian Internet pharmacies, which may not even be in Canada, which \npose a significant threat to American patient safety.\n  This amendment would require the Food and Drug Administration to \nallow individuals to import prescription drugs into the United States \nfrom Canada, notwithstanding any other provision of the Federal Food \nDrug and Cosmetic Act.\n  Drugs that supposedly come from Canada can originate in any country \nin the world, and merely be shipped to the United States from Canada. \nCanadian law does not prohibit the shipment of drugs from any country \ninto Canada and then into the United States. They do not care.\n  In 2005, FDA conducted an investigation of drugs that American \npatients thought they were ordering from Canada. Eighty-five percent of \nthe drugs represented as coming from Canada actually came from 27 other \ncountries. A number of drugs were found to be counterfeit.\n  A letter from Assistant Deputy Minister of Health, Canada, to the \nU.S. Surgeon General again said that Canada does not assure that \nproducts being sold to U.S. citizens are safe, effective, and of high \nquality, and does not intend to do so in the future.\n  The pending amendment would allow importation from Canadian Internet \npharmacies. Canadian Internet pharmacies openly acknowledge they obtain \nmost of their drugs from other countries. The specific language of the \npending amendment gives rise to the additional safety concerns. For \nexample, it will not prevent the importation of drugs that need special \nhandling, such as refrigerated or photosensitive drugs. It would not \nprevent the importation of special drugs, such as those inhaled during \nsurgery or administered intravenously.\n  The pending amendment would not require Canadian wholesalers that \nwould be involved in the importation to be licensed or registered in \nany way. There would be a list but not a licensing or registration. Do \nwe want anyone, even someone under investigation or with a suspended or \nrevoked license, to be in the business of importing drugs, given the \nwell-known risks?\n  FDA advises consumers that some imported drugs, including those that \nbear the name of U.S.-approved products, may, in fact, be counterfeit \nversions that are unsafe or completely ineffective. You know, they can \nhave all of the ingredients to it, but if it is not put together the \nright way, it will not even dissolve as it goes through the body, and \ntherefore there would be no benefit from that drug, even though it \nlooked like the real thing, it tasted like the real thing, it went down \nlike the real thing. But if it is not the real thing, it can cause some \nreal trouble with people's health.\n  This is not a hypothetical concern. Last year Homeland Security \nSecretary Napolitano testified that counterfeit drugs are a growing \nproblem. Two months ago, FDA testified about the dangers of purchasing \ncounterfeit, unapproved, or diverted prescription drugs on line. My \ncolleague Senator Mikulski has highlighted the growing involvement of \norganized crime in this area. Prescription drug counterfeiting can be \ndramatically more profitable than narcotic smuggling. Imported drugs \npose additional dangers because their labels may lack important \ninformation or warnings.\n  FDA advises consumers that an imported medication may lack \ninformation allowing patients to be promptly and correctly treated for \ndangerous side effects.\n  We know imported drugs pose severe risks to American patients. The \nFDA and the Department of Health and Human Services have repeatedly \nsaid they cannot assure the safety of imported drugs. A side-by-side \namendment that we used to put on this all the time was that you could \nimport drugs as long as the Secretary of Health and Human Services said \nit was safe. Well, there hasn't been a Secretary of Health and Human \nServices who has been willing to sign that drugs imported from \nanywhere--even Canada--are safe.\n  FDA's Web site advises consumers that imported drugs--including drugs \nimported from Canada--may not have been manufactured under quality \nassurance procedures designed to produce a safe and effective product. \nThat is the FDA Web site.\n  The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act represents over 100 years of \nlawmaking to protect the public health. It gives the FDA authority to \nmake sure drugs are properly approved, manufactured, labeled, shipped, \nhandled, and stored, that factories are inspected, and that numerous \nother protections are in place for American patients. Adopting this \namendment would endanger American patients, and I therefore urge my \ncolleagues to oppose it.\n  There is a lot more that could be said. I have been saying this for \nyears and trying to find a way it could be done. At the present time, \nthe safety of it makes me oppose this particular amendment. They keep \nrevising the amendment. It is still online and everybody knows how \nthings online can be redone. They talked about putting an official seal \non each Web site, but I know fourth graders who can duplicate any seal \nyou can put on the Internet. Any list can be changed--and who checks \nlists, anyway? The problem is not knowing where the drugs come from \nthat go through Canada to the United States. If they are counterfeit, \nthey can sell them for less. The Canadian secretary of health also \ndoesn't want to be the pharmaceutical supplier to the United States. \nThey have a little different system up there. It is a way of driving \nprices down, which is something we would not stand for in the United \nStates, a mechanism where they have to bid on the drugs. The people who \nmake hard medicine bid against each other, and your doctor might prefer \nthe one that doesn't win the bid. That is how they drive the price \ndown. It is probably something we would not allow in the United States.\n  I ask my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will speak about two amendments that we \nwill vote on later.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2111\n\n  First is the Bingaman amendment. I urge my colleagues to oppose it. \nIt ignores fundamental economic realities of pharmaceutical patent \nlitigation, and it would ultimately result in fewer generic drugs being \nbrought to market and delays in the launch of many of the generic drugs \nthat do go to market.\n  Under current law, a generic drug company that is the first to file \nan abbreviated new drug application for an\n\n[[Page S3543]]\n\nexisting patented drug is entitled to 180 days of market exclusivity \nonce the generic drug is approved. In other words, they have the \nexclusive market on it for half a year. This creates a powerful \nincentive for drug companies to bring generic drugs to market.\n  The present amendment would dilute this right of 180 days of \nexclusivity and potentially require the exclusivity period to be shared \nwith another drug company's product. Under the amendment, the only way \na generic drug company that files the first ANDA could be assured of \ngetting 180 days of market exclusivity is by litigating a challenge to \nthe validity of the branded drug's patent all the way to a final \njudgment.\n  This is not a sound approach. First of all, patent litigation is very \nexpensive. Full litigation of a drug patent suit typically costs \nbetween $3 million and $5 million. Second, most drug patents are \nultimately found by the courts to be not invalid; that is, most \nvalidity challenges to these patents fail.\n  Generic drug companies, as everyone else, have limited litigation \nbudgets. As a practical matter, if we force them to litigate every \npatent case to a final judgment in order to preserve their exclusivity \nrights, they will pursue fewer abbreviated new drug applications, and \nfewer ANDAs means fewer generic drugs and higher costs for consumers.\n  Finally, it is often the case that part way into a drug patent \nlawsuit, the generic drug company comes to the conclusion that the \nbrand's patent is strong and that the challenge to the patent is likely \nto lose. In such a situation, everyone is better off if the suit is \nsettled. Typically, such settlements allow the generic drug to go to \nmarket somewhat earlier but still preserve the bulk of the patent term. \nObviously if the generic drug company is forced to litigate this all \nthe way to judgment in order to potentially receive exclusivity and \nthey lose, the full patent term will run and there will be no early \ngeneric market entry. This hurts both the generic drug companies and, \nmore importantly, the consumers.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Bingaman \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2109\n\n  Second, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Sanders amendment. This \namendment would undermine the government's ability to fight fraud and \nwill harm patients and U.S. competitiveness by eviscerating existing \nincentives to invest in medical innovation.\n  The Sanders amendment would result in the automatic revocation of any \nremaining regulatory exclusivity on a product when a company is \nconvicted or even enters into a settlement agreement for certain \nviolations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or any violations of \nthe False Claims Act or several other listed statutes.\n  There are several reasons why this is the wrong approach. First and \nforemost, the amendment will result in less lifesaving drugs ever \ngetting to patients. Obviously, we should be fighting for lifesaving \ndrugs getting to patients even faster. We provide these periods for \nexclusivity, as I mentioned earlier, for a reason: to enable companies \nto recoup the significant investments they make--as high as $1.2 \nbillion per drug--to develop new medicines. Some of the exclusivities \nthe amendment would revoke are those we enacted to encourage companies \nto ensure the safe use of pharmaceuticals in children or to find a cure \nfor rare diseases that affect a very small number of people.\n  Indeed, orphan drug exclusivity is a great example of how these \nexclusivity periods benefit patients. Since 1983, the year the Orphan \nDrug Act was signed into law, more than 350 medicines have been \napproved to treat rare diseases, compared to fewer than 10 in the \n1970s. Why would we want to jeopardize such a great success story?\n  Second, reduced investment in U.S. drug development is not only bad \nfor patients but for the economy. Because the Sanders amendment would \ncreate a disincentive to invest in drug development, the National \nVenture Capital Association has already expressed concerns, stating \nthat the amendment has ``the potential to inadvertently undermine \ninnovation and undermine decades of policies enacted by Congress with \nthe goal of fostering medical innovation.'' Defined periods of \nexclusivity provide some small measure of predictability in what is \notherwise a risky process, and companies and venture capitalists rely \non these periods of exclusivity to make development and investment \ndecisions.\n\n  By threatening the elimination of exclusivities for conduct that is \nlikely many years removed from the development process, the Sanders \namendment would introduce even greater uncertainty into the R \nprocess.\n  Let me restate that we need to reconsider the overall favorability of \nthe environment for innovation in the United States. Yet here we are \nconsidering an amendment that, if enacted, would make the U.S. \ninvestment climate far less attractive for these companies, even as \nother countries are actively courting the biopharmaceutical industry.\n  Third, while the amendment purports to fight fraud, in reality it \nwould actually undermine the ability of the government to fight fraud \nby undermining its ability to settle cases. The Sanders amendment would \nrevoke exclusivity not only upon conviction--even if that conviction is \nlater overturned on appeal--but also upon settlement. This is a huge \nproblem because it creates a disincentive for companies to ever settle, \nas it would make more sense to drag out the district court litigation \nwhile any relevant exclusivity period is still running for the company.\n  Fourth, and finally, the amendment is not even necessary because the \noutcome called for by the Sanders amendment can already be achieved \nunder current law in appropriate cases, because the government can, and \ndoes, have the power to negotiate the relinquishment of exclusivity as \na condition of settlement. It can already do this. For example, this \npast January, the Department of Justice negotiated the relinquishment \nof a company's 180-day exclusivity as part of a settlement for \nviolations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Mandating this serious \noutcome in every case undermines the government's ability to use it as \nleverage to negotiate settlements.\n  Large penalties already apply for violations of the statutes listed \nin the Sanders amendment. The world of drug manufacturing and marketing \nis very heavily regulated, and noncompliance is subject to considerable \npenalties under current law. This amendment is not necessary. Rather \nthan being outraged by settlements that occur, perhaps we ought to take \nthem as an indicator that the government is doing a good job of using \nexisting authority to go after those who seek to defraud the health \ncare system.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Sanders amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                         Nuclear Submarine Fire\n\n  Before I do that, I want to recognize and acknowledge the tremendous \nand outstanding and remarkable work done by the crew at the Portsmouth \nNaval Shipyard and the local firefighters from numerous departments \nfrom the State of Maine, as well as from New Hampshire, because of the \nfire that occurred on the nuclear-powered submarine at the shipyard \nlast evening, which was burning for more than 9 hours.\n  It was the extraordinary teamwork and coordination among all of the \ncrews, as well as the firefighters and departments from both States, \nthat managed to put out the fire. It is now smoldering. I offer my \ncommendations and congratulations to those who did the exceptional and \noutstanding work, which exemplifies the kind of teamwork that already \noccurs at that shipyard. I wanted to offer my recognition to that \nextraordinary work in a very difficult circumstance.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2107\n\n  I rise in support of the amendment offered by the Senator from \nArizona, Senator McCain, in authorizing a very limited drug importation \nprogram, whereby Americans can purchase medications from accredited \nonline Canadian pharmacies. I am supporting this amendment, as I have \nin the past. In fact, we have had broader amendments offered on the \nfloor of the Senate for almost more than a decade with respect to \nallowing importation of prescriptions from other countries that offer \nmore competitive prices.\n  I applaud Senator McCain, who obviously has been a very valuable ally \nin\n\n[[Page S3544]]\n\nthis effort for many years. But he proposed a very limited approach to \naddress those who have concerns with the idea of importing prescription \ndrugs. I, for one, cannot understand why there is such a fundamental \nconcern about this issue because, first of all, Americans have been \nfacing tremendous increases in prescription drug prices for far too \nlong. I think it is at a point at which Congress should address this \nissue, and precisely on this particular piece of legislation that is \nbefore us today. It could not be more appropriate to have this \namendment offered on this legislation.\n  In 2010, AARP found that retail prices for the most popular brandname \ndrugs increased 41.5 percent, while the Consumer Price Index rose just \n13 percent. In other words, the cost of prescription drugs rose more \nthan three times as much as the inflation rate. That is completely \nunacceptable.\n  What has occurred as a result of this trend? First of all, American \nconsumers are increasingly choosing to risk living without taking \ncritical medications. According to the Commonwealth Fund, in 2010, 48 \nmillion Americans did not fill a prescription due to high costs. That \nrepresents an increase of 66 percent since 2001.\n  If the Senate and the overall Congress were to adopt the McCain \namendment, it would allow Americans to purchase safe medications at a \nlower price than they are available for us in this country. We could \nbegin to turn this disturbing trend around. I know people in Maine \ndeserve access to affordable drug prices. Millions of Americans, and \ncertainly those in Maine, have purchased drugs from Canada safely, at a \nsignificant savings over the years. They have had to go to great \nlengths in order to purchase lower price medications. They have taken \nbus trips to Canada to purchase that medication because that was the \nonly way they could have access to the prescriptions they so \ndesperately need. The McCain amendment builds on that foundation.\n\n  If we look at this first chart, Mr. President, an April 27, 2012, \nsurvey comparing average Canadian drug prices against major U.S. retail \npharmacy prices, we find the average U.S. price for a 90-day supply of \nNexium, which is a common blood thinner, is $560 in America but only \n$265 in Canada. So Americans are paying twice as much for Nexium as \nCanadians do. I think that is simply outrageous. Why should American \nconsumers pay twice as much for a medication that so many Americans \ndepend upon?\n  Here is another example of a drug that is a blood-thinning drug that \nis also very crucial in this process, and that is Plavix. That costs \n$585 in the United States versus $398 in Canada for a 90-day supply. \nSo, again, American consumers are paying 50 percent higher costs for \nthe same prescription drugs as Canadians do.\n  Then let's look at the very popular anticholesterol medication \nLipitor. This chart illustrates, again, what Lipitor costs the American \nconsumer. The cost is $478 in the United States as compared to $278 in \nCanada for a 90-day supply.\n  So for patients who are already trying to make ends meet in this very \ndifficult economy by rationing their medications, splitting their \npills, or even skipping medications entirely, why would we deny them \naccess to safe drug products at these dramatically lower prices? That \nis why I have cosponsored Senator McCain's amendment. It would allow \nAmericans to import medication from accredited Canadian pharmacies from \na list approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. These \naccredited pharmacies must commit to ongoing quality assurance programs \nand product testing to determine the safety and efficacy of these \nproducts.\n  This amendment is more narrowly focused than even the one that our \nformer colleague Senator Dorgan and I had offered previously. This \nprovides a pathway to a more limited approach for Americans to access \naffordable medications. In fact, there has been a very recent study \nconducted by Roger Bate of the American Enterprise Institute entitled \n``Unveiling the Mystery of Online Pharmacies: An Audit Study.'' Let me \nquote from him as to what he discovered:\n\n       If some foreign Web sites sell safe prescription drugs with \n     substantial price discounts, but American consumers are \n     guided to buy from U.S. Web sites only, the FDA could \n     potentially discourage price competition between the U.S. and \n     foreign pharmacies and, thereby, reduce drug affordability \n     within the United States. The danger of reducing price \n     competition depends on whether consumers can distinguish \n     trustworthy Web sites from the vast pool of foreign Web \n     sites.\n\n  So here we have the documentation by a very significant study that \ntalks about how Americans can access these affordable medications. We \nshouldn't be discouraging price competition, as this study illustrates. \nThat is one of the points I have been arguing over the years; that the \nreal problem in this country with respect to prices for prescriptions \nis that we don't have competition within the industry and competition \nfor those medications.\n  Americans have learned that citizens in other countries use the very \nsame medications as we do. They are made in the very same plants. Yet \nthey pay less. We talk about injecting greater free market competition \nin the health care marketplace as a way of achieving greater \naffordability, and this amendment attempts to address that very issue. \nAs we look at what other countries do, when we are talking about \naccessing cheaper medications, we know in Canada that is the case, and \nit is certainly true in other industrialized nations.\n  I should add, in fact, they pay 35 to 55 percent less for their drugs \nbecause of the higher prices Americans pay, which is about $90 billion \nmore for prescription drugs every year than we would otherwise. I think \nthat is totally unacceptable. Why should American consumers be paying \n35 to 55 percent more or nearly $90 billion more than consumers in \nother countries for the very same medications? It simply doesn't make \nsense.\n  According to former Pfizer CEO Hank McKinnell--looking at the quote \non this chart:\n\n       Competition is good medicine for economies. . . . Name an \n     industry in which competition is allowed to flourish--\n     computers, telecommunications, small package shipping, \n     retailing, entertainment--and I will show you lower prices, \n     higher quality, more innovation, and better customer service. \n     There's nary an exception. Okay, there's one. So far, the \n     health care industry seems immune to the discipline of \n     competition.\n\n  When we last considered the legislation I introduced along with \nformer colleague Senator Dorgan, we allowed importation only from \nCanada, the European Union, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, and the \nCongressional Budget Office estimated the Federal Government would save \nalmost $20 billion--$20 billion--if we allowed the importation of those \nmedications. So we know for a fact allowing drug importation generates \nconsiderable cost savings to the government, to individuals, and \nbusinesses that provide health insurance coverage to their employees.\n  The bottom line is where nations institute safe, regulated trade in \npharmaceuticals they achieve results. When Sweden entered the European \nUnion system of trade, they saw a reduction of 12 to 19 percent in the \nprice of traded drugs. In fact, Europe has had parallel trading for \nmore than 30 years and has never had an incident.\n  Industries see the advantage in being a part of the global market \nwhen it comes to manufacturing costs. For example, according to a Pew \nstudy in 2011, the number of prescription drugs made at non-U.S. sites \ndoubled between 2001 and 2008. That means they doubled at a sizable \nincrease with respect to the number of prescription drugs that are made \nat non-U.S. sites. There are more than 50 plants where our medications \nare manufactured, and not all of those facilities are even inspected--\nnot even inspected. Yet those are medications we use in this country \nbecause they are manufactured at other plants in other countries. As I \nsaid, there are more than 50 countries in which we have our \nprescriptions manufactured.\n  So let me see if I have this straight. It is fine for some foreign \ncountries to manufacture drugs in their own plants for the U.S. market, \nship those drugs here where the American people are given the privilege \nof paying higher prices than anywhere else in the world, but somehow we \ncan't safely import those very drugs into the United States directly. \nIt simply doesn't make sense.\n  The American taxpayer is underwriting more than $30 billion of \nresearch--basic and applied research--at the National Institutes of \nHealth alone, so consumers in all those other\n\n[[Page S3545]]\n\nnations are benefiting from the investments the American taxpayer is \nmaking with respect to research. That U.S. research produces these \nmedications and these prescriptions that other nations pay 35 to 55 \npercent less for than the American consumer. The American taxpayer is \npaying more for those drugs, as I said, and also paying more of their \ntax dollars for the research that is ongoing at the National Institutes \nof Health. It simply doesn't make sense.\n\n  With all of the additional profit, industry invests nearly equally in \nR in the United States and in Europe and is increasingly moving \nresearch to low-cost Asian countries. So paying the world's highest \nprices for drugs doesn't ensure us more research, but it decreases our \naccess to drugs. So that is the contradiction that Americans confront \neach and every day when they are purchasing their medications at a much \nhigher cost than consumers in other countries.\n  The amendment that is offered by the Senator from Arizona is allowing \nimportation solely from Canada, and it is for online pharmacies based \non a list that has been drafted by the Department of Health and Human \nServices. That is a very prescribed, targeted, limited approach to \nallowing American consumers to benefit from those lower priced drugs \nthat are offered in Canada.\n  It is very important we take this step. It is important for American \nconsumers who otherwise are not going to be able to afford these \nmedications when they are paying two to three times more than their \ncounterparts in Canada, for example. The prices are rising five times \nmore than the inflation rate year after year, so the compounding effect \nis significant and overwhelming for most American consumers and \nfamilies. So what I hope is we will support the amendment that has been \noffered by Senator McCain.\n  Some have suggested that providing support for the McCain amendment \nwill hinder efforts to quickly move on the underlying legislation for \nthe FDA. That concern is certainly not persuasive because the McCain \namendment is a very narrowly focused approach. It represents a good-\nfaith effort to find common ground. It has included strong safety-\nrelated measures and is done under very limited circumstances so the \nAmerican consumer can take advantage of the lower prices I have \ndemonstrated today with regard to some of the commonly used drugs, such \nas the anticholesterol medication Lipitor and the drug-thinning drugs \nsuch as Plavix. It is explicitly designed to make it more broadly \nacceptable to those who might have concerns in taking the approach of \ndrug importation.\n  We must create a more competitive, more affordable health care system \nfor the American people. The prescription drug market needs \ncompetition. Competition will lower prices. For some reason, even \nthough we are underwriting all of the research that benefits consumers \nin so many other countries, and even though our medications are \nmanufactured at other plants in 50 countries, the American consumers \nare paying up to 55 percent more than their counterparts around the \nworld. It simply doesn't make sense. In fact, I would suggest it is \noutrageous.\n  So that is why I am supporting this amendment. We need to take this \nlimited, modest first step that I think goes a long way to addressing \nany reservations anyone might have in this Chamber with respect to the \nissue of importation. I hope we will allow American consumers to \nbenefit from the much lower prices, especially during these very \ndifficult economic times. This is a first step toward a larger system \nof safe, regulated drug importation.\n  I commend the Senator from Arizona for offering this amendment, and I \nhope the Senate will adopt it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n  Amendments Nos. 2142, as Modified, 2145, As Modified, and 2146, as \n                            Modified En Bloc\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, I ask to engage in a colloquy with Senator \nHarkin.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa for his hard work as chairman of the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions and, in particular, \non the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act that the \nSenate is now considering. I appreciate Senator Harkin reaching out to \nme about those amendments to his bill that fall within the jurisdiction \nof the Judiciary Committee. One of those amendments concerns the issue \nof synthetic drugs--a major problem that the committee has been \naddressing.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Amendment 2146, as modified, filed by Senator Portman, \nplaces a number of synthetic drugs within schedule I under the \nControlled Substances Act.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes. That amendment is the same in substance as three \nbills that the Senate Judiciary Committee passed last year--the \nCombating Dangerous Synthetic Stimulants Act, S. 409; the Combating \nDesigner Drugs Act, S. 839; and the Dangerous Synthetic Drug Control \nAct, S. 605. It addresses substances commonly known as bath salts and \nother synthetic drugs that have no legitimate use and can too easily be \nobtained under current law. Bath salts have resulted in a number of \nreports of individuals acting violently in the United States, including \nin Vermont, and have led to injuries to those using them and to others.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am glad that those bills and, therefore, the substance \nof this amendment have already been given careful consideration by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. That gives me comfort in including this \namendment among those to which the managers of the bill consent.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree. I want to be sure that the amendment to be \nincluded will be Senator Portman's amendment that corresponds precisely \nto the bills that were considered by the Judiciary Committee. Adding \nchemicals to schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act has serious \nconsequences and is not a step that we should undertake without careful \nconsideration. Do you understand that the consent to include Senator \nPortman's amendment is not consent to further amend the Controlled \nSubstances Act, that it is limited to these chemicals and matters \ncontained in that amendment, and that have been considered and approved \nby the Senate Judiciary Committee?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It is unfortunate that the three synthetic drug bills that \nthe Judiciary Committee passed last summer have been unable to move on \nthe Senate floor because they have been held up by one Senator. They \nhave been cleared for Senate passage on the Democratic side for some \ntime.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is too bad that so much progress has been blocked by \nso few in this Congress. I am glad that the Food and Drug \nAdministration Safety and Innovation Act may provide an opportunity to \nmake progress on this important issue.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator for his assistance on this matter.\n\n[[Page S3547]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \npending amendments be agreed to: Leahy No. 2142, as modified; Portman \nNo. 2145, as modified; and Coburn No. 2131; and that the Coburn \namendment No. 2132 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). Is there objection? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    amendment no. 2142, as modified\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the Senate for unanimously \nadopting my amendment to address Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, \nconcerns with section 708 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety \nand Innovation Act. I especially thank Senators Harkin and Enzi--the \ndistinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the HELP Committee--for \nworking with me to protect the American public's ability to access \nimportant health and safety information under FOIA.\n  My amendment improves the bill by allowing the Food and Drug \nAdministration, FDA, to obtain important information about drug \ninspections and drug investigations undertaken by foreign governments, \nwhile at the same time ensuring that the American public has access to \ninformation about potential health and safety dangers. Specifically, \nthe amendment narrows the scope of the FOIA exemption in the original \nbill to No. 1 cover only information obtained from foreign government \nagencies and No. 2 clarify that the information to be withheld must be \nvoluntarily provided to the FDA pursuant to a written Memorandum of \nUnderstanding. The amendment also preserves the right of the Congress \nto obtain this information. Lastly, the amendment places a 3 year time \nlimit for withholding information pursuant to the exemption, unless a \ndifferent time period is specified by the foreign government agency--so \nthat the information will not automatically be shielded from the public \nindefinitely.\n  For more than four decades, the Freedom of Information Act has been \nan indispensible tool for the public to obtain Government information. \nThis law carefully balances the need for the Government to keep some \ninformation confidential, with the need to ensure free flow of \ninformation in our Democratic society. I am pleased that by unanimously \nadopting my amendment, the Senate has worked in a bipartisan manner to \nensure that this careful balance is maintained regarding FDA drug \ninspections and investigations.\n  I thank the many open government and consumer groups--including \nOpenTheGovernment.org and Public Citizen--that supported this \namendment. Again, I also thank and congratulate the lead sponsors of \nthis bill on the passage of this important legislation.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2146, as Modified\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we are ready \nto act on the Portman amendment No. 2146, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nthere is no further debate, the question is on the adoption of the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2146), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2111\n\n (Purpose: To provide substantial savings in health care costs to the \nFederal government and consumers by fostering competition among generic \n pharmaceutical manufacturers and ensuring that anti-competitive ``pay-\n for-delay'' settlements between brand-name and generic pharmaceutical \n   manufacturers do not block generic drugs from entering the market)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2111.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment by number.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Mr. Vitter, Mr. Franken, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Udall of \n     New Mexico, Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. \n     Merkley, and Mr. Sanders, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2111.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading be dispensed \nwith.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Thursday, May 17, 2012 \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is one that is a \nbipartisan amendment. Senator Vitter is cosponsoring this with me, also \nSenators Franken, Shaheen, Kohl, Tom Udall, Tim Johnson, Klobuchar, \nMerkley, Sanders, and the Presiding Officer, Senator Brown.\n  This amendment addresses the very same issue that the Senator from \nMaine was talking about; that is, how do we bring down the price of \nprescription drugs? How do we get competition into the market for \nprescription drugs?\n  We have a circumstance today in which an anticompetitive, \nanticonsumer practice is engaged in, and our amendment will change the \nlaw so that practice can no longer be engaged in. The practice I am \ntalking about is the entering into so-called pay-for-delay settlements \nbetween brand-name drugs--brand-name pharmaceutical companies and \ngeneric manufacturers.\n  These pay-for-delay settlements have the effect of delaying timely \naccess to generic drugs. These agreements between companies shield \nbillions of dollars in sales each year from effective competition. The \npharmaceutical companies benefit from this lack of competition and they \ndo so at the expense of consumers and they do so at the expense of the \nFederal Government, since the Federal Government is a very large \nconsumer and purchases a substantial amount of prescription drugs for \nthe military and in other ways.\n  A preliminary estimate from the CBO indicates that this amendment \nwill reduce direct spending by hundreds of millions of dollars at a \nminimum. Frankly, I believe it will, in fact, save us billions of \ndollars annually at the Federal Government level. The CBO also \nindicates that the amendment will reduce the average cost for \nprescription drugs and lower the cost of health insurance plans.\n  Early access to generic drugs is a key to saving money in the health \ncare system. Kaiser Family Foundation has found this. They concluded \nthat spending in the United States for prescription drugs reached \n$259.1 billion in 2010. That is nearly six times as much as we spent on \nprescription drugs in 1990. Since generic drugs are on average four \ntimes less expensive--or another way to put that is one-quarter of the \ncost of the brand-name alternatives--they can be a very important \nsource for reducing the cost in our health care system. To actually \nreceive these savings, consumers have to have access to these generic \ndrugs and have access to them in a timely manner.\n  In 1984, Congress passed the bipartisan Hatch-Waxman Act to create \nmarket-based incentives for generic pharmaceutical companies to bring \ntheir drugs to market as quickly as possible. The purpose of the law \nwas to incentivize the early generic drug competition while preserving \nincentives for pioneer companies to develop innovative new medicines. \nUnfortunately, pay-for-delay settlements between brand-name drugs that \nalready have their products in the market and generic pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers who have not yet brought their products to market have \nbecome commonplace, and these agreements, these so-called settlements, \nhave stifled competition and delayed access to generic drugs at a \nsignificant cost to everyone who is involved in the health care system.\n  There is a table I want to put up. It relates to three particular \ndrugs, and I will talk about the second two of these drugs because this \ngives some context to what I am concerned about.\n  This second drug is Lipitor. Everybody knows about Lipitor. It is a \ncholesterol-lowering drug. It is familiar to most people. It is the \nbest-selling pharmaceutical ever in the history of the world.\n  According to a 2008 New York Times report, a pay-for-delay settlement \ndelayed generic entry into that market--the entry of a generic version \nof Lipitor--by 20 months. The same report stated the generic version of \nthe drug was estimated to sell for less than one-third the cost of the \nbrand-name Lipitor. It pointed out that the brand-named Lipitor had \nearned $12.7 billion in sales the year before.\n  According to a letter sent to the FDA Director Hamburg last year from \nsome of my colleagues in the Senate indicating that the Federal \nGovernment was spending $2.4 billion a year on\n\n[[Page S3548]]\n\nLipitor, they estimated that bringing a generic version to market would \ngenerate somewhere between $4 billion and $6.7 billion in savings \nannually to people who are purchasing this drug in this country.\n  The second example is Provigil. This is a sleep disorder drug. Due to \nthe pay-for-delay settlement entered into there, a generic version of \nProvigil just came to market this year. Had this amendment we are \noffering as part of this bill been law, generics very likely would have \nentered the market 6 years ago with the expiration of exclusivity.\n  The chief executive officer of Cephalon--which is the brand-name \nmanufacturer of Provigil--is quoted as saying:\n\n       We were able to get six more years of patent protection. \n     That's $4 billion in sales that no one expected.\n\n  In other words, the Provigil case represents 6 years and millions of \ndollars of lost savings to consumers, the largest consumer being the \nU.S. Government and particularly the U.S. military.\n  I have a chart that relates to the U.S. military's potential savings \nfrom this amendment. This translates this into dollars that are being \npaid out by the U.S. military as part of the defense budget, which we \nare going to be passing later this year.\n  Assuming that a generic version of Provigil would have been released \nin 2006, the Department of Defense alone would have saved $159 million \nfrom this one drug between 2006 and 2011. That is over $150 million \nfrom a single prescription drug.\n  If enacted, this amendment would foster more generic competition, \nwould bring generic drugs to the market sooner, and would do so in a \nmanner that is consistent with the original intent of the Hatch-Waxman \nAct. Passage of the amendment would significantly cut prescription drug \ncosts for American consumers and help reduce the Federal deficit.\n\n  Let me also allude to an article on the front page of the New York \nTimes. I know some of my colleagues take exception to the New York \nTimes occasionally, but this is an article entitled ``New Fervor for \nCutting Costs Among Hospitals and Insurers.'' The reporter is Reed \nAbelson. About three paragraphs into the article, he states:\n\n       After years of self-acknowledged profligacy, hospitals, \n     doctors and health insurers say there is a strong effort \n     under way to bring medical costs under control.\n\n  I was struck by that phrase ``self-acknowledged profligacy in the \nhealth care system.'' I think that is what we have engaged in, in the \nCongress, frankly, is self-acknowledged profligacy in the health care \nsystem. This amendment will help to correct that.\n  The amendment has the strong support of AARP, of Families USA, \nConsumer Federation of America, U.S. PIRG, Consumers Union, the Center \nfor Medicare Advocacy, AFL CIO, AFSME, Walmart, the National Committee \nto Preserve Social Security and Medicare, among other groups and \norganizations.\n  If my colleagues favor competition, this amendment helps to promote \ncompetition. If we want to see reduced costs to the taxpayer for health \ncare, then this amendment helps to reduce the cost to the taxpayer. If \nwe want to reduce what patients and hospitals and insurance companies \nhave to pay for prescription drugs, this amendment helps to do that as \nwell.\n  I think this is something that is long past time we corrected this \nproblem. This is a great opportunity for us to do so. I believe it is \none of the first amendments that will be considered on this \nlegislation. I hope my colleagues will put aside whatever other \nconsiderations they might have had in the past and go ahead and vote \nfor this correction in Federal law. This is a problem, frankly, that we \npassed legislation that provided the opportunity--unfortunately. It was \nnot intended. But an unintended consequence of the earlier legislation \nthat we passed, the Hatch-Waxman Act, was to allow this kind of \nblocking, these kinds of pay-for-delay settlements to be entered into. \nWe can correct that today. I hope very much we will.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On whose time is the Senator speaking?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am speaking on the majority's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the Bingaman amendment?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. No. I am speaking on the McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2146\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am going to speak for a brief moment on \nthe amendment No. 2146 and then on a different issue, which is the \nreaction of some to the proposal Senator Casey and I made about Eduardo \nSaverin and others who renounced their citizenship for tax purposes.\n  First, on 2146. I am glad this amendment has now finally passed the \nSenate. It places synthetic drugs on schedule I of the Controlled \nSubstances Act as totally banned substances, which are where they \nbelong.\n  These synthetic substances are also known as bath salts or, in the \ncase of synthetic marijuana, Spice incense. Synthetic drugs aren't sold \non street corners by slingers who keep hidden stashes; instead, these \ndrugs are legal--even though they are dangerous--and can be found in \nlocal corner stores across the country. They are as easy to buy as a \nlollipop or a carton of milk but far more dangerous, even more \ndangerous than the common illegal drug on which they are based.\n  By passing this amendment, we finally get these poisonous drugs off \nour shelves and keep our Nation's youth out of emergency rooms.\n  I wish to thank Senators Klobuchar and Grassley for working with me \non this amendment, as well as Chairman Harkin and Senator Enzi, \nChairman Leahy, Senator Grassley, and Senator Feinstein for their \nleadership, and I want to thank Senator Harkin and Enzi particularly \nfor getting us in this package and Senator Portman for working with us \non this amendment.\n\n\n                            Eduardo Saverin\n\n  On the issue of Eduardo Saverin, last week, Senator Casey and I \nintroduced the Ex-Patriot Act. It is a bill that makes sure that people \nthat renounce their citizenship for tax purposes do not escape what \nthey owe and cannot come back without repaying all that they avoided \npaying this great country.\n\n  It is a modest proposal, made in response to the regrettable effort \nby a person named Eduardo Saverin, who renounced his American \ncitizenship to avoid paying even the historically low level of 15 \npercent on capital gains for the several billion dollars in windfall \nprofit he is set to receive from the Facebook IPO.\n  Mr. Saverin is no longer involved in the day-to-day running of the \ncompany, and it bears mentioning that the current, active leadership of \nFacebook is comprised of responsible corporate citizens who meet all of \ntheir responsibilities and obligations.\n  Mr. Saverin, on the other hand, has chosen to disown the United \nStates to save some money on his taxes.\n  Senator Casey and I have proposed a response. Our bill would bar \nSaverin--and others like him--from reentering the country. It would \nalso re-impose taxes on investment income earned in the United States \neven if an expatriate is living abroad.\n  I believe that the vast majority of Americans, of all parties and \npersuasions, think that renouncing citizenship in America to avoid \ntaxes is troubling, unwarranted and ungrateful.\n  It is upsetting, to say the least, when a person who has benefitted \nso thoroughly from being an American--a person who accessed and enjoyed \nso many exceptional aspects of American society--just takes the money \nand runs, rather than doing the right thing and repaying the debt he \nowes to a nation that nurtured, facilitated and cheered his success.\n  And I think that the vast majority of Americans are receptive to \nsuggestions for how we can address this kind of unacceptable behavior.\n  Look, nobody enjoys paying taxes, but Americans know that we would \nnot have a functioning society without them. We argue and debate about \nthe proper rates, and what is fair, and what level will sustain and \ngrow our economy and our middle class.\n  But I think that most Americans agree that paying a mere 15 percent \nin capital gains taxes on a sum of $3 billion or $4 billion is not too \nmuch to ask a person, especially a person who fled\n\n[[Page S3549]]\n\ntheir own homeland because their native society could not provide a \nreasonable level of security to their family.\n  While the real point here is not just about this one case--our bill \naddresses a small group of evaders over the last decade or so--it is \nworth pointing out that in this particular case the Saverin family \nfound security here thanks to taxpayer funded cops and stability thanks \nto a taxpayer funded military, and a world-class university system, \nlike that at Harvard--again underpinned by public support.\n  And they also found an expansive middle class that would become the \nmarket for his product. And a dynamic, entrepreneurial, free market \neconomy that allows for significant accumulation of wealth. And \nfunctioning capital markets that were recently saved from the brink of \ncatastrophic collapse through who? The American taxpayer.\n  And they found a government that invests in research and development, \nin things like creating the internet, and the web, and GPS, and \nmicroprocessors, all of which are necessary precursors to what Saverin \nand his cohorts created via Facebook.\n  And let's not forget, a non-corrupt legal system, which decided a \ncase in his favor that made him a billionaire.\n  Yes, Eduardo Saverin did well by being in America.\n  And I think that most Americans know full well that what he \naccomplished was not done in a vacuum and that his success is the also \nthe outgrowth of his participation in an extraordinary American \nsociety--a society that we collectively support.\n  No one gets rich in America on their own. And when people do well in \nAmerica, they should do well by America.\n  I believe the vast majority of Americans believe this, too. So when I \nintroduced our legislation I was sure it would garner wide and deep \nsupport, and in general, it has.\n  That is why it is baffling that extreme right wing Republicans, \npeople like Grover Norquist, the de-facto leader of the Republican \nParty on tax matters, would rush to the defense of a man who is turning \nhis back on America by dodging taxes.\n  Amazingly, the extreme right-wing echo chamber has made Saverin into \na cause celebre, defending his decision to disown the country as \nsomehow ``heroic''--Their words, not mine.\n  I was amazed. Just amazed. I took it as a given that citizenship--and \nall that it implies in terms of loyalty and duty to America--was \naxiomatic.\n  But that is no longer the case. Here is just some of what was said.\n  Forbes said that ``For De-Friending The U.S., Facebook's Eduardo \nSaverin Is An American Hero.'' An American hero? Renouncing your \ncitizenship now qualifies as heroic for the hard right wing? George \nWashington was heroic. Rosa Parks was heroic. John McCain and Gabby \nGiffords are heroic. Navy SEALS are heroic. Eduardo Saverin is not.\n  National Review's Mario Loyola says, ``It is the foolish and counter-\nproductive tax policies of the left that are chasing Eduardo Saverin to \nanother country. . . .'' I'm sorry. 15 percent capital gains rate on \nseveral billion dollars is so onerous that it is chasing him away? I am \nsure any American worker would love to have that rate.\n  And if 15 percent is too high, what does Mr. Loyola or Mr. Norquist \nthink the proper capital gains rate should be? Do they think we should \nhave even lower taxes on capital gains, which disproportionately goes \nto the highest income earners?\n  What is the proper capital gains rate, Mr. Norquist? Should we make \nit 10 percent? 5 percent? Or should it be zero?\n  They won't say. Because if they did, they would be laughed out of \ntown.\n  The Wall Street Journal says we are ``oppressive and demagogic.''\n  No. In America, You are free to leave. But if you leave to purposely \navoid paying your fair share, then we will attach a consequence to that \ndodge.\n  Right wing blog after blog--from the American Thinker to the Daily \nCaller--echoes that, ``punishing Saverin for tax dodging is un-\nAmerican.''\n  Really? Silly me. I thought that renouncing one's citizenship was un-\nAmerican.\n  While on right wing radio they ask:\n\n       If it's a more favorable tax haven than you can find \n     elsewhere, why is it automatic that you are unpatriotic? Why \n     is it automatic that you are a coward?\n\n  Because, my fellow Americans, when you renounce your nation to fatten \nyour bank account, you are--by definition--being greedy and \nunpatriotic.\n  Grover Norquist: says our bill is like fascist Nazi Germany or \napartheid South Africa or communist Soviet Union, while in American \nThinker we of erecting a ``Berlin Wall.'' And In the Examiner they are \naccused say we are ``totalitarian.''\n  The comparisons are absurd on their face and burden on the odious.\n  The law Mr. Norquist references in Nazi Germany was purely; \ndiscriminatory. It targeted a particular race of people--the Jewish \npeople--and--punished them for nothing other than being Jewish and \nexercising freedom of movement. It was meant to constrain that freedom \nby forcing Jews to reside inside Germany.\n  Our proposal targets no single race, creed or class. It doesn't \npunish you for factors beyond your control, like who your parents were. \nIt applies based on actions you take--namely, disowning the United \nStates to avoid taxes. Our law is not triggered by a wish to travel \nbeyond America's borders, or even reside permanently in a foreign \ncountry. It is the act of renouncing one's U.S. citizenship--for the \npurpose of avoiding taxes--that triggers our bill.\n  Another right wing opinion piece asks: ``If you leave to protest \nheavy taxation why must you pay a penalty?''\n  I am sorry, gentlemen, but Mr. Saverin is not protesting anything If \nhe was protesting, he would stay here, and fight for a lower tax rate--\nnot simply exempt himself and leave others like him to continue paying \na rate he considers too high. What he is doing is free-riding on \nAmerica, dodging paying his fair share, and pocketing the billions from \nan IPO windfall.\n  Yet another right wing blog says we are engaged in ``class warfare to \nvilify people that create wealth-just like the Nazi's did with the \nJews.''--I know a thing or two about what Nazi's did--some of my \nrelatives were killed by them--and saying that a person who made their \nfortune specifically because of the positive elements of American \nsociety, in turn, has a responsibility to do right by America is not \neven on the same planet as comparing to what the Nazis did to the Jews. \nThat comparison is odious, but it is in a bunch of these right-wing \nblogs.\n  On and on it goes. The whole torrent of vitriol is absurd. Just \nabsurd.\n  Mr. Saverin is, in essence, an economic tax dodger.\n  And once upon a time, the right wing castigated draft dodgers for \nfailing to heed their nation's call. Those who fled the country were \nvilified by the right wing as cowards, as self-absorbed, as traitors.\n  Yet, in this case, the exact same kind of unpatriotic, un-American \nbehavior is actually being defended by the extreme right wing.\n  It is off the deep end.\n  And when a view this irrational has overtaken one end of the \npolitical spectrum, it has serious, negative consequences for our \nability to solve our nation's problems.\n  If those on the other side of the negotiating table are this \nobsessive on taxes--that they consider their minimization a higher \npriority than preserving our national identity--then it is no wonder a \ngrand bargain on taxes and spending has been so out of reach.\n  In the last several years, the far right has disregarded one \nhistorically conservative priority after another in favor of an all-\nconsuming obsession with protecting low tax rates for the wealthiest \nAmericans.\n  First, it was the deficit. The Republicans have for years claimed \nthat deficit reduction was their top priority. But that has since been \nexposed as a myth.\n  Every independent economist will tell you that the deficit problem \ncannot be solved except through both spending cuts and revenue \nincreases. In fact, preserving tax cuts for the very wealthy is \ncounterproductive to the goal of reducing our annual deficits.\n  Yet the far right marches on in defense of tax cuts for millionaires, \ndeficits be damned.\n  Last August, our Nation's creditworthiness became a second casualty \nof the far right's insistence on low taxes for the wealthy. The right \nwing was so dug in against any reasonable fiscal\n\n[[Page S3550]]\n\ncompromise that they forced a manufactured crisis over raising the \nNation's debt limit. This caused the first-ever downgrade of our \nNation's credit rating.\n  Unbelievably, the far right prioritized millionaire tax breaks over \nour Nation's full faith and credit.\n  Despite that unreasonableness, we thought we had finally figured out \na way to force the far right to come to grips with the need to deal \nwith revenues. We come up with a mechanism called the sequester that \nwould trigger harsh defense cuts if the Republicans continued to refuse \nany new revenues.\n  Surely, if there was one thing conservatives prized as much as tax \ncuts, it was defense spending, right?\n  Wrong. As we speak, the far right remains unwilling to cede an inch \non revenues, no matter what it means for the Pentagon. The deficit; the \nNation's creditworthiness; National security--all of these have taken a \nbackseat to the far right's idolatry on taxes. Now they have gone so \nfar, they have taken this idolatry all the way to its extreme end point \nby making Eduardo Saverin into their patron saint.\n  In the name of low taxes for the wealthy, they have lionized an \ninherently unpatriotic person.\n  The hero worship of Saverin is Norquist's extreme right wing anti-tax \nagenda being carried to its logical conclusion. And it is a scary, \nabsurd place where even a tax dodger who renounces America for his own \n30 pieces of silver is celebrated as a patriot and an American hero.\n  It is perverse.\n  Reasonable Republicans rightly seem wary to embrace taking things \nthis far. House Speaker John Boehner labeled Saverin's move \n``absolutely outrageous'' and said he would support legislation to stop \nwealthy ex-pats relocating to avoid taxes.\n  Others have been quiet, perhaps cowed by fears of being the next \ntarget of the right wing echo chamber.\n  Shouldn't loyalty to America--and the broader responsibilities and \nduty of citizenship--trump base, non-essential financial self-interest?\n  Sadly, the answer of the extreme right is no.\n  The Wall Street Journal attacked the thrust of our proposed \nlegislation as an example of the ``age of envy.'' Well, it is not envy. \nIn fact, I am happy those who intended and invested in Facebook got \nvery rich. Having an idea and succeeding and maybe getting rich off \nthis great idea is the American way. More power to them.\n  However, what is not the American way is taking a free ride on all \nthe exceptional aspects of American society. What is not the American \nway is deriving massive advantage from various publicly supported \nelements of that society and then skipping town when you hit the \njackpot. Yes, you are free to leave. You have a right to be selfish--\neven greedy--when renouncing this Nation.\n  I understand this will make you more money and there is a rational, \nsimplistic argument to be made in favor of doing it--if the only factor \nthat mattered was always getting richer and all other values were \nirrelevant. But we Americans have other values too.\n  America is special for many reasons. It is secure, it offers freedom \nof expression, it is diverse and tolerant, it is entrepreneurial, and \nit is economically and culturally dynamic. Looking out for the common \ngood is in our blood. It is a part of our shared history and vision of \nour Founding Fathers.\n  We provide for the common defense. We promote the general welfare. We \nare not just out for ourselves. No. We look to secure the blessings of \nliberty not just for ourselves but for our posterity. It is this, and \nso much more, that makes America an exceptional society.\n  I am appalled by the reaction. I am not appalled by a debate on tax \npolicy. I am appalled by making heroic a man who renounces his \ncitizenship to escape a tax rate, capital gains of 15 percent.\n  Too often I think every action and dilemma we face is now reduced to \na question of whether this means bigger government or smaller \ngovernment. Since those on the extreme right believe we must have \nsmaller government at all costs, they vehemently oppose all taxes. But \nsometimes, as with this case and others like it, it is not just about \nthe size of government. It is about doing what is fair and right and \njust based on your responsibilities as a citizen.\n  Citizenship is not simply a business decision, it is not just a \ntransaction. Those on the right, such as Grover Norquist, defending \nthis economic draft dodger are saying something very different. They \nare saying the social contract somehow excludes the accumulation of \nmoney. We know we give up certain rights and freedoms to live in a \nplace like America, but we cannot just carry out vigilantism to pursue \njustice.\n  So in conclusion, being an American is not a one-way street. There \nare enormous benefits to being a citizen of our Nation and a member of \nthe amazing society that has spawns. But there are also \nresponsibilities and duties, such as patriotism, service, contributing \nyour fair share, and commitment to community and family.\n  As we approach critical debates on the matters of taxation and \nfairness and job creation so critical to keeping America, the greatest \nNation on the face of the Earth, I certainly hope it is these values, \nnot glorified self-interest, that drowns out all other values that \nguide our actions.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, while I agree with much of what the Senator \nhas said, I hope this doesn't encourage other partisan diatribes to \ncome to the floor when we are on a bipartisan bill and trying to solve \ngetting necessary pharmaceuticals to the market as soon as possible. We \nhave a limited time of debate, and we need to stay on the subject. So I \nhope others are not encouraged to come down to counter anything they \nmay have heard or to make different charges.\n  We have some time left on Bingaman and some others, but I hope we can \nmove forward on the bill.\n  I yield the floor to the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I concur with Senator Enzi on that, to \nstick to the bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent, notwithstanding the previous order, the \nSenate proceed to votes in relation to the following amendments at 12 \nnoon with all other provisions of the previous order remaining in \neffect: Bingaman amendment No. 2111, Murkowski amendment No. 2108, and \nPaul amendment No. 2143.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I will not \nobject. I want to ensure that I will have 10 minutes in support of the \nBingaman-Vitter amendment prior to the vote as was promised to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is notified that \nthere is not 10 minutes remaining in support of that amendment.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, may I inquire to the Chair how much time \nis remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 3 minutes left in support of the \nBingaman-Vitter amendment.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that as part of \nthis agreement that I be given 7 minutes before the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would modify my unanimous consent \nrequest to have the vote start at 12:05.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I think that accommodation was to allow \nthe Senator from Louisiana for 7 minutes, and I would ask for 5 minutes \nbefore the votes begin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Louisiana \nwill be given 7 minutes and the assistant majority leader will be given \n5 minutes and the vote will begin at 12:05. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The assistant majority leader.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2127\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today we are considering a bill that will \nimprove the FDA's ability to assure the\n\n[[Page S3551]]\n\nsafety of drugs in our medicine cabinets and medical devices in our \nhospitals. The FDA is an essential guardian of the public's health and \nsafety. In the past few years, FDA has faced obstacles that call on the \nagency to adapt and respond to the evolving nature of reviewing, \nmanufacturing, and distributing drugs and devices.\n  Some of those obstacles and challenges are addressed in the \nreauthorizations of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act and the Medical \nDevice User Fee Act, which are set to expire at the end of September \n2012.\n  Last fall, I visited Cook Medical's medical device plant in Canton, \nIllinois, and representatives expressed concern about the amount of \ntime it takes medical devices to be reviewed. The FDA needs sufficient \ntime to review medical devices, in order to ensure their safety and \neffectiveness. However, inefficiencies and insufficient resources can \nresult in longer review times, which mean patients have to wait longer \nto benefit from new medical devices.\n  This bill makes key changes to maintain the safety of devices and \npreserve our country's leadership in biomedical innovation. The bill \nwill authorize the FDA to collect almost $600 million in user fees over \n5 years. The FDA can use these additional resources to help hire and \ntrain staff.\n  Furthermore, the bill makes important improvements by streamlining \nthe review process for devices and increasing communication between the \nFDA and device manufacturers throughout the review process. These \nchanges to the review of medical devices will not only help innovative \ndevice companies get their product to market faster, but will prevent \npatients from having to wait extra weeks and months to benefit from a \nnew device.\n  In addition to reauthorizing the Prescription Drug and Medical Device \nUser Fee Acts, this bill also establishes the Drug User Fee Act and \nBiosimilar User Fee Act, which gives the FAA new authority to collect \nuser fees for generic and biosimilar drugs. Currently the FDA does not \ncollect user fees to support the review of generic drugs, and it takes \nabout 30 months for the agency to review generic drug applications. \nThis extra time reduces access to safe, affordable generic drugs and \nleaves patients and taxpayers paying the tab for brand-name drugs that \nlack competition from generics.\n  Since the first Prescription Drug User Fee Act was enacted in 1992, \nthe FDA began collecting user fees to support the review of \napplications. The FDA has cut the review time for new drugs by 60%, \nfrom 2 years to a little over 1 year. Similarly, the Generic Drug User \nFee Act will give the FDA the support it needs to cut the current 30-\nmonth review time for generic drugs down to 10 months. This improvement \nwill promote competition in the marketplace and save money by reducing \nthe amount of time patients have to wait for less expensive generic \nalternatives to brand name drugs. The process of negotiating and \ndrafting this legislation started 18 months ago and the result is a \ncomprehensive bill that improves the safety and quality of drugs and \nmedical devices.\n  Chairman Harkin and Senator Enzi have put together a bill that \nresponds to many of these challenges, including one that is of \nparticular interest to me----the national shortage of critical drugs. \nBetween 2006 and 2010 the drug shortage increased 200 percent from 56 \nto 178 drugs. Currently the drug shortage includes over 200 drugs, like \nintravenous nutrition supplements, cancer treating drugs, and \nanesthesia.\n  Over the past few months, I have held three roundtable discussions at \nhospitals across Illinois to learn about the drug shortage and how it \nis affecting providers and patients. From these discussions it is clear \nthat the drug shortage is being felt at most hospitals and those \nIllinois hospitals, providers, and pharmacists are working around the \nclock to ensure patients maintain access to drugs and safe treatments.\n  At Advocate Hospital in Libertyville, a doctor shared that he learned \njust days before starting a patient on chemotherapy that the drug was \nnot available. Unfortunately, this is a common scenario across the \ncountry as doctors learn days before starting a treatment or even once \nthe patient is on the hospital bed that a drug is not available. \nPharmacists now spend part of each day scrambling to find drugs or an \nalternative treatment.\n  Recently I learned that a young woman on my staff here in D.C. is all \ntoo familiar with the drug shortage. She is a smart and hard-working \nwoman who has been taking Concerta to treat her ADD since she was 14. \nLike most people with severe ADD, she must take her medicine at a \ncertain time every day in order to keep her ADD symptoms from impeding \nbasic life and work responsibilities. And while there are several ADD \ndrugs on the market, each drug works differently and can have different \nside effects, so switching to a new prescription is not without risk.\n  Last year, the local CVS where she usually had her prescription \nfilled started telling her they didn't have her drug in stock. She \ndidn't think much of it as she would wake up early and walk to another \nCVS in the morning where she was usually able to get the prescription. \nOver time, she grew accustomed to going between these two CVS \npharmacies to fill her prescription.\n  Until one month, when she carried her prescription with her for 3 \ndays and was unable to find a pharmacy with enough Concerta to fill her \n30-day prescription.\n  By the end of day 3, she was out of her supply. She woke up early and \nrode her bike to four or five CVS pharmacies until she was able to find \na pharmacy that could fill her prescription. But by then it was 12 \no'clock and past the prescribed time to take the drug.\n  The shortage of ADD drugs impacts children, adults, parents, and \nemployees across the country. Congress needs to take action to address \nthe drug shortage.\n\n  The FDA Safety and Innovation Act builds on Senator Klobuchar's bill \nwith key provisions to curb the national drug shortage. First, the bill \nrequires drug manufacturers to notify the FDA 6 months in advance for \ncertain drug shortages. With this much notice, the FDA can work with \nmanufacturers to try to avoid a shortage and, when necessary, identify \nalternative sources of the drug to ensure we maintain a supply for \npatients.\n  This winter, thanks to open communication between the FDA and drug \ncompanies, the FDA successfully avoided a shortage of methotrexate, a \nvital drug to treat leukemia in children. The FDA collaborated with \nIllinois-based generic drug manufacturer, Hospira, to increase \nproduction of this live-saving drug when another company halted \nproduction. Requiring 6 months advance notice of a drug shortage will \nhelp the FDA to work with companies to avoid shortages of critical \ndrugs.\n  Furthermore, the bill requires FDA to enhance the agency's response \nto shortages and will improve reporting of shortages by allowing third-\nparties to report drug shortages to the FDA.\n  This bill also takes steps to improve the safety of drugs and the \ndrug supply chain.\n  In 2008, serious injuries and 81 deaths were linked to contamination \nof the crucial blood thinning drug heparin. The source of the \ncontamination was a facility in China that intentionally adulterated \nthe drug. This was a horrible illustration of what happens when \nadulterated and counterfeit drugs make their way into the drug supply \nchain and ultimately to patients. This case has also raised serious \nquestions about the global manufacturing practices of drugs and drug \ningredients and the FDA's responsibility to protect the drug supply \nchain.\n  Since the heparin incident, the global nature of the drug supply \nchain has only grown. Today 80 percent of active pharmaceutical \ningredients are manufactured outside of the United States. This bill \nimproves the safety of our supply chain, both domestically and \ninternationally by requiring foreign manufacturers to register their \nfacilities with the FDA. The bill also places greater responsibility on \nU.S. drug manufacturers to know their international suppliers and \nincreases penalties for intentionally contaminating or counterfeiting \ndrug. Counterfeit and adulterated drugs can have deadly consequences, \nyet the penalty for committing these crimes is less than the penalty \nfor selling a counterfeit designer purse.\n  Currently, the penalty for intentionally counterfeiting or \nadulterating a drug is no more than 3 years in prison or a $10,000 fine \nor both.\n\n[[Page S3552]]\n\n  This bill raises the penalty for intentionally adulterating a drug to \nno more than 20 years in prison or a $1 million fine or both.\n  And the penalty for intentionally counterfeiting drugs is raised to \nno more than 20 years in prison or a $4 million fine or both.\n  This bill addresses the drug shortage, reduces the review time for \nmedical devices and drugs, improves the pipeline for antibiotics and \npediatric drugs, and helps secure the supply chain for prescription \ndrugs.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Harkin and Senator Enzi for their \nextraordinary leadership and hard work on this bill.\n  The amendment we will face this afternoon is one I am offering \nrelative to dietary supplements. I want to make it clear what this is \nabout.\n  If someone walked into their neighborhood drugstore and looked at \neverything on the shelf, here is what they can say: All the \nprescription drugs the pharmacy has access to have been reviewed by the \nFood and Drug Administration that they are safe and effective. All of \nthe over-the-counter drugs have been reviewed and registered with the \nFood and Drug Administration to make certain they are safe and have \nbeen precleared before they can be sold. Now when they move back to the \nvitamin counter, all bets are off. Those are called dietary \nsupplements. They are not subject to the same level of scrutiny, \ninspection, testing or regulation. It is an entirely different world.\n  It is understandable that there are those of us who want to be able \nto walk in and buy vitamins, for example, without a prescription. That \nis our right as Americans. But we also want to make sure that whatever \nis on the shelf at the pharmacy is not dangerous or at least we know it \nis there.\n  There are between 55,000 and 75,000 dietary supplements in America. \nWe don't know the exact number. They include the obvious, vitamins and \nminerals, but they also go further. They include energy drinks. Ever \nheard of the 5-Hour Energy Drink, Monster Energy Drink? Those are not \nsold as colas, sodas, or beverages. They are sold as dietary \nsupplements. Why? Because there is no regulation in terms of their \ncontents.\n  We had a sad story I told on the Senate floor 2 days ago, with the \nfamily in the gallery, about a 16-year-old girl from Hagerstown, MD, \nwho drank two Monster Energy Drinks within a 24-hour period and went \ninto cardiac arrest. It was too much for her heart. She died. That was \na dietary supplement.\n  My amendment says if they want to sell a dietary supplement in the \nUnited States, they have to do one basic thing: They have to go to the \nFood and Drug Administration and say: This is the name of my company. \nThis is the name of my product and the ingredients in it. And here is a \ncopy of the label. That is it.\n  So is it important that we know this? There will be 1,000 new \nproducts bought and sold in the United States as dietary supplements \nevery year. Just in case we think knowing the dietary supplement \nfacility company has been registered is enough, hang on tight. These \ndietary supplements are coming from all over the world. Sadly, a lot of \nthem turn out to be dangerous.\n  In 2009 the FDA announced that Super Slim, a dietary supplement \nmanufactured in China, contained the pharmaceutical ingredient \nsibutramine, which is no longer available in the United States and \nfound to increase the risk of heart attack or stroke. If the \nmanufacturers had registered this dietary supplement so we knew the \ningredient, we could protect American consumers.\n  The same thing was true in 2001. Another Chinese-based weight-loss \ningredient, aristolochic acid, was found to cause kidney damage and to \nbe a potent carcinogen. Isn't it important for us to know this? Is it \ntoo much to ask the dietary supplement companies to go to the FDA and \nat least register their products before they put them on the shelves \nacross America? Don't American families have the right to scrutiny and \nat least some basic knowledge of the sale of these products?\n  The industry is against this. They don't want to report it. They \nbasically say: It is none of your business. We will sell what we want \nto sell, and that is the way it will be. If we want to volunteer the \ninformation, so be it. But we don't want to be required to disclose the \ninformation.\n  There are groups that see it differently. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record letters that support my amendment. The \nCenter for Science and Public Interest and the Consumers Union are in \nsupport of this amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Center for Science in\n\n\n                                          the Public Interest,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 24, 2012.\n     Senator Dick Durbin,\n     Attn.: Binta Beard, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: The Center for Science in the Public \n     Interest is pleased that you are introducing an amendment to \n     the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that would help improve \n     public confidence in dietary supplements. Supplements are \n     poorly tested, may be contaminated, can sometimes interact \n     with pharmaceuticals, and are marketed with more hype than \n     just about any other consumer product. Your amendment would \n     do the minimum to protect both consumers and conscientious \n     companies: require disclosure to the Food and Drug \n     Administration of all ingredients, build a repository of \n     labels, and require registration with the FDA. Much more \n     really should be done to assure safety and efficacy, but we \n     hope your amendment will receive widespread support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Michael F. Jacobson,\n     Ph.D., Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 21, 2012.\n     Senator Richard J. Durbin,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: Consumers Union applauds your efforts \n     to strengthen dietary supplement safety by requiring \n     manufacturers to register their products with the Food and \n     Drug Administration (FDA). Specifically, your proposed \n     amendment to the Food and Drug Administration Safety and \n     Innovation Act (S. 3187) would require manufacturers to \n     provide the FDA with accurate and up-to-date information \n     regarding each dietary supplement product they manufacture, a \n     list of ingredients included in those products, and a copy of \n     the product labels.\n       Although many dietary supplements on the market may be safe \n     and healthful, there are numerous ingredients that may pose \n     significant dangers to consumers. Some supplement ingredients \n     could, for example, interact with prescription drugs to \n     produce dangerous side effects. Others can change the \n     effectiveness of prescription drugs. Still others could be \n     generally safe for most consumers, but have hazardous health \n     effects for certain population subgroups, such as pregnant \n     women or children.\n       Dietary supplement manufacturers are currently subject to \n     limited registration requirements as food-processing \n     facilities. However, these entities are not required to \n     register their products with the FDA, in order to facilitate \n     timely action in the event of a safety alert. As noted by the \n     U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) in its 2009 \n     report, FDA ``lacks complete information on the names and \n     location of dietary supplement firms within the agency's \n     jurisdiction,'' and does not have a comprehensive database of \n     products currently being sold in the marketplace, and the \n     ingredients they contain. This leaves the FDA without \n     adequate marketplace information, should it need to take \n     prompt or immediate action regarding supplement ingredients \n     that are dangerous or found to be adulterated.\n       Requiring manufacturers to submit a list of products sold, \n     product ingredients, and product labels to FDA on a regular \n     basis would ensure that the agency can appropriately assess \n     potential safety issues and quickly respond as they arise. \n     The FDA's post-marketing surveillance of dietary supplements \n     will be much more effective if the FDA has accurate, timely \n     information about supplement products currently available in \n     the U.S. marketplace.\n       Consumers Union believes this amendment will advance the \n     safety of dietary supplements for consumers. We thank you for \n     taking on this critically important issue, and look forward \n     to working with you to support the amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Chuck Bell,\n       Programs Director Consumers Union.\n     Ioana Rusu,\n       Regulatory Counsel Consumers Union.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask my colleagues when this vote comes before us, \nbefore we have another death in America from a dietary supplement from \nChina, India, Mexico, or even in the United States, shouldn't we \nrequire the most basic information so we know the name of the company, \nthe ingredients in the product, and what the label looks like?\n  The FDA has asked for this information. They asked expressly for this \ninformation. To say it is a burden on them, they already asked for it.\n\n[[Page S3553]]\n\n  I ask my colleagues when this amendment comes up later this afternoon \nthat they support this in the best interest of protecting American \nfamilies and consumers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 211\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise to strongly support the upcoming \nBingaman-Vitter amendment, which is basically an amendment form that \nBingaman-Vitter Fair Generics Act would stop an escalating trend in the \ndrug industry which has pay-for-delay deals between a generic \nmanufacturer and a big pharmaceutical manufacturer.\n  Over the last several years we have seen a huge increase, and we have \nseen this trend grow from modest to a raging trend, and it is \nanticompetitive. It is pay-for-delay deals in which the brand-name drug \ndealer pays off or settles with the first-to-file generic drugmaker, \noften restricting generic market entry for years into the future.\n  As prescription drug prices explode, they put real pressure and \nburdens on many Americans' budgets because they are making medications \nthat should be more affordable in terms of coming onto the market. They \nare postponing those drugs, paying for the delay, and holding them off \nthe market longer and longer.\n  The FTC has compiled data and made clear that this trend is \nhappening, and the FTC, an official government agency, said:\n\n       The continued trends of record numbers of brands and \n     generics resolving patent litigation prior to a final court \n     decision [yields] significant numbers of such settlements \n     potentially involving pay-for-delay.\n\n  Those were the FTC's words.\n  In 2004 the FTC had identified zero of those sorts of pay-for-delay \ndeals. In 2006 it was up to 14. In 2011 it doubled to 28. Clearly it is \na big trend. That is ``28 final settlements (that) contain both \ncompensation to the generic manufacturer and a restriction on the \ngeneric manufacturer's ability to market its product.''\n  This fair generics bill, through this amendment, fixes the problem. \nThat was the intent of the original Hatch-Waxman language, but there \nwas a loophole that has been exploited in this pay-for-delay deal \nbecause the first filer is granted exclusivity even if the first filer \nis paid off and settles and doesn't pursue its ability to enter the \nmarket.\n  The Fair Generics Act would fix that, and it would basically outlaw \nthat sort of marketing of generics. It would realign and reaffirm the \nincentive and reward not just for filing first but for successfully \nchallenging and invalidating a patent. So we would move the first \nfiling exclusivity to a reward for filing and also successfully \ninvalidating a patent.\n  It is a realistic proposal. It would allow the first filer to follow \nthrough on that filing. It would encourage it, but also if that is not \ngoing to happen, it would allow subsequent filers to litigate and \nvalidate the patent and thereby gain ability to enter the \nmarketplace. I really think this was the intent of Hatch-Waxman.\n\n  Unfortunately, there is a loophole that has been exploited in Hatch-\nWaxman that has led to these serious pay-for delay cases. Again, this \nis an escalating trend that is still growing. I have no doubt that when \nwe get the number for 2012, it is going to be significantly above the \n2011 number of 28.\n  So to simplify it, if the first filer does not enter into a \nsettlement with the restricted and delayed market entry date and if it \ndoes diligently challenge and invalidate a patent, nothing changes \nunder present law. The current 6-month market exclusivity reward \nremains. So that incentive, that reward absolutely remains. However, if \nthat doesn't happen and the first filer just wants to settle or park \nits filing and is generic, a subsequent filer would have the ability to \nstep up and challenge the patent and, if it won, it would have market \naccess.\n  This solution provides more litigation certainty. We propose \nbasically a use-it-or-lose-it statute for the brand name to sue the \ngeneric within the 45-day window. Current law provides a brand \nmanufacturer a 30-month stay if they sue the generic within the 45-day \nwindow but still allows a suit after.\n  So, again, I believe this is a reasonable and measured approach. This \nis not as Draconian or dramatic an approach as other proposals in the \nSenate. I believe this is the middle ground, and I believe this honors \nand gets us back to the original intent on this subject of Hatch-\nWaxman. But it is a measured response to this escalating trend that we \nclearly see, that the FTC has objectively identified and measured--a \nso-called pay-for-delay arrangement.\n  In conclusion, the goal of Hatch-Waxman was to bring generics to the \nmarket more quickly. This approach, the FAIR Generics Act, will do \nthat. There are anticompetitive deals that are being struck more and \nmore often--pay for delay--and they are becoming much more prevalent, \nand they are hurting American families.\n  The mega-lobbyist pharmaceutical industry, of course, opposes this \nreform because, quite frankly, those pay-for-delay deals are a way to \nbuy more exclusivity and keep generics off the market longer. But that \nis not in the interests of the consumer. It is time to stand up to \nthem. It is time to have some courage, to stand up to Big Pharma and \nsay: We are going to preserve your exclusivity for developing a drug, \nbut we are not going to let you buy off generics and unfairly extend \nthat time period. We are going to let generics come to market in a \nreasonable time. We are going to create incentives to make sure that \nhappens.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support that proposal, which is \nembodied in the Bingaman-Vitter amendment, the FAIR Generics Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Bingaman amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, first I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I thank Senator Vitter for his \ncomments and for his strong support of this amendment. I thank all of \nthe other cosponsors of the legislation.\n  If we are interested in promoting competition in the health care \nfield so that we can keep prices down, then we need to support this \namendment. That is exactly what this does.\n  Under our law in this country, we provide exclusive rights to a \ncompany that develops a drug to sell that drug during the time the \npatent is in effect. But what we are concerned with here is that after \nthat patent is no longer valid, companies are still extending their \nexclusivity, extending their time when they don't have any competition \nby entering into these agreements. So we think they can settle their \ndisputes--we don't have a problem there--but they cannot keep other \ngeneric manufacturers from coming to the market who also have \ndemonstrated the invalidity of a patent.\n  If we are worried about the cost of health care to the Federal \nGovernment--the Federal Government is paying too much for prescription \ndrugs because of this flaw in the Hatch-Waxman Act that we are trying \nto correct. If we are worried about keeping prices down for hospitals, \ninsurance companies, and consumers, this amendment will help to do \nthat.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise today to oppose the amendment \naddressing the patent settlements for generic claims.\n  I am sympathetic to the intent of the sponsors of this amendment. I \nbelieve that some drug patent settlements may be improper and could be \nunfairly increasing drug prices for consumers. If that is in fact \nhappening, we should stop the bad settlements and encourage the ones \nthat work.\n  The problem with this amendment, however, is that its scope is much \nbroader and could lead to unintended consequences that could harm \nconsumers and increase costs. That is why I must oppose it. The \namendment uses a machete when a scalpel might solve the problem. Not \nall patent settlements are abusive. They do not all lead to higher \ncosts. In fact, some settlements can actually expedite generic drugs \ncoming to market. According to\n\n[[Page S3554]]\n\none recent study by RBC Capital Markets, patent settlements helped \nexpedite 24 of the 37 most recent generic drug approvals.\n  The amendment would allow competing generic manufacturers, in certain \ncases, to share the 180 days of exclusivity provided under the drug \npatent law known as Hatch-Waxman. This period of exclusivity was \nintended to create a market incentive for generic manufacturers to be \nthe first to file a generic drug application with FDA.\n  The amendment is intended to discourage generic manufacturers from \nreaching settlements with brand manufacturers to delay generic \ncompetition. Unfortunately, it may also have the unintended consequence \nof discouraging generic competition generally.\n  The Hatch-Waxman statute, which first established our current system \nof brand and generic drug approvals, was a careful compromise of \ncompeting interests. It struck a balance between encouraging research \nand development of new cures and promoting competition to lower costs. \nBy all accounts, this law has been a success. Our Nation leads the \nworld in the creation of new drugs and therapies that improve the lives \nof countless patients across the world. At the same time, generic drugs \nhave promoted competition and lowered costs to American patients. \nAccording to one recent estimate, generic drugs have saved the American \nhealth care system over $930 billion over the last decade.\n  This amendment would disrupt that system and reduce the incentives \nthat currently encourage manufacturers to file generic drug \napplications with the FDA. Allowing competitors to share the 180 days \nof exclusivity will undermine the market incentives for manufacturers \nto make such filings. It will also create uncertainty about whether \ngeneric manufacturers will ultimately be able to recoup their \ninvestments and could mean that there will be fewer generic drugs.\n  That is why the generic drug manufacturers oppose this amendment. \nWhile I genuinely appreciate the desire to prevent abusive settlements, \nI believe that we must be very careful in disrupting a system that has \nworked so well for patients and consumers.\n  We should hold hearings in the HELP Committee to hear from all of the \nstakeholders who have a role in this system. We need to learn how any \nproposal will impact the incentives to encourage competition. We also \nneed to learn how any proposed solutions will affect settlements and \npatent litigation.\n  This is clearly an important and very complex issue, but this \namendment could have serious and detrimental consequences for patients. \nThis is why I would urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask for support of the amendment \nthat is before us. This is an amendment that will actually strengthen \nthe role of NOAA as the Federal agency that has oversight over our \nfisheries.\n  Currently the FDA is considering an application for a genetically \nengineered fish, a fish that takes DNA from one salmon and an ell pout \nto accelerate the growth unnaturally. The FDA is not looking at \nlabeling this fish. The FDA is not considering the environmental impact \nof escapement on this fish into the marine environment.\n  What we are asking for with this amendment is as the FDA proceeds in \nits process that the agency that has oversight of our fisheries be \nallowed to participate and weigh in as to whether there are any \nenvironmental consequences that may come about as a consequence of a \nrelease into a marine environment.\n  This is a situation where people have a right to know about the \nquality of their fish, where it comes from, what it is made of. What I \nam asking is for the agency that has oversight of our fisheries to have \na role in this process. I urge Members to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise in opposition to speak for 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute in opposition. The Senator \nis recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I fear this legislation would insert \nCongress in the scientific process of approving applications that we \nhave entrusted to the FDA. This application has been pending at FDA for \nover 15 years. We should allow the FDA to complete their scientific \nreview of the product and not interfere with the ongoing reviews.\n  We have a science-based system that allows for complete review. We \nshould allow that process to continue. This amendment sets up a two-\ntiered, two-agency approval system. That is not good. We know the FDA \nhas already conferred with NOAA regarding the pending application.\n  Basically, Members of the Senate should not put on lab coats and tell \nthe FDA to approve or deny the pending application. We should allow \nthem to act on the statutory authority that is given to them. I \nreluctantly oppose the amendment of my colleague from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, this would be the first time Congress has \never interfered in an FDA-based, science-based approval process.

The Senator from Iowa controls 15 minutes, and \nthe Senator from Wyoming controls 22 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time does the Senator from Tennessee need?\n  Mr. CORKER. Three minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. OK, that is fine.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will, too, if he needs it.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I rise to thank both the majority and \nminority leaders of the bill for their great effort. I am pleased to \nspeak about a provision in the FDA Safety Innovation Act that addresses \na growing public threat in Tennessee and Connecticut and across the \nNation.\n  Several months ago, Senator Blumenthal and I introduced the GAIN Act, \nwhich is a bipartisan provision that provides a meaningful market \nincentive and reduces regulatory burdens to encourage development of \nnew antibiotics that will help save lives and reduce health care costs.\n  Drug-resistant bacteria, or ``superbugs'' as we call them, are \nbecoming harder to treat because we lack new antibiotics capable of \ncombating these infections. Not only do these infections take a toll on \npatients and their families, but they also run up health care spending \nto the tune of $35 billion to $45 billion annually.\n  It is crucial that these new antibiotics are discovered in order to \nstay ahead of the growing trend of drug resistance. Drug discoveries do \nnot happen overnight, so we must act now to ensure that we have \nlifesaving medications when we need them.\n  The GAIN Act is a straightforward, commonsense bill that provides \nmarket incentives to encourage innovation without putting Federal \ndollars at stake, and it is included in this FDA reauthorization. \nAntibiotic resistance is a growing issue that we need to address now to \nproperly prepare for the future.\n  Dr. William Evans, director and CEO of St. Jude's Hospital in \nTennessee, wrote a letter supporting this bill, which says:\n\n       We don't want to find ourselves in a situation in which we \n     have been able to save a child's life after a cancer \n     diagnosis only to lose them to an untreatable multi-drug \n     resistant infection.\n\n  I thank Senator Blumenthal from Connecticut for his leadership on \nthis bill. I especially thank Senators Harkin and Enzi for working with \nus the way they have to include this provision in the FDA Safety and \nInnovation Act.\n  I think I have stayed within my time limit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nOhio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 2145 and 2146\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I thank the ranking member and \ncongratulate him for the good work today on this legislation.\n  There are a couple of amendments that are part of the bill I want to \nspeak about. First is on prescription drug abuse--a problem we all face \nas representatives of our States. I particularly thank Senator \nWhitehouse for his partnership on this important bill.\n  In the last decade, unfortunately, prescription drug abuse has \nreached epidemic proportions in States such as Ohio, and in so many \nother States around the country. In doing so, it has devastated the \nlives of so many individuals but also the well-being of our \ncommunities, and of course affected their families, affected our \neconomy, and it has caused a big spike in crimes, including theft, as \naddicts look for ways to support their addictions. This crime, of \ncourse, has doubly strained law enforcement, which has already had to \ncontend with the increase in drug trafficking with constrained budgets. \nIt has also served as a gateway to other drug use, including heroin \nuse, which tends to be less expensive and causes additional public \nhealth challenges.\n  Amazingly, since 2007, drug overdoses have now moved ahead of car \naccidents as the leading cause of accidental death in my home State of \nOhio. Again, we have seen this, unfortunately, too often around the \ncountry. We have had record levels of hepatitis C infection from needle \nsharing. In one county on the Ohio River, in southern Ohio, 10 percent \nof the babies born in 2010 had drugs in their system.\n  The good news is progress is being made in places such as Scioto \nCounty and around the country thanks to the good work of health \nprofessionals, law enforcement, local, State, and Federal officials, \nalong with community groups, families, schools, churches, and others. \nBut they need some help. More work needs to be done, and one critical \ntool they are looking for in the fight against prescription drug abuse \nis a better way to monitor prescription drug use. There are databases \naround the country called prescription drug monitoring programs. They \nallow States to monitor and track the dispensing of prescription drug \nmedications by health care providers to be able to identify and stop \nthe abuse of people getting prescriptions for these drugs in various \ndifferent doctors' offices and in what have been called pill mills. \nPreliminary research has shown monitoring programs are highly effective \nin stemming the tide of abuse. That is why 48 States and 1 territory\n\n[[Page S3556]]\n\nnow have them, with 41 of them operational.\n  There is a problem, however. Different States' monitoring programs \ncan't communicate with one another, so one State doesn't know what the \nother State is doing, and drug trafficking is an interstate problem. \nThis is especially true in places such as Scioto County in southern \nOhio, right across the river from Kentucky and bordering West Virginia. \nWe want these States to be able to work together, and that is why \nSenator Whitehouse and I have offered this amendment, No. 2145, as a \nFederal solution to providing a framework for monitoring programs to \nparticipate in data sharing across State lines.\n  This amendment also supports collaboration between the Department of \nHealth and Human Services and the Bureau of Justice Assistance in order \nto further their research to assess challenges that have an impact on \nStates' interoperability.\n  Some have called for a national monitoring program--one Federal \nprogram. I don't think that is necessary. I don't think it will work as \nwell. A lot of States have programs that are working extremely well and \nthey have put a lot of money into them. There are differing protected \nhealth standards State by State. So rather than trying to federalize \nit, our amendment gets these disparate programs to work together \nsecurely, reliably, and efficiently without undermining or jeopardizing \nthe State's autonomy in this area. States should remain free to \nestablish laws that determine user eligibility and reporting \nrequirements. So this amendment is to help, again, give these \ncommunities the tools they need to fight this prescription drug abuse.\n  Finally, I would say that our amendment has no effect on direct \nspending or revenues over the 10-year period.\n  The other amendment I want to mention also has to do with substance \nabuse--about the dangers of what we unfortunately all here in this \nChamber have heard about--and that is synthetic drug abuse, including \nK2 Spice, bath salts, and herbal incense. Today we have an opportunity \nto do something about this problem. Let's prohibit these drugs from \ngetting into the hands of our children, our service men and women, and \nothers.\n  This amendment addresses the growing use and misuse of synthetic \ndrugs by placing 15 cannabinoids, 2 stimulants, and 9 hallucinogens in \nSchedule I to expose those who manufacture, distribute, possess, \nimport, and export synthetic drugs without proper authority to the full \nspectrum of criminal, civil, and administrative penalties, sanctions, \nand regulatory controls.\n  I want to give special thanks to the people who led this effort over \nthe years--Senators Grassley, Schumer, and Klobuchar. They have worked \nhard on this issue, and we are all pleased this is part of the \nunderlying legislation. It was Senator Grassley, as well as the folks \nfrom the Community Anti-Drug Coalition, who originally introduced me to \nthe prevalence of designer drugs. I was told of the story of David \nMitchell Rozga and many others who have suffered, and of some of the \ndeaths that have occurred around the country.\n  This amendment, again, would have no significant effect on direct \nspending or revenues over a 10-year period and is a good, commonsense \napproach to trying to get our hands around this issue and help the \nconstituents we represent and help our communities fight to stem this \nparticular substance abuse that is affecting us all.\n  Madam President, I yield the remainder of my time, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, if I may inquire of the Senator how much \ntime she wishes.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. I would request 6 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield 6 minutes off the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. First, Madam President, I do want to applaud the hard \nwork of the Senate HELP Committee chairman Tom Harkin and the ranking \nmember Senator Mike Enzi. This bill is truly one of the most bipartisan \nefforts I have had the opportunity to be a part of in the 3 years I \nhave served in the Senate. It ought to be a reminder that, yes, when we \nwork together across the aisle, the Senate can get things done.\n  I am particularly proud to support this bill because of what it will \nmean for patients who are suffering with diseases, who do not have \naccess to adequate treatments, or who do not have access to any \ntreatment at all. This bill we are voting on includes key provisions of \nthe TREAT Act--the Transforming the Regulatory Environment to \nAccelerate Access to Treatments Act--which I introduced in February. \nThese important provisions will expedite the review of treatments for \nserious or life-threatening diseases without compromising the FDA's \nalready high standards for safety and effectiveness.\n  I introduced the TREAT Act after meeting with a family whose child \nsuffered from spinal muscular atrophy or SMA. This is an incurable \nneuromuscular disease and is the leading genetic cause of infant \ndeaths. Of course, that family was not alone. There are 30 million \nAmericans suffering from rare diseases, and I have had the honor to \nmeet a number of them. Their stories are both heartbreaking and \ninspiring.\n  When I visited the North Carolina Children's Hospital last month, I \nmet with Megan and Jarrod Hendren of Lumberton, NC, whose 13-month-old \ntwins Logan and Lucas suffer from Gaucher's disease. This disease is a \npainful and potentially debilitating metabolic disorder for which \ncurrently there is no cure.\n  I also met with 8-year-old Ashley Burnette from Raleigh, who is \nresilient and wise beyond her years, but who is suffering from \nneuroblastoma.\n  For the families and patients like these, suffering from these rare \ndiseases for which there are no approved medications, medical advances \ncannot come fast enough. There are so many rare diseases, but fewer \nthan 250 have FDA-approved therapies. The provisions of the TREAT Act \nthat have been included in this bill take great steps toward resolving \nthe problem.\n  There is currently a pathway at the FDA to expedite the review of \ndrugs for illnesses that are serious or life-threatening and for which \nthere is no adequate treatment. This is called the Accelerated approval \npathway. Since the early 1990s, it has been successfully used to \nadvance treatments for patients with HIV and cancer by leaps and \nbounds. However, it has not been applied regularly or consistently to \nthe review of drugs to treat other diseases.\n  This inconsistency is why I introduced the TREAT Act. My bill will \nbroaden the application of the accelerated approval pathway beyond HIV/\nAIDS and cancer to a wider range of diseases, with a particular focus \non rare diseases. That is why my proposal enjoys broad support from \npatient advocates, including the National Organization of Rare \nDiseases, Us Against Alzheimers, Parkinson's Action Network, the \nHuntington's Disease Society of America, and many more.\n  By providing for consistent application, we will help the FDA \nimplement these provisions, assist drug sponsors to navigate the \napproval process, and, hopefully, bring safe and effective treatments \nmore rapidly to the patients who need them.\n  I am also proud to have played a critical role in the legislation \nthat led to the negotiations of the first biosimilars user fee \nagreement, which is also included in the bill before us. Last Congress, \nwe passed the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act to \nfacilitate the introduction of lower cost alternatives to biologic \ndrugs, while ensuring continued research and development into \ninnovative biologics which can save or improve the lives of millions of \nAmericans.\n  The user fees negotiated by the industry and the FDA will provide the \nnecessary funding for the review of these critical therapies. The \nbiosimilars industry is in the earliest stages of development, and the \nbiosimilars user fee agreement will help facilitate this industry's \ngrowth.\n  In addition, the FDA Safety and Innovation Act provides the necessary \nregulatory updates to keep pace with the rapid innovations of the \nbiopharmaceutical industry. This is imperative for creating jobs in \nStates such as mine--in North Carolina--and maintaining America's \ncompetitive edge in the global economy.\n  Companies with footprints in North Carolina are partnering with our \nworld-class universities to improve the health of people all across the \nglobe\n\n[[Page S3557]]\n\nevery day by researching, discovering, and developing lifesaving \ntreatments for those suffering from these devastating diseases.\n  Passing the FDA Safety and Innovation Act for States such as North \nCarolina, and for our Nation, to remain global leaders is important. It \nis especially important if we are to help attract the jobs of the \nfuture.\n  The American public also expects the FDA to be the world's gold \nstandard when it comes to ensuring the supply, the safety, and the \nintegrity of our drug supply. By sending the FDA Safety and Innovation \nAct to the President's desk, we will establish a clear and effective \npathway for turning ideas into cures and cures into treatments. And we \nwill have shown the foresight and flexibility required to maintain our \ncountry's position at the top of the medical treatment and device \nindustries.\n  I thank the Chair and I urge my colleagues to join in supporting the \nFDA Safety and Innovation Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the McCain \namendment No. 2107. I appreciate the intent of Senator McCain to make \nlower cost drugs available to the American people, but I have many \nflashing lights about this amendment. I bring this from knowledge of \nbeing both on the Intelligence Committee and also in working with the \nFBI as the chair of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and Science.\n  This amendment allows individuals to import FDA approved drugs from \nCanada. It sounds great, but we don't know if the drug was made in \nCanada. No HHS Secretary has been able to demonstrate that importation \nwill be safe. It is ironic that some faux populists who oppose a public \noption, who oppose allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, support \nimporting price controls from Canada. This amendment doesn't guarantee \ncost savings for consumers, Medicare, Medicaid, or insurers.\n  I oppose this amendment for four reasons. First, it is a budget \nbuster. Enforcing this will take enormous amounts of resources, and the \namendment doesn't give the FDA the human resources, the financial \nresources, or the technological resources to ensure the safety of these \ndrugs for U.S. consumers. It doesn't give FDA the resources to inspect \nand certify the brick-and-mortar and Internet-based Canadian \npharmacies, nor does it give FDA the resources to verify that these \npharmacies comply with Canada's laws. We all know that FDA needs more \nmoney to carry out its existing responsibilities overseas and \ndomestically. The agency doesn't need another unfunded mandate.\n  The second reason I oppose this amendment is because I am concerned \nabout organized crime and counterfeiting. We have a history of phony \ndrugs coming from rogue Web sites. We cannot be sure that the drugs \ncoming from Canada are not a counterfeit, lethal drug. There is no \nguarantee that these drugs originate from the legitimate supply chain. \nWhere there is compelling, compassionate human need, there is greed. \nWhere there is greed, there are scams and schemes. In this case, the \nscams and schemes can be lethal.\n  The third reason I oppose this amendment is that it doesn't exempt \nbiologics. Biologics are different from chemical drugs. There is no way \nto ensure that the supply chain remains intact and that the product \nthat reaches your doorstep will be effective. Because biologics tend to \nbe more expensive than chemical drugs, criminals will make more money \nby counterfeiting them.\n  The final reason I oppose this amendment is because it doesn't \nguarantee that the drug you buy will be bioequivalent to the FDA-\napproved drug. How will consumers be assured that the drug they buy \nonline is metabolized the same way? Also, what guarantee is there that \nthe packaging and labeling will be identical?\n  We have examples of awful things that have happened. Interpol and the \nUnited States have seized millions of counterfeit pills. These drugs \nwere made in unsanitary conditions and were deadly and ineffective. \nRemember the contaminated Heparin from China that killed over 150 \npeople. Then there was cough syrup made from antifreeze instead of \nglycerin. Seventy-eight people died. There are also the ineffective \ndrugs that may not kill you but certainly won't improve your health. I \ncould list more, but I urge my colleagues to go talk to the FDA, FBI, \nand Customs and Border Protection and hear firsthand what they have \nexperienced.\n  Counterfeiting is a real threat. It is a matter of life and death. We \nhave to make affordable drugs in our own country, and we did so by \nclosing the doughnut hole in health reform. Today we are doing so \nagain. The FDA user fee reauthorization before us creates the first \never generic drug user fee program. It will speed generic drug entry \ninto the U.S. market so that consumers get safe FDA approved drugs more \nquickly and cheaply.\n  If you want safety, then defeat the McCain amendment.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to support the \ngoal of my friend and colleague from New Mexico of delivering lower \ncost medicines to Americans. But, unfortunately, I cannot support his \nunderlying amendment, No. 2111 to S. 3187. I agree that we should \nincrease access to generic drugs wherever we can, and I agree that the \npath to market for generic products is fraught with legal challenges. \nBut I have several concerns about the amendment. First, as convoluted \nas it seems, the Hatch-Waxman law that created the pathway to bring \ngeneric drugs to market has been a tremendous success in doing just \nthat. Eighty percent of the drugs on the market now are generic, and \nover the last decade consumers have saved $931 billion on their drug \ncosts as a result. There is clearly a balance in the system, and \nmechanisms within that system are working to bring generics to market.\n  As I understand it, a key element of generic entry into the market is \nthe incentive to challenge brand-name patents. The underlying amendment \nchanges the key incentive for generic manufacturers--the 180 days of \nmarket exclusivity. The amendment allows late filers to now share in \nthe exclusivity, significantly reducing the incentive for companies to \nfile early and ensuring that products get to market as quickly as \npossible. Generic manufacturers have a limited window for market \nadvantage, and it is the revenues gained during this incentive period \nthat fuel additional product development. There is a balance here. If \nwe need to adjust that balance, I think it needs to be done in a \nbroader context. We need to be sure that any changes that we might make \ndo not disrupt the balance and inadvertently harm consumers.\n  While other aspects of the amendment are well-meaning, they may also \nhave unintended consequences. I look forward to continuing the dialog \non this issue with my colleague and others as we all work collectively \nto provide lower cost medicines to our constituents while maintaining \nan appropriate incentive for companies to innovate and develop the \ntherapies that patients need.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that the time during the quorum call be taken off \nof the Burr amendment and be equally divided on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized for 10 minutes \nand that the time be taken from the Burr amendment and equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2131\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, we have three counties in Delaware. The\n\n[[Page S3558]]\n\nsouthernmost county is called Sussex County. Several years ago, I was \nprivileged to visit a Methodist Church there and speak as a lay speaker \nto try to encourage people to become mentors.\n  The minister that day was a great old guy, Reverend Reynolds. He is \nnow deceased, but he said to me that day these words, and I have never \nforgotten them. He said, ``The main thing is to keep the main thing the \nmain thing.''\n  That is what he said. ``The main thing is to keep the main thing the \nmain thing.''\n  At first I wasn't sure what he was talking about, but the more I \nthought about it I thought: Boy, this guy is smart. And if I am smart, \nI will keep the main thing the main thing.\n  For us in the Senate and in Congress, the main thing for the voters \nof this country is they want us to work together--well, maybe the two \nmain things are they want us to work together--they want Democrats and \nRepublicans to work together--and they want us to get things done. One \nof the things they want us to get done is to create what I call a \nnurturing environment for job creation and job preservation. They want \nus to do things that are going to help encourage the creation of jobs \nand the preservation of jobs.\n  Little known to a lot of folks across the country, we actually have \nbeen doing some of that in the Senate for much of this year, and we \nhave worked productively across party lines to pass a series of bills \nthat I think do help create a more nurturing environment for job \npreservation and job creation.\n  Just a couple examples, if I could: One, the reauthorization of the \nFederal Aviation Administration to establish a new source of additional \nrevenues to modernize and update airports across the country, to bring \nthe air traffic control system of our country into the 21st century \nwhere we had kind of an analogue system, and to bring it into the \ndigital age.\n  Patent reform was another significant step forward earlier this year, \nwhere we said enough of this patent patrol--people who come in after \nsomeone has filed for a patent and say: Oh, no, that was my idea, and \njust botch things up and drag things out in the courts. Under patent \nreform legislation, if you are first to file, you are first to file, \nand that is your patent. Also provided in the same legislation are the \nresources needed in the Patent Office to more expeditiously process \npatent applicants.\n  Free-trade agreements. One of our roles as the government is to try \nto make sure we have access to foreign markets. If our goods and \nservices are being closed out in those foreign markets, then we have to \nopen them up. We agreed by a broad bipartisan proposal this year--three \nof them, actually, three free-trade agreements--one with South Korea, \none with Colombia, one with Panama negotiated originally by the George \nW. Bush administration and embraced by the Obama administration, which \nis now the law of the land, to make sure when businesses have the \nopportunity to export, the barriers that have maybe kept them out in \nthe past are knocked down or eliminated, and to make sure if American \nbusinesses need financing and help to finance their exports, that they \nhave that kind of help through the Export-Import Bank, which we have \nreauthorized and extended into the future.\n  Another one that we worked on this year together, a bipartisan bill \nand supported by the President, is something called the JOBS Act. What \nit is all about is trying to make sure companies have better access to \ncapital, and if a small or medium privately held company wants to go \npublic, to make sure they can do it through something called an IPO \nonramp as opposed to just trying to jump into it and get it done all at \nonce. Or for companies that want to stay privately held, for them to be \ncapped at 1964 levels, 500 shareholders, to say they can go up to \n1,000, 2,000 shareholders to enable them to have that access to capital \nto continue to grow and to create jobs.\n  Other examples of bipartisan legislation we worked on, in one case \nthe Transportation bill--land transportation: roads, highways, bridges, \nand transit--we passed a good bill in the Senate, paid for, to help \nover the next couple of years to meet our transportation needs and make \nsure the 3 million people who are working on transportation and transit \nprojects across the country don't basically get laid off in a month or \ntwo. We passed a good bill. I give a lot of credit to Senators Boxer \nand Inhofe for helping to lead the bipartisan approach.\n  Also, 7 or 8 million jobs depend on the Postal Service. The Postal \nService is in tough straits, running out of money and losing $125 \nmillion a day. We are hoping that the House of Representatives will \npass the bill--they need to--so we can go to conference and help fix \nthat problem. But there is good bipartisan legislation here to effect \npositively 7 or 8 million jobs that depend on the Postal Service. All \nthat stuff, in terms of the American people wanting us to work \ntogether, and we have been. Those are just a couple examples.\n\n  In terms of actually doing things that help create jobs and preserve \njobs, every one of the items I just mentioned does create a more \nnurturing environment for job creation and job preservation. In the \ncoming weeks, we also want to work on agricultural legislation--a \nbipartisan bill, again, out of the Agriculture Committee that will save \nbillions of dollars on the deficit side. It will also help to \nstrengthen our agricultural economy.\n  We need to get to work on a national flood insurance update, and that \nlegislation helps to bolster the home building industry in this country \nwhich is struggling, as we know, and we have the opportunity for those \nthings that are on our to-do list, to get them done.\n  Today the Senate is considering another bipartisan piece of \nlegislation, as we know, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and \nInnovation Act, affectionately known by its acronym. I don't like \nacronyms, but I love this one. It is called PDUFA. So it is the FDA and \nhow we make sure the FDA has the resources they need to do their job. \nAs the other bills passed by the Senate I just talked about, this bill \nhelps create a more nurturing environment for those businesses to \nthrive. Those businesses include the pharmaceutical business and \nbusinesses that make and sell medical devices. But just as important, \nthis bill helps to ensure that Americans get access to lifesaving \nmedications and medical devices that are developed in this country as \nsoon and as safely as possible.\n  This bill reflects a strong bipartisan, bicameral effort, for which \nChairman Harkin and ranking member Mike Enzi deserve enormous praise, \nand I praise them even though they are not in the Chamber right now. \nThey have done great work, and I thank them and their staffs for \nbringing it to this point today.\n  The legislation builds upon the successful current user fee programs. \nFor a number of years, the companies have paid a user fee if they want \nthe FDA to approve a drug or medical device, and we are making progress \nto actually have more resources for the FDA to do this than we used to. \nBut they need some additional help, and this legislation would do that, \npaid for by the industries that are seeking the consideration of their \nnew pharmaceuticals and their new medical devices.\n  The legislation also adds important new user fees for generic and \nbiological drugs. The user fees are paid, again, by the prescription \ndrug and medical device industries to help cover the FDA's costs for \nreviewing new drugs and medical devices.\n  What this means is safer drugs and a speedier process to bring new \nand less expensive drugs and medical devices to markets for consumers, \nand I think it is a win-win for just about everybody.\n  As a result of the FDA legislation affectionately known as PDUFA, the \nFDA's drug review times have already been cut in half. That is good. If \nthese user fees, these user programs are not reauthorized, though, the \nFDA would have to lay off, I am told, about 2,000 employees, which \nwould put them back in the ditch, if you will, and begin to delay \napproval of new drugs. We don't want to see that happen. That would \nthreaten patent access to new therapies, as well as pharmaceutical and \nmedical device industry jobs, and America's global leadership in \nbiomedical innovation.\n  This bill also makes medicines safer for millions of children, \nimproves the FDA's tools to police the global drug supply chain, and \nreduces the risk of drug shortages. There are a number of amendments \nthat are being offered to the bill--we have voted on a couple of\n\n[[Page S3559]]\n\nthose--and one of the amendments that we will be voting on, I believe, \na little later this afternoon is legislation that would, in my view, \nweaken or contaminate our country's supply of prescription drugs and \nput our patients and our health care system at risk.\n  Some of my colleagues have proposed to include a measure in this bill \nthat ostensibly would lower prescription drug prices. This amendment, \nin my view, however, is not without unintended consequences, and we \nalways have to be careful of those.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CARPER. I ask unanimous consent for 3 more minutes equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Unfortunately, it would open our borders to increased \nnumbers of contaminated and adulterated drugs.\n  The proposal to import drugs from Canada would allow drugs to be \nimported wholesale, often from illegal Internet pharmacies with no \nprotection against abuse or contamination.\n  Also, though this measure is supposed to be about importing drugs \nfrom Canada, in truth it would allow drugs to come from countries that \ndon't have the kind of strong inspection and policing of prescription \ndrugs that we have in the United States.\n  Instead of going down that road, we should work to increase the FDA's \nabilities to protect and regulate our drug supply. While doing so, we \nshould reject any proposals to import drugs from Canada that undermine \nour ability to ensure that prescription drugs are safe and effective.\n  One last thing I want to mention is there is an amendment that is \ngoing to be offered today--or maybe already has been, but I am going to \nmention this anyway--that deals with generic drugs and concern about \nthe ability for larger pharmaceutical companies to work with and pay \noff, buy out the generic drug companies so they don't bring their \ngeneric version of the name-brand drug to market. I just want to say \nthat we need to be careful what we are doing here.\n  I came out of the Navy and came to this Congress in 1983 as a \nfreshman Congressman. In 1982, 20 percent of the prescriptions being \nfilled in this country were generic drugs. This year, 80 percent of the \nmedicines or prescriptions that are being filled are generic. One of \nthe well-intentioned amendments to have been offered today is one that \nsays we are not making enough progress toward allowing the generics to \ngrow. Say that again?\n  We have gone from 20 percent generic penetration in 1982 to, today, \n80 percent. I would suggest that we should declare victory, and as time \ngoes by, even that 80 percent will become 85 percent or 90 percent. But \nwe have come a long way. As a result of that, people who need to buy \nmedicine can find a generic version of almost any medicine that is \nbeing sold in this country. I think the system is working just fine, \nand we ought to allow it to continue to work.\n  In closing, the main thing is the main thing. The main thing is to \nkeep the main thing the main thing.\n  For us, the main thing is to work together. We are in a whole host of \nways--including under the great leadership of Senator Harkin and \nSenator Enzi--working to make sure our pharmaceutical industry is \nvibrantly strong, the medical device industry is vitally strong, but \nalso that patients are not disadvantaged, that they are actually \nadvantaged by all of that.\n  So responding to folks in Delaware and Iowa and across the country, \nwe are working together. We are not just working together on a couple \nof things but on a whole host of things, a whole litany of provisions \nand laws and proposals that do what: help us to create a more nurturing \nenvironment for job creation and job preservation. That is a good \nthing. That is a very good thing.\n  I thank Senator Harkin for giving me a chance to say a few words and \nfor the great work that he and Senator Enzi have done. I am happy to \nfollow their leadership here today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I appreciate the remarks made by my good \nfriend from Delaware. I thank him and his staff for their input on this \nbill. Again, this bill is the work of a lot of different people, and I \nwant to thank the Senator from Delaware for helping us get to the point \nwhere we have a good consensus bill.\n  Madam President, is there any time remaining on the Burr amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining on the Burr \namendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I yield 6 minutes off of the McCain \namendment, on our side, to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2107\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I rise to speak against amendment \nNo. 2107, the one that talks about pharmaceutical products, medicines. \nWe know how important the prescription medicines are in improving \nhealth in this country and the need to make sure those drugs are safe \nand affordable. Prescription drugs have brought great advances in \nhealth outcomes. Just look at how much longer people are living. Over \nthe past century, life expectancy increased from 49 years to 77 years. \nWe know that beneficial drugs need to be more affordable and more \nreadily available. But allowing drugs to enter into the United States \nfrom other countries is not the answer.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services found that importing \nprescription drugs might save 1 to 2 percent on their prescription \ndrugs--and I am not describing that as insignificant--but these are \nmodest savings compared to what the outcome might be.\n  Importing risky prescription drugs from other countries could cause \nmore health problems, more suffering, and in the final analysis, more \nexpensive treatments. Americans buy medicine to lower their \ncholesterol, fight cancer, prevent heart disease. Some of these have \nhad remarkable effects. Heart disease is much less threatening. It is \nstill a dangerous disease but much less than it was years ago. Imagine \nwhat would happen to a mother or a child if they were relying on \nimported drugs only to find out that the drugs were unsafe. We need to \nbe absolutely certain that we are not putting Americans' lives at risk.\n  That is why I am opposing amendment No. 2107, the McCain amendment, \nwhich would allow potentially unsafe prescription drugs to be shipped \nacross our border, directly into the medicine cabinets of homes \nthroughout America. Instead of safeguarding American patients, this \namendment could bring potentially dangerous and ineffective drugs from \nCanada. I say that because, though Canadian drugs may seem safe, we \nalready know that drugs that claim to be from Canada are not always \nreliable. They are not worth the risk. An FDA investigation found that \n85 percent of drugs imported from Canadian Internet pharmacies were \nactually from 27 other countries. Many of these were pure counterfeit.\n  The Senate already recognized the danger that imported drugs pose to \nAmericans. On five previous occasions, this Chamber has asked the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to certify that importation \nwill not put people at risk. The Secretary still has not been able to \nconfirm that imported drugs would be safe.\n  I wish to make another observation. I find it kind of amusing to \nwatch Republican colleagues talk about how wonderful the Canadian \nhealth system is. Last I checked, Canada's health care system is \nsocialized medicine. During the health care reform debate these same \ncolleagues were decrying the Canadian system as a horrible socialist \nexperiment. My colleagues need to make up their minds. Do they prefer \nsocialized medicine? If so, it comes with some risks.\n  I am proud that many of our country's drugs originate in the State of \nNew Jersey, commonly known as the Medicine Chest State. In fact, there \nare over 46,000 highly skilled people in my home State working to \nproduce lifesaving drugs. It would be wrong to undercut the hard work \nof these trained New Jerseyans, only to put Americans in danger.\n  Right now the drugs in our country are safe and effective, as we have \nseen by the results. Thanks to Senator Harkin and Senator Enzi, this \nbill will even make our drugs more safe. Americans deserve real peace \nof mind. When\n\n[[Page S3560]]\n\nthey open the pill bottle and swallow their medicine, they have to know \nthe product is safe and effective.\n  I urge my colleagues to support keeping medicine in our country safe \nand affordable. I urge the drug companies, the medicine companies, to \ndo whatever they can to make drugs, medicines, more available at \ncheaper prices. I urge my colleagues to vote against amendment No. \n2107.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from \nWest Virginia, again off the opposition to the McCain amendment time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I wish to say to the chairman that I \nappreciate his hard work on this bill, a very important piece of \nlegislation.\n  I would like to address an issue that touches all of us: Democrats \nand Republicans, rich and poor, young and old, West Virginians and New \nYorkers.\n  As you know, the prescription drug epidemic is destroying communities \nacross this nation, wreaking havoc on our education system, devastating \nour workforce and our economy, and tearing our families apart.\n  Prescription drug abuse is the fastest growing drug problem in the \nUnited States, and it is claiming the lives of thousands of Americans \nevery year. According to a report issued by the Centers for Disease \nControl in November, the death toll from overdoses of prescription \npainkillers has more than tripled in the past decade. More than 40 \npeople die every day--every single day--from overdoses involving \nnarcotic pain relievers. These prescription painkillers kill more \nAmericans than heroin and cocaine combined.\n  It's especially tough in my home state of West Virginia, which has \nthe highest rate of drug overdose deaths in the country. Nearly 90 \npercent of those deaths are linked to prescription drug abuse.\n  For months now, I have been going out and listening to the stories of \nso many people in my State--law enforcement, business owners, school \nteachers, pastors, and especially the children who ask for help getting \ntheir parents off the stuff. So I worked with all of them to offer an \namendment to this bill that would make it harder for anyone to abuse \nprescription drugs. That bipartisan amendment was submitted on behalf \nof the countless West Virginians and Americans whose lives have been \ncut short by drug abuse and the families who are picking up the pieces, \nand it is on their behalf that I thank my colleagues in the Senate for \npassing it unanimously.\n  Last night I was so moved and encouraged to see the Members of the \nU.S. Senate come together across party lines and unanimously approve \nthat measure, to take a serious step to fight this prescription drug \nepidemic. I strongly urge our friends in the House to do the same, and \nthe President to sign this important bill.\n\n  This measure is not the work of just one person, however. I would \nlike to thank the cosponsors of this bill, who all believe so strongly \nin it: Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New \nYork, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and, of course, Senator Jay \nRockefeller of my home State of West Virginia.\n  I also thank Governor Earl Ray Tomblin and Congressman Nick Rahall \nfor their tireless work on this issue, along with Congressman Vern \nBuchanan of Florida, who is doing excellent work to end pill mills. As \nwe all know, last night's vote gives this amendment a solid step \nforward, but there is much work remaining to give our communities the \nright tools to fight this epidemic.\n  That's because all too often, we all hear stories like this one, \nwhich the Ohio County Substance Abuse Prevention Coalition in my State \nshared with me.\n\n       A young boy was injured and was prescribed prescription \n     pain killers containing hydrocodone. After the injury he \n     began using the opiates with the other teens in school. They \n     began by taking pills and eventually by graduation, snorting \n     the pills on a daily basis. One day he was convinced by a \n     friend to try IV use. He was married and was able to hold \n     down a job until he began using IV. His wife was addicted to \n     pain killers and their child was born addicted to drugs. He \n     wanted more than anything to be a hard-working father and \n     husband. He wanted to live and to amend his past behaviors. \n     He completed treatment but eventually began using pain \n     killers again. This man in his mid-twenties overdosed and \n     died.\n\n  Think about it. This young man was snorting pills by high school \ngraduation and dead in his mid-20s. Unfortunately, that story is more \ncommon than we would all like to believe.\n  A 2012 study by the National Institute on Drug Abuse found that 8 \npercent of high school seniors had admitted to abusing Vicodin in the \npast year. The Centers for Disease Control has found that about \n12 million Americans have reported non-medical use of prescription \npainkillers in the past year.\n\n  Unlike many illegal drugs, prescription drugs are not produced in \nbasement labs or smuggled across the border--they are found in our own \nmedicine cabinets and are often prescribed for medically necessary \nreasons. And that makes it much easier for people to become addicted or \nabuse these medications.\n  In 2010 alone, pharmacies dispensed the equivalent of 42 tons of pure \nhydrocodone--that is enough to give every man, woman and child in the \nUnited States 24 Vicodin pills.\n  The fact is, that number is just too high. People are getting these \npills because it is just too easy.\n  That is why this amendment would make it harder to get addictive \nprescription drugs, by moving them to a more restrictive category in \nour official drug classification system.\n  Practically, this means that patients would need an original \nprescription for refills and pills would have to be stored more \nsecurely.\n  Let me me close by sharing a few more personal stories about this \nproblem--stories that show on a human level the urgency we need to put \na stop to prescription drug abuse and why I am committed to this fight.\n  This is a problem that hits very close to home in my office. A member \nof my staff, a very bright young girl from Wyoming County who is doing \nvery good work has lost three friends to drug abuse, all in their 20s. \nTheirs were lives full of promise, but they were tragically cut short \nby drug abuse.\n  In the past 7 years, more than 120 people have died from drug \noverdoses in Wyoming County alone, including 41 in 2011 and 12 just \nthis year.\n  I visited Wyoming County in October to speak with a group of students \nat Oceana Middle School who are working very hard to take on the drug \nabuse crisis in their community.\n  These students were part of a letter writing campaign, organized by \nthe faith-based group ``One Voice,'' which works to help addicts and \ntheir families. I want to share with you a few excerpts from some of \nthese letters:\n\n       ``My town, Oceana, has an issue about drugs. I write this \n     letter to you because I hope that you can do something about \n     it. In 2006, my godmother died of an overdose. She was the \n     only person I could talk to. Drugs make people act in bad \n     ways and if something doesn't happen about them then our town \n     will be in worse shape.\n\n  I will give just one more example:\n\n       I am 13 years old and I am a student at Oceana Middle \n     School. I have witnessed drug deals, prostitution and \n     homeless people in our town. I have medicine I take for ADHD \n     and here recently some of my meds were stolen. I will \n     graduate high school in 7 years. If nothing is done about \n     these issues it'll be worse in the future.\n\n  I visited with these students in person. They want a better life for \ntheir parents, their siblings, their friends, their communities--and \nthemselves. They are willing to fight, and they are asking for our \nhelp.\n  The amendment that passed last night with unanimous bipartisan \nsupport is a good step toward reaching their dream, and I offer my \nheartfelt thanks to my colleagues on behalf of all the people in West \nVirginia who have been affected by prescription drug abuse. And I urge \nmy colleagues in the House to support this measure and the President to \nsign it--for the good of all the 12-year-old girls who are asking us to \nhelp get their daddies off this stuff.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I would like to say to both chairmen on both sides of \nthe aisle, thank you for legislation that is much needed. Thank you for \nan amendment agreed upon, voted on unanimously, and accepted last \nnight. This will go a long way to fight drug abuse in America and save \ncountless children's lives. I thank both Senators so much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n[[Page S3561]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, how much time remains on the McCain \nopposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I yield myself that time and a couple of \nminutes off the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I wish Senators to know that we will \nstart voting here in 9 or 10 minutes, and these will be 10-minute \nvotes.\n  The first vote will be on the amendment offered by the Senator from \nKentucky, Mr. Paul, followed by Senator McCain's amendment, Senator \nSanders' amendment, Senator Durbin's amendment, and then final passage.\n  By an earlier consent, all of those votes will be 10-minute votes. I \nwanted to make sure that people knew what the lay of the land was here.\n  We are rapidly approaching the final passage of this bill. We have \nhad great cooperation from all Senators on both sides in moving this \nlegislation forward here on the floor. We have had good debates. They \nhave not been drawn out endlessly, but we have had good debates and a \ngood airing of the amendments on the bill. I thank all Senators for \nthat, and hopefully we can move rapidly to wrap up this bill and move \non.\n  This bill is the product of 18 months of very hard work by Senator \nEnzi and all of the Senators on our committee on both sides of the \naisle. It is a true compromise and bipartisan bill. As I mentioned \nearlier, it has the support of a broad spectrum of stakeholders, from \nthe pharmaceutical companies to pharmacists to consumer organizations, \nacross the broad spectrum who support this bill, and it is necessary \nthat we get it done. That is why we have urged everyone to \nexpeditiously get this done before the break period coming up for \nMemorial Day so the Food and Drug Administration won't have to start \nsending pink slips out to people this summer, and so there will not be \nany disruptions. It will allow them to get on with the business of \nmaking sure we get drugs and devices to patients expeditiously but \nsafely, making sure our drugs and our devices are safe.\n  It is a good bill, and it is the result of a lot of hard work by a \nlot of people, so I hope we can move these amendments rapidly and move \nto final passage this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when we begin \nthe next vote, Senator Paul, who has 7 minutes left on his item, be \ngiven 2 minutes so he may explain his bill in exchange for those 7 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume off the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2143\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, we are rapidly approaching a vote on the \nPaul amendment, and I know the Senator wants to have a couple of \nminutes to speak on that.\n  I rise in opposition to the Paul amendment. I oppose it for several \nreasons. Perhaps the most important reason is that this is a drug bill. \nThis bill deals with drugs and devices. It does not deal with food. We \ndealt with dietary supplements and vitamins and things such as that in \nthe food safety bill that we passed 2 years ago and that bill, again, \nwas a consensus bill that has been through the committee structure. We \nbrought it to the floor and had a lot of debate on it. We made \nmodifications at that time to the whole area of vitamins, minerals, and \nsupplements, and that is the proper place to address it, not on a bill \nsuch as this. This bill is a bill on drugs, not on supplements and \nfood, so that is the most important reason.\n  I will make that same argument on the Durbin amendment. That should \nnot be here because this is a drug bill.\n  On substance, I would say this bill kind of turns food law on its \nhead. It would allow supplements to be sold with claims to cure any \ndisease, such as AIDS or cancer, without any kind of FDA review \nwhatsoever. I take a backseat to no one in terms of my support for the \nvitamin, mineral, and supplement industry and their products. Senator \nHatch and I were the two people who put through the DSHEA bill, the \nDietary Supplementary Health and Education Act in 1994. If I might say, \nwe have sort of been protectors of it in working to make sure it has \nbeen implemented correctly since that time.\n  But the Paul amendment would go way too far. It is not consensus \npolicy. In fact, it is strongly opposed by even the dietary supplement \nindustry. I would note that the Natural Products Association, United \nNatural Products Alliance, and the Council on Responsible Nutrition, \nall three are big umbrella groups that oppose the Paul amendment. This \nwould open this industry to snake oil salesmen.\n  Again, those of us who want to make sure people have unfettered \naccess to safe products and to good, nutritious vitamins, minerals, and \nsupplements, the last thing we want to see is people in their garages \nmixing it up and selling it as snake oil. This is not good for America, \nit is not good for people who want to take vitamins and supplements and \nminerals for their own health. It would throw this thing open and turn \nthe clock back 50 years or more where anybody could make any claim they \nwant and the FDA would have no way of reviewing it whatsoever.\n  I will move to table the amendment at the appropriate time, but I \nurge all Senators to oppose the Paul amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I yield the Senator from Kentucky the time \nhe is already entitled to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized for 2 \nminutes under the previous order.\n  Mr. PAUL. My amendment is to rein in the FDA. I believe they have \ngotten overzealous in their duties. They do have important duties, but \nI think they have gotten overblown. My amendment has three parts.\n  First, it attempts to stop the FDA's overzealous regulation of \nvitamins, foods, and supplements by codifying the first amendment \nprohibition on prior restraint. What this means is the first amendment \nsays we cannot restrain speech before it happens. This amendment also \nhelps to make explicit that commercial speech is speech and should be \nprotected.\n  Under current rules, the FDA prevents even the manufacturer of prune \njuice from saying that prune juice relieves constipation. I think that \nis an FDA that has gotten a little bit out of hand. I think that \nvitamin supplement manufacturers and distributors should be allowed to \ngive us information and that the buyers should be allowed to review \nthat information in making decisions about the product and that this \nspeech should not be restricted.\n  Second, my amendment says the FDA doesn't need to be carrying \nweapons. I don't need to see bureaucrats carrying automatic weapons. If \nthere are police officers necessary in the operation of their duties, I \nwould rather have the FBI. The FDA does not need to be sending armed \nagents to the Amish farms to arrest a farmer for selling milk from the \ncow.\n  Third, my amendment fixes what needs to be fixed in a lot of \nregulatory crimes. We need to add in the component of mens rea. Mens \nrea means that when a person commits a crime and they put that person \nin jail, they have to prove that person had a guilty mind and had \nintent to commit a crime. So we add two words. If they are going to \naccuse a person of a crime, it has to be knowing and willful. These are \nvery simple words, but they change the burden of the government. If the \ngovernment is going to accuse a person of the crime, they need to know \nthis. If Congress is going to criminalize conduct at a Federal level, \nas it does in the FDA Act, then the least we can do is add in the mens \nrea requirement.\n  Thank you. I urge support for my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I move to table the amendment by the \nSenator from Kentucky and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is agreeing to the motion.\n\n[[Page S3562]]\n\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 2107, offered by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain.\n  Who wishes the floor?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment is a simple one. It creates \na safe individual drug importation program only from approved Canadian \npharmacies, overseen by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  In a normal world, this would probably require a voice vote. But what \nwe are about to see is the incredible influence of the special \ninterests, particularly PhRMA, here in Washington, where people who \ncannot afford it will have to make a choice between eating and \nmedicine. They will not be allowed to purchase a medication at less \nthan half the price, many times, than they will in American pharmacies \nin Canada.\n  So what you are about to see is the reason for the cynicism the \nAmerican people have about the way we do business in Washington. \nPhRMA--one of the most powerful lobbies in Washington--will exert its \ninfluence again at the expense of average low-income Americans who \nwill, again, have to choose between medication and eating.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, it is not the special interests that \nhave caused the Senate countless times to reject this policy. It is an \namendment that puts Americans at risk, undermines the FDA's authority, \nand would have a devastating ripple effect throughout the country's \ndrug supply by allowing foreign pharmaceuticals into the country.\n  It is not simply about Canada. The Canadians themselves have said \nthey cannot be expected to monitor all the drugs coming through Canada \nand into our country, and all the Web-based opportunities would allow \nuntraceable drugs to come through Canada into the United States.\n  This is about the health and security of the American people. That is \nwhy time after time the Senate has rejected it. It is why it should be \nrejected once again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have had, during this short period of \ntime, four different Senators come to me and say: Please hold the votes \nto 10 minutes, with the 5-minute penalty. So we are going to do that. A \nnumber of Senators already missed votes today. We are going to cut \nthose votes off. If you are not here, there is no excuse. These votes \nhave been scheduled since yesterday. So we are going to turn in these \nvotes exactly at 15 minutes. The clerks understand that. If a Senator \nis late, they are late.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, this amendment is \nsubject to a 60-vote threshold. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes \nfor the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2109\n\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 2109, \noffered by the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Sanders.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, this amendment is supported by Public \nCitizen, U.S. PIRG, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security \nand Medicare, and the National Women's Health Network.\n  In the United States, we pay by far the highest prices in the world \nfor prescription drugs--much higher than Canada, much higher than \nEurope. There are a number of reasons for that. One of the reasons is \nthe widespread fraud, systemic fraud being perpetrated on the American \npeople by virtually every major drug company in this country.\n  In the last few years, companies such as Abbott, Pfizer, Johnson & \nJohnson, Merck, GlaxoSmithKline, and many others combined have paid \nbillions of dollars in fines because they are ripping off Medicare, \nthey are ripping off Medicaid, and they are ripping off the American \nconsumer. It is high time we said that fraud cannot be perpetrated as a \nbusiness model by some of the major corporations in this country.\n  I ask for a ``yes'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would oppose this amendment. We do need to \ncombat health care fraud, but this amendment goes too far in several \naspects. First and most important, it would discourage any settlement \nagreements. People would fight it to the death if they are going to \nlose their exclusivity.\n\n[[Page S3563]]\n\n  Second, as drafted, the amendment would require companies to forfeit \nexclusivity anytime there is a civil or criminal liability under the \nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. It is disproportionate. This \ncould be triggered by a misdemeanor. In addition, such liability may \nnot reflect fraud. The amendment would discourage the development of \nnew cures for patients. If manufactures know they could lose \nexclusivity for even minor infractions, they will not invest the \nmillions of dollars necessary to create new lifesaving therapies for \npatients.\n  I ask that the Senate oppose the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Under the previous order, this amendment is subject to a 60-vote \nthreshold for adoption.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN.

I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2127\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 2127, offered by the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. If you go \ninto the drugstore and look at the prescription drugs, every one of \nthem has been registered with the FDA. The over-the-counter drugs have \nall been registered. When you go to the dietary supplement section, \nthere is no requirement under the law for the company selling those \nproducts to register the name of the product, the ingredients of it, or \na copy of the label.\n  The GAO did a study in 2009, and the FDA said we need this \ninformation to protect American consumers. From what? One of them is an \nexample on this chart. This is a Chinese product that was imported into \nthe United States, put up for sale, and then we discovered that one of \nthe ingredients was life-threatening. It was never registered with the \nFDA, and there was no disclosure of its ingredients.\n  If you want to sell from the counters in America, shouldn't you be \nrequired, whether you are from China, India, Mexico, or anywhere in the \nUnited States, to register your product, the ingredients in it, and a \ncopy of the label? The FDA says they need this information to keep \nAmerica safe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first of all, this is a drug and device \nbill, not a food bill. We addressed food issues in the food safety bill \n2 years ago. That doesn't solve the problem Senator Durbin talked \nabout. This bill is a very delicate balance. We have worked on this for \n18 months. Stakeholders all over the country, consumers, the \npharmaceutical industry, and pharmacists all support this bill. This \nwould upset that delicate balance.\n  I say to the Senator that every supplement has a label, the \ningredients, and the potency, by law, on every single item sold as a \nsupplement. This is a drug bill, not a food bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I strongly oppose this amendment. I will be \nvoting to table it, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same. It \nwould impose another layer of regulations on an industry that already \nhas a workable regulatory framework. It is totally unnecessary, and it \nwill only increase costs for those who use dietary supplements.\n  I wish to make a few points clear.\n  First, HHS already has authority to impose an immediate ban on any \ndietary supplement that poses imminent hazard to public health.\n  Second, four previous FDA Commissioners and a former Deputy \nCommissioner agree that DSHEA already provides sufficient oversight of \nthis industry. This amendment would strap the FDA with a huge burden at \na time when the agency is already struggling to perform its current \ncore responsibilities.\n  Third, it unnecessarily expands registration requirements without \nadding any additional consumer protections.\n  All this amendment does is penalize good companies, while doing \nnothing to go after the bad.\n  In the end, as a result of this amendment, consumers will suffer by \npaying higher prices for their supplements.\n  This amendment is bad for the FDA and bad for consumers. The Senate \nshould reject it.\n  We already have a regulatory framework under DSHEA that works. A new \nintrusive regulatory regime is totally unnecessary. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote with me to table this amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the same \namount of time given on the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the FDA asked for this knowledge and \ninformation. What am I asking them to disclose? The name of the \nproduct, the ingredients of it, and a copy of the label. If a Chinese \nmanufacturer wants to sell a dietary supplement in Des Moines, IA, \nshouldn't they have to report to the FDA the name of the product and \nits ingredients? It is not required by law now. Let's give the FDA this \nextra information to keep Americans safe.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I move to table the Durbin amendment, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Prescription Drug Information\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, earlier this week I introduced the \nCody Miller Initiative for Safe Prescriptions Act. The legislation \nwould require the Food and Drug Administration to issue regulations to \nensure patients receive timely, consistent, and accurate information \nwith their prescription drugs. The legislation would ensure patient \nmedication information is regularly updated as new information becomes \navailable and ensure that common information is applied consistently \nacross similar products. Most importantly, the legislation would ensure \npatients are kept up to date about potential adverse side effects and \ndangerous drug interactions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I applaud the work of the Senator from New York on this \nlegislation and share her commitment to ensuring patients receive \nstandardized and accurate information about their prescription drugs. \nWhile verbal counseling by a pharmacist is still critical, the patient \nmedication information is also an important resource to help patients \nuse medications safely.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I appreciate the Chairman's support and hope to work \nwith him to advance this legislation. I also hope he will join me in \ncalling on the FDA to use its existing authority to ensure patient \nmedication information is uniform, accurate, and up-to-date. The FDA is \ncurrently engaged in efforts to revise the patient education materials \nthat are distributed to patients. However, the FDA's current plan falls \nshort of ensuring that consumers will receive unbiased and accurate \ninformation about their prescription drugs. It also fails to ensure \nthat patient medication information is consistent for identical or \nsimilar products.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree we need to take steps to improve the information \npatients receive and look forward to working with the Senator on this \nissue.\n\n\n                       ACCELERATED PATIENT ACCESS\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Section 901 of the managers' amendment to S. 3187, \nEnhancement of Accelerated Patient Access to New Medical Treatments \nstates that an accelerated approval under section 506(b) of the Federal \nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is subject to certain limitations, \nincluding the requirement that the sponsor conduct appropriate post- \napproval studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on \nirreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Does the \nlack of an explicit reference to postapproval validation of surrogate \nendpoints, as described in current law, in any way restrict the \nSecretary's existing authority to require such validation postapproval?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The managers' amendment to 3187 revises section 506(b), \nremoving the explicit language in current law requiring postapproval \nvalidation of surrogate endpoints. However, this is not intended to \nrestrict the Secretary's current ability to require such validation \npostapproval, if appropriate. Equally important, the change likewise is \nnot intended to suggest that any such validation should now occur prior \nto approval under section 506(b). Rather, in keeping with current \npractice, the bill's new language continues to permit the Secretary to \nrequire postapproval studies to verify the effect on the surrogate \nendpoint or predicted clinical outcome, i.e., verification of the \npredicted clinical benefit. In addition, it continues to allow the \nSecretary to withdraw an accelerated approval if the required studies \nfail to verify and describe the predicted effect.\n  Mr. ENZI. To receive accelerated approval, the managers' amendment \nrequires that FDA determine that a surrogate or clinical endpoint is \nreasonably likely to be predictive of an effect on clinical benefit or \non a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible \nmorbidity or mortality as of the time of granting accelerated approval \nand the standards under section 505(c) of the FDCA or section 351(a) of \nthe Public Health Service Act are met. In meeting such a requirement, \nit is appropriate for the Secretary to seek data and information to \nshow that the surrogate or clinical endpoint is reasonably likely to \npredict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other \nclinical benefit.\n  I would just like to reiterate that nothing in these amendments to \nsection 506(b) is intended to alter the FDA's historical practice of \nutilizing unvalidated surrogates to grant accelerated approval in \nappropriate cases or its practice of granting traditional approval \nunder section 505(b) based on validated surrogates in appropriate \ncases.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, Senator Manchin's amendment, amendment \n2151 to the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, \nseeks to address the problem of prescription opiate drugs by tightening \nrestrictions on hydrocodone. Opiate prescription drugs like hydrocodone \nhave been a tremendous and growing problem in Vermont, as they have in \nWest Virginia. I thank Senator Manchin for working with me to make the \namendment better.\n  The scourge of prescription drug abuse has had a devastating effect \nin communities across the country. I heard about the lives destroyed by \nthis epidemic and the violence and other ills it has brought with it in \nseveral hearings in Vermont in recent years. Senator Manchin's \namendment seeks to make it more difficult for prescription drugs to get \ninto the hands of those who would abuse them by requiring prescriptions \nmore comprehensively and by restricting storage and transportation. I \nhope these steps will be helpful.\n  I am glad Senator Manchin was willing to work with me to modify the \namendment so that it did not cause as many sentencing increases, and \nparticularly to eliminate what would have been a new mandatory minimum \nsentence. Those who work on the problem of prescription drugs every day \nhave not identified a lack of adequate criminal sentences to be part of \nthe problem, so a significant change in the sentencing scheme was not \nneeded or intended.\n  Indeed, the proliferation of severe sentences for drug offenses and \nof mandatory minimum sentences in particular is a large part of what \nhas led to the serious problem we face now in having too many people in \nprison for too long. These sentences have contributed to the runaway \nprison costs that are so crippling to Federal and State budgets.\n  Overwhelming prison costs take resources away from programs focusing \non drug prevention, drug treatment, and strong law enforcement, all of \nwhich are more effective in helping communities take on prescription \ndrug problems than are lengthy sentences. I am glad that we could work \nto ensure that this amendment would help to address our prescription \ndrug problem without contributing to the overincarceration of drug \noffenders.\n  I know some doctors in Vermont and elsewhere continue to have \nconcerns about the effect this amendment will have on getting \nprescriptions to those who need them. I hope we can continue working \ntogether to ensure that we tackle the difficult problem of prescription \ndrug addiction without hindering crucial medical care.\n  I thank Senator Manchin for his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I am pleased that last night, my \namendment, No. 2126, which would ensure that there are no future delays \non the\n\n[[Page S3565]]\n\nimplementation of new sunscreen labeling and testing standards, was \nadopted as part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and \nInnovation Act.\n  Because sunscreens have been considered a cosmetic, they have largely \navoided government oversight and the FDA hasn't changed its \nrecommendations for sunscreen standards in over 30 years.\n  However, last June, after years of prodding by our former colleague \nSenator Dodd, me, and others, the FDA finally acted.\n  The agency finalized comprehensive new sunscreen regulations that \nwere scheduled to go into effect on June 18, just a few weeks from now \nand in time for summer. Indeed, this was considered a victory for \nfamilies across the country that spend more time outdoors and under the \nsun's harmful UVA and UVB rays during the summer months.\n  But just 2 weeks ago, the FDA announced it is now giving the industry \nan extra 6 months to make changes, meaning the standards will take \neffect in mid-December instead of this summer.\n  For too long the FDA has allowed manufacturers to get away with \ninaccurate claims about sun protection. My amendment will protect \nagainst any future delays and ensure the new sunscreen safety and \nlabeling standards go into effect no later than the end of this year.\n  I am pleased that the Environmental Working Group supports this \namendment, and the Consumer Health Care Products Association, which \nrepresents sunscreen manufacturers, has agreed to the amendment's \ninclusion in this bill. Finally, the Congressional Budget Office has \ninformed me that my amendment would not result in any additional cost \nto the Federal government.\n  I thank Chairman Harkin and Senator Enzi for reviewing this amendment \nand including it in this FDA reauthorization bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I will support final passage of the Food \nand Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act which will \nreauthorize the user fee agreements that govern the fees paid by the \npharmaceutical and medical device industries to the Food and Drug \nAdministration, FDA, to expedite the drug and device approval process.\n  These fees are an important funding source that provides the FDA with \nresources necessary to ensure potentially lifesaving drugs and medical \ndevices can be reviewed and ultimately brought to market quickly and \nsafely. I understand this legislation is the product of a tremendous \namount of work by the chairman and ranking member of the HELP \nCommittee, in conjunction with various stakeholders, and enjoys broad \nsupport from industry, the FDA, and consumer groups.\n  For the first time, this bill will also create new user fee \nagreements for generic drug manufacturers; manufacturers of biologics; \nand would make permanent the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act and \nthe Pediatric Research Equity Act. These two laws together help improve \nthe safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals for children.\n  Of particular interest, the bill aims to address drug shortages by \nrequiring all manufactures of certain drugs to provide advance \nnotification of possible supply disruptions and any permanent \ndiscontinuance of these products to the Health and Human Services \nSecretary. In addition, it will also require HHS to establish a task \nforce to address possible drug shortages and will grant the secretary \nthe authority to expedite the inspection and review process of \nsubstitute products that could mitigate a shortage.\n  The bill will allow the FDA to continue to collect fees from \npharmaceutical manufacturers and medical device manufacturers through \n2017. I am pleased to join with colleagues from both sides of the aisle \nin voting in favor of this important legislation.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I applaud the effort underway between \nthe FDA and industry to develop a transitional pathway for the \nregulation of emerging diagnostic tests. In addition, I am pleased that \nthe FDA expressed its commitment to work with industry on this \nimportant initiative in the MDUFA III commitment letter.\n  Many new diagnostic tests serve as the missing link to improved \nhealth care through better detection, treatment, and monitoring of \ndisease. Thus, it is critical for public health that FDA's premarket \nreview system for diagnostics be modernized in a manner that supports \nadvances in the sciences and promotes patient access.\n  I look forward to developments with respect to the agency's plans to \ndevelop a transitional in vitro diagnostics pathway and steps taken \nrelated to its implementation.\n  I also wish to talk about two massively important laws that work to \nensure that medications used in children are tested and labeled \ncorrectly--the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, known as BPCA, \nand the Pediatric Research Equity Act, known as PREA.\n  Taken together, these two laws encourage and require drug companies \nto study their products in children. They have been hugely successful \nin ensuring that physicians and parents have information needed to best \ntreat our Nation's children.\n  Most drugs on the market have never been tested in children, largely \nbecause manufacturers face economic, mechanical, ethical, and legal \nobstacles that work to discourage pediatric testing.\n  With respect to economic obstacles, the pediatric drug marketplace is \ngenerally small, with little economic incentive for manufacturers to \ncommit resources to testing in children when they could just test in \nthe much larger adult population.\n  With respect to mechanical obstacles, young children often cannot \nswallow pills. This presents a challenge for drug manufacturers, who \noften then have to develop alternate formulations, such as liquids or \nchewable tablets. Finally, even for adults, ethical and legal \nrequirements for participation in a clinical trial are incredibly \ncomplex and challenging. Trying to recruit children for trials is even \nmore difficult. Parents don't want their kids used in experiments, and \ndrug companies face added liability concerns.\n  We understand these challenges, but doctors still must treat \nchildren--many with serious and life-threatening conditions. And, too \noften, doctors are forced to prescribe drugs that have never been \nstudied in kids. So in 2002 and 2003 Congress passed laws that serve as \na carrot and stick to generate more pediatric drug information. We \npassed the Pediatric Research Equity Act, which requires safety and \nefficacy studies in children for all new drugs. For drugs that were on \nthe market before PREA was enacted, the law allows FDA to go back and \nmandate child studies where appropriate.\n  We also passed the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, which \nrewards drug companies with 6 months additional exclusivity if they \ncomplete additional pediatric testing requested by FDA.\n  As a result of BPCA and PREA, over 425 drug labels have been revised \nwith important pediatric information. Before BPCA and PREA, more than \n80 percent of drugs used in kids were used off-label without data on \nsafety and efficacy. Today, that number has been reduced to \napproximately 50 percent. New pediatric studies conducted as result of \nBPCA and PREA have resulted in new dosing information, new indications \nof use, new safety information, and new data on effectiveness in \nchildren.\n  The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act removes \nthe 5-year sunsets for BPCA and PREA, giving biopharmaceutical \ncompanies a more predictable regulatory path and providing certainty \nthat these programs will still be up and running when companies \ncomplete their pediatric trials.\n  This bill also makes important pediatric information publicly \navailable. The last reauthorization of BPCA and PREA ensured that \ncertain pediatric studies were made publicly available but did not \nensure the availability of pre-2007 studies. This bill ensures that \npediatric studies conducted between 2002 and 2007, which resulted in a \nlabeling change, are made publicly available for physicians, \nresearchers, and parents.\n  Finally, this bill gives FDA new tools to ensure that studies \nrequired by PREA are completed on time, unless there is an appropriate \nreason for delay.\n  Children are not small adults. They have different medical needs. The \nonly way to improve the health of current and future generations of \nchildren is to\n\n[[Page S3566]]\n\nbetter understand how drugs work in pediatric populations. We need to \nhelp doctors by getting them more information so that treatment of \npediatric diseases is less of a guessing game and more of an informed \npractice. I believe these two pediatric programs have been incredibly \nsuccessful, and I am very encouraged by the improvements we make in the \nbill before us today.\n  Finally Madam President, I wish to talk about the safety of our \nNation's prescription drug supply. Today, there are many challenges and \nobstacles facing our families--from trying to find or keep a job, to \nfiguring out how to pay off crushing student loans, to obtaining \naffordable health insurance. One thing that our families shouldn't have \nto worry about is whether the drug they are taking or whether the drug \ntheir loved one is taking to cure or treat an illness is going to harm \nthem instead of help them.\n  When the modern FDA was first established in 1938, most of our \nmedical products were developed and manufactured within our own \nborders. That is no longer the case. Nearly 40 percent of drugs \nAmericans rely upon are made outside our borders. About 80 percent of \nthe active ingredients used in drugs made in the United States come \nfrom 150 other countries. The increased globalization of our drug \nindustry, coupled with the fact that we have not given our Federal \nagencies additional authorities to keep pace, has created great \nchallenges for FDA and industry and great danger to patients in need.\n  Where there is need, there is greed. Where there is greed, there is \nscam and schemes. In this case, we know that increased globalization \nand insufficient authorities to regulate at a Federal level has created \na dangerous opportunity for bad actors to take advantage. And they have \ntaken advantage--from adulteration, to counterfeiting, to cargo theft, \nto manufacturing drugs in unsanitary conditions, to mislabeled \nproducts. We have seen it all in recent years and the consequences have \nbeen deadly.\n  In recent years, a highly toxic solvent, known as DEG, added to fever \nmedicine, cough syrup, and teething products resulted in the deaths of \nchildren and adults in Panama, Haiti, and Nigeria.\n  In 2007, pet food adulterated with melamine and acid sickened several \nthousand pets in the United States. Melamine and acid was added to \ninfant formula in China, poisoning and killing six babies and sickening \n300,000 others.\n  In 2008, contaminated Heparin from China killed and sickened hundreds \nacross the United States.\n  In 2003, more than $20 million in illegally imported and counterfeit \nLipitor was sold throughout the United States.\n  In 2009, an estimated 46 drug cargo thefts occurred, valued at $184 \nmillion.\n  Many stolen drugs are then improperly stored or handled before being \nsold back to consumers, putting patients at risk. For instance, stolen \ninsulin was reintroduced into the drug supply and caused adverse events \nin patients because it had not been refrigerated. I could go on and on \nwith examples of how counterfeit, adulterated, and stolen drugs have \nsickened and killed people and animals worldwide.\n  But, I am encouraged by the bill before us today. The FDA Safety and \nInnovation Act takes a number of important steps to improve the safety \nof our Nation's drug supply. For instance, this legislation requires \nevery foreign establishment engaged in the manufacture of a drug or \ndevice imported into the United States, to electronically register with \nthe FDA.\n  Under current law, there are no requirements governing how often FDA \nmust inspect foreign facilities. The bill before us requires FDA to set \nup a risk-based inspection frequency to ensure that we are getting in \nthere and inspecting facilities that pose the greatest risks.\n  This legislation gives the Secretary of Homeland Security the \nauthority to refuse admission into the United States any drug or \ningredient if it was manufactured, processed, packed, or held at an \nestablishment that has refused or delayed inspection by FDA.\n  This bill requires drug manufacturers and wholesalers to notify the \nFDA if they become aware that their drug has been counterfeited or has \nbeen stolen or lost in substantial quantities.\n  Finally, this bill increases penalties for bad actors who knowingly \nadulterate or counterfeit drugs.\n  In developing this legislation, the question we had to ask was this: \nDoes the Federal agency tasked with ensuring the safety of our Nation's \ndrugs have the resources and authorities necessary to do their job and \nprotect the public health? The answer was no. But I believe the new \nauthorities contained in the FDA Safety and Innovation Act--which we \ndeveloped on a bipartisan basis in the Senate HELP committee--will help \nus ensure that the next time we ask this question, the answer will be \nyes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, today, we are considering a bill that \nwill improve the FDA's ability to assure the safety of drugs in our \nmedicine cabinets and medical devices in our hospitals.\n  The FDA is an essential guardian of the public's health and safety.\n  In the past few years, FDA has faced obstacles that call on the \nagency to adapt and respond to the evolving nature of reviewing, \nmanufacturing, and distributing drugs and devices.\n  Some of those obstacles and challenges are addressed in the \nreauthorizations of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act and the Medical \nDevice User Fee Act, which are set to expire at the end of September \n2012.\n  Last fall, I visited Cook Medical's medical device plant in Canton, \nIL, and representatives expressed concern about the amount of time it \ntakes medical devices to be reviewed.\n  FDA needs sufficient time to review medical devices in order to \nensure their safety and effectiveness. However, inefficiencies and \ninsufficient resources can result in longer review times, which means \npatients have to wait longer to benefit from new medical devices.\n  This bill makes key changes to maintain the safety of devices and \npreserve our country's leadership in biomedical innovation.\n  The bill will authorize the FDA to collect almost $600 million in \nuser fees over 5 years. FDA can use these additional resources to help \nhire and train staff.\n  Furthermore, the bill makes important improvements by streamlining \nthe review process for devices and increasing communication between the \nFDA and device manufacturers throughout the review process.\n  These changes to the review of medical devices will not only help \ninnovative device companies get their product to market faster but will \nprevent patients from having to wait extra weeks and months to benefit \nfrom a new device.\n  In addition to reauthorizing the Prescription Drug and Medical Device \nUser Fee Acts, this bill also establishes the Generic Drug User Fee Act \nand Biosimilar User Fee Act, which give FDA new authority to collect \nuser fees for generic and biosimilar drugs.\n  Currently the FDA does not collect user fees to support the review of \ngeneric drugs, and it takes about 30 months for the agency to review \ngeneric drug applications. This extra time reduces access to safe, \naffordable generic drugs and leaves patients and taxpayers paying the \ntab for brand-name drugs that lack competition from generics.\n  Since the first Prescription Drug User Fee Act was enacted in 1992, \nthe FDA began collecting user fees to support the review of \napplications.\n  FDA has cut the review time for new drugs by 60 percent, from 2 years \nto a little over 1 year.\n  Similarly, the Generic Drug User Fee Act will give FDA the support it \nneeds to cut the current 30-month review time for generic drugs down to \n10 months.\n  This improvement will promote competition in the marketplace and save \nmoney by reducing the amount of time patients have to wait for less \nexpensive generic alternatives to brand-name drugs.\n  The process of negotiating and drafting this legislation started 18 \nmonths ago, and the result is a comprehensive bill that improves the \nsafety and quality of drugs and medical devices.\n  Chairman Harkin and Senator Enzi have put together a bill that \nresponds to many of these challenges, including one that is of \nparticular interest to me--the national shortage of critical drugs.\n  Between 2006 and 2010 the drug shortage increased 200 percent--from \n56 to\n\n[[Page S3567]]\n\n178 drugs. Currently the drug shortage includes over 200 drugs, such as \nintravenous nutrition supplements, cancer treating drugs, and \nanesthesia.\n  Over the past few months, I have held three roundtable discussions at \nhospitals across Illinois to learn about the drug shortage and how it \nis affecting providers and patients. From these discussions it is clear \nthat the drug shortage is being felt at most hospitals, and those \nIllinois hospitals, providers, and pharmacists are working around the \nclock to ensure patients maintain access to drugs and safe treatments.\n  At Advocate Hospital in Libertyville, a doctor shared that he learned \njust days before starting a patient on chemotherapy that the drug was \nnot available. Unfortunately, this is a common scenario across the \ncountry as doctors learn days before starting a treatment or even once \nthe patient is on the hospital bed that a drug is not available.\n  Pharmacists now spend part of each day scrambling to find drugs or an \nalternative treatment.\n  I recently learned that a young woman on my staff here in DC is all \ntoo familiar with the drug shortage. She is a smart and hardworking \nwoman who has been taking Concerta to treat her ADD since she was 14. \nLike most people with severe ADD, she must take her medicine at a \ncertain time every day in order to keep their ADD symptoms from \nimpeding basic life and work responsibilities. And while there are \nseveral ADD drugs on the market, each drug works differently and can \nhave different side effects, so switching to a new prescription is not \nwithout risk.\n  Last year, the local CVS where she usually had her prescription \nfilled started telling her they didn't have her drug in stock. She \ndidn't think much of it, as she would wake up early and walk to another \nCVS in the morning where she was usually able to get the prescription.\n  Over time, she grew accustomed to going between these two CVS \npharmacies to fill her prescription until one month when she carried \nher prescription with her for 3 days and was unable to find a pharmacy \nwith enough Concerta to fill her 30-day prescription. By the end of day \n3, she was out of her supply. She woke up early and rode her bike to \nfour or five CVS pharmacies until she was able to find a pharmacy that \ncould fill her prescription. But by then it was 12 o'clock and past the \nprescribed time to take the drug.\n  The shortage of ADD drugs impacts children, adults, parents, and \nemployees across the country.\n  Congress must take action to address the drug shortage.\n  The FDA Safety and Innovation Act builds on Senator Klobuchar's bill, \nwith key provisions to curb the national drug shortage.\n  First, the bill requires drug manufacturers to notify the FDA 6 \nmonths in advance for certain drug shortages.\n  With this much notice, the FDA can work with manufacturers to try to \navoid a shortage and, when necessary, identify alternative sources of \nthe drug to ensure we maintain a supply for patients.\n  This winter, thanks to open communication between the FDA and drug \ncompanies, the FDA successfully avoided a shortage of methotrexate, a \nvital drug to treat leukemia with children.\n  FDA collaborated with Illinois-based generic drug manufacturer \nHospira to increase production of this lifesaving drug when another \ncompany halted production.\n  Requiring 6 months' advance notice of a drug shortage will help the \nFDA to work with companies to avoid shortages of critical drugs.\n  Furthermore, the bill requires FDA to enhance the agency's response \nto shortages and will improve reporting of shortages by allowing third \nparties to report drug shortages to the FDA.\n  This bill also takes steps to improve the safety of drugs and the \ndrug supply chain.\n  In 2008, serious injuries and 81 deaths were linked to contamination \nof the crucial blood thinning drug heparin. The source of the \ncontamination was a facility in China that intentionally adulterated \nthe drug. This was a horrible illustration of what happens when \nadulterated and counterfeit drugs make their way into the drug supply \nchain and ultimately to patients.\n  This case has also raised serious questions about the global \nmanufacturing practices of drugs and drug ingredients and the FDA's \nresponsibility to protect the drug supply chain. Since the heparin \nincident, the global nature of the drug supply chain has only grown. \nToday, 80 percent of active pharmaceutical ingredients are manufactured \noutside of the United States.\n  This bill improves the safety of our supply chain both domestically \nand internationally by requiring foreign manufacturers to register \ntheir facilities with the FDA.\n  The bill also places greater responsibility on U.S. drug \nmanufacturers to know their international suppliers and increases \npenalties for intentionally contaminating or counterfeiting drugs.\n  Counterfeit and adulterated drugs can have deadly consequences, yet \nthe penalty for committing these crimes is less than the penalty for \nselling a counterfeit designer purse. Currently, the penalty for \nintentionally counterfeiting or adulterating a drug is no more than 3 \nears in prison or a $10,000 fine or both. This bill raises the penalty \nfor intentionally adulterating a drug to no more than 20 years in \nprison or a $1 million fine or both. And the penalty for intentionally \ncounterfeiting drugs is raised to no more than 20 years in prison or a \n$4 million fine or both.\n  This bill addresses the drug shortage, reduces the review time for \nmedical devices and drugs, improves the pipeline for antibiotics and \npediatric drugs, and helps secure the supply chain for prescription \ndrugs.\n  I thank Chairman Harkin and Senator Enzi for their extraordinary \nleadership and hard work on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and the \nthird reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on passage of the \nbill, as amended.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, we have all put in a lot of work and \nbenefited greatly by the constructive ideas and efforts of all the \nMembers of this body. I sincerely thank all my colleagues, especially \nSenator Enzi, for their hard work on this must-pass legislation.\n  This excellent bill is a shining example of what we can achieve when \nwe all work together. Now we must keep our promise to patients and the \nbiomedical industry and pass this critical bill.\n  Today, with one vote, we can reauthorize the essential FDA's user fee \nagreements, systematically modernize FDA's medical product authority, \nand help to boost American innovation and ensure that patients have \naccess to the therapies they need.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join in this bipartisan spirit of \ncooperation and pass this important legislation, the FDA Safety and \nInnovation Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, the chairman has said it well. We \nappreciate the bipartisan spirit in which people have participated, \nespecially in committee for a year and a half, working out amendments, \nworking out ideas, and coming up with a bill that had a good consensus.\n  I appreciate the action on the Senate floor, the people who were \nwilling to do time limits on their amendments, and how quickly we have \ngotten through the votes.\n  I particularly want to thank the chairman for the way he has handled \nthis in committee and the process since then. We had a couple of issues \nthat were outstanding and those got worked out.\n  I also want to thank the staffs on both sides. Their dedication for a \nyear and a half is what made this happen, and we have some outstanding \nstaff on both sides. Every member of the committee and every committee \nmember's staff helped on this one, and that makes a difference. So I \nask everyone to support the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Shall the bill pass?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n\n[[Page S3568]]\n\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

ENHANCEMENT OF ACCELERATED PATIENT ACCESS TO NEW \n                   MEDICAL TREATMENTS.\n\n       (a) Findings; Sense of Congress.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\n       (A) The Food and Drug Administration (referred to in this \n     section as the ``FDA'') serves a critical role in helping to \n     assure that new medicines are safe and effective. Regulatory \n     innovation is 1 element of the Nation's strategy to address \n     serious and life-threatening diseases or conditions by \n     promoting investment in and development of innovative \n     treatments for unmet medical needs.\n       (B) During the 2 decades following the establishment of the \n     accelerated approval mechanism, advances in medical sciences, \n     including genomics, molecular biology, and bioinformatics, \n     have provided an unprecedented understanding of the \n     underlying biological mechanism and pathogenesis of disease. \n     A new generation of modern, targeted medicines is under \n     development to treat serious and life-threatening diseases, \n     some applying drug development strategies based on biomarkers \n     or pharmacogenomics, predictive toxicology, clinical trial \n     enrichment techniques, and novel clinical trial designs, such \n     as adaptive clinical trials.\n       (C) As a result of these remarkable scientific and medical \n     advances, the FDA should be encouraged to implement more \n     broadly effective processes for the expedited development and \n     review of innovative new medicines intended to address unmet \n     medical needs for serious or life-threatening diseases or \n     conditions, including those for rare diseases or conditions, \n     using a broad range of surrogate or clinical endpoints and \n     modern scientific tools earlier in the drug development cycle \n     when appropriate. This may result in fewer, smaller, or \n     shorter clinical trials for the intended patient population \n     or targeted subpopulation without compromising or altering \n     the high standards of the FDA for the approval of drugs.\n       (D) Patients benefit from expedited access to safe and \n     effective innovative therapies to treat unmet medical needs \n     for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions.\n       (E) For these reasons, the statutory authority in effect on \n     the day before the date of enactment of this Act governing \n     expedited approval of drugs for serious or life-threatening \n     diseases or conditions should be amended in order to enhance \n     the authority of the FDA to consider appropriate scientific \n     data, methods, and tools, and to expedite development and \n     access to novel treatments for patients with a broad range of \n     serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions.\n       (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Food and Drug Administration should apply the accelerated \n     approval and fast track provisions set forth in section 506 \n     of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 356), \n     as amended by this section, to help expedite the development \n     and availability to patients of treatments for serious or \n     life-threatening diseases or conditions while maintaining \n     safety and effectiveness standards for such treatments.\n       (b) Expedited Approval of Drugs for Serious or Life-\n     Threatening Diseases or Conditions.--Section 506 (21 U.S.C. \n     356) is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 506. EXPEDITED APPROVAL OF DRUGS FOR SERIOUS OR LIFE-\n                   THREATENING DISEASES OR CONDITIONS.\n\n       ``(a) Designation of Drug as Fast Track Product.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall, at the request of \n     the sponsor of a new drug, facilitate the development and \n     expedite the review of such drug if it is intended, whether \n     alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, for the \n     treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or \n     condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet \n     medical needs for such a disease or condition. (In this \n     section, such a drug is referred to as a `fast track \n     product'.)\n       ``(2) Request for designation.--The sponsor of a new drug \n     may request the Secretary to designate the drug as a fast \n     track product.

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote and move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I know people are very anxious to move on. \nI am, too, but I have to say just a word. I have said in my own caucus \nhow much I appreciate the cooperation of Senator Enzi. He is a fine \nSenator. He and Senator Harkin have worked so well together. It is \nexemplary for what the rest of us should do. I appreciate very much the \nwork they have done. I repeat, it is how we should get other work done.\n  This is an important piece of legislation, and we made it look \nsimple; it was not. But because of these two fine Senators, we were \nable to get this done in a very short period of time and get good \nthings done for the American people.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, today, with passage of the FDA Safety \nand Innovation Act and the reauthorization of the FDA user fee \nagreements, we have helped both the FDA and the biomedical industry \nensure that they can get needed medical products to patients quickly \nand safely.\n  This legislation will ensure that the FDA can swiftly approve drugs \nand medical devices, save biomedical industry jobs, protect patient \naccess to new therapies, and preserve America's global leadership in \nbiomedical innovation. It will keep patients safer by modernizing FDA's \ninspection process for foreign manufacturing facilities, while also \nimproving access to new and innovative medicines and devices. It will \nreduce drug costs for consumers by speeding the approval of lower cost \ngeneric drugs and help prevent and address drug shortages. Finally, by \nimproving the way FDA does business, increasing accountability and \ntransparency, U.S. companies will be better able to innovate and \ncompete in the global marketplace.\n  By passing the FDA Safety and Innovation Act, we have taken an \nimportant step to improve American families' access to lifesaving drugs \nand medical devices.\n  As I have said throughout this debate, the bipartisan process that \nproduced this excellent bill has been quite remarkable. I have worked \nclosely with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, as well as \nindustry stakeholders, patient groups, and consumer groups to solicit \nideas and improvements on the critical provisions in this bill. We have \na better product thanks to everyone's input.\n  I extend a special thank-you to my colleague, Ranking Member Enzi. I \nhave been working with Senator Enzi for over a year on this bill. It \nhas been a wonderful and cooperative partnership and a trusting \nfriendship. I can honestly say we would not have gotten this done \nwithout his excellent leadership and wise counsel. I thank him for \nthat.\n  I also thank all of the HELP Committee members, as well as members \noff the committee, who were thoroughly engaged with this process from \nthe beginning as part of the bipartisan working groups we established. \nEach of them has contributed significantly to this legislation, and I \nam sincerely grateful for all their contributions.\n  Madam President, I will submit for the Record a list of all staff \nmembers who were part of our bipartisan working groups throughout the \npast year. We all know we could not have achieved this without the \ntireless and diligent work of our loyal staffs. I extend my deep \nappreciation for their hard work and extraordinary efforts.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of staff members be printed in \nthe Record.\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/24/senate-section/article/S3608-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3608-S3609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HELP BIPARTISAN WORKING GROUPS\n\n\n                             Drug Shortages\n\n        Rachel Pryor--Blumenthal;\n        Jessica McNiece, Christine Evans--Mikulski;\n        Deirdre Fruh--Casey;\n       Andrew Hu--Klobuchar;\n       Hannah Katch, Whitney Brown--Franken;\n        Jennifer DeAngelis--Whitehouse;\n       Sophie Kasimow--Sanders;\n       Rohini Kosoglu, Sally Mayes--Bennett;\n        Susan Lexer--Merkley;\n       Joshua Teitelbaum--Hagan;\n       Sandra Wilkniss--Bingaman;\n       Jennifer Boyer--Roberts;\n       Hayden Rhudy--Hatch;\n       MarySumpter Lipinski--Alexander;\n        Christopher Bowlin--McCain;\n       Anna Abram, Margaret Coulter--Burr;\n       Anne Oswalt--Corker;\n       Amanda Makki--Murkowski.\n\n\n                  Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now\n\n       Rachel Pryor--Blumenthal;\n       Hannah Katch, Whitney Brown--Franken;\n        Sophie Kasimow--Sanders;\n       Susan Lexer--Merkley;\n       Rohini Kosoglu--Bennett;\n       Joshua Teitelbaum--Hagan;\n       Sandra Wilkniss--Bingaman;\n       Matt Prowler, Deirdre Fruh--Casey;\n        Christine Evans, Jessica McNiece--Mikulski;\n       Margaret Coulter/Anna Abram--Burr;\n       Amanda Makki--Murkowski;\n        Ashley Carson Cottingham--Sanders;\n        Michael Behan--Sanders;\n       Tyler Thompson, Francie Pastor--Isakson;\n        MarySumpter Lapinski--Alexander;\n       Jennifer Boyer--Roberts;\n        Shauna McCarthy--Kirk;\n        Hayden Rhudy--Hatch.\n\n\n                         Pediatrics (BPCA/PREA)\n\n       Paula Berg--Murray;\n       Kate Mevis--Reed;\n       Rohini Kosoglu, Sally Mayes--Bennett;\n        Jessica McNiece, Christine Evans--Mikulski;\n        Deirdre Fruh, Matt Prowler--Casey;\n        Hannah Katch, Whitney Brown--Franken;\n        Sophie Kasimow--Sanders;\n       Anna Abram, Margaret Coulter--Burr;\n        MarySumpter Lapinski, Nicolas Magallanes--Alexander;\n       Jennifer Boyer--Roberts;\n       Tyler Thompson--Isakson;\n       Amanda Makki--Murkowski;\n       Hayden Rhudy, Paul Williams--Hatch.\n\n\n                           Drug Supply Chain\n\n       Rohini Kosoglu--Bennett;\n       Jennifer DeAngelis, Justin Florence--Whitehouse;\n       Anna Abram--Burr;\n       Erika Smith--Grassley.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

I also thank Elizabeth Jungman, Bill McConagha, Kathleen Laird, \nKathleen Wise, Dan Goldberg, Justine Sessions, Kate Frischmann, \nElizabeth Donovan, Lory Yudin, Frank Zhang, and Evan Griffis.

I thank all \nof you for your extraordinary public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/24/senate-section/article/S3609-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3609-S3611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STOP THE STUDENT LOAN INTEREST RATE HIKE ACT OF 2012\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to S. 2343, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2343) to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 \n     to extend the reduced interest rate for Federal Direct \n     Stafford Loans, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 10 \nminutes of debate equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, we are in a rather ridiculous staring \ncontest, waiting for our Democratic friends to offer a proposal that \ncan actually pass when we already have one right in front of us. We \nhave wasted actually 2 weeks on this student loan issue for no good \nreason. Neither I nor the ranking member has heard a word from the \nDemocrats on how they propose to resolve the issue and actually prevent \nthe interest rate from rising.\n  As we learned earlier this week, the President doesn't seem to even \ntalk to his committee chairmen anymore. All of this suggests that the \nWhite House doesn't want to solve the problem; that it would rather \nallow these rates to double in a few weeks so he can run around all \nsummer pointing the finger at those Republicans in the Senate.\n  I would still like to believe that is not the case. We had a chance \nto talk to the President about this and other issues last week down at \nthe White House. I am convinced he would like to get a solution. Yet \nthe fact is, all he would have to do is simply pick up the phone and \ntell the Democratic leadership that we would like to get this done, and \nI am pretty confident we could work it out. Unfortunately, we cannot \njust wait around hoping the President is going to pick up the phone. \nCollege students cannot wait either. They want us to resolve the issue \nnow, and I know we can.\n  To move the ball forward, I would say to my colleague, the majority \nleader, if he agrees with me--Senator Harkin and Senator Enzi just did \na good job with coming up with a bipartisan solution to the FDA bill. I \nam confident they could do the same thing on the student loan issue. \nThey are the chairman and the ranking member of the committee that \noversees student loan legislation. I have a lot of confidence in their \nability to do it.\n  I am going to proffer a consent agreement that I think would allow us \nto go forward. My colleague from Tennessee will take the balance of our \ntime after I have concluded.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the conclusion of the two \nscheduled votes on the student loan bill, which we are about to have, \nthe next order of business be a Harkin-Enzi bill dealing with the issue \nof the current student loan rate; provided further that no motion to \nproceed to other items be in order unless agreed to by both leaders.\n  The purpose of this consent agreement I have just proffered is to \nallow Senator Harkin and Senator Enzi to negotiate on this important \nissue, the increase in the student loan rates, and to keep the Senate \nfocused on how to resolve this issue in a timely way before the rate \ngoes up. The bill they would negotiate would be the next order of \nbusiness, but it would also provide that both leaders could agree to \nallow the Senate to work on other measures if necessary as those \nstudent loan discussions continue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I am going to use the leader time, not the 5 minutes we \nwere allocated.\n  Madam President, we have all heard of reverse engineering. What we \njust heard is reverse reasoning. This is one of the most interesting \nthings I have heard--that makes no sense. We have been trying to get on \nthis bill for weeks. The Republicans have refused to allow us to get on \nthe bill.\n  The student loan issue is important. We should have already completed \nthis--had we been allowed to get on the bill--but we were not allowed \nto get on the bill. We were faced with one of our many filibusters--\nscores of them. Not one, two, three or four, scores of them. This is \nanother example of them stopping us from legislating on a bill. Now to \ncome here and say we could have been doing something--my friend knows \nthe rules of this Senate as well as I do. He knows his suggestion is \nabsurd.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2153\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. On behalf of Senator Alexander I call up amendment No. \n2153.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for Mr. \n     Alexander, for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Enzi, Mr. \n     Barrasso, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Coats, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. \n     Heller, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Johanns, Mr. Roberts, \n     Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Rubio, and Ms. Ayotte, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2153.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Interest Rate Reduction \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. INTEREST RATE EXTENSION.\n\n       Subparagraph (D) of section 455(b)(7) of the Higher \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087e(b)(7)(D)) is amended--\n       (1) in the matter preceding clause (i), by striking \n     ``2012'' and inserting ``2013''; and\n       (2) in clause (v), by striking ``2012'' and inserting \n     ``2013''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

COMPLIANCE WITH STATUTORY PAY-AS-YOU-GO ACT OF 2010.\n\n       The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of \n     complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall \n     be determined by reference to the latest statement titled \n     ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act, \n     submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the \n     Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, provided that such \n     statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, on July 1, 7 million students getting \nnew loans to go to college, the rate for interest will go from 3.4 to \n6.8. This is an amendment to get a result. This is the House-passed \nbill. President Obama\n\n[[Page S3610]]\n\nsays he wants to freeze the rate for a year. Governor Romney says he \nwants to freeze the rate for a year. The House of Representatives has \nvoted to freeze the rate for a year. A vote yes on the House-passed \nbill will permit us to send it to them and quickly send it to the \nPresident, he will sign it, and we solve the problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, while I appreciate the confidence the \nRepublican leader has in the ability of Mr. Enzi and me to get things \ndone, frankly, we are confronted now with two votes. Which way do we \nwant to go? What they are proposing is that we totally end, totally \neliminate all of the prevention and wellness money that we have out \nthere in the wellness fund.\n  What would this do? We have vaccinations for children, immunizations, \nsmoking cessation programs, colorectal screenings, diabetes prevention, \nbreast cancer screening, obesity prevention--all funded by this \nPrevention and Wellness Fund. Not one of those would be funded from \nthat fund if that amendment passes.\n  The choice is very clear on the two amendments we have coming up. We \ncan either vote to close a tax loophole that allows wealthy tax dodgers \nnot to pay their fair share of taxes--we can close that loophole and \nkeep the interest rates at 3.4 percent--or, as the Republicans want to \ndo, totally eliminate the Wellness and Prevention Fund and end the \nmoney that we are putting into diabetes prevention and breast cancer \nand colorectal screening and all the things I mentioned.\n  I do not think the choice could be more clear to the American people \nabout the direction we ought to go. Close the tax loophole. Keep the \nprevention fund in there. Keep our people healthy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, we have 2 minutes left. I will use one \nof them.\n  Our friends on the other side have their usual solution to almost any \nproblem: Let's put some more taxes on small business men and women in \nAmerica during a time of the greatest recession we have had.\n  We have a better idea for how to pay for this bill. We will take some \nof the savings the Congressional Budget Office said they found when \nthey took over the student health program in the health care bill--\ninstead of giving the students the benefit of those savings, they spent \nit on government. They spent $8.3 billion on the health care bill. We \nwill give back to the students enough money to pay for this freezing of \nthe rate.\n  We will not tax the small businesspeople. We will have a little left \nover, and we will reduce the debt. Then we can send our bill to the \nHouse, they will pass it like that, send it to the President, and the \nproblem is solved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, as Senator Harkin pointed out, the \nRepublican proposal goes right to the heart of prevention, and that \nwill have two effects. It will deny critical services to families all \nacross this country, and it will do something else--it will deny us the \nchance to bend that proverbial cost curve. If we do not control those \ncosts, we will be in a fiscal disaster. The proposal they are making \ndoes not make sense. We have proposed to close a tax loophole that has \nbeen described by the Treasury inspector general for tax administration \nas a multibillion-dollar employment tax shelter.\n  We have restricted it to the people who are receiving over $200,000 a \nyear. This is not small business men and women. This is not the corner \nhardware store. These are lobbyists. These are lawyers who have \ncraftily used subchapter S corporations to avoid paying payroll taxes.\n  This loophole has been criticized on the editorial pages of the Wall \nStreet Journal. This is no ``just raise taxes.'' This is trying to find \na loophole which has been criticized by the right as well as the left \nto pay for and ensure that we do not double the interest rate on \nstudents. I cannot think of a clearer choice: Reject the Republican \nproposal; accept our proposal; do not allow the subsidized student loan \ninterest rate to rise on July 1.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 20 seconds.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. It is reassuring to me my friend on the other side of \nthe aisle is reading the editorial pages of the Wall Street Journal. I \nam sure that will have some constructive benefit over the next several \nmonths. But here is the bottom line, a result. This is the same as the \nHouse-passed bill which freezes interest at 3.4 percent for a year. We \nsend it to the House, down to the President, he signs it, the problem \nis solved. Instead of raising taxes on small businesspeople, we give \nback to students the money they should have had the benefit of when the \nother side took over the whole student loan program before.\n  If you want a result, please vote yes. If you want more debate and \ndelay, vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The President has already said if the Republican measure \nwere to pass and sent to him, he would veto it. That is a nonstarter. \nSurely my friend from Tennessee does not want to cut out all of this \nfunding that we do for hepatitis screening and colorectal screening, \ndiabetes prevention, vaccination for our kids, all of which are funded. \nAll of that would be ended by their amendment.\n  I do not know what my friend is talking about in terms of student \nmoney and this and that. Their provision takes all of this money out of \nthe Prevention and Wellness Fund. That is not what we want. We do not \nwant to keep our kids from getting vaccinations or hepatitis screening \nor diabetes prevention in order to keep the interest rates low. Let's \nclose the tax loophole that has been talked about, that both Senator \nReid from Nevada and Senator Reed from Rhode Island talked about. Close \nthat tax loophole and send it to the President. He will sign it. That \nway we will keep the interest rates down at 3.4 percent and not allow \nthem to double on July 1.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. REID. Has all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 35 seconds and the majority \n38 seconds.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Our case is so compelling, Mr. President. We yield \nback the rest of our time.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Time has been yielded back. We think there will be two more \nvotes. I can't say there will be no more votes. We have a few more \nitems to be worked out, such as flood insurance. I can't give everyone \nthat assurance at this time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Ms. SNOWE (when her name was called).

Mr. President, while the Republican alternative was \ndefinitely better than the Democrat-endorsed proposal, at the end of \nthe day, neither option presented a long term answer to the impending \nrise in student loan interest rates.\n  In 2007, Congress passed the College Cost Reduction and Access Act, \nwhich I opposed. This legislation used a stepped reduction of interest \nrates for subsidized Stafford loans, from 6.8 percent to the current \n3.4 percent. Also as a part of this law, these rates are scheduled to \nreset to the original 6.8 percent on July 1. So for five years, we have \nknown this day was coming. A one-year extension of the current interest \nrate is merely a six billion dollar temporary fix. It would simply \npostpone finding an actual solution to the problem of college \naffordability. Congress has gotten too comfortable with band aid fixes: \npayments to physicians, the Highway bill, and flood insurance being \nrecent examples. It is because of increased government intervention \nthat we continually find ourselves in this predicament. With every \ngovernment takeover, whether it is education, health care, or the EPA, \nthe result is less competition, less consumer choice, and less \ninnovation.\n  Mr. President, I understand the importance and value of a good \neducation. My wife was a teacher, and my two daughters became teachers \nas well, one even at a university. I also commend the efforts of all \nstudents who strive to achieve a higher education and improve their \nlives, especially those struggling through financial burdens. However, \nwe owe it to these students to address the problem, not just put a band \naid on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments this \nafternoon to do something that has become a bit of a ritual with me; \nthat is, to try to take some time each week to speak about the damage \nwe are doing to our atmosphere, to our oceans, and to our climate with \nthe relentless carbon pollution we are discharging.\n  As each week goes by, the information continues to pile up about the \nharms we are causing.\n  A recent story says rising temperatures could eliminate two-thirds of \nCalifornia's snowpack by the end of this century.\n\n       The snowpack that helps provide water for California cities \n     and farms could shrink by two-thirds because of climate \n     change, according to new research submitted to the state's \n     Energy Commission.\n       Higher temperatures appear likely to wipe out a third of \n     the Golden State's snowpack by 2050 and two-thirds by the end \n     of the century, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography \n     found.\n\n  Science Daily reports:\n\n       Black carbon aerosols and tropospheric ozone, both \n     humanmade pollutants emitted predominantly in the Northern \n     Hemisphere's low- to mid-latitudes--\n\n  That is basically us--\n\n     are most likely pushing the boundary of the tropics further \n     poleward--\n\n  North and south--\n\n     in that hemisphere, new research by a team of scientists \n     shows. . . .\n\n  The lead climatologist, Robert J. Allen, says:\n\n       If the tropics are moving poleward, then the subtropics \n     will become even drier. If a poleward displacement of the \n     mid-latitude storm tracks also occurs, this will shift mid-\n     latitude precipitation poleward, impacting regional \n     agriculture, economy, and society.\n\n  The American people have not been taken in by the campaign of \npropaganda that primarily the polluting industries have put out. There \nhave been significant reports in the past on ExxonMobil's funding of \nessentially phony research agencies so they can offer their opinions on \nthis issue without having it be ExxonMobil's opinion. They either \ncreate or take over or subsidize organizations that then put out the \nmessage, and they sound legit--Heartland Institute, Annapolis Center.\n  But the American people are not fooled, it turns out. Seventy-one \npercent of visitors who have come to the Nation's wildlife refuges say \nthey were personally concerned about climate change's effects on fish, \nwildlife, and habitat. Seventy-four percent said that working to limit \nclimate's effects on fish, wildlife, and habitat would benefit future \ngenerations. And 69 percent said doing so would improve the quality of \nlife today.\n  One of the original researchers on climate change--I quoted an \narticle earlier, describing how over time the facts have proven his \ninitial predictions accurate--is James Hansen. He wrote an article a \nfew weeks ago in the New York Times headlined ``Game Over for the \nClimate.'' It begins with these two sentences:\n\n       Global warming isn't a prediction. It is happening.\n\n  Clearly we see that in measurements and observations around the \nplanet. But what happens if it keeps going? He is talking about the tar \nsands up in Canada, and he says this:\n\n       If we were to fully exploit this new oil source, and \n     continue to burn our conventional oil, gas, and coal \n     supplies, concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere \n     would eventually reach levels higher than in the Pliocene \n     era, more than 2.5 million years ago, when sea level was at \n     least 50 feet higher than it is now. That level of heat-\n     trapping gases would assure that the disintegration of the \n     ice sheets would accelerate out of control. Sea levels would \n     rise and destroy coastal cities. Global temperatures would \n     become intolerable. Twenty to 50 percent of the planet's \n     species would be driven to extinction. Civilization would be \n     at risk.\n\n  That is clearly, as he admits, a long-term outlook, but it is an \noutlook that deserves our attention, because when he has given us long-\nterm outlooks in the past, as time has marched forward they have been \nproven over and over to be true.\n  It is convenient around here to pretend that none of this is \nhappening. And it would be nice if we could wait until the disaster, \nthe wolf was at the door and then do something about it, but there is a \nstrong likelihood that by the time we take action, it will be too late.\n  In September of 1940, there was an American living in the Philippines \nwith his wife and son. He looked at what was happening over in Europe. \nHe looked at the threat to Britain. He cabled back to the United States \nhis recommendation. He said:\n\n       The history of failure in war can almost be summed up in \n     two words--``too late.'' Too late in comprehending the deadly \n     purpose of a potential enemy. Too late in realizing the \n     mortal danger. Too late in preparedness. Too late in uniting \n     all possible forces for resistance. Too late in standing by \n     one's friends.\n\n  The author of that cable was GEN George MacArthur. He continued later \non in the cable:\n\n       The greatest strategic mistake in all history will be made \n     if America fails to recognize the vital moment, if she \n     permits again the writing of that fatal epitaph ``too late.''\n\n  Of course, General MacArthur was talking about what was becoming \nWorld War II, he was not talking about climate change. Yet his warning \nrings very true against this threat as well. ``Too late'' will be the \nepitaph if we do not prepare now. And I very much regret that we are in \na situation in which we do not seem able as a body to take this threat \nseriously. The House shows no indication whatsoever of taking this \nthreat seriously. Even the White House has dialed back its expressions \nof interest and concern on this issue, probably for the practical \nreason that the Republican-controlled House does not\n\n[[Page S3613]]\n\nwant to deal with this issue at all. Period. End of story. But it is \nhappening out there. It is happening out there.\n  People see the dying forests of the West as the pine bark beetle \nworks its way more and more north because winters are no longer cold \nenough to kill off the larvae. People see the habitat of quail, of \ntrout, of pheasant, of game animals, change in their lifetimes.\n  They see the places where they used to be able to go to fish with \ntheir grandchildren no longer available. Farmers see changes. Gardeners \nsee changes. Plants that could not grow in certain zones now can. \nTropical plants can grow in northern areas because of changes. In Rhode \nIsland we have had winter blooms of some of our fruit trees because it \nhas gotten so warm.\n  My wife did her dissertation on the species called the winter \nflounder, which was a very significant cash crop for the Rhode Island \nfishing industry. It was not very long ago. She wrote her dissertation \nabout it because it was such an important part of the Rhode Island \nfishing industry, and because it had an interesting connection with a \nshrimp, Crangon septemspinosa, in which one fed on the other until it \ngot big enough, and then the predatory cycle reversed itself and the \nwinter flounder began to eat the shrimp instead of vice versa.\n  Well, landings of winter flounder in Rhode Island have crashed \ncatastrophically. The reason? The mean winter water temperature of \nNarragansett Bay is up about 4 degrees. That is enough of an ecosystem \nshift that the winter flounder is gone. Fishermen now catch scup \ninstead, which is a far less remunerative crop and frankly not as good \na fish to eat, in my opinion anyway.\n  So these changes are happening. It is regrettable that we are unable \nto address them. The science has been discredited by propaganda \ncampaigns that are deliberately and strategically designed to create \ndoubt in the minds of the public where no doubt should exist. The fact \nis this science is rock solid.\n  The notion that when you put lots of carbon dioxide up into the \natmosphere it warms the atmosphere has been around since the Civil War. \nThe scientist who discovered it was an English-Irish scientist named \nJohn Tyndall. He first reported this phenomenon in 1863. For 150 years \nwe have known this. This is nothing new. We can measure the gigatons of \ncarbon that we are discharging into the atmosphere. Of course, it is \ngoing to make a difference. The notion that it does not has been a \npublic relations and propaganda campaign by well-heeled special \ninterests to protect pollution, because it makes money for those \ncompanies. But with the damage it is doing to our future, it is very \nhard to honestly look my children in the eye and say I am doing my job \nfor them here in Washington while we do nothing on carbon pollution.\n  In fact, we continue to subsidize the biggest polluters. ExxonMobil \nmakes more money than any corporation has in the history of the world \nand they still claim a subsidy from the American taxpayer. It is a \nridiculous subsidy. And yet we subsidize them. I see the distinguished \nchairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee is \nhere on the floor. I want to conclude my remarks and thank him for the \namazing work he and the ranking member, Michael Enzi, did on the FDA \nbill we just passed with such a strong vote, virtually a unanimous \nvote. There was a lot of very good work that was done there, so that \nproves there are areas where we can do good work.\n  I hope the day comes when we can begin to do good work on the damage \nwe are doing to our atmosphere and to our oceans with our relentless \ndischarge of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, with our relentless \nsubsidy of the polluters. One day we will be called into account for \nour inaction, and we will have earned the condemnation of history.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to thank my friend from Rhode \nIsland for a very eloquent speech--elegant speech too--eloquent and \nelegant--in portraying what is so frustrating. And that is science \nknows what is happening. The scientists know what is happening. We have \ngood data points about what is happening to our climate, our \natmosphere, our oceans, and yet it seems we cannot do anything about \nit.\n  I say to my friend from Rhode Island, I think I was reading recently \nin a Scientific American magazine, which I love to read every month, \nthat in terms of this whole global climate change, what is happening is \nthat by the time we recognize it is happening--that is broadly, not \njust the scientists and others who do know what is happening--by the \ntime it is broadly accepted, it will be too late, that we will have \nreached that tipping point. But the evidence is there for all to see. \nIt is a shame that we cannot do something about it.\n  The Senator mentioned the fish catch in Rhode Island. I think also in \nthe recent issue of Scientific American was a story about the fisheries \nand oceans at large, and there were three pictures. One was a picture \ntaken on a pier in Key West in the 1950s showing the size of the fish \nthat were caught. Big. I think the average weight was like 30-some \npounds. Then there was a picture taken in the 1970s--late 1970s, early \n1980s--now it is down to maybe 15 pounds. Same pictures, same pier, \nsame dock and everything, and now the catch is down to teeny little \nfish. Same place, same ocean, same waters.\n  The article went on to point out how, if you look at the first \npicture, people are very happy. They are happy with this big fish. Then \nthe second page, people are happy with what they caught. And now you \nhave got this little teeny fish and people are still happy, because we \nkind of tend to accept what it is right now and be happy with what we \nhave got without realizing what we have lost in the past.\n  Again, I thank the Senator for his speech. We need to do more of that \naround here. We need to focus on this. We seem to be drifting. You are \nright, our grandkids are going to wonder why we did not do something.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I would suggest that it is more than just that we are \ndrifting. I would suggest we are being drifted by politics and by the \nmoney in politics, particularly the big money the big polluters can \nthrow into politics, not only directly by giving campaign contributions \nto people but by flooding money into phony so-called scientific \norganizations that then parrot their message, but without people being \nable to say: Wait a minute, this is ExxonMobil telling me; maybe I \nshould be a little more guarded about it. So they launder it through a \nlegitimate-sounding organization--not one, dozens--and we get bombarded \nwith false propaganda. Scientists are not good at propaganda. It is not \nwhy they went to graduate school. It is not why they got their Ph.D. It \nis not what they do when they are out in the field taking measurements. \nSo you put them up against a company such as ExxonMobil with all of its \nmoney and its propaganda skills and it is not an even contest.\n  As the Chairman points out, by the time we are looking around and \nseeing, oh, my gosh, what have we allowed to happen--now we are awake--\nwe reject the propaganda. We have to do something about this, and it \nwill probably be, as General MacArthur said, too late. That is the \ngreat danger.\n  I thank the chairman for his recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     honoring senator james abdnor\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a former Member \nof this body and my long-time friend and mentor, Senator Jim Abdnor of \nSouth Dakota. Senator Abdnor passed away last Wednesday, May 16, 2012, \nin South Dakota in the company of friends and family.\n  We are both products of the dusty short-grass country just west of \nthe Missouri River on the plains of central South Dakota. Jim was a \nproduct of the active and civically-minded political culture of Lyman \nCounty and I was from next door Jones County. Despite these counties' \nsports rivalries over the years, Jim took me under his wing and \nintroduced me to the American political process. If not for Jim Abdnor, \nI would not be standing here today.\n\n[[Page S3614]]\n\n  After a basketball game when I was a freshman in high school, Jim \nstruck up a conversation with me that would change the course of my \nlife. I went to work for Jim as a legislative assistant when he was a \nSenator and later at the Small Business Administration. When I first \nran for office, Jim's guidance and support were invaluable to me.\n  This past weekend, hundreds of South Dakotans came out to honor Jim \nAbdnor and remember his great love for them and his state. His funeral \nwas held in a Lutheran church in the shadow of the State capital in \nPierre, where Jim first served in statewide office as Lieutenant \nGovernor. Jim was buried just outside of his small hometown of Kennebec \nnear where his immigrant father first homesteaded.\n  Mr. President, Jim leaves us with many legacies and I want to mention \na few of them here today.\n  First and foremost, Jim's was an American story. It started as the \ntale of an immigrant who boarded a ship for the United States not even \nknowing the English language but knowing he was heading for the land of \nopportunity. That immigrant, Jim's father Sam Abdelnour, wanted to \nescape the growing authoritarianism of his native Lebanon, for American \nfreedom.\n  Jim's story is also a frontier story. His father Sam settled in Lyman \nCounty, South Dakota. Sam Abdnor became a homesteader and planted corn \nand wheat. He also peddled his wares to the other farmers in the area \nand when Kennebec was organized as a town, Sam was one of the first \npeople to establish a business on main street. Jim grew up learning how \nto balance the books in a small town store and knowing how to work the \nfamily farm. He learned financial responsibility and hard work and how \none can climb the ladder of success in America.\n  Jim's story is also a story of the land and farming. Some of us who \nknew Jim through politics may forget that before he was elected to \nCongress Jim had owned and run the family farm for three decades. Jim \nwas very proud of the fact that he was good at representing South \nDakota agriculture because he was an active farmer who did the planting \nand hauled his grain to the elevator in the fall. When he was in \nCongress, South Dakota was ranked as the most agricultural state in the \nNation and Jim was the first farmer elected to Congress from South \nDakota. Jim was proud of that correlation and he never forgot his \nfarming roots.\n  During the 1970s, when people were organizing sit-ins and teach-ins \nand other protests, Jim helped organize a ``beef-in.'' He brought 100 \nWest River ranchers to Washington, DC, to talk about farm issues. They \nset up pens of cattle on the Washington mall and met with agriculture \nofficials. Jim didn't rest until these ranchers had their voices heard.\n  Jim's story is also about water. We all live comfortably now with \nrunning water and hot showers, but that's not how Jim grew up. He grew \nup on his family's windy, dry-land farm in Lyman County. He lived \nthrough the droughts of the 1930s. He understood the importance of \nwater. He never stopped working on the issues of water access--\nincluding being a champion of the WEB water project in Walworth, \nEdmunds, and Brown counties in north central South Dakota that began in \n1983.\n  The question of water was never far from Jim's mind and I think it \nhad something to do with his heritage. That's certainly true of his \nLyman County roots, which is where the humid Midwest begins to turn \ninto the arid High Plains, but also of his roots in Lebanon, where \nwater is also scarce. His family's home village of Ain Arab was founded \nbecause it was a watering hole. Ain Arab literally means ``spring'' or \n``well.'' More specifically, it means ``spring of the Arab.'' When they \nhad enough water in Ain Arab they would grow wheat, just like the \nAbdnors would do out in Lyman County.\n\n  Jim's is also a story about organizing. As soon as he came home from \ncollege, he started organizing Republicans in Lyman County and became \nhead of the Lyman County Young Republicans. He helped organize and \nfound the Elks lodge in Pierre in 1953. He joined every organization he \ncould and he brought as many people into community affairs and politics \nand civic organizations as he could.\n  Jim also pushed other people to organize. He liked to tell the story \nof the people in Faith, SD, who wanted a new grandstand at their rodeo \ngrounds. They took one look at the Federal regulations involved with \nsome grant program and promptly did everything themselves, raising all \nthe money they needed from local sources and fundraisers and did it at \n10 percent of the cost. They put in 4,000 hours of their own time and \nmade it happen themselves and Jim appreciated that. He liked \ncommunities working together to solve their own problems.\n  During the 1970s, when tensions in the Middle East worsened, Jim \ncalled for his fellow Arab-Americans to become more involved in the \npolitical process. He opposed what he saw as their tendency toward \nisolation and self-segregation. He said his ethnic compatriots should \n``get out and mix.'' ``They should become more involved,'' he said, \n``become part of the community.'' Jim never stopped believing in the \nimportance of being involved and working with others to make life \nbetter.\n  This is why Jim had so many friends. He never stopped working to meet \npeople and bring them together around issues and simply to socialize. A \nfriend of mine says that he doesn't think anyone in the State of South \nDakota has ever attended more weddings, graduations, ceremonial \ndinners, or basketball, baseball, and football games than Jim.\n  As someone from the wide open plains who wanted groups of people to \ncome together to solve problems on their own, Jim was always resisting \nFederal encroachment on local control. As the son of a small \nbusinessman, Jim was sensitive to the growing encroachment of Federal \nregulations and how much this encroachment cost small businesses. For \nmany years, Jim was especially incensed about OSHA mandating rules for \nsmall stores on South Dakota main streets. In the 1970s, Jim also had a \nbig fight with OSHA because it was trying to mandate that South Dakota \nwheat farmers maintain porta-potties in the fields, which a practicing \nwheat farmer from Lyman County, South Dakota knew was the definition of \nabsurd.\n  As a small businessman and farmer, Jim was always worried about the \nbottom line and he constantly tried to apply these concerns in the area \nof the Federal budget. Jim was sounding the alarm bell in the 1970s \nwhen the Federal Government spent less than $400 billion a year, which \ntoday seems laughably small given our current state of affairs. Back \nthen, he was attacking deficits of $70 billion. He was also adamantly \nopposed to the Federal Government bailing out New York City in the \n1970s because he said it would set a bad precedent. He attacked a \nFederal debt ceiling limit of $500 billion as being highly \nirresponsible. He criticized the fact that each American owed $2,000 \nbecause of the Federal Government's debt. Jim liked to quote the editor \nof the Freeman Courier, who asked ``how can it be that a government \nwhich is unable to balance its own budget and lives far beyond its \nmeans, has the authority to tell a businessman'' how to run his \nbusiness.\n  Jim wasn't afraid to make hard votes to fix our problems, votes that \nprobably cost him his Senate seat. But Jim Abdnor had the moral courage \nto make the tough decisions.\n  Mr. President, Jim Abdnor leaves us with a critical reminder. He \nembodied the American dream. He was the son of a poor Lebanese peddler \nwho built a successful business and raised a great family, including a \nson who ascended the heights of American politics and became a U.S. \nSenator. Jim Abdnor shows how hard work and diligence can pay off.\n  On this occasion of remembrance and during this time of honoring my \ngood friend Jim Abdnor, I hope we can remember our solemn duty to \nprotect the American dream that the Abdnor family represented.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S3615]]\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 5652\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last month, the Senate passed the Violence \nAgainst Women Act Reauthorization on a strong bipartisan vote of 68 to \n31. Fifteen Republican Senators--including all the women on the other \nside of the aisle--joined Senate Democrats to support this important \nlegislation. Senate Democrats strongly stand behind the bill we passed. \nIt makes clear that all victims of domestic violence and sexual assault \nshould enjoy the protections of the Violence Against Women Act. We \ndon't believe we should be in the business of picking and choosing \nwhich victims deserve protection.\n  In contrast, the bill passed by House Republicans fails to include \ncrucial protections for Native American women--I have 22 tribal \norganizations in my State, for example--gay and lesbian victims, \nbattered immigrant women, and victims on college campuses and in \nsubsidized housing. The House bill would roll back many important and \nlongstanding protections in current law for abused immigrant victims--\nprotections that have never been controversial and previously have \nenjoyed widespread bipartisan support.\n  So there are many differences to be worked out between the House and \nthe Senate in this crucial piece of legislation. The right place to \nwork out these differences is in conference. That is why we seek today \nto go to conference with the House on this important legislation, and \nthat is why we object to simply passing the House bill that has been \nsent to us.\n  The House has raised, I think unfortunately, the so-called blue slip \nproblem, which seems to be an issue they raise all the time when there \nis a bill they do not like.\n  Having said that, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed \nto the consideration of H.R. 5652, Calendar No. 398; that all after the \nenacting clause be stricken and the language of S. 1925, the Violence \nAgainst Women Act Reauthorization, as passed by the Senate on April 26 \nby a vote of 68 to 31, be inserted in lieu thereof; that the Senate \ninsist on its amendment, request a conference with the House on the \ndisagreeing votes of the two Houses; and the Chair be authorized to \nappoint conferees on the part of the Senate, with all the above \noccurring with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 4970\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me make a few observations and then \nI intend to offer a consent request myself.\n  This is a problem that has been created by the majority, and I am \nsorry they will not accept our offer to fix their problem so we can \nmove forward on this legislation. We have all known for literally years \nwhen the Violence Against Women Act was going to expire. We have known \nthat for years. During this time, Democrats controlled the Senate. Yet \nour friends on the other side waited until February of this year--\nnearly 6 months after the current authorization expired--before they \neven reported a bill out of committee, and they chose to wait almost 3 \nmonths more to bring a bill to the floor.\n  I don't know why that decision was made. Press reports indicate that \nmembers of the Democratic leadership thought they could use VAWA as a \ncampaign issue. When they finally chose to bring this bill to the \nSenate floor, Republicans consented to going to the bill, Republicans \nconsented to bringing the debate to a close, and Republicans consented \nto limiting ourselves to just two amendments--just two. Our Democratic \ncolleagues also added an amendment. It was a complete substitute. They \noffered it at the last minute.\n  This substitute was a couple hundred pages long and it added new \nsections to the bill. One of those sections would generate revenue by \nassessing new fees on immigration visas. I gather our Democratic \ncolleagues did this because their bill, unlike the Hutchison-Grassley \nbill, would add over $100 million to the debt.\n  Including this provision is obviously a problem, in that adding a \nrevenue provision in a Senate bill violates the Origination Clause of \nthe U.S. Constitution. If we sent the Senate bill to the House in its \ncurrent form, it would trigger a blue slip point of order, as it always \ndoes.\n  It is not our fault Senate Democrats waited until well after VAWA \nexpired to start moving a bill. It is not our fault their bill would \nadd to the debt. It is not our fault our friends waited until the last \nminute to try to fix the problem, and, in the course of doing so, they \ncreated yet another problem. We have offered to help them fix their \nproblem. They do not have to accept our help, but they should stop \ndemagoguing the issue and blaming others.\n  Therefore, I would offer another consent: I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 406, H.R. \n4970, the House-passed Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act; \nprovided further that all after the enacting clause be stricken, the \ntext of the Senate-passed Violence Against Women bill, S. 1925, with a \nmodification that strikes sections 805 and 810 related to the \nimmigration provisions; that the bill be read three times and passed, \nthe Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the \nHouse, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of \nthe Senate with a ratio agreed to by both leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the \nRepublican leader is now proposing an amendment to the Senate-passed \nbill--a Senate-passed bill that we are very proud of. It has been \nengineered and advocated by all Democratic Senators but mainly by the \n12 women who are part of our caucus. This is an important piece of \nlegislation. We all feel very strongly about this.\n  I haven't looked at all the details of this amendment, but I \nunderstand it. My first response is that the amendment is something the \nconferees should be working on. We can't do that without the proper \ninput from all the interested parties, and we have 52, other than \nmyself, on my side of the Capitol. That is why I have sought to go to \nconference with the product the Senate passed.\n  It may be that sometime in the future, after we evaluate all these \npieces that have been suggested by my friend, the Republican leader, we \nmay be able to proceed along this route, if, in fact, we get to \nconference. But we have to get to conference, and we have to have wider \ndiscussions airing the proposed amendment we have had just a little \ntime to look at, at this stage.\n  I understand my friend's proposal, and I object to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/24/senate-section/article/S3615-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, before I speak today about the bill \nbefore us, I want to commemorate the life of a dear friend and a true \nWest Virginian, Bill Stewart.\n  Bill was taken from us 2 days ago at the age of 59, but he left \nbehind a lifetime of memories and love for our State.\n  Bill Stewart was a proud West Virginian in every sense of the word, \nand he was the best cheerleader this State ever had. Whether it was \nplaying ball at Fairmont State--where I first met him--or coaching West \nVirginia University to a Fiesta Bowl win--where he took an underdog \nteam to a thrilling victory--you never had to worry about Bill's \nenthusiasm; he had enough for all of us. In fact, you were either a \nfriend of Bill Stewart's or he hadn't met you yet.\n  Bill was raised in New Martinsville and was a West Virginian through-\nand- through. Countless young men thrived under his coaching, but he \nwas also truly dedicated to his family--his wife Karen and his son \nBlaine. I hope Karen and Blaine know just how much Bill meant to the \npeople of our State, how much we loved him and how much we all will \nmiss him.\n\n[[Page S3616]]\n\n  My wife Gayle and I will keep Bill's entire family in our thoughts \nand prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/24/senate-section/article/S3616-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECOGNIZING GARY BATES\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the exemplary \ncitizenship of Gary Bates. This is recognition for a life that has been \nlived and is continuing to be lived well--the kind of honorable life \nthat too often goes unrecognized.\n  Gary's life has been defined by fighting. He began life in Henderson, \nNV fighting to avoid the challenges of a difficult home. He took this \nfighting spirit into the Marine Corps, where he served honorably until \n1966 when he began an impressive career as a professional heavyweight \nboxer. As a regular name on the Las Vegas strip, he faced off with big \nnames like Ken Norton, Ron Lyle and Gerry Cooney. There is nothing to \nidealize about many of the choices he made and paths he took in this \nphase of his life, but what is admirable is how he fought to turn his \nlife around. He learned from the mistakes he made, and turned potential \nstumbling blocks into effective stepping stones to a productive life.\n  Recognizing a better way of living, Gary settled down by marrying his \nwife Carmen and raising two daughters. But Gary did not stop fighting. \nFinding inspiration in his Catholic faith, he picked up the fight for \nthe less fortunate and endangered. Some of Gary's feats border on the \nincredible. He once saved the life of a complete stranger, Charles H. \nCase. While visiting Las Vegas, Charles crashed into an off-ramp rail \nand his car exploded into flames. Luckily for Charles, Gary witnessed \nthe crash, broke the front left window and freed his pinned body from \nthe enflamed car. Another time, while working in a downtown casino, \nGary chased a fleeing thief through an alley into another casino and, \nas the police reported, decked him with a single punch to the right \ncheekbone. Gary was never motivated by or sought praise for these \nactions, a fact that is evidenced by many other low-profile acts of \nservice. He has donated more than 25 gallons of his blood. \nAdditionally, Gary has uniquely compatible blood marrow that he has \namazingly matched with five non-relatives. He will tell you that of all \nhis feats he is most proud of his marrow donation that saved the life \nof a 1-year-old boy.\n  I am pleased to recognize my friend Gary Bates and to give him some \nof the praise he has never asked, but certainly deserves. He has said \nhe would take a bullet for me, but I think he would take one for anyone \nin need. Even at 67 he exercises daily so that he can be physically, \nnot just mentally, ready to meet the call of anyone in distress. He \ncontinues to be an example to Nevadans and Americans that anyone can \nturn in their boxing gloves or brass knuckles for the work gloves of a \ncitizen making our society a better place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/24/senate-section/article/S3616-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3616-S3617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. LARRY D. SHINN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great \neducator who has impacted the lives of thousands of Kentuckians over \nthe course of his career. My good friend, Dr. Larry D. Shinn, will \nretire in a little more than a month's time after serving 18 years as \npresident of Berea College in Berea, KY, and I know I speak for many \nwhen I say I am very sorry to see him go.\n  Dr. Shinn has served as president since 1994 and is the eighth \npresident of Berea College, a proud liberal-arts college which is \ndedicated to serving students of great promise and limited economic \nmeans. Its primary focus is on serving students from the Appalachian \nregion. Berea College generously offers a full-tuition scholarship to \neach of its 1,500 students and requires all of them to work in \npositions on campus. Berea College is proud of its heritage as the \nfirst interracial and coeducational college in the South and proud of \nits focus on a Christian ethic of service and its historic mission to \npromote the cause of Christ.\n  Dr. Shinn is a magna cum laude graduate of Baldwin-Wallace College \nand a summa cum laude graduate of Drew University Theological School. \nHe received his Ph.D. in history of religions from Princeton \nUniversity. Before coming aboard as Berea's president, he taught at \nOberlin College for 14 years and served as dean and vice president at \nBucknell University for 10 years. He has authored several books and \nnumerous articles and book reviews.\n  Then there is the remarkable progress Berea College has made under \nDr. Shinn's leadership. During his presidency, Dr. Shinn has led the \nschool's strategic-planning process and the creation of its strategic \nplan for Berea College to thrive in the 21st century. He has instituted \na decisionmaking process that has enhanced virtually every area of \nacademic life, from student retention and graduation rates to \nresidential life, academic planning, development, and facilities \nrenovation. He has led Berea's sustainability initiative, which is \nresponsible for the creation of the Sustainability and Environmental \nStudies Program; the ecological renovations of several campus \nbuildings, including the first LEED, Leadership in Energy and \nEnvironmental Design, building in Kentucky; and the establishment of a \nresidential ``eco-village'' for student families.\n  Dr. Shinn also led the ``Extending Berea's Legacy'' campaign that \nraised $162 million for endowments to fund student scholarships, \nundergraduate research, a new technology program for students, a study \nabroad program, an entrepreneurship program, and other key initiatives.\n  I know that Larry and his wife Nancy are looking forward to having a \nlittle more time to themselves and to spend with their family, but \ntheir gain will certainly be Berea College's and Kentucky's loss. In \nhis 18 years at the helm, Dr. Shinn has proven himself to be one of the \nfinest college presidents in Kentucky and the Nation. I salute him for \nhis incredible legacy of service towards improving the lives of the \nthousands of Kentuckians and other students who have passed through \nBerea College's doors. He is a great Kentuckian whom I have been \nhonored to represent and to work with over his nearly two decades as \nBerea College's president. He will be missed.\n  Mr. President, the Berea Spotlight, a publication of Berea College, \npublished an article highlighting the many accomplishments of Dr. Larry \nShinn around the time he announced his retirement. I ask unanimous \nconsent that said article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Berea Spotlight, Apr. 4, 2011]\n\n         Larry Shinn, Berea College President, Plans Retirement\n\n                            (By Tim Jordan)\n\n       Berea College President Dr. Larry D. Shinn announced today \n     that he will be retiring from the College, effective June 30, \n     2012. Berea's 8th president, Dr. Shinn has served in this \n     capacity since 1994. In a letter to trustees, faculty, staff \n     and students, Shinn stated that, with the College emerging \n     strongly from the challenges of the Great Recession, it is a \n     good time for Berea to begin the process of a leadership \n     transition.\n       The combined efforts of Berea's faculty, staff, \n     administrators, trustees, and other stakeholders have, over \n     the span of the past 17 years, resulted in dramatic progress \n     at the College. Enrollment of African-American students has \n     increased from 6 percent to 18 percent, while service to the \n     Appalachian region has been expanded. Retention and \n     graduation rates have improved more than 30 percent while new \n     program initiatives have enhanced educational quality. The \n     College has successfully completed over $140 million in \n     sustainable building renovations, and in 2005 a $150-million \n     sesquicentennial campaign exceeded its goal. In response to \n     the financial crisis of 2008 09, the College has embraced a \n     bold and creative vision for carrying out its historic \n     mission in a rapidly changing world. Dr. Shinn noted that \n     Berea is a stronger and more resilient institution today that \n     has greater capacity to address future opportunities and \n     challenges.\n       President Shinn indicated that while he and his wife, \n     Nancy, are looking forward to extended time with their \n     children and grandchildren during their pending retirement, \n     he cited a number of challenging initiatives that Berea must \n     engage over the next 15 months, including the transition from \n     academic departments to divisions, development of the \n     College's new Center for Transformative Learning, and ``deep \n     green'' science and residence hall projects.\n       Dr. David E. Shelton, chair of the Berea College Board of \n     Trustees, commented: ``President Shinn's unique blend of \n     academic and leadership skills passionately applied to \n     Berea's mission, in partnership with the entire College \n     community, has produced outstanding results. Berea is well-\n     positioned for the future, and we look forward to the \n     unfolding of a number of new developments and opportunities \n     during Larry's remaining tenure as president. Dr. Shinn's \n     extraordinary abilities, personal commitment, and strong work \n     ethic have set the example for the next generation of \n     presidential leadership at\n\n[[Page S3617]]\n\n     Berea. The Board of Trustees is grateful to Larry and Nancy \n     for their extraordinary service to the College.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/24/senate-section/article/S3617-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3617-S3619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MEMORIAL DAY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this Monday, May 28, is Memorial Day. \nIt is a day for all Americans to honor the brave men and women in \nuniform who have served and defended our Nation--especially those who \nsacrificed their very lives for this sacred duty.\n  It is only right that we set aside this day to remember those who \nhave given us so much. Freedom as we know it in America could not exist \nwithout their heroism.\n  On Memorial Day, we honor servicemembers who laid down their lives \nfighting under the command of GEN George Washington, to those who have \nperished in Afghanistan and Iraq. What a proud legacy of fighting for \nfreedom our country has. I am honored to live in a nation that boasts \nthe bravest warriors in the world.\n  I am also honored to serve my fellow Kentuckians, who understand the \nimportance of this day more, I think, than most. Kentucky has a proud \ntradition of military service that is upheld today by the many Armed \nForces members at our State's military bases, the members of the \nKentucky National Guard, our reservists, and Kentuckians fighting \naround the world. Since September 11, 2001, 107 Kentucky servicemembers \nhave fallen while fighting for their country.\n  I have been honored to meet many of the family members of these \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who did not return home. I have \nlet them know that their loved ones will not be forgotten. Memorial Day \nis a chance to make sure that message is heard loud and clear across \nAmerica.\n  I want to share with my colleagues a special story about one soldier \nin particular from Kentucky. SGT Felipe Pereira of the 101st Airborne \nDivision, based out of Fort Campbell, KY, recently was awarded the \nNation's second highest military honor, the Distinguished Service \nCross, for his acts of bravery in battle.\n  Sergeant Pereira is the first soldier from the 101st Airborne to be \nawarded the Distinguished Service Cross since the Vietnam war. At a \nceremony this April at Fort Campbell, Chief of Staff of the Army GEN \nRay Odierno presented Sergeant Pereira with the venerated military \ndecoration.\n  According to the award citation, on November 1, 2010, in Kandahar \nprovince, Afghanistan, a squad of soldiers that included Sergeant \nPereira was on dismounted patrol when an improvised explosive device \nwent off, killing two of Sergeant Pereira's comrades and wounding \nSergeant Pereira with shrapnel that caused his lung to begin to \ncollapse. As an enemy ambush began to unfold, ``with little regard for \nhis own safety or care'' Sergeant Pereira drove an all-terrain vehicle \ninto enemy fire to help evacuate wounded soldiers.\n  After moving the first set of casualties, the sergeant went back into \nthe line of fire once more to help others. Sergeant Pereira is credited \nwith ``saving the lives of two of his fellow soldiers while risking his \nown [on] multiple occasions. Only after all the wounded soldiers had \nbeen evacuated and were receiving medical care did he accept treatment \nhimself.''\n  Mr. President, Sergeant Pereira's selfless actions demand our \nadmiration and respect. What is more, so does his selfless attitude \nabout his bravery on that fateful day.\n  ``Every time I have the opportunity, I always say remember those that \ngave the ultimate sacrifice,'' said Sergeant Pereira in an article \npublished by the Fort Campbell Courier. ``I still get to come back and \nenjoy barbecues with my family and their love and everything. Those \nguys, they really gave it all. Those are truly the heroes. Just \nremember those guys. I think even on a happy occasion like this, I \nthink we need to celebrate their life and their sacrifice.''\n  I can't improve on those words. Sergeant Pereira has captured the \nmeaning of Memorial Day right there, in those words of wisdom.\n  So I hope this Memorial Day, people will heed the advice of SGT \nFelipe Pereira. The men and women who ``really gave it all'' are truly \nthe heroes, and this Monday is their day to receive our admiration and \nour respect. I know my friends in Kentucky and people across America \nwill not forget that.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, Memorial Day is a time to pay tribute to \nthose who have given ``the last full measure of devotion'' in the \nservice of our great country. I believe this Memorial Day is especially \nsignificant as we pause to reflect on some of the events of the past \nyear and acknowledge the passing of the last surviving veteran of World \nWar I, the end the Iraq War, and a renewed commitment to wind down our \nengagement in Afghanistan by 2014.\n  Since the first colonial troops took up arms in the fight for our \nindependence in 1775, more than 1.1 million American soldiers, sailors, \nand airmen have died in the wars and conflicts fought to defend our \nNation, our freedom, and our ideals. In the past 10 years, we have lost \nover 6,400 brave Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan. The death of each \none of these servicemen and women represents not only a tragic loss to \ntheir loved ones, but to their community, and to our Nation.\n  The American tradition of Memorial Day--originally known as \nDecoration Day--has its roots in local springtime tributes that were \nheld in the North and the South during and immediately after the Civil \nWar and following the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln on \nApril 14, 1865. On May 1, 1865, nearly 10,000 freedmen, teachers, \npreachers, missionaries, and Union troops properly landscaped and \ncovered with flowers the unmarked graves of some 250 or more Union \nprisoners of war who had died in captivity at the Charleston Race \nCourse, a site now known as Hampton Park. On April 26, 1866, grieving \nmothers, sisters, wives, and daughters in Columbus, MS placed flowers \non the graves of Confederate soldiers who had died in the Battle of \nShiloh. While they grieved for their own lost loved ones, they saw that \nnearby graves of the Union soldiers were neglected, so they placed \nflowers on these graves as well. On May 5, 1866, an official \ncommemoration was held in Waterloo, NY to honor local veterans of the \nCivil War. Businesses were closed and flags were flown at half-mast to \nhonor the dead. On May 5, 1868, MG John A. Logan, who headed the Grand \nArmy of the Republic, GAR, which was an organization of Union veterans, \ndeclared that May 30 of each year should be Decoration Day, a time for \nthe Nation to festoon the graves of Union and Confederate war dead with \nflowers. Logan said, ``We should guard their graves with sacred \nvigilance. . . . Let pleasant paths invite the coming and going of \nreverent visitors and fond mourners. Let no neglect, no ravages of \ntime, testify to the present or to the coming generations that we have \nforgotten as a people the cost of a free and undivided republic.'' The \nfirst large observance was held that same year at Arlington National \nCemetery. In 1966, Congress and President Lyndon Johnson declared that \nWaterloo is the official birthplace of Memorial Day but it is apparent \nthat many communities and people across America can claim some of the \ncredit.\n  Shortly after World War I, Decoration Day ceremonies were no longer \nlimited to honoring those who had died in the Civil War. Rather, the \ncommemoration was altered to embrace the men and women who have died in \nall American wars. In 1971, Congress passed legislation to make \nMemorial Day a national holiday and to fix its date as the last Monday \nin May. In December 2000, Congress passed ``The National Moment of \nRemembrance Act'' (Public Law 106 579, which encourages all Americans \nto pause wherever they are at 3:00 PM local time on Memorial Day for 1 \nminute of silence to remember and honor those who have died in service \nto our Nation.\n  While the Memorial Day we will celebrate this Monday is approaching \nthe sesquicentennial of its birth, the tradition of honoring those who \nhave fallen in war is probably as old--or nearly as old--as human \nhistory itself. Over 2,400 years ago--in 431 B.C.E.--Pericles paid \ntribute to the Athenian soldiers who had fallen in battle at the \nbeginning of the Peloponnesian War, saying\n\n       For this offering of their lives made in common by them all \n     they each of them individually received that renown which \n     never grows old, and for a sepulchre, not so much that in \n     which their bones have been deposited, but that noblest of \n     shrines wherein their glory is laid up to be eternally \n     remembered upon every occasion on which deed or story shall \n     call for its commemoration. For heroes have the whole earth \n     for their tomb;\n\n[[Page S3618]]\n\n     and in lands far from their own, where the column with its \n     epitaph declares it, there is enshrined in every breast a \n     record unwritten with no tablet to preserve it, except that \n     of the heart.\n\n  This Memorial Day, in the spirit of compassion and empathy shown by \nthe Confederate widows who placed flowers on the graves of Union \nsoldiers in Columbus, MS nearly 150 years ago, I would like to mention \nsome facts about those fallen servicemen and women we too often neglect \nto consider. According to a recent study by the Army, suicides among \nU.S. servicemembers increased 80 percent from 2004 to 2008. The study \nconfirmed that there is an increased risk of suicide among those who \nexperience mental health disorder diagnosis associated with the stress \nof combat. Protracted military operations requiring multiple \ndeployments over the past decade have made mental health disorders the \nsignature wounds for our military members returning from the conflicts \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. A comprehensive study by RAND found that \napproximately 18.5 percent of those servicemen and women returning from \ndeployment reported symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, PTSD, or depression. Up to 30 percent of \ntroops returning home from combat develop serious mental health \nproblems within 3 to 4 months. And since mental health issues often are \nnot immediately addressed while our servicemen and women are on active \nduty, or because of the lasting traumas of war, we see even higher \nnumbers of mental illness diagnosis among our veterans. According to a \nGovernment Accountability Office report, U.S. Department of Veterans \nAffairs, VA, data ``show that from fiscal year 2004 through fiscal year \n2008, the number of unique veterans receiving treatment for PTSD \nincreased by 60 percent from over 274,000 to over 442,000.''\n  I believe that the best way we can truly honor those who have \nsacrificed themselves upon the altar of freedom is not just to fulfill \nour solemn obligation to care for their widows and orphans. More than \nthat, we must care for their brothers and sisters in arms who have also \nborne the battle, and who have returned to us wounded, ill and injured, \nand for the family members and other individuals who selflessly care \nfor them. These soldiers and sailors and airmen and their caregivers \nalso deserve our gratitude, our accolades, our compassion--and our \nsupport. Therefore, I commend the VA Secretary Shinseki's recent \ndecision to hire an additional 1,900 mental health staff at VA \nfacilities to ensure greater care for our servicemembers suffering from \nthe wounds of war, both physical and emotional.\n  It is not just about providing adequate resources, however. Having an \nadequate number of mental health professionals is just one component of \nensuring access to care. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates \ncorrectly acknowledged that the greatest obstacle to servicemembers \nreceiving necessary mental health treatment is the stigma too often \nassociated with seeking help for their psychological injuries. I \nfrequently hear from servicemembers who believe that seeking mental \nhealth services will hurt their military and post-military careers. We \nmust overcome these real and perceived barriers to care by changing the \npolicies that govern how we provide mental health care to our active \nduty military members, reservists, and veterans. Those who suffer in \nsilence will seek treatment only when they are assured they can truly \nseek such treatment and speak about their problems freely and off-the-\nrecord. Meanwhile, as more and more go untreated, we will continue to \nsee a rise in suicides and other tragic incidents among our military \nmembers and veterans--a preventable epidemic, which is heaping tragedy \nupon tragedy.\n  During this holiday weekend and on Monday in particular we will see \nmany American flags and flowers adorning the graves of those who have \nmade the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation. I will remember in \nparticular the 114 Marylanders who have been killed in our most recent \nconflicts as I remind myself that our freedom is not free. And I will \nremind myself that the best way to honor their ultimate sacrifice is to \nensure that we are unwavering in our resolve not only to care for their \nwidows and orphans, but also for those who do return to us wounded, \nill, and injured--including those whose injuries are emotional. Let us \nreaffirm our commitment to support all of these individuals and their \nfamilies and other caregivers this Memorial Day, and every Memorial Day \nhereafter.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the importance of \nMemorial Day, a day that means so much to me and those I represent in \nAlaska. For so many of us, it means sunlight nearly all day, the \nunofficial beginning of summer, and enjoying the great outdoors.\n  But let us never forget the deep, true meaning of Memorial Day. It \nmeans the payment of respect, memories, time and energy to the \nsacrifices of men and women who have defended the rights and privileges \nwe enjoy today.\n  Memorial Day first began nearly 100 years before Alaskan statehood, \nbut even in our territorial days we had Alaskans fighting on our own \nsoil against foreign enemies--one of the few States that can say such a \nthing. It is because of those early successes--and the success of \nAlaskans from then to those deployed today--that we salute our flag, \nspeak our mind and continue to be a global leader.\n  As many Alaskans know first-hand, those successes often came at the \nultimate price. On Memorial Day we make a small attempt to repay them \nwith our support, prayers and appreciation. I ask that all Alaskans and \nAmericans join me in devoting a few minutes of our time in reflection \nas a small tribute to those who have given their lives for the cause of \nfreedom.\n  Although we may not be able to fully measure the cost of our heroes' \nsacrifice, we can commit ourselves to preserving their memory. So on \nMemorial Day 2012, I ask that we honor our fallen heroes, comfort the \nloved ones of those we lost, and carry on our lives in a manner that is \nworthy of their sacrifice. May God continue to bless our great Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the men and \nwomen of our Nation who have given their lives for the cause of freedom \nand to honor those who are still with us today. On this Memorial Day \nweekend, let us stand together as Americans to pay our respects and \nmourn the loss of those brave soldiers who fought in defense of our \nliberty. As we gather across the Nation, we need to remember the \ninvaluable sacrifices of our troops and their families are debts that \ncan never fully be repaid.\n  Every soldier whose life is taken in the line of duty is a great loss \nto our Nation. Lives have been sadly shortened, and we all feel an \nabsence. We may never be able to measure the loss, but we can take \nsolace in knowing that their lives served to inspire, defend freedom, \nand preserve life. Today, we commemorate the brave men and women in \nuniform who gave their lives while serving our country.\n  We must also remember the members of our Armed Forces who are \ncurrently in harm's way. In this trying time in America's history, our \nsoldiers have accepted the call of duty, knowing that the road ahead is \ndangerous and full of hardship. Their courage and resiliency are what \nmake our military the best in the world. Our servicemembers face \nperilous situations in order to protect Americans from harm, and I am \nso grateful for all they do. Their commitment of service and self-\nsacrifice is what we admire, appreciate, and respect. As we continue \nwithdrawing some of our combat forces, we pray for their safe return.\n  As someone whose father is a disabled veteran and whose brother \nserved overseas, I understand firsthand the struggles of our \nservicemembers and the significant sacrifices made by their families. \nThe families of our military men and women also make tremendous \nsacrifices for our country and for the safety of our Nation. Each and \nevery deployment causes great stress and a burden of separation that \nevery member of these families experience. They have loved ones far \naway from home and are sacrificing their own well-being for the \nprotection of our country. We must remember that these families serve \nas the backbone for the men and women who wear the uniform of our armed \nservices, and our Nation owes them a debt of great gratitude.\n  Today, we honor those who have given their life in service to their \ncountry. We will never forget our soldiers\n\n[[Page S3619]]\n\nwho fought for a better America and served our country with honor. I \nask my colleagues to join me today in honoring our Nation's heroes who \nhave given the ultimate sacrifice to make sure that our country remains \nsafe and free.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/24/senate-section/article/S3619-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING THE S.S. ``BADGER''\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, recently Chicagoans were asked in a poll \nwhat asset of their great city they valued most. By a large margin, \nthey chose Lake Michigan.\n  Lake Michigan is the primary source of drinking water for more than \n10 million people--not just in my home State of Illinois but also in \nWisconsin, Indiana, and Michigan.\n  The lake is also part of the $7 billion per year Great Lakes fishing \nindustry. Millions of people visit Lake Michigan for its recreational \nopportunities like swimming, kayaking, boating, or just taking a walk \nalong the beach. It is a beautiful lake.\n  Unfortunately, we are faced with a threat to the health of our Great \nLake.\n  This week, on Thursday, May 24, the coal-fired car-ferry S.S. Badger \nwill begin its 60th year sailing on Lake Michigan.\n  Many people have fond memories of the Badger, steaming from its \nhomeport of Ludington, MI, to Manitowoc, WI, every summer. But they \nneed to be reminded of this: It is the last coal-fired ferry in the \nUnited States, and every year it dumps another 500 tons of coal ash \ninto Lake Michigan. Think about that for a moment--500 tons of coal ash \nevery year since the 1950s. What must the bottom of the lake look like?\n  The owner of the Badger insists that the coal ash is basically just \nsand, but we know better. Scientists are concerned about coal ash \nbecause it contains chemicals like arsenic, lead, and mercury.\n  Once in the lake, these chemicals enter the food chain through the \nwater we drink and the fish we eat. Then they accumulate in our bodies \nand can cause cancer and neurological damage. In fact, we already are \nfacing problems from mercury contamination of the fish that are part of \nour food supply. How can we continue to accept behavior that will just \nmake this problem worse?\n  If the Badger's owners had only recently found that dumping coal was \na problem, it might be OK to cut them some slack. But the Badger's \nowners have a long history of avoiding the steps needed to clean up \ntheir act.\n  Most other vessels on the Great Lakes converted from coal to diesel \nfuel long ago but not the Badger.\n  In 2008, conversion to a new fuel was way overdue. But a waiver was \nplaced into EPA's vessel general permit to allow the Badger to continue \ndumping coal ash through 2012. I think that was 5 years too many of \ntoxic dumping. But to make matters worse, the Badger's owners still \nhave not made a reasonable effort to stop dumping coal ash into the \nlake. Instead, they are doing everything they can to avoid switching to \na new fuel.\n  Last fall, the Badger was nominated to be a national historic \nlandmark, and an amendment was added to House Coast Guard and Maritime \nTransportation Act to exempt all vessels of historic significance from \nenvironmental regulation.\n  The national historic landmark designation was created to commemorate \nproperties that have special significance in American history. The \ndesignation has been appropriately used to protect sites including the \nhome of President Abraham Lincoln in Springfield, IL, and the S.S. \nMilwaukee Clipper, a retired steamship in Muskegon, MI. The national \nhistoric landmark designation was never intended to allow polluters to \navoid complying with Federal regulations that protect our health and \nthe environment.\n  I have urged Interior Secretary Salazar to oppose the designation of \nthe Badger as a national historic landmark. I also ask my fellow \nSenators to join me in opposing language in the House Coast Guard and \nMaritime Transportation Act that would exempt ``vessels of historic \nsignificance'' from EPA regulation.\n  After I came out in opposition to this strategy, the Badger's owner \ncame to Washington to talk to me.\n  He mentioned that he was applying for an EPA permit to continue \ndumping coal ash while he pursues conversion of the Badger to run on \nliquefied natural gas. He would like to make the Badger the greenest \nvessel on the Great Lakes. That would be terrific, but it just isn't a \nrealistic option right now. Today, there are few suppliers of liquefied \nnatural gas. There are no shipyards in the United States qualified to \nconvert passenger vessels to run on liquefied natural gas. And it would \ntake close to $50 million just to develop the infrastructure needed to \nfuel the Badger at the dock.\n  One day, all the boats on the Great Lakes might be powered by natural \ngas. But it isn't a realistic plan for the Badger to stop dumping coal \nash. It is just another delaying tactic, when the Badger's owners were \ngiven a deadline 5 years ago.\n  The Badger has blatantly avoided complying with current EPA \nregulations. We cannot reward the owners for their negligence with \npermanent statutory protection from EPA regulation.\n  This is more than a car ferry with a venerable tradition. This is a \nvessel that generates and dumps 4 tons of coal ash laced with mercury, \nlead, and arsenic into Lake Michigan every day. This Great Lake cannot \ntake any more toxic dumping, no matter how historic or quaint the \nsource may be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/24/senate-section/article/S3619-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a Memorial Day \ntribute to the brave men and women who have lost their lives protecting \nthe safety and security of our citizens and American interests around \nthe world.\n  Today, there are media reports about the American people becoming \n``war weary'' after more than a decade of combat activities in \nAfghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere. Many lives and great expense have been \nmarshaled since the 9/11 attacks, but I would submit that Americans are \nunfaltering in their appreciation for the honor, courage and dedication \nshown by our servicemen and women. This is especially the case for \nthose who have made the ultimate sacrifice by giving their lives for \ntheir country.\n  This Memorial Day, I will take time to honor our brave fallen \nwarriors, including the more than 70 military personnel from \nMississippi who have died in the service of our Nation in Iraq, \nAfghanistan and around the world over the past decade.\n  For the Record, I offer the names of these brave Mississippians who \nhave fallen since the Nation commemorated Memorial Day last year. They \nare:\n  Sgt. Christopher R. Bell, 21, of Golden, who died June 4, 2011.\n  Petty Officer Stacy O. Johnson, 35, of Rolling Fork, who died July \n18, 2011.\n  LCpl. Edward J. Dycus, 22, of Greenville, who died Feb. 1, 2012.\n  SFC Billy E. Sutton, 42, of Tupelo, who died Feb. 7, 2012.\n  MSG Scott E. Pruitt, 38, of Gautier, who died April 28, 2012.\n  SSG Carlous Perry, 30, of West Point, who died April 30, 2012.\n  I am confident that the people of my State will join the national \ncommemoration to remember these men and the thousands of \nMississippians, who over the course of this great nation's history, \nhave courageously served and sacrificed their lives in that service. We \nwill also recall their families and their profound loss. On this day of \nremembrance, we salute those sacrifices and express our gratitude for \ntheir brave service.\n  In these challenging times, we should also reaffirm our commitment to \nthe servicemen and women who today put themselves in danger on our \nbehalf. We must remain resolved to ensure that those who join our Armed \nForces are the best equipped and best trained in the world, and that we \nmeet our obligations to those who have served and sacrificed in the \ndefense of our nation.\n  Let me close by expressing my personal gratitude to all our fallen \nheroes, and communicating my sincere appreciation to those \nMississippians and Americans who answer the call to arms and find \nthemselves in harm's way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/24/senate-section/article/S3619-3", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3619-S3620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL.

Mr. President, I would like to make clear for the record \na matter relating to the Officer Safety Act of 2012. I thank my \ncolleague from Iowa for working with me on this legislation. I \ncosponsored this bill after changes were made, in the nature of a \nsubstitute amendment, to clarify the limited scope of the legislation. \nThe Officer Safety Act clarifies when an officer is ``acting under the \ncolor of his office'' for removal purposes only. As my colleague has \nstated previously, the bill provides no liability protection. Whether a \nlaw enforcement officer is deemed to have been ``acting under the color \nof his office'' for removal purposes under 28 U.S.C. Sec.  1442(c), as \namended, is a separate question from whether that officer should \nsubsequently be held liable for his conduct, whether the officer should \nbe considered immune from suit, or whether the officer's defense in a \ncriminal trial has merit.\n  The clarification of ``color of . . . office'' and the expansion of \nremoval eligibility granted by this legislation is not meant to affect \nthose latter determinations of liability and immunity. The bill is \nsimply meant to give these law enforcement officers the ability to make \narguments pertaining to liability, immunity, and potential criminal \ndefenses in Federal rather than in State court. Does my colleague \nagree?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. My colleague from Illinois is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/24/senate-section/article/S3620-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     STRUGGLING AGAINST BUREAUCRACY\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, this week is National Small Business Week, \nwhich is a time to celebrate the entrepreneurial spirit behind American \nenterprise. But, as I was reminded by a piece that was published \nrecently in the Wall Street Journal, it is also a time to remember how \ngovernment can better serve the small businesses in America. In today's \neconomy, the Nation needs an effective regulatory environment that \nallows small business to grow and create jobs while keeping our \nfamilies and environment safe. I ask unanimous consent to have this \narticle printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 22, 2012]\n\n   The Red Tape Diaries--One Small Business Owner's Struggle Against \n                              Bureaucracy\n\n                         (By Nicholas N. Owens)\n\n       This week is National Small Business Week, a time to \n     celebrate the ingenuity of entrepreneurs--and to consider how \n     government can provide better service to the small \n     enterprises that form the backbone of American industry.\n       Consider the Environmental Protection Agency official who \n     described his agency's work as akin to crucifixion. In a Web \n     video from 2010 that recently came to light, Al Armendariz \n     likened regulatory enforcement to the Roman imperial practice \n     of crucifying people to serve as an example to others: \n     soldiers would go to ``a town somewhere, they'd find the \n     first five guys they saw, and they'd crucify them,'' he \n     explained. ``And then, you know, that town was really easy to \n     manage for the next few years.''\n       Mr. Armendariz's point was that making examples of certain \n     businesses or industries would serve as a deterrent to ensure \n     compliance. But the way he illustrated his point provoked \n     outrage, and within days he had resigned from the agency--\n     proving again that the journalist Michael Kinsley was right \n     to say that a ``gaffe'' in Washington is when someone \n     accidentally tells the truth.\n       I know first-hand that Mr. Armendariz's view is a truthful \n     representation of how many regulators view their function. \n     While serving as the Small Business Administration's (SBA) \n     national ombudsman from 2006 to 2009, I worked with small \n     business owners who believed they were falling victim to \n     unfair or excessive regulatory enforcement. All too often, I \n     saw federal regulators take a stridently adversarial stance \n     toward the industries they oversee.\n       In 2007, for example, I was contacted by Rob Latham, who \n     runs a small Internet sales company in Greenville, S.C. Mr. \n     Latham started his business in 2005 and was prepared to work \n     hard to make it succeed.\n       He wasn't prepared for how easily a run-in with federal \n     regulators could bring him to the brink of ruin. That's what \n     happened in 2007 after he found himself embroiled in a \n     months-long dispute with the EPA over a shipment of engines \n     he had imported.\n       The issue came down to labeling. Although the product Mr. \n     Latham was importing met the EPA's environmental standards, \n     regulators ordered the shipment seized because it contained \n     labels that could be removed with a razor blade. (In other \n     words, they were somewhat vulnerable to damage or tampering.) \n     Mr. Latham thought the dispute could be easily resolved but \n     was surprised by the EPA's intransigence--its dedication to \n     junking his entire shipment--when he tried to work with them.\n       Mr. Latham wasn't ignorant of the regulations that governed \n     his business--quite the opposite. He had carefully studied \n     the rules that governed the products he was importing, and he \n     thought he had taken all appropriate steps to ensure \n     compliance. But as a small business owner with no in-house \n     legal team, he had little idea how complicated the \n     bureaucratic process would be.\n       He met with regulators in Washington to resolve the issue \n     but found that they doubled down on their position, becoming \n     hostile and aggressive.\n       That's when he reached out to my office. Hearing of his \n     plight, I contacted the EPA on his behalf and started working \n     with regulators to resolve the case. Soon thereafter, the \n     regulators relented and allowed Mr. Latham's imports to move \n     forward--but only after he paid a substantial penalty of \n     $10,000, an apparent tribute to the regulators to allow them \n     to save face.\n       The story ends happily: Once the EPA dispute was resolved, \n     Mr. Latham's business grew swiftly. Today his company boasts \n     three warehouses and more than 20 employees.\n       But had Mr. Latham not connected with my office, he might \n     have lost his business. It's frightening to think what other \n     small business owners encounter in similar situations. What \n     about those who don't know where to turn, or who aren't lucky \n     enough to stumble across the right advice or the right \n     advocate?\n       As of 2008, small businesses faced an annual regulatory \n     cost of $10,585 per employee, according to an SBA regulatory \n     impact study published two years ago.\n       So was Rob Latham crucified? That's too strong a word, \n     because it's likely he wasn't specifically targeted--he was \n     simply caught up in a web of red tape and bureaucracy, and \n     the regulators had little interest in helping him get through \n     the impasse. His struggle is a case study in why we need a \n     regulatory regime that's fair, accountable and allows our \n     economy to grow again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/24/senate-section/article/S3620-3", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3620-S3621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS WEEK\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, this week marks the 49th annual National \nSmall Business Week, a time to celebrate the innovations, ideas, and \nhard work of our entrepreneurs. Small businesses are the backbone of \nour economy, accounting for 65 percent of new jobs over the last 17 \nyears. This vital economic component also employs about half of all \nprivate sector employees.\n  As a former small business owner I recognize the difficulty these \nowners have to plan for future growth and investment. It is our job to \nmake sure we provide an environment that helps these engines of \neconomic growth. We need to make sure our small businesses have the \nresources they need to continue providing good, well-paying jobs for \nhard-working Americans. I was pleased to support the American Jobs Act \nin March. This legislation seeks to increase capital formation, spur \nthe growth of startups and small businesses, and enable more small-\nscale businesses to enter public markets.\n  Arkansans are familiar with what it takes to build a business from \nthe ground up. As home to Fortune 500 companies--including the world's \nlargest retailer, Wal-Mart, and the world's largest processor of \nchicken, Tyson's--that both started as a small business, residents of \nthe Natural State understand the risks and rewards associated with \nsmall businesses.\n  This week the U.S. Small Business Administration recognized the work \nof Americans who excel in their work to help small businesses. I am \nproud to say that Kelly Massey of the Henderson State University Small \nBusiness and Technology Development Center in Arkadelphia, AR was \nrecognized as the SBA's Small Business Development Center Counselor of \nthe Year winner.\n\n[[Page S3621]]\n\nAs director of the State's premier business assistance program, Massey \ndedicates himself to helping the area's small businesses achieve \nsuccess and promoting the mission and goals of the SBDC program to help \nspur economic development.\n  We are also proud of Arkansas Power Electronics International, Inc., \nfor its recognition as the 2012 Arkansas State Small Business Person of \nthe Year. The company continues to strive for success as it develops \nthe next generation of high energy-efficiency power electronics \nsystems.

Mr. President, on Sunday, the 20th of May, Taiwan \nmarked the second inauguration of President Ma Ying-jeou. Since its \nfirst direct presidential elections in 1996, Taiwan's democracy has \nemerged as model for the rest of the Asia Pacific region. Over these 16 \nyears, power has changed hands twice between Taiwan's two largest \npolitical parties, demonstrating for the world the rapid maturation of \nits democracy and the commitment of its people to exercising their \ndemocratic freedoms. I rise today to congratulate President Ma on his \ninauguration, and note Taiwan's remarkable history as a kindred \ndemocracy, key partner in security and trade, and great friend of the \nUnited States.\n  I take deep pride in the partnership between the United States and \nthe people of Taiwan, which is rooted in shared values, shared \ninterests, and a shared vision for a peaceful and prosperous future. \nFor more than 6 decades, the United States has stood with Taiwan as it \nhas transformed into a prosperous free market democracy.\n  Just as the United States has supported Taiwan, so too has Taiwan \nbeen a great friend to America. Taiwan is among America's top trading \npartners. Moreover, time and time again from the Korean War, to the \nVietnam War, to our continued security cooperation today Taiwan has \nstood shoulder to shoulder with the United States. I am deeply grateful \nto the people of Taiwan for their contributions to our shared security \nand prosperity.\n  Looking to the future, I hope and believe that President Ma's second \ninauguration will mark another milestone in the deepening relationship \nbetween the United States and Taiwan. For all of our progress, we still \nhave a big agenda ahead.\n  It is past time for us to remove the barriers to trade between the \nU.S. and Taiwan and negotiate a Free Trade Agreement with Taiwan. We \nmust also ensure that the people of Taiwan are secure, so they can \ncontinue to decide their future for themselves. That, in turn, means \nthe United States should take common-sense steps to deepen our security \nties with Taiwan and support Taiwan in acquiring the weapons it needs \nand has requested. As the United States focuses increasingly on the \nAsia-Pacific region, the Obama Administration must do more to make \nTaiwan an integral part of our broader strategy to uphold the balance \nof power in this critical part of the world as a way to maintain peace.\n  In closing, I again congratulate President Ma on his inauguration and \nthank Taiwan's people for their decades of friendship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/24/senate-section/article/S3621-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO RICHARD F. WALSH\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would be remiss if I did not recognize \nthat today's meeting of the Senate Committee on Armed Services to vote \nout its annual Defense authorization bill was the last for Richard F. \nWalsh of my staff. I know Dick's Winnebago is packed and idling outside \nand is probably out of gas because he delayed his retirement to see us \nthrough mark up, but I want to say a few words before we adjourn.\n  I believe in the nobility of public service, and I think Dick \nexemplifies that, not just through his tenure here but throughout his \nentire career. Many may not know that Dick came to the Armed Services \nCommittee after a distinguished 30-year career in the Navy, much of it \nas a judge advocate. He served in a number of challenging assignments, \nincluding counsel to the Chief of Naval Personnel; commander of the \nNaval Legal Service Office, National Capital Region; director of \nlegislation in the Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs; and executive \ndirector for Senate affairs under the Assistant Secretary of Defense \nfor Legislative Affairs.\n  In 2001, my good friend Senator John Warner hired Dick to handle \npersonnel issues. From the halls of the service academies to the bones \nof Tripoli, Dick has seen it all. He has worked on issues of military \npay, benefits, and education. Some were high profile, others not. Some \nwere for the dogs, literally and figuratively. During his tenure, he \nstrived to ensure fairness in the military justice system and remained \nvigilant so that military standards continue to reflect the honor of \nmilitary service. I am proud of the work we did together on the GI bill \nto ensure the transferability of military benefits to family members. \nThrough it all, he showed himself a consummate professional.\n  Our committee works on issues vital to our national security and the \nmen and women who protect it. Dick's work in particular over the last \ndecade touches our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and their \nfamilies, daily, in very real, very meaningful ways. I know Dick will \nhave mixed emotions when he leaves us, but he can take comfort in the \nknowledge that he has made a difference.\n  So from one retired Navy officer to another, I wish Dick Walsh and \nhis wife Gail fair winds and following seas as they board their \nWinnebago and push off for a well-earned retirement together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/24/senate-section/article/S3621-3", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3621-S3622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING DENISE ADDISON\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life \nof one of my long-time aides, Denise Addison, who was a devoted public \nservant and cherished friend. Sadly, Denise lost her long battle with \ncancer on May 12, 2012.\n  Denise first came to my office back in 2001. While I was just \nstarting my Senate career that year, she was already an experienced \nveteran, having worked in Congress for 25 years.\n  Although Denise was not a native of Nebraska, having grown up right \nhere in our Nation's capital, she found something special in our great \nState and adopted it as her own. In 1998, she began working with former \nNebraska Senator Chuck Hagel, later transitioning to the office of \nthen-Senator Bob Kerrey, whose staff members were so impressed by \nDenise's performance that they strongly recommended she be one of my \nfirst hires.\n  Denise's work with my constituent services team was impeccable. She \nwas well aware of how important my constituents are to me and, as such, \ntook great pride in her work. Her amazing memory and attention to \ndetail made her a valuable staff member, and her complete satisfaction \nwith her daily work made her irreplaceable. In this town, it is rare to \nfind someone who possesses all of the qualities Denise brought to my \nstaff, including loyalty, dedication, and genuine fulfillment.\n  Yet that was the kind of person Denise was--both at work and in her \npersonal life. Even more remarkable than her tenure in the Senate was \nher commitment to her family--her husband Carl, whom she affectionately \ncalled ``Mr. A;'' her three children, Al, Dominique, and Jasmine; her \nparents; her five brothers; and her cousins, who were always more like \nsisters to her.\n  When Denise and I first started working together, her youngest \ndaughter, Jasmine, was just starting kindergarten. Today, she is almost \nthrough high school. Denise was incredibly proud of her children and \nalways put the needs of her family before all else.\n  Although the last 2 years of Denise's life were definitely a struggle \nfor her, she never complained. Instead, she remained, as always, more \nconcerned for those around her than for herself. I do not think she \never fully recognized what an immense impact she had on all those who \nknew her.\n  While Denise was taken from us far too soon, there is solace in \nknowing\n\n[[Page S3622]]\n\nshe confronted her illness by continuing to be the same kind, caring \nperson she had always been, living life to the fullest right up to the \nend. Denise Addison was truly one of a kind, beloved and missed by \neveryone who had the pleasure of being her friend.\n  Thank you, Denise, for who you were and for all you did for me, for \nmy staff, and, most important, for the State of Nebraska. The ``good \nlife'' will not be quite the same without you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/24/senate-section/article/S3622-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO COMMANDER BRYAN E. HELLER\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I am so proud to rise today to honor a \nNevadan whom I have known for my entire life and who has my utmost \nadmiration and respect. It is with great pleasure to recognize my \nbrother, Bryan Heller, as he retires from the U.S. Navy after 20 years \nof service to his State and country. On June 1, 2012, he will enter the \nnext chapter of his life, and I am thrilled to see what he will \naccomplish next. On behalf of a grateful nation, I thank Bryan for his \nmany years of faithful, selfless service and extend heartfelt \ncongratulations on the occasion of his retirement.\n  Bryan began his naval career while studying civil engineering at \nBrigham Young University. In 1992, he entered the Navy in the Nuclear \nPropulsion Officer Candidate Program and was later commissioned at \nOfficer Candidate School in Newport, RI. Bryan successfully completed \nthe rigorous nuclear pipeline and submarine school and subsequently \nreported to the USS Georgia, where he earned his gold dolphins and \nqualified as nuclear engineer officer.\n  Over the course of his career, Bryan and his family moved across the \ncountry to respond to his next call of duty. Returning to his civil \nengineering roots, he transferred to the Civil Engineering Corps, CEC, \nwhere he experienced his first CEC tour aboard the NAS Oceana and \nbecame registered as a professional engineer. He also earned his master \nof science in civil engineering from the University of Texas. In 2007, \nBryan reported to Commander, U.S. Naval forces Central Command, where \nhe headed the Navy's construction program in Bahrain, United Arab \nEmirates, Oman, Kuwait, Jordan, and Lebanon.\n  Currently serving as the desert operation officer, Bryan leads the \nDesert Integrated Product Team, which supports Navy bases outside of \nSan Diego and Ventura County. Bryan continues to be an incredible asset \nto the naval community, and I know it will be difficult to replace him. \nThroughout his career, Bryan has been extensively decorated, \nexemplifying his strong work ethic and commitment to serve. He has been \nawarded three Meritorious Service Medals, three Navy and Marine Corps \nCommendation Medals, and two Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals.\n  Today, it is also my distinct honor to recognize and express my \ngratitude to Bryan's family--his wife, Kristi, and children, Natascha, \nHeidi, Josef, and Jakob. Their strength during times when their family \nwas apart embodies the resilience that makes our military communities \nstrong. I constantly find myself in awe of the sacrifices and efforts \nthat have been made by our military families. Each and every deployment \ncauses great stress and a burden of separation that every member of \nthese families experience. We must remember that these families serve \nas the backbone for the men and women who wear the uniform of our armed \nservices, and they deserve our support. The invaluable sacrifices of \nour servicemembers and their families are debts that can never fully be \nrepaid.\n  I am proud to honor my brother today and recognize his accomplished \ncareer in the U.S. Navy. On the eve of this Memorial Day holiday \nweekend, we must recognize all our brave servicemembers and their \ncommitment to our country. It is with great appreciation that I ask my \ncolleagues to stand with me in honoring Bryan's service to our Nation \nas he moves onto the next phase of his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/24/senate-section/article/S3622-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        DENVER GAY MEN'S CHORUS\n\n Mr. BENNET.

For the last 30 years, \nthe group has shown great commitment to educational, cultural, and \nsocial enrichment in the community on behalf of the Rocky Mountain Arts \nAssociation.\n  Since the Denver Gay Men's Chorus was formed in 1982, it has \nperformed more than 130 concerts and more than 1,400 compositions, \narrangements, and medleys. The group has commissioned 25 works. It \nperformed at the 1996 World Summer Olympics in Atlanta at the opening \nof the Olympic Diversity Center.

Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate the \nWorld Trade Center Utah on the naming of one of Utah's finest buildings \nin their honor. On May 23, 2012, my Utah staff had the pleasure of \nattending a ceremony whereby the building formerly known as Eagle Gate \nTower became the World Trade Center at City Creek. Naming one of Salt \nLake's premier business addresses after the World Trade Center Utah is \na fitting tribute to the important role the organization plays in \nguiding Utah's world-leading companies into new markets. This \nachievement is all the more remarkable when you consider that the \norganization was only founded in 2006.\n  We hear time and time again about the fact that 95 percent of our \npotential consumers live outside the United States. But we all know \nthat reaching those customers can be difficult. Since 2006, the World \nTrade Center Utah has assisted over 1,000 companies to do just that, \nthrough educational classes and seminars, international business \ndevelopment events, and networking opportunities. The World Trade \nCenter Utah rightly prides itself on being the ``first stop'' for Utah \nbusinesses seeking to expand their trade opportunities. By assessing \ntheir capabilities, providing educational opportunities and connections \nto the right people and organizations, the World Trade Center Utah \nprovides the businesses of the Beehive State a much needed roadmap to \nengaging in international trade.\n  Their hard work has paid off. Thanks in no small part to the World \nTrade Center Utah and the leadership of its CEO, Lew Cramer, Utah \nmerchandise exports increased 37 percent in 2011 compared to 2010, \ngrowing from $13.8 billion to $18.9 billion. In a time of great \neconomic difficulty for our Nation, this was no easy feat and was no \ndoubt welcome news to the nearly 93,000 Utahns whose jobs depend on \nexports, as well as the companies in Utah which collectively exported \nto over 190 foreign markets.\n  I congratulate the World Trade Center Utah, as well as its founding \nCEO, Lew Cramer, and his dedicated staff for this achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/24/senate-section/article/S3622-4", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3622-S3625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     KEEPING CHILDREN ALCOHOL FREE\n\n Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted the attached statement in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Recognizing The Leadership To Keep Children Alcohol Free Foundation\n\n       Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, today it is my honor to \n     recognize the accomplishments of a group of dedicated \n     volunteers who have devoted extensive time, resources and \n     energy toward the worthy effort of helping our children avoid \n     the pitfalls of alcohol dependence and binge drinking. The \n     Leadership To Keep Children Alcohol Free Foundation is a \n     unique coalition of current and former Governors' spouses, \n     Federal agencies, and public and private organizations united \n     in their goal to prevent the use of alcohol by children\n\n[[Page S3623]]\n\n     ages nine to fifteen. It is the only national effort that \n     focuses on alcohol use in this age group. Childhood drinking \n     leads to adolescent alcohol abuse, and in my state of North \n     Dakota, I want to acknowledge that the rate of alcohol abuse \n     among young people is an ongoing challenge that we must \n     address. For this reason especially, I am motivated by a \n     sense of duty and public concern to extend my gratitude to \n     the volunteers of this Foundation and enter into the \n     Congressional Record a comprehensive summary of the \n     accomplishments and impact that this Foundation has achieved \n     from 2000 to 2012 for the families of my state and our \n     nation.\n       I would like to provide some background on how this \n     Foundation came to be. In partnership with The Robert Wood \n     Johnson Foundation (RWJF) and in response to childhood \n     drinking as a national public health threat, the National \n     Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), an \n     institute of the National Institutes of Health charged with \n     research on alcohol abuse and its causes, the many medical \n     and social consequences of heavy drinking, and approaches to \n     new prevention and treatment, established the Leadership \n     Initiative in 2000. The initiative would engage First Spouses \n     in each state, with the underlying assumption that top-level \n     state leadership could serve as a collective and powerful \n     force to bring the scope and dangers of early alcohol use to \n     the public's attention and to mobilize National, State, and \n     local action to prevent it. And thus, it was launched as a \n     national initiative in 2000 and subsequently evolved in 2004 \n     as The Leadership To Keep Children Alcohol Free Foundation \n     with a non-profit, non-partisan membership of over 50 current \n     and former governors' spouses.\n       The seamless transition from the Initiative into the \n     Foundation enabled the work of the Leadership Initiative to \n     continue without interruption. Its purpose, membership, and \n     accomplishments remained the same. That is, its purpose is to \n     support the efforts of current Governor's spouses or their \n     representatives, both in their states and nationally, to \n     prevent or reduce underage drinking, especially among the 9 \n     15 year old population.\n       This multiyear, multimillion-dollar initiative provided \n     support to participating Governors' spouses, who conveyed the \n     initiative's messages within their States and nationally \n     through State policy briefings, outreach to and through the \n     media, broad distribution of educational materials and public \n     service announcements, and personal appearances. Both the RWJ \n     and NIAAA funding ended in 2007.\n       Leadership membership has always been composed of \n     Governors' spouses or their designate that are also \n     prosecutors, judges, educators, business leaders, substance \n     abuse prevention specialists, and parents. They often act as \n     a point of contact in their state conveying news about their \n     state's underage drinking prevention initiatives, and also \n     taking information back to their constituency. The Leadership \n     initiative provides members with a source of information to \n     use as they reach out to these audiences.\n       At this time, The Leadership Foundation has 26 current \n     spouses as members, 22 emeritus spouses as members, and 20 \n     Partners of like-minded organizations.\n       I will now offer to you, Mr. President, the major \n     accomplishments of The Leadership Foundation form 2000 \n     through 2011. As originally conceptualized, The Leadership to \n     Keep Children Alcohol Free Foundation has been uniquely \n     qualified to help move the conversation around underage \n     drinking to a higher level and broader audience. Its niche \n     has been its ability to educate and engage policy makers at \n     all levels. Its non-partisan membership of over 50 current \n     and former governors' spouses has allowed it to influence the \n     debate over childhood drinking both nationally and within \n     states.\n       It has been remarkably successful in a relatively short \n     time. Many organizations and experts in the field of \n     prevention view the Governors' spouses' work on childhood \n     drinking as key in placing childhood and underage drinking \n     front and center on the national agenda. Often in \n     collaboration with national and state partners, The \n     Leadership Foundation has accomplished our purpose by voicing \n     concerns in national conversations on related issues; \n     providing ongoing support of First Spouse underage prevention \n     activity within their respective states; maintaining timely \n     contact and delivery of information on underage drinking; and \n     distributing resources/tools to assist the efforts of First \n     Spouses in their states.\n       In the first few years of formation (2000 2005), members of \n     the Leadership to Keep Children Alcohol Free initiative \n     worked extensively at the federal level in support of a \n     federal collaborative effort to address underage drinking. \n     During that period, members engaged in the following \n     activities: encouraged Congress to call for the National \n     Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine Report on Underage \n     Drinking; worked with several US Surgeon Generals to produce \n     the Call to Action to Prevent and Reduce Underage Drinking; \n     provided information related to the STOP Act of 2006; \n     testified before several Congressional Committees, served as \n     key partners in April is Alcohol Awareness Month activities \n     with the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence \n     (NCADD); served on the Advisory Councils of Substance Abuse \n     and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Center \n     for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP), Center for Substance \n     Abuse Treatment (CSAT), National Institute on Alcoholism and \n     Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA), Safe and Drug Free Schools and \n     Communities Act, Drug Free Communities Act, and NIAAA's \n     Steering Committee for Underage Drinking Research Initiative, \n     and the board of the National Center on Addiction and \n     Substance Abuse at Columbia University (CASA); garnered \n     national media attention in newspapers and magazines; and \n     worked with the National Attorneys Generals Association's \n     Youth Access to Alcohol standing committee to convince the \n     alcohol industry not to advertise to youth.\n       In addition to the aforementioned national accomplishments \n     and activities, the Leadership Foundation provides ongoing \n     service to its membership through such activities as \n     providing ongoing support of underage drinking prevention \n     activities by First Spouses within their respective states.\n       Annually, a one-day seminar is held for Leadership \n     membership, usually in conjunction with the winter Community \n     Anti-Drug Coalitions of America (CADCA) conference. SAMHSA/\n     CSAP and NABCA have been strong supporters of the Prevention \n     Days. In 2010, the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, \n     National Institute on Alcohol, Abuse and Alcoholism, National \n     Alcohol Control Beverage Association, Shinnyo-en Foundation, \n     Wyoming Association of Sheriffs and Chiefs of Police, Paxis \n     Institute, International Survey Associates/Pride Survey, The \n     Christopher D. Smithers Foundation Inc., and State Farm \n     Insurance Company provided financial support for the 10th \n     anniversary education seminar in Washington DC in February. \n     At these annual events, speakers are engaged to provide \n     latest research news on products such as alcohol energy \n     drinks, coalition creation and maintenance, and minimum \n     drinking age laws.\n       In 2008 and 2009, with financial support from SAMHSA, the \n     Leadership Foundation organized thirteen state visits for the \n     US Surgeon General to promote his Call to Action to Prevent \n     and Reduce Underage Drinking. The Leadership Foundation \n     President, Hope Taft, accompanied the Surgeon General on the \n     visits at the invitation of the First Spouses, and/or their \n     designate. At these state visits, First Spouses convened and \n     encouraged statewide partnerships to address underage \n     drinking within their respective states through such \n     activities as the following:\n       In Hawaii, the Lieutenant Governor James R. ``Duke'' Aiona, \n     Jr., Co-Chair of Leadership to Keep Children Alcohol Free, \n     hosted the Surgeon General's visit to Hawaii to promote the \n     Call to Action. They provided media interviews; visited an \n     inner-city Honolulu elementary school, where Lt. Governor \n     Aiona conducted a teach-in, engaging students in an \n     interactive, lively discussion and delivering a presentation \n     on Too Smart to Start, a SAMHSA-sponsored underage alcohol \n     use prevention initiative; met with Hawaii Governor Linda \n     Lingle to discuss the Call to Action; met with the Hawaii \n     Partnership to Prevent Underage Drinking (HPPUD); and \n     attended a Town Hall meeting sponsored by HPPUD at which 120 \n     university researchers, health care providers, Department of \n     Health officials, policymakers, law enforcement personnel, \n     educators, business representatives, members of the faith-\n     based community, youth, and parents were in attendance.\n       In Maine, the First Lady Karen Baldacci and the Surgeon \n     General met with the Governor and Maine legislators in the \n     Senate and House of Representatives, Maine's Attorney \n     General, and community leaders. The Surgeon General also gave \n     a keynote address at the annual New England School of \n     Addiction Studies. As part of Maine's response to the Call to \n     Action, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of \n     Substance Abuse (OSA) announced the second phase of a \n     statewide media campaign, ``Find Out More, Do More,'' \n     targeted to parents.\n       In Nebraska, the First Lady Sally Ganem and the Surgeon \n     General provided several speaking engagements with teachers, \n     parents, students, and community leaders. Follow-up \n     activities included the following: twenty-one town hall \n     meetings were held in the spring of 2008; the Nebraska Liquor \n     Control Commission requested that Nebraska wholesalers limit \n     pocket-sized liquor containers until an investigative panel \n     evaluates the product's appeal to youth; the First Lady \n     raised funds to make a video of the Acting Surgeon General's \n     Town Hall Meeting for distribution throughout the State; \n     officials and other stakeholders developed a Nebraska ``call \n     to action'' on underage drinking; Nebraska Educational \n     Television (NET) developed a 30-minute documentary on \n     underage drinking featuring First Lady Sally Ganem; and the \n     First Lady and University of Nebraska's Coach Bo Pelini \n     developed PSAs to be shown during every high school sports \n     events covered by NET. The PSAs are expected to reach more \n     than 85,000 people with a message about underage drinking.\n       In New Mexico, the First Lady Barbara Richardson and the \n     Surgeon General provided a medical round table discussion, a \n     public forum in Santa Fe about underage drinking, and a \n     lecture in Albuquerque as part of Governor Bill Richardson's \n     DWI Research Speaker Series.\n       In North Carolina, during the Surgeon General's visit, the \n     First Lady Mary Easley announced the states ``Media Ready'' \n     program, a media literacy substance abuse prevention program \n     that is taught in middle schools. They also met with State \n     legislators, policy makers, education leaders, and \n     representatives from the Governor's Office,\n\n[[Page S3624]]\n\n     the judicial system, law enforcement, and health and \n     substance abuse prevention organizations that work on the \n     State and local levels to address underage drinking in North \n     Carolina. In addition, the Surgeon General spoke about the \n     Call to Action at North Carolina State University's \n     Millennium Seminar.\n       In North Dakota, the First Lady Mikey Hoeven and the \n     Surgeon General provided an address at the 2007 Alcohol and \n     Substance Abuse Summit in Bismarck and visited a middle \n     school where the Surgeon General spoke to students.\n       In Ohio, the First Lady Frances Strickland hosted the \n     Surgeon General's visit that included an address to college \n     and university presidents, as well as an address to the \n     prevention and treatment professionals in Ohio.\n       In Oklahoma, the Surgeon General spoke at several events \n     including a town hall meeting at the Oklahoma History Center \n     in Oklahoma City, and an address at the University of \n     Oklahoma College of Public Health.\n       In Oregon, the Surgeon General and the Oregon Attorney \n     General spoke at a news conference on underage drinking where \n     the Attorney General announced he was reconstituting a State \n     underage-drinking task force to examine binge drinking on \n     college campuses, energy drinks that contain alcohol, and the \n     possible creation of a driver's license suspension program \n     for minors caught with alcohol.\n       In Wyoming, the First Lady Nancy Freudenthal hosted the \n     Surgeon General's visit that included a news conference at \n     the annual meeting of the National Prevention Network, a \n     meeting on Wind River Reservation to discuss underage \n     drinking, and participation at a Town Hall Meeting on the \n     Central Wyoming Campus that highlighted not only the Surgeon \n     General's information but also the prevention efforts under \n     way across the State. This event also served as the kick-off \n     meeting for the national Town Halls. In addition, Wyoming \n     Public Television taped a discussion of underage drinking \n     issues including the Surgeon General, Wyoming youth involved \n     in prevention activities, and community members.\n       In Montana, the First Lady Nancy Schweitzer hosted the \n     Surgeon General's three-day visit to Montana that included \n     several speaking engagements with community groups, teens, \n     and university staff/students; production of a PSA of the \n     Surgeon General and First Lady; and meeting with the Lt \n     Governor and the State Interagency Coordinating Council. \n     Following the Surgeon General's visit, there were twenty-six \n     town hall meetings in Montana on underage drinking.\n       In Maryland, the First Lady Katie O'Malley and the Surgeon \n     General met with the Lt Governor, Attorney General and \n     several state leaders; gave a press conference; provided \n     remarks to the House and Senate legislators; gave a keynote \n     address and roundtable discussion at the Baltimore Health \n     Department; and attended a meeting with students in a middle \n     school.\n       In Rhode Island, the First Lady Suzanne Carcieri hosted the \n     Surgeon General's visit that included a meeting with Family \n     Court and Traffic Tribunal Judges with RI Family Court Chief \n     Judge Jeremiah S. Jeremiah who presented information about \n     the Family Court's Alcohol Calendar; a press conference on \n     underage drinking, a meeting with Substance Abuse Task Force \n     Coordinators, State Room, State House; a Lunch with Governor \n     and Mrs. Carcieri in the Governor's Personal Office; a \n     speaking engagement with university presidents, vice \n     presidents, and researchers, hosted by University of Rhode \n     Island President Dr. Robert Carothers; a meeting with \n     Policymakers in Providence, State Room, State House; an \n     address in both the House of Representatives and Senate; and \n     a Town Hall Meeting in Woonsocket, RI, City Hall.\n       Additionally, in 2008 2009, through the generosity of \n     Motorola, P, and Pride Surveys, the Foundation was able to \n     give stipends to support 25 Town Hall Meetings in member \n     states across the country to focus community attention on \n     underage drinking. These Town Hall Meetings were in addition \n     to the ones funded by SAMHSA/CSAP.\n       The Leadership also worked with Utah 2009 on a meeting of \n     medical examiners with NIAAA and CDC to see how the routine \n     screening for alcohol use in all deaths of persons under the \n     age of 21 could be actualized.\n       To accomplish its purpose of supporting First Spouse \n     underage drinking prevention initiatives, the Leadership \n     Foundation has produced weekly email updates, an information-\n     packed website, distribution of opinion editorials, and \n     presentations at national conferences.\n       The Weekly Update was supported with funding from NIAAA, a \n     Scaife Foundation grant in 2009, and their own resources. The \n     Weekly Update was distributed weekly from 2000 2011 to more \n     than 1,900 individuals. The Update contained timely \n     information on latest research, news from states, new \n     partners, grant and conference information. When a Facebook \n     page was developed, the Leadership decided to use the social \n     media network to distribute timely alerts about underage \n     drinking prevention. The website is also used extensively to \n     distribute information with an average of 400 new visitors \n     each week.\n       As issues pertaining to underage drinking have arisen, The \n     Leadership Foundation provided Draft Opinion Editorials to \n     First Spouses. First Spouses were encouraged to shape a final \n     draft based on their state data and/or opinions for \n     distribution to their media outlets. The Op Eds were intended \n     to raise awareness in the early 2000's on childhood/underage \n     drinking and more recently on specific issues such as the \n     costs of underage drinking to states, the minimum drinking \n     age laws, and alcohol energy drinks.\n       The Leadership Foundation has also been recognized as a \n     leader in the area of underage drinking prevention. As such, \n     representatives of the Leadership Foundation have been \n     invited to present at a variety of national and state \n     conferences. These included numerous presentations at the \n     Enforcing Underage Drinking Laws (EUDL) Conference, the Mid-\n     Year CADCA Institute, NPN/NASADAD conference, and state \n     conferences such as the Ohio Prevention and Education \n     Conference.\n       Since 2000, the Leadership Foundation membership, in \n     particular Advisory Board members, have provided significant \n     support at the national level by prompting the development of \n     important documents such as the Surgeon General's Call to \n     Action [SAMHSA, NIAAA, SG], and a state-level analysis of \n     alcohol costs to the state [NM, CDC].\n       In addition several products were developed and distributed \n     on-line, at conferences, and in print. All materials are \n     free, and downloadable from the Foundation's website at \n     http://www.alcoholfreechildren.org. These have included a \n     statistical brochure for lay audiences which distills the \n     most current research findings about early alcohol use and \n     its effects; a brochure describing three basic strategies for \n     preventing alcohol use by children, and bookmarks on ``Stay \n     Smart; Don't Start,'' a video entitled ``Drinking It In,'' a \n     program for Drug Free Workplace, a discussion guide for \n     communities on childhood drinking and a parent ``book club'' \n     discussion guide on the book ``Messengers in Denim.''\n       Several members of the Leadership Foundation have been \n     recognized for their outstanding efforts through The Racicot \n     Leadership Award, and The Hope Award.\n       In 2009, the Leadership Foundation Board of Directors \n     created the Racicot Award to be named for Theresa Racicot, \n     first lady emeritus of Montana for her efforts to turn the \n     Leadership Initiative into the Leadership Foundation in 2006 \n     7. The Award would be given annually to a sitting First \n     Spouse who had made significant accomplishments in his/her \n     state on underage drinking prevention and contributed time \n     and energy into the Leadership Foundation's work. Recipients \n     of the Racicot Award have been First Lady Mikey Hoeven who \n     served as co-chair of the Leadership Foundation Board, \n     started the successful ``Let's Keep Our Kids Alcohol Free'' \n     campaign, raised money for her efforts through Applebee's and \n     a MOMS cookbook, created the ``I Choose'' CD and served on \n     the Governor's Prevention Advisory Council on Drugs and \n     Alcohol during her tenure as First Spouse; Wyoming First Lady \n     Nancy Freudenthal who worked collaboratively with the Wyoming \n     Liquor Division, the Mental Health & Substance Abuse Division \n     of the Wyoming Department of Health, the Wyoming Association \n     of Sheriffs and Chiefs of Police and parents to develop new \n     partnerships and programs on underage drinking prevention; \n     and First Lady Sally Ganem of Nebraska who worked to create \n     several videos that are still widely used in Nebraska and \n     available to other states that serve as discussion openers.\n       In 2011, the Leadership Board of Directors voted at their \n     10th Anniversary Annual Meeting to create a recognition \n     program for Emeritus spouses to be named for Hope Taft, first \n     lady emeritus of Ohio and current president of the \n     Foundation. Patterned after the annual Racicot Leadership \n     Award, the Hope Award recipient is selected from nominations \n     of Leadership members and given to a former governor's spouse \n     who has stayed involved and committed to the vision of the \n     Leadership Foundation after leaving the Governor's Residence. \n     Recipients of the Hope Award have been Hope Taft, First Lady \n     Emeritus of Ohio who was a leader in underage drinking \n     prevention in Ohio during her tenure as First Spouse, and who \n     has represented the Leadership Foundation at the national \n     level; and Karen Baldacci, First Lady Emeritus of Maine who \n     has led the recruiting effort, and stayed on as chair of the \n     Leadership Foundation beyond the normal term.\n       In 2010, the Leadership Foundation developed a Promise \n     Partnership Program where agencies with a like-minded mission \n     were invited to submit an application for becoming a \n     Leadership partner Promise Partners include the Hepatitis \n     Foundation; Marin Institute (AlcoholJustice.org); Drug Free \n     Action Alliance; Lee County Coalition For a Drug Free \n     Southwest Florida; NABCA; Dr. Parnell Donahue, author of \n     Messengers in Denim; FACE; Prevention Council of Roanoke \n     County; Kansas Family Partnership; Outside the Classroom; The \n     NV Children's Cabinet; 7 Valleys Council on Alcoholism and \n     Substance Abuse, Inc.; Center for Prevention and Counseling; \n     Partnership for a Drug Free Community of S.

Many \n     states have passed laws focused on environmental issues such \n     as keg registration, server training, social hosting and \n     graduated licensing. Many members\n\n[[Page S3625]]\n\n     have worked in their states to bring awareness to the issue, \n     changes in policy and coordination in efforts to prevent \n     childhood drinking. As an example of extensive grassroots \n     activity in underage drinking, more than 2,000 grassroots \n     events were held in 2010 to focus on underage drinking.\n       The combined national initiatives, state focus, and \n     grassroots activities have contributed to a significant \n     decline in underage drinking in the United States as \n     discussed on page 1 2 of this document. In 1991 when the \n     first Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention (YRBS) survey was \n     administered, 50.8% of youth in grades 9 12 reported current \n     alcohol use, or use with 30 days prior to the survey. The \n     latest survey results in 2009 showed that number had dropped \n     to 41.8%, a statistically significant drop with a p-value of \n     0.00. That statistical difference means that youth in 1991 \n     were more likely than youth in 2009 to be current drinkers. \n     The number of states and territories participating in YRBS \n     survey data collection was fifty-three (53) in 2009; thirty-\n     six (36) were states in which there was a First Spouse member \n     of the Leadership Foundation. When looking at the data from \n     those specific states, all states showed a marked decline in \n     current alcohol with an average decline of 9.4%. Ten out of \n     the 36 showed a statistically significant decline in current \n     youth alcohol users. The front-runners in decline were New \n     Mexico, Rhode Island and North Dakota, and Utah showed the \n     lowest rate of current alcohol use among all states in 1991 \n     and 2009 (26.6 to 18.2).\n       Despite significant headway in the prevention of underage \n     drinking, current levels are still too high. Researchers \n     continue to document the importance of protecting the \n     development of the adolescent brain from the toxic effect of \n     alcohol. Adolescent alcohol use contributes to a host of \n     social, emotional, legal, academic, and physical \n     consequences. Children who begin using alcohol before age 15 \n     are more likely to develop a full-blown addiction and a \n     lifetime of lost productivity from it. The country's \n     attention to it must be continued and expanded.\n       Therefore, the Leadership Foundation has launched a 2012 \n     initiative to create ``virtual statewide coalitions'' with \n     support from NABCA (National Alcohol Beverage Control Board \n     Association). The website, with the First Spouse as the \n     convener, provides a place for all the coalitions in a state \n     to register along with vital, relevant state departments, and \n     agencies as well as relevant alcohol reduction and youth \n     serving agencies. The purpose of this initiative is to \n     facilitate more effective conversations between state and \n     local efforts to prevent underage drinking, and to distribute \n     timely alerts from national agencies to state and local \n     groups.\n       Mr. President, I hereby offer these aforementioned \n     accomplishments of The Leadership To Keep Children Alcohol \n     Free Foundation, and in so doing, seek to commemorate for \n     posterity their important work and highlight the value of \n     protecting our nation's children from the dangers of underage \n     drinking.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/24/senate-section/article/S3625-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO LOUIE A. WRIGHT\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL Mr. President, today I Wish to honor the work \nof Louie A. Wright. In our great Nation, there are labor leaders and \nthen there are exceptional labor leaders. Louie Wright is one of those \nexceptional labor leaders.\n  Louie recently retired as the head of the International Association \nof Firefighters Local 42 in Kansas City, but Louie will never stop \nworking and fighting for working men and women of Missouri and, for \nthat matter, the Nation.\n  Louie is exceptional for many reasons, not the least of which are his \nintellect, his professionalism, and his ability to work with, not \nagainst, management to the benefit of his membership.\n  I have known Louie for over 30 years. I have watched him under \npressure. I have watched him succeed. I have watched him stumble from \ntime to time. But through it all he remained steadfast and loyal to his \nfriends and willing to do anything for his fellow firefighters.\n  Louie grew up in Kansas City and, as a young man, became a \nfirefighter for the city of Kansas City, MO, Fire Department. It was a \nfull-time job, but for Louie full-time is 24 hours-a-day, so in 1988 he \nentered law school at the University of Missouri in Kansas City.\n  He received a law degree and was admitted to the Missouri, Kansas, \nColorado and Federal bar. Louie also clerked in the U.S. District Court \nin the Western District of Missouri, and he accomplished all of this \nwhile serving the people of Kansas City as one of their most dedicated \nfirefighters.\n  Having a labor leader with a law degree is a powerful force when \nnegotiating labor contracts, and the men and women of the city's fire \ndepartment recognized that, electing Louie president of IAFF Local 42 \nin 1995.\n  What also set Louie apart was his understanding that for firefighters \nto expect decent wages and benefits, the department had to demand that \nit become a first-rate firefighting and fire prevention force. And \ntoday Kansas City has one of the best and most well-respected fire \ndepartments in the Nation.\n  Louie did not just care about his firefighters, but he cared for all \nthe working men and women of Kansas City and was and remains a member \nof the executive committee of the Greater Kansas City AFL CIO. In \naddition, one of his true passions is health care and its delivery to \nall Kansas Citians. Louie spent untold volunteer hours on the board of \nthe Truman Medical Center and the Mid-America Health Coalition.\n  In conclusion, we honor him today as an exceptional labor leader. \nUpon Louie's retirement, IAFF Local 42 lost an amazing president. \nHowever, Kansas City has not lost one of its finest advocates for the \nworking men and women. Thankfully, his work will continue. I treasure \nhis friendship and am proud to recognize his immense \ncontributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/24/senate-section/article/S3625-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3625-S3626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RURAL HEALTH EDUCATION NETWORK\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I wish to \nrecognize the 20th anniversary of a successful program in my home State \nof Nebraska called the Rural Health Education Network, or RHEN which \nfocuses on increasing the health workforce.\n  The RHEN program was established at the University of Nebraska \nMedical Center, UNMC, as an effort to develop a network of volunteer \nfaculty in communities across the State who would serve as mentors for \nstudents entering into various health care professions to perform rural \nrotations as part of their training. This partnership between UNMC and \nthese Nebraska communities provides hands-on training for these health \nprofession students.\n  Working with volunteer faculty across rural Nebraska communities, \nalmost all UNMC students are able to complete a rural rotation during \ntheir education. Students spend up to 2 months living and working in a \nrural community under the guidance of a local health professional. In \n2010, more than 530 students from UNMC participated in 854 rural \nrotations in 74 Nebraska communities. The program allows these UNMC \nstudents to experience the good life in Nebraska communities, inspiring \nmany students to launch a health career in a smaller community.\n  The RHEN program has since expanded to promote career opportunities \nin health care to students in rural areas and smaller communities. In \nfact, RHEN has become the umbrella under which most of UNMC's rural \noutreach education activities are accomplished.\n  One goal of RHEN has been to create innovative programs at the \nundergraduate level and establish a career pipeline for students from \nrural areas to become health care professionals in rural Nebraska. A \nkey component in attaining this goal was the establishment of the Rural \nHealth Opportunities Program, or RHOP.\n  Built on the logic that persons raised in rural areas are more likely \nto return to rural areas after school, RHOP gives youth from rural \nareas a head start in pursuing a health care career. Under RHOP, \nqualified high school graduates receive tentative acceptance into one \nof nine UNMC health profession programs when they begin undergraduate \nstudies at either Chadron State or Wayne State College in Nebraska. The \nundergraduate tuition is waived for these students, provided they meet \nall applicable academic standards.\n  The RHOP program provides students a career path to nearly every \nhealth care field, including medicine, nursing, pharmacy, dentistry, \ndental hygiene, physical therapy, physician assistant, radiography, and \nclinical laboratory science. Since its inception,\n  Seventy-five percent of all practicing UNMC RHOP graduates have \nworked in a rural community for at least part of their careers;\n  Currently, 183 out of 359 practicing RHOP graduates are health care \nproviders in rural Nebraska;\n  Two hundred fifty-three RHOP alumni are practicing in 57 Nebraska \ncounties; and\n  Seventy percent of RHOP graduates stay in Nebraska.\n\n[[Page S3626]]\n\n  Based on RHOP's initial success, UNMC has since developed three \nadditional early admission programs:\n  The Kearney Health Opportunities Program grants students at the \nUniversity of Nebraska-Kearney, UNK, pre-admission to UNMC in five \nprograms including medicine, nursing, pharmacy, radiography, and \nclinical laboratory science.\n  A collaboration between Peru State College and the UNMC College of \nPharmacy reserves three slots each year in the College of Pharmacy for \nPeru State graduates.\n  The Public Health Early Admission Student Track allows Chadron State, \nWayne State, Peru State, and UNK to each annually select three students \nfor direct enrollment into a UNMC Public Health graduate program to \nhelp relieve the critical shortage of public health workers in rural \nNebraska.\n  Additionally, since 1993, UNMC has sponsored annual science meets for \neighth graders in Nebraska communities to get students interested in \nscience-based careers. More than 1,000 students have participated in \nthese meets. Further, RHEN hosts a career day each year for more than \n250 students to visit and experience UNMC.\n  Now recognized as one of the most effective health workforce \ndevelopment programs in my state, RHEN's anniversary provides the \nperfect opportunity to recognize the accomplishments of this amazing \nprogram and how it is making a difference across Nebraska. To \nillustrate, RHEN's focus is one of the reasons why U.S. News & World \nReport ranks UNMC's primary care medicine program among the top 10 in \nthe country.\n  In closing, the Rural Health Education Network program has made a \nsignificant difference in helping students become health care \nprofessionals for rural Nebraska, and I extend my congratulations to \nthis program on 20 years of making a positive impact and increasing the \nhealth care workforce across Nebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/24/senate-section/article/S3626-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         JEWISH HERITAGE MONTH\n\n Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, throughout the month of May, \nwe celebrate Jewish Heritage Month, a time to reflect upon and \ncelebrate those who have helped shape Jewish culture and the shared \nAmerican experience. Since arriving on the shores of New Amsterdam in \n1654, the men and women of the Jewish faith have worked to promote \nopportunity, justice, and equality for all.\n  In communities across the United States, public service, social \naction, and charity are rooted in both the religious and cultural \ncomponents of Judaism.\n  Every day, members of Ohio's Jewish community make contributions that \nbetter the lives of their families, friends, and cities. While so many \nof these men and women deserve our praise and gratitude, I would like \nto highlight a few leaders within the Ohio Jewish community both past \nand present.\n  Dr. Albert Sabin, a pioneer in the field of medicine, called \nCincinnati, OH home. While a professor at the University of Cincinnati \nCollege of Medicine, Dr. Sabin developed and perfected the oral polio \nvaccine. In 1960, after extensive preliminary trials, Dr. Sabin's oral \npolio vaccine was first used in Europe.\n  Between the years of 1962 and 1964, nearly 100 million people--\nchildren and adults--benefited from this vaccine in the United States. \nDr. Sabin's contributions to the field of medical research saved \ncountless lives from the ravages of polio and in the process, shaped \nmodern vaccine study. It is no exaggeration to say that his efforts \nbettered and saved the lives of millions worldwide.\n  The success of Dr. Sabin clearly reflects Jewish values a commitment \nto social justice and a desire to work towards bettering society.\n  Such values are also extremely evident in the work of Rabbi Abraham \nJoshua Heschel. Born in Poland in 1907 and deported by the Nazi's in \n1938, he was rescued and brought to the United States by Cincinnati's \nHebrew Union College. Both an activist and religious leader, Rabbi \nHeschel played a powerful role in forging the bonds of faith, social \naction, and civil rights. In 1965, Rabbi Heschel marched arm-in-arm \nwith Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., in Selma in support of the civil \nrights movement. Following this experience, he spoke the iconic words: \n``I felt my feet were praying.''\n  Just 3 years later, on March 25, 1968--10 days before that fateful \nday in Memphis, TN--Rabbi Heschel introduced Dr. King to the 68th \nAnnual Convention of the Rabbinical Assembly. Rabbi Heschel closed his \nintroduction by saying, ``The situation of the poor in America is our \nplight, our sickness. To be deaf to their cry is to condemn \nourselves.''\n  Dr. King began his opening statement by saying, ``I have heard `We \nShall Overcome' probably more than I have heard any other song over the \nlast few years. It is something of the theme song for our struggle. But \ntonight was the first time that I ever heard it in Hebrew, what a \nbeautiful experience for me.''\n  Rabbi Heschel's legacy is carried on by his daughter, Dr. Susannah \nHeschel, a professor of Jewish studies at Dartmouth College. I was \nproud to join Dr. Heschel at a series of events we conducted in Ohio to \ncelebrate her father's legacy and to discuss the future of social \naction and civil rights.\n  Another resident of Ohio who had a tremendous impact on Jewish \nheritage is Samuel Melton. Born in Austria-Hungary in 1900, Melton was \njust 4 years old when he and his mother joined his father in Toledo, \nOH.\n  As a student at the Ohio State University, Mr. Melton first became \ninterested in reforming how Judaism was studied. While his career path \nled him away from Judaism and into the production of stainless steel \nfittings, his passion for Jewish education remained.\n  After Mr. Melton's retirement from Capitol Manufacturing and Supply \nof Columbus in 1959, he devoted his time and financial resources to \nmodernizing and reforming Jewish education. He established the Melton \nFellowship to encourage talented men and women to pursue work in Jewish \neducation and financed the Samuel M. Melton Center for Jewish Studies \nat the Ohio State University, the first center for Jewish Studies at an \nAmerican public university. Additionally, Mr. Melton's impact on Jewish \nheritage spans the globe through his entrepreneurial and philanthropic \ninvolvement in Israel.\n  Some have said that Mr. Melton spent the first half of his life \nearning his fortune and the second half giving it away. I commend Mr. \nMelton for this generosity. His passion for Judaism has impacted \nthousands of young Jewish men and women in Ohio and across the world.\n  Finally, I would like to highlight Alfred Tibor, a current Columbus \nresident, who was born in Hungary in 1920. Mr. Tibor has used his \nexperiences as a Holocaust survivor to create sculptures that not only \ncommemorate but also inspire humanity.\n  In his youth, Mr. Tibor was a talented gymnast and acrobat, but his \nJewish heritage kept him from competing in the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. \nIn 1940, he was forced by the Germans to perform slave labor before \nbeing sent to a prisoner of war camp in Siberia. After the war, Alfred \nand his brother returned to Hungary to find that they were the only \nmembers of their family to escape the war. Fearing further anti-Semitic \nactivities, he fled Hungary, arriving in the United States and settling \nin Columbus.\n  For more than half a century, Alfred Tibor has used his talents to \ninspire and educate. According to Mr. Tibor, ``Art for art's sake is \nnot enough.'' His sculptures are seen across the world as tributes to \nthose lost and as reminders of hope and faith in times of tragedy and \nunspeakable horror.\n  During Jewish Heritage Month, let's honor Dr. Sabin, Rabbi Heschel, \nMr. Melton, and Mr. Tibor, as well as all the men and women within the \nOhio Jewish community who are seeking to better their neighborhoods \nwhile working to advance social justice. Thank you for your service to \nthe Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/24/senate-section/article/S3626-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/24/senate-section/article/S3626-3", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3626-S3627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United\n\n[[Page S3627]]\n\nStates submitting sundry nominations which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/24/senate-section/article/S3627-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following joint resolution was read the first time:\n\n       S.J.

A bill to provide for a uniform national standard for the \nhousing and treatment of egg-laying hens, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nwith Senators Blumenthal, Brown, Cantwell, Merkley, Vitter, and Wyden, \nthat will codify an agreement reached by the nation's largest egg \nproducer organization, the United Egg Producers, and the largest animal \nwelfare organization, the Humane Society of the United States.\n  In its most simple terms, the legislation sets a national standard \nfor the treatment of egg-laying hens and the labeling of eggs.\n  As of today, 6 States, including California, have set their own \nstandards about how egg-laying hens should be raised, and 18 other \nStates allow citizen ballot initiatives could initiate similar laws in \nthe future.\n  These State standards will make it difficult for egg producers to \nfreely ship across State lines.\n  Starting in 2015, eggs produced in Iowa, Indiana and other egg-\nexporting states can no longer be shipped to California because the \nhens will have been raised in cages that do not meet California's \nstandards.\n  Different standards in Michigan and Ohio will take effect later, \nfurther adding to the patchwork of regulations.\n  As States with disparate standards continue to protect their own egg \nproducers by banning the sale of eggs from States with lower or no \nstandards, a complicated web of State laws will impair interstate \ncommerce.\n  I have met with a number of egg producers and their concerns vary.\n  For some producers, different regulations increase costs because new \ncages must be designed for each State in which they operate.\n  Other producers fear that egg prices in states without regulations \nwill plummet as imports flood their market.\n  Some egg producers selling to national grocery stores will have to \nproduce eggs that meet different standards in different States.\n  Concerns don't end with producers.\n  Consumers can expect to see higher prices at grocery stores and \nrestaurants will have to pay more for every egg they prepare.\n  Millions of individuals, including myself, are concerned about the \nliving conditions of these animals.\n  That is why I am pleased to introduce this legislation today. The \nUnited Egg Producers and the Humane Society of the United States worked \nfor over a year to reach this compromise, and I believe it is one that \nstrikes a very fair balance.\n  Producers must enlarge cages for egg-laying hens and allow space for \nthe birds to engage in natural behaviors such as nesting and perching.\n  Producers will have up to 18 years to meet this standard and make the \nrequired investments.\n  The legislation will officially outlaw the practice of starving \nchickens to increase egg-production, a cruel practice that is rarely \nused today, and one with consensus to end.\n  The bill will also lead to improved air quality in hen-houses by \nprohibiting excessive ammonia levels and it requires humane euthanasia \nof spent hens. This is also already common practice in the industry.\n  At its heart, this legislation is about protecting the future of the \negg industry.\n  The egg industry brought this legislation to Congress and has asked \nus to help them implement the uniform regulations needed to survive and \ngrow.\n  With this legislation, egg producers will have the market certainty \nthey need and a reasonable timetables to make the required changes.\n  Producers need these uniform national standards so they can invest in \nnew cages without facing the risk of more stringent state laws \nrendering their investments moot.\n  The egg industry is prepared to make these investments, many of which \ncan be accomplished during the normal course of replacing aged \nequipment.\n  In addition to promoting industry stability, this bill will save jobs \nand strengthen the economy.\n  Furthermore, consumers are already embracing these reforms. Polls \nindicate broad support for the provisions in this bill and for humane \ntreatment of egg-laying hens in general.\n  A recent survey found that 64 percent of Americans say that these \nnewer facilities should be required through Federal legislation.\n  A majority, 58 percent, of American consumers also support a national \nstandard.\n  The survey found 92 percent of consumers support the industry \ntransitioning to these new enriched cages.\n  Candidly, it is not often that we see this sort of compromise in \nWashington.\n  Two groups that have been in fundamental conflict for years sat down \nand reached a deal.\n  The egg industry and the Humane Society are lock-step in their \nsupport for this bill. They are joined in endorsing the bill by the \nAmerican Veterinary Medical Association and the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica.\n  Even though the egg industry supports this bill, some still target \nthis legislation as anti-agriculture they suggest the legislation will \nsomehow be applied to, or set a precedent for Federal regulation of \nother industries.\n  That is simply not the case.\n\n[[Page S3634]]\n\n  I want to be clear: requirements in the Egg Products Inspection Act \nAmendments of 2012 only apply to the production of eggs. The bill will \nnot affect any other agricultural product including beef, pork, poultry \nand milk.\n  This legislation is a responsible compromise between those who \nadvocate for more humane treatment for egg-laying hens and those who \nput breakfast on our tables.\n  I hope that even in this partisan climate we can enact this \ncommonsense and widely endorsed legislation.\n  This legislation protects restaurants, bakers, food processors and \nAmerican consumers from unnecessarily high egg prices. It protects egg \nproducers from having eggs they can't sell.\n  This legislation is a reasonable, widely-supported solution to a \nreal, costly and growing problem. The bill has the support of the \nUnited Egg Producers, which represents nearly 90 percent of the \nNation's egg industry, as well as nine state and regional egg producer \ngroups, more than 100 individual egg farms and more than 880 other \nfamily farms.\n  I urge you to join me in supporting this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3239\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to permanently reauthorize the EB 5 Regional Center \nProgram, the E-Verify Program, the Special Immigrant Nonminister \nReligious Worker Program, and the Conrad State 30 J 1 Visa Waiver \nProgram; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nGrassley, in introducing legislation that will permanently authorize \nfour expiring immigration programs. I thank Senator Grassley for \nworking with me on this needed legislation.\n  The bill we introduce will permanently authorize the EB 5 Regional \nCenter Program, the voluntary E-Verify electronic work authorization \nprogram, the State 30 J 1 Visa program that Senator Conrad champions \nand the Special Immigrant Nonminister Religious Worker Program that is \nso important to Senator Hatch. All of these programs have been in \ntemporary status for many years, and the time has come for Congress to \nmake them permanent so that the proponents of these programs can get to \nwork building upon the benefits these programs bring to communities \nacross the country. Permanency for these programs will strengthen our \neconomy, create jobs, and enhance the security of American workers. \nPermanency will help medically underserved areas obtain talented \nphysicians and religious institutions welcome individuals from around \nthe world to participate in good works. These programs serve diverse \nand important interests in America, and should become permanent \nfixtures in our immigration law.\n  I am particularly pleased that the EB 5 Regional Center Program is a \npart of this package. With permanency, I believe this program can \nbecome an even greater economic driver than it has been in communities \nacross the United States. Making the program permanent will also create \na solid foundation for me and others interested in its success to begin \nin earnest to make improvements and reforms that will make it more \nbusiness friendly, more predictable and stable for investors, and will \nprovide U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services with the tools it \nneeds to ensure that the program meets the highest standards of quality \nand integrity. There is little reason that this program should not \ncontinue to improve as a deficit-neutral source of capital investment \nand job creation across America.\n  I hope our introduction of this legislation today is the beginning of \na strong bipartisan effort to make these programs permanent. I look \nforward to working with Senator Grassley and others to accomplish this \ngoal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3245\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve the Service Corps of Retired Executives, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nstrengthen the resources and support that we provide to entrepreneurs, \nand to strengthen oversight of the SCORE program.\n  In 1964, the Small Business Administration recognized that retired \nbusiness executives who volunteered to share their knowledge and \nexpertise could be invaluable to entrepreneurs. From this, SCORE was \nestablished and has since grown to over 360 chapters across America. As \nwith any type of growth, there comes an essential need for increased \norganization and oversight. This bill seeks to assist the SBA and SCORE \nwith just that.\n  The key to getting our nation on the road to economic recovery lies \nin the hands of small business, which is why I am always looking for \nways to improve the SBA's entrepreneurial assistance programs. By \ncreating a SCORE Advisory Board which functions to monitor and develop \ninitiatives for programs affecting SCORE chapters, we can ensure that \nentrepreneurs in all areas of our economy are served by high-quality \nmentoring services. Specifically, this board is compromised of six \nmembers coming from the owners and employees of small businesses \nthemselves, in addition to current members of SCORE chapters.\n  While some may argue that funding for SCORE should be increased, in \nthis budget environment, where Federal revenues and spending are \nmisaligned to the tune of $1.1 trillion this year alone, we must find \nways to be more efficient with existing resources. I am hopeful that \nwith administrative reforms and increased transparency, we can make the \nSCORE program more cost effective, while maintaining its vital \nassistance to small businesses.\n  For example, there is currently no oversight for funding allocations \nto individual SCORE chapters. In the past three fiscal years, only $2.5 \nmillion of the $7 million appropriated to SCORE has been distributed to \nthe SCORE districts and chapters. The bulk of their funding, $4.5 \nmillion, has been spent on\n\n[[Page S3637]]\n\nstaffing, administrative expenses, technology, and overhead. As a non-\nprofit organization, SCORE seeks to support small businesses across the \ncountry with thousands of volunteers but only very limited resources. \nIt is imperative that there are transparent and fair practices in place \nfor allocation of SBA funding to best provide for these small \nbusinesses. Therefore, my bill requires the creation of an Allocation \nCommittee, comprised of Advisory Board members who will ensure that not \nless than 50 percent of SCORE's total allocation goes to the districts \nand chapters that directly serve small business clients.\n  To safeguard funds appropriated to SCORE, my bill also places a limit \non the taxpayer funded salary of SCORE's CEO, which according to the \nlatest Internal Revenue Service filing, is 43 percent higher than that \nof the SBA's Administrator, who oversees the entire agency, including \nSCORE. This bill establishes in statute that the SCORE CEO follow the \nsalary cap of a Senior Executive Service level Federal employee, \nensuring that more money is available for the small businesses driving \nour economy. Additionally, this bill proposes to limit the Federal \nshare of this salary even further when that CEO serves in a leadership \ncapacity on a foundation affiliated with SCORE.\n  Through the Advisory Board and its Allocation Committee, we will add \nmuch needed improvements to an already successful program. By enhancing \nintegration between SCORE chapters and the SBA, small businesses will \nhave even more support to sustain their contributions to our recovering \neconomy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3246\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the North American bison as the national \nmammal of the United States; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to provide a few comments regarding \nthe introduction of the Bison Legacy Act. Senator Tim Johnson of South \nDakota and I are introducing this legislation today because of the \nsignificant role the North American Bison has played in the history of \nour Nation. This bill honors that legacy by designating the bison as \nthe national mammal of the United States.\n  The bison has been integrally linked to the economic and spiritual \nlives of many Native American tribes over the centuries. Since our \nfrontier days, the bison has become a symbol of American strength and \ndetermination. The Department of Interior has depicted the bison on its \nofficial seal for 94 years and the buffalo nickel played an important \nrole in modernizing our currency in the early 20th century. At one \npoint in American history, bison were brought in to graze outside the \noriginal Smithsonian building here in Washington, DC.\n  I must also add that my home State of Wyoming is one of three states \nthat recognize the bison as its official state mammal and has honored \nan image of a bison on the Wyoming state flag since it was first \nadopted in 1917. Today, thousands of American bison freely roam \nYellowstone and Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. The bison is also \nimportant to our state's economic well-being with a growing number of \nranchers raising bison for consumers all over the world.\n  This bill is supported by a wide variety of stakeholders. I want to \nrecognize the National Bison Association who represents the interests \nof the bison ranchers in nearly every single State. Also behind this \nbill is the Intertribal Bison Council supporting the cultural role the \nbison has played in Native American history. Finally, there is the \nWildlife Conservation Society who wishes to honor the restoration of \nbison in North America since the 19th century.\n  I ask my colleagues to help me support and pass this legislation \nhonoring the bison and designating it as our national mammal. The bison \nhas and will continue to be a symbol of America, its people and a way \nof life.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 3253. A bill to amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to \nenhance the Small Business Investment Company Program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as National Small Business Week is \ncoming to a close, I come to the floor today to make a strong \ncommitment that the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship will not lose momentum on our relentless push to help \nAmerica's small businesses grow, thrive, and excel. So today, along \nwith the senior senator from Maine, I am introducing the Expanding \nAccess to Capital for Entrepreneurial Leaders Act, or the EXCEL Act. \nThis legislation will enhance the already successful Small Business \nInvestment Company, SBIC, program at the Small Business Administration, \nSBA, that has helped over 100,000 small businesses. The best part of \nour bill is that the EXCEL Act should not cost the taxpayer anything.\n  The SBA runs a venture capital program by guaranteeing money borrowed \nby qualified investment funds who invest in small businesses. The \nqualified funds, or Small Business Investment Companies, SBICs, are \nprivately owned and operated, but licensed and regulated by the SBA. \nUsing a combination of private investments and the loans guaranteed by \nthe SBA, typically at a ratio of $2 in guaranteed funds for every $1 of \nprivate capital, SBICs make long-term investments in American small \nbusinesses. In order to participate in the program, funds pay licensing \nfees which serve to cover all SBIC program costs. As a result, the core \nSBIC program, Debenture SBICs, not only boasts a strong success rate, \nbut also incurs no cost to the U.S. government. Since the program's \ninception, over $50 billion has been invested in over 100,000 small \nbusinesses.\n  The Ranking Member of the Small Business Committee and I conducted a \nroundtable with 14 participants from the SBA, SBICs, investors in \nSBICs, and small businesses to elicit suggestions on enhancing the \nprogram. Out of that was born the EXCEL Act.\n  The EXCEL Act is a bipartisan effort encompassing much-needed changes \nthat will allow the SBIC program to meet growing demand and will make \nimprovements so that more small businesses can access capital.\n  The first thing the EXCEL Act does is raises the SBIC program \nauthorization level from $3 billion to $4 billion and pegs it to \ninflation. This change is long overdue--the ceiling has been at $3 for \nsome time, despite inflation and the impressive growth in the SBIC \nprogram. To illustrate: the program grew 50 percent in FY2011 alone. In \norder to meet demand, we need to give the program room to grow.\n  Secondly, the EXCEL Act will encourage successful investors by \nraising the limit on ``families of funds.'' Family of funds refers to a \nteam of SBIC fund managers who operate several funds. These are \ncurrently limited to $225 million of SBA-guaranteed debt. However, SBIC \nfund managers who manage more than one fund generally see better \ninvestment results. The EXCEL Act will encourage that kind of success \nby giving families of funds a higher limit of $350 million, which will \nbe indexed to inflation.\n  Next, the EXCEL Act improves transparency and accountability in the \nprogram. The legislation requires that\n\n[[Page S3639]]\n\nthe SBA make public how effective individual SBICs are in their small \nbusiness investments, guaranteeing that SBA-backed money is being used \nresponsibly.\n  Finally, the EXCEL Act promotes outreach, thereby ensuring that the \nmaximum possible number of small businesses can benefit from the SBIC \nprogram. The legislation encourages outreach to community banks and \nother lenders, states and municipalities, and asks the SBA to make \ntheir SBIC website more user-friendly.\n  The EXCEL Act contains a number of common sense provisions supported \nacross the aisle, and is sponsored by the Chair and Ranking Member of \nthe Small Business Committee. It enhances a program with proven success \nin providing capital to small businesses, and does so with the \nexpectation that it will not add a dime to the deficit. Let us get this \nbill passed.

Res. 473\n\n       Whereas polio is a highly infectious disease that primarily \n     affects children and for which there is no known cure;\n       Whereas polio can leave survivors permanently disabled from \n     muscle paralysis of the limbs and occasionally leads to a \n     particularly difficult death through the paralysis of \n     respiratory muscles;\n       Whereas polio was once one of the most dreaded diseases in \n     the United States, killing thousands annually in the late \n     19th and early 20th centuries and leaving thousands more with \n     permanent disability, including the 32nd President of the \n     United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt;\n       Whereas severe polio outbreaks in the 1940s and 1950s \n     caused panic in the United States, as parents kept children \n     indoors, public health officials quarantined infected \n     individuals, and the Federal Government restricted commerce \n     and travel;\n       Whereas 1952 was the peak of the polio epidemic in the \n     United States, with more than 57,000 people affected, 21,000 \n     of whom were paralyzed and 3,000 of whom died;\n       Whereas safe and effective polio vaccines, including the \n     Inactivated Polio Vaccine (commonly known as ``IPV''), \n     developed in 1952 by Jonas Salk, and the Oral Polio Vaccine \n     (commonly known as ``OPV''), developed in 1957 by Albert \n     Sabin, rendered polio preventable and contributed to the \n     rapid decline of polio incidence in the United States;\n       Whereas polio, a preventable disease that the United States \n     has been free from since 1979, still needlessly lays victim \n     to children and adults in several countries where challenges \n     such as active conflict and lack of infrastructure hamper \n     access to vaccines;\n       Whereas the eradication of polio is the highest priority of \n     Rotary International, a global association that was founded \n     in 1905 in Chicago, Illinois, is currently headquartered in \n     Evanston, Illinois, and has 1,200,000 members in more than \n     170 countries;\n       Whereas Rotary International and its members (commonly \n     known as ``Rotarians'') have contributed more than \n     $1,000,000,000 and volunteered countless hours in the global \n     fight against polio;\n       Whereas the Federal Government is the leading public sector \n     donor to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative and provides \n     technical and operational leadership to this global effort \n     through the work of the Centers for Disease Control and the \n     United States Agency for International Development;\n       Whereas Rotary International, the World Health \n     Organization, the United States Government, the United \n     Nations Children's Fund (commonly known as ``UNICEF''), and \n     the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have joined together \n     with national governments to successfully reduce cases of \n     polio by more than 99 percent since 1988, from 350,000 \n     reported cases in 1988 to fewer than 700 reported cases in \n     2011;\n       Whereas polio was recently eliminated in India and is now \n     endemic only in Nigeria, Pakistan, and Afghanistan; and\n       Whereas the eradication of polio is imminently achievable \n     and will be a victory shared by all of humanity: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends Rotary International and others for their \n     efforts in vaccinating children around the world against \n     polio and for the tremendous strides made toward eradicating \n     the disease once and for all;\n       (2) encourages the international community of governments \n     and non-governmental organizations to remain committed to the \n     elimination of polio; and\n       (3) encourages continued commitment and funding by the \n     United States Government to the global effort to rid the \n     world of polio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/24/senate-section/article/S3639-3", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3639-S3640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 474--RECOGNIZING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MAY 2012 AS \nASIAN-PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH AND THE IMPORTANCE OF CELEBRATING \nTHE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS OF ASIAN-AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS \n                  TO THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Reid of Nevada, Mr. Begich, \nMrs. Murray, and Mr. Menendez) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 474\n\n       Whereas the United States joins together each May to pay \n     tribute to the contributions of generations of Asian-\n     Americans and Pacific Islanders who have enriched the history \n     of the United States;\n       Whereas the history of Asian-Americans and Pacific \n     Islanders in the United States is inextricably tied to the \n     story of the United States;\n       Whereas the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community \n     is an inherently diverse population, comprised of over 45 \n     distinct ethnicities and over 100 language dialects;\n       Whereas according to the United States Census Bureau, the \n     Asian-American population grew faster than any other racial \n     or ethnic group over the last decade, surging nearly 46 \n     percent between 2000 and 2010, which is a growth rate 4 times \n     faster than the total United States population;\n       Whereas the 2010 decennial census estimated that there are \n     17,300,000 United States residents who identify as Asian and \n     1,200,000 United States residents who identify as Native \n     Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, making up nearly 6 \n     percent of the total United States population;\n       Whereas the month of May was selected for Asian-Pacific \n     American Heritage Month because the first Japanese immigrants \n     arrived in the United States on May 7, 1843, and the first \n     transcontinental railroad was completed on May 10, 1869, with \n     substantial contributions from Chinese immigrants;\n       Whereas the year 2012 marks several important historic \n     milestones for the Asian American and Pacific Islander \n     community, including the--\n       (1) 20th anniversary of the formal establishment of Asian-\n     Pacific American Heritage Month;\n       (2) 30th anniversary of the unpunished murder of Vincent \n     Chin;\n       (3) 70th anniversary of the signing of Executive Order \n     9066, which authorized the internment of Japanese-Americans;\n       (4) 100th anniversary of the planting of the first cherry \n     tree in Washington, D.C. from Japan;\n       (5) 130th anniversary of the enactment of the Act entitled \n     ``An Act to execute certain treaty stipulations relating to \n     Chinese'', approved May 6, 1882 (22 Stat. 58, chapter 126); \n     and\n\n[[Page S3640]]\n\n       (6) 150th anniversary of the enactment of the Act of July \n     1, 1862 (12 Stat. 489, chapter 120), which promoted the \n     construction of the transcontinental railroad;\n\n       Whereas section 102 of title 36, United States Code, \n     officially designates May as Asian-Pacific American Heritage \n     Month and requests the President to issue each year a \n     proclamation calling on the people of the United States to \n     observe the month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and \n     activities;\n       Whereas the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, a \n     bicameral caucus of Members of Congress advocating on behalf \n     of Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, is composed of a \n     record high 41 Members in 2012;\n       Whereas today, Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders are \n     serving in State legislatures across the United States, in \n     States as diverse as Alaska, Arizona, California, \n     Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Maryland, New Jersey, \n     New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, Utah, and \n     Washington;\n       Whereas the commitment of the United States to diversity in \n     the judiciary has been demonstrated by the nominations of \n     high-caliber Asian-American and other minority jurists at all \n     levels of the Federal bench;\n       Whereas there still remains much to be done to ensure that \n     Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders have access to \n     resources, a voice in the Federal Government, and continue to \n     advance in the political landscape of the United States; and\n       Whereas celebrating May 2012 as Asian-Pacific American \n     Heritage Month provides the people of the United States with \n     an opportunity to recognize the achievements, contributions, \n     and history of, and address the challenges faced by, Asian-\n     Americans and Pacific Islanders: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate recognizes--\n       (1) the significance of May 2012 as Asian-Pacific American \n     Heritage Month as an important time to celebrate the \n     significant contributions of Asian-Americans and Pacific \n     Islanders to the history of the United States; and\n       (2) that the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community \n     enhances the rich diversity of, and strengthens, the United \n     States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/24/senate-section/article/S3640-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 475--RELATING TO THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE E.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Successive Presidents of the United States have \n     determined that the pursuit of nuclear weapons capabilities \n     by the Government of Iran presents a danger to the United \n     States, its friends and allies, and to global security.\n       (2) Successive Congresses have recognized the threat that \n     the Government of Iran and its policies present to the United \n     States, its friends and allies, and to global security, and \n     responded with successive bipartisan legislative initiatives, \n     including most recently the enactment of the Comprehensive \n     Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 \n     (22 U.S.C. 8501 et seq.) on July 1, 2010.\n       (3) If the Government of Iran achieves a nuclear weapons \n     capability, it would pose a threat to the United States and \n     allies and friends of the United States, particularly Israel, \n     destabilize the Middle East, increase the threat of nuclear \n     terrorism, and significantly undermine global \n     nonproliferation efforts.\n       (4) The United States and its allies in the international \n     community recognize the threat posed by the pursuit of \n     nuclear weapons capabilities by the Government of Iran and \n     have imposed significant sanctions against the Government of \n     Iran, including through the enactment of the Comprehensive \n     Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 in \n     the United States and the adoption of a series of successive, \n     increasingly stringent United Nations Security Council \n     resolutions. While such efforts, together with others, have \n     served to slow the development of Iran's nuclear program, \n     they have not yet deterred Iran from its nuclear ambitions, \n     and international efforts to do so must be intensified.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' has the meaning \n     given that term in section 14 of the Iran Sanctions Act of \n     1996 (Public Law 104 172; 50 U.S.C. 1701 note).\n       (2) Credible information.--The term ``credible \n     information'' has the meaning given that term in section 14 \n     of the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996, as amended by section 205 \n     of this Act.\n       (3) Knowingly.--The term ``knowingly'' has the meaning \n     given that term in section 14 of the Iran Sanctions Act of \n     1996 (Public Law 104 172; 50 U.S.C. 1701 note).\n       (4) United states person.--The term ``United States \n     person'' has the meaning given that term in section 101 of \n     the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and \n     Divestment Act of 2010 (22 U.S.C. 8511).\n\n  TITLE I--EXPANSION OF MULTILATERAL SANCTIONS REGIME WITH RESPECT TO \n                                  IRAN\n\n     SEC. 101. POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES WITH RESPECT TO \n                   DEVELOPMENT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS CAPABILITIES BY \n                   IRAN.\n\n       It shall be the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to prevent the Government of Iran from--\n       (A) acquiring or developing nuclear weapons;\n       (B) developing its advanced conventional weapons and \n     ballistic missile capabilities; and\n       (C) continuing its support for terrorist organizations and \n     other activities aimed at undermining and destabilizing its \n     neighbors and other countries; and\n       (2) to fully implement all multilateral and bilateral \n     sanctions against Iran, as part of larger\n\n[[Page S3643]]\n\n     multilateral and bilateral diplomatic efforts, in order to \n     compel the Government of Iran--\n       (A) to abandon efforts to acquire a nuclear weapons \n     capability;\n       (B) to abandon and dismantle its ballistic missile and \n     unconventional weapons programs; and\n       (C) to cease all support for terrorist organizations and \n     other terrorist activities aimed at undermining and \n     destabilizing its neighbors and other countries.\n\n     SEC. 102.

Among these economic sanctions are--\n       (1) prompt enforcement of the current multilateral \n     sanctions regime with respect to Iran;\n       (2) full, timely, and vigorous implementation of all \n     sanctions enacted into law, including sanctions imposed or \n     expanded by this Act or amendments made by this Act, \n     through--\n       (A) intensified monitoring by the President and his \n     designees, including the Secretary of the Treasury and the \n     Secretary of State, along with senior officials in the \n     intelligence community, as appropriate;\n       (B) more extensive use of extraordinary authorities \n     provided for under the International Emergency Economic \n     Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) and other sanctions laws;\n       (C) reallocation of resources to provide the personnel \n     necessary, within the Department of the Treasury, the \n     Department of State, and the Department of Defense, and, \n     where appropriate, the intelligence community, to apply and \n     enforce sanctions; and\n       (D) expanded cooperation with international sanctions \n     enforcement efforts;\n       (3) urgent consideration of the expansion of existing \n     sanctions with respect to such areas as--\n       (A) the provision of energy-related services to Iran;\n       (B) the provision of insurance and reinsurance services to \n     Iran;\n       (C) the provision of shipping services to Iran;\n       (D) those Iranian financial institutions not currently \n     designated for the imposition of sanctions that may be acting \n     as intermediaries for Iranian financial institutions that are \n     designated for the imposition of sanctions; and\n       (4) a focus on countering Iran's efforts to evade \n     sanctions, including--\n       (A) the activities of telecommunications, Internet, and \n     satellite service providers, within and outside of Iran, to \n     ensure that such providers are not participating in or \n     facilitating, directly or indirectly, the evasion of the \n     sanctions regime with respect to Iran or violations of the \n     human rights of the people of Iran;\n       (B) the activities of financial institutions or other \n     businesses or government agencies, within or outside of Iran, \n     not yet designated for the imposition of sanctions; and\n       (C) urgent and ongoing evaluation of Iran's energy, \n     national security, financial, and telecommunications sectors, \n     to gauge the effects of, and possible defects in, particular \n     sanctions, with prompt efforts to correct any gaps in the \n     existing sanctions regime with respect to Iran.\n\n     SEC. 103.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Government of Iran continues to violate \n     systematically the basic human rights of citizens of Iran, \n     including by cutting off their access to information and \n     technology, suppressing their freedom of expression, and \n     punishing severely, and sometimes brutally, their attempts to \n     exercise political rights.\n       (2) In a March 20, 2012, speech celebrating Nowruz, the \n     Iranian New Year, President Barack Obama described censorship \n     of the Internet and monitoring of computers and cell phones \n     by the Government of Iran as depriving the people of Iran of \n     ``the information they want [and] stopping the free flow of \n     information and ideas into the country''. The President \n     concluded that ``in recent weeks, Internet restrictions have \n     become so severe that Iranians cannot communicate freely with \n     their loved ones within Iran, or beyond its borders, [so \n     that] an electronic curtain has fallen around Iran.''.\n       (3) At a time when growing numbers of Iranians turn to the \n     Internet as a source for news and political debate, the \n     response of the Government of Iran has combined increasingly \n     pervasive jamming and filtering of the Internet, blocking of \n     email, social networking and other websites, and interception \n     of Internet, telephonic, and mail communications.\n       (4) The March 2012 Report of the United Nations Human \n     Rights Council Special Rapporteur on Iran details the \n     Government of Iran's widespread human rights abuses and \n     censorship, its chronic disregard of due process, and its \n     equally chronic harassment, abuse, and intimidation of the \n     people of Iran.\n       (5) There has been no independent investigation into the \n     months of violence that followed Iran's fraudulent 2009 \n     presidential election, violence that included the beatings of \n     scores of Tehran University students by security forces using \n     weapons, such as chains, metal rods, and electrified batons, \n     and the subsequent imprisonment of many students, some of \n     whom died in captivity.\n       (6) The Government of Iran has failed to cooperate with \n     human rights investigations by the Special Rapporteur, and \n     its failure to cooperate in those and similar investigations \n     has been criticized in reports of the United Nations \n     Secretary-General, General Assembly, and Human Rights \n     Council, even as human rights abuses continue.\n\n     SEC. 402. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Government of Iran, especially Iran's Revolutionary \n     Guard Corps, continues to engage in serious, systematic, and \n     ongoing violations of human rights and the rise in the level \n     of such violations after the 2009 presidential elections has \n     not abated;\n       (2) the Government of Iran is engaging in a systematic \n     campaign to prevent news, entertainment, and opinions from \n     reaching media that are not subject to government control and \n     to eliminate any free Internet or other electronic media \n     discussion among the people of Iran; and\n       (3) the Government of Iran has refused to cooperate with \n     international organizations, including the United Nations, \n     seeking to investigate or to alleviate those conditions.\n\n     SEC. 403.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to consider the following nomination: Calendar No. 640, and \nthat the Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Sara Margalit Aviel, of \nCalifornia, to be United States Alternate Executive Director of the \nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nconsideration of the nomination.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the nomination of \nSara Aviel to be the Alternate Executive Director to the International \nBank for Reconstruction and Development. Had the Senate conducted a \nrecorded vote, I would have voted against Ms. Aviel's nomination.\n  In 2011, the World Bank released a new 10-year energy sector lending \nstrategy which includes a proposal to limit lending for new coal \ngeneration projects. I strongly disagree with the World Bank blocking \nany access to coal-powered energy. Their strategy will drive up energy \nprices around the world, and will make affordable and reliable energy \nfor poor countries difficult to secure.\n  The World Bank should be focused on poverty reduction and economic \ngrowth. Using advanced technologies, coal provides a clean, low cost \nand reliable energy source which is critical to countries looking for \nassistance in poverty alleviation and economic development. I believe \nrepresentatives of the United States at the World Bank should support \nlow cost and dependable energy sources as a means to help countries \nspur economic growth.\n  Sara Aviel supports the World Bank providing financing for coal power \ngeneration but only to the poorest countries when no other options are \navailable. She reiterated this point when I asked her whether she would \nsupport the World Bank's financing of a new coal-fired power plant \nproject in Kosovo. She stated:\n\n       There are a number of compelling reasons in favor of this \n     project. First, Kosovo, one of the poorest countries in \n     Europe, is greatly in need of reliable base load power and \n     there appears to be no other viable alternatives.\n\n  Since the majority of lending by the World Bank is for middle-income \ncountries, and not to the poorest of countries, the World Bank strategy \nsupported by Sara Aviel will place significant limits, if not \neliminate, lending for coal power generation. I believe she will use \nthe World Bank 10-year energy strategy as a means to restrict World \nBank lending for coal power generation projects, even when the proposal \nrepresents the most cost effective alternative. Requiring borrowers to \naccept higher cost projects when affordable and reliable alternatives \nare readily available is no way to operate a bank, especially when the \nbank is being funded with taxpayer dollars.\n  The World Bank has also started a shift from providing financing to \nhelp the poorest of countries with economic growth and reducing \npoverty, to a focus in other areas with a strong emphasis on lending to \nmiddle-income countries. Middle-income countries that receive the vast \nmajority of World Bank financing include nations such as China and \nBrazil.\n  While Sara Aviel agrees that middle-income countries are able to \nborrow on international capital markets at commercial rates, she \nbelieves the World Bank should continue its lending to these countries. \nI disagree with her support of this policy.\n  The World Bank should be aggressively working towards the graduation \nof middle-income countries from borrowers to donors. The resources of \nthe World Bank should be directed at helping the poorest of countries \neradicate poverty and implement successful economic development \nprojects. Their primary focus should be on assisting countries that \ncannot access international capital markets at commercial rates, not \nfinancing middle-income\n\n[[Page S3653]]\n\ncountries that can tap other financing resources.\n  The World Bank is at a critical juncture. The Bank needs to pursue \nserious reforms, especially in the areas of corruption and \ntransparency. It must not be used to push social agendas and political \npriorities to the detriment of poor nations, or to use donor funds in a \nmanner that is not cost-effective. The United States representative \nmust be a strong advocate for reform and accountability.

I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to consideration \nof Calendar No. 412, S. 414.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n  A bill (S. 414) to protect girls in developing countries through the \nprevention of child marriage, and for other purposes.\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to urge that the Senate pass \nS. 414, the ``Protecting Girls by Preventing Child Marriage Act.'' As \nthe Senate prepares to approve this bipartisan measure, we should take \na moment to acknowledge and reflect upon the critical impact this \nlegislation will have on the estimated 100 million girls in developing \ncountries who are at risk of being married as children over the next \ndecade.\n  The harmful practice of forced child marriage often exacerbates \nsocial, economic, and political instability in the developing world, \nand can prohibit smooth economic and political transition.\n  For example, Afghanistan's high female illiteracy rates and maternal \nmortality rates are among the most significant obstacles standing in \nthe way of long-term progress and stability. Without ending child \nmarriage, which remains one of the many underlying catalysts of these \npoor outcomes, the road ahead for women in Afghanistan will be all the \nmore grueling. And women in Afghanistan are by no means alone in the \nstruggle the discriminatory norms that perpetuate child marriage also \nprohibit full participation of women in the economic and political life \nin many other regions of the world.\n  According to the United Nations Children's Fund--UNICEF--an estimated \n60,000,000 girls between the ages of 20 through 24 were married before \nthey turned 18. The Population Council estimates that the number will \nincrease by 100 million over the next decade if current trends \ncontinue. In addition to denying these tens of millions of women and \ngirls their dignity, child marriage continues to endanger their health. \nMarriage at an early age puts girls at greater risk of dying as a \nresult of childbirth. Pregnancy and childbirth complications are the \nleading cause of death for women 15 to 19 years old in most Third World \ncountries.\n  Furthermore, women and girls are the world's greatest untapped \nresources. Studies conducted by the Food and Agricultural \nOrganization--FAO--have confirmed that women are the main-stay of small \nscale agriculture, farm labor, and day-to-day family subsistence \naccounting for half of the world's food production.\n  However, child marriage continues to be a barrier to the improvement \nof society and the development of these young women. And, \nunfortunately, early marriages continue to pull girls out of school and \nprohibit them from gaining vital skills to engage in income generating \nactivities, actively participate in efforts to shape their communities, \nand often block their ability to achieve food security.\n  I am heartened to see the United States Senate affirm the United \nStates' commitment to promote the basic human rights of all individuals \nand through this small step improve the lives of millions of girls by \npassing this bill today.\n  Before closing, let me briefly commend my friend and colleague, \nSenator Durbin of Illinois. He has been a leader on this topic for a \nnumber of years and\n\n[[Page S3656]]\n\nI have been privileged to work with him on this bill. Once the Senate \ncompletes action on this bill, I hope that the U.S. House will able to \nquickly approve it and send it to the White House for signature by \nPresident Obama.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed \nto a voice vote on passage of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill (S. 414) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and \nwas read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The bill (S. 414) was passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 414\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``International Protecting \n     Girls by Preventing Child Marriage Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Child marriage, also known as ``forced marriage'' or \n     ``early marriage'', is a harmful traditional practice that \n     deprives girls of their dignity and human rights.\n       (2) Child marriage as a traditional practice, as well as \n     through coercion or force, is a violation of article 16 of \n     the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states, \n     ``Marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full \n     consent of intending spouses''.\n       (3) According to the United Nations Children's Fund \n     (UNICEF), an estimated 60,000,000 girls in developing \n     countries now ages 20 through 24 were married under the age \n     of 18, and if present trends continue more than 100,000,000 \n     more girls in developing countries will be married as \n     children over the next decade, according to the Population \n     Council.\n       (4) Between \\1/2\\ and \\3/4\\ of all girls are married before \n     the age of 18 in Niger, Chad, Mali, Bangladesh, Guinea, the \n     Central African Republic, Mozambique, Burkina Faso, and \n     Nepal, according to Demographic Health Survey data.\n       (5) Factors perpetuating child marriage include poverty, a \n     lack of educational or employment opportunities for girls, \n     parental concerns to ensure sexual relations within marriage, \n     the dowry system, and the perceived lack of value of girls.\n       (6) Child marriage has negative effects on the health of \n     girls, including significantly increased risk of maternal \n     death and morbidity, infant mortality and morbidity, \n     obstetric fistula, and sexually transmitted diseases, \n     including HIV/AIDS.\n       (7) According to the United States Agency for International \n     Development (USAID), increasing the age at first birth for a \n     woman will increase her chances of survival. Currently, \n     pregnancy and childbirth complications are the leading cause \n     of death for women 15 to 19 years old in developing \n     countries.\n       (8) Most countries with high rates of child marriage have a \n     legally established minimum age of marriage, yet child \n     marriage persists due to strong traditional norms and the \n     failure to enforce existing laws.\n       (9) Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has stated that \n     child marriage is ``a clear and unacceptable violation of \n     human rights'', and that ``the Department of State \n     categorically denounces all cases of child marriage as child \n     abuse''.\n       (10) According to an International Center for Research on \n     Women analysis of Demographic and Health Survey data, areas \n     or regions in developing countries in which 40 percent or \n     more of girls under the age of 18 are married are considered \n     high-prevalence areas for child marriage.\n       (11) Investments in girls' schooling, creating safe \n     community spaces for girls, and programs for skills building \n     for out-of-school girls are all effective and demonstrated \n     strategies for preventing child marriage and creating a \n     pathway to empower girls by addressing conditions of poverty, \n     low status, and norms that contribute to child marriage.\n\n     SEC. 3. CHILD MARRIAGE DEFINED.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``child marriage'' means the marriage \n     of a girl or boy, not yet the minimum age for marriage \n     stipulated in law in the country in which the girl or boy is \n     a resident or, where there is no such law, under the age of \n     18.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) child marriage is a violation of human rights, and the \n     prevention and elimination of child marriage should be a \n     foreign policy goal of the United States;\n       (2) the practice of child marriage undermines United States \n     investments in foreign assistance to promote education and \n     skills building for girls, reduce maternal and child \n     mortality, reduce maternal illness, halt the transmission of \n     HIV/AIDS, prevent gender-based violence, and reduce poverty; \n     and\n       (3) expanding educational opportunities for girls, economic \n     opportunities for women, and reducing maternal and child \n     mortality are critical to achieving the Millennium \n     Development Goals and the global health and development \n     objectives of the United States, including efforts to prevent \n     HIV/AIDS.\n\n     SEC. 5. STRATEGY TO PREVENT CHILD MARRIAGE IN DEVELOPING \n                   COUNTRIES.\n\n       (a) Assistance Authorized.--\n       (1) In general.--The President is authorized to provide \n     assistance, including through multilateral, nongovernmental, \n     and faith-based organizations, to prevent the incidence of \n     child marriage in developing countries through the promotion \n     of educational, health, economic, social, and legal \n     empowerment of girls and women.\n       (2) Priority.--In providing assistance authorized under \n     paragraph (1), the President shall give priority to--\n       (A) areas or regions in developing countries in which 40 \n     percent or more of girls under the age of 18 are married; and\n       (B) activities to--\n       (i) expand and replicate existing community-based programs \n     that are successful in preventing the incidence of child \n     marriage;\n       (ii) establish pilot projects to prevent child marriage; \n     and\n       (iii) share evaluations of successful programs, program \n     designs, experiences, and lessons.\n       (b) Strategy Required.--\n       (1) In general.--The President shall establish a multi-year \n     strategy to prevent child marriage and promote the \n     empowerment of girls at risk of child marriage in developing \n     countries, which should address the unique needs, \n     vulnerabilities, and potential of girls under age 18 in \n     developing countries.\n       (2) Consultation.--In establishing the strategy required by \n     paragraph (1), the President shall consult with Congress, \n     relevant Federal departments and agencies, multilateral \n     organizations, and representatives of civil society.\n       (3) Elements.--The strategy required by paragraph (1) \n     shall--\n       (A) focus on areas in developing countries with high \n     prevalence of child marriage;\n       (B) encompass diplomatic initiatives between the United \n     States and governments of developing countries, with \n     attention to human rights, legal reforms, and the rule of \n     law;\n       (C) encompass programmatic initiatives in the areas of \n     education, health, income generation, changing social norms, \n     human rights, and democracy building; and\n       (D) be submitted to Congress not later than one year after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than three years after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the President should submit to \n     Congress a report that includes--\n       (1) a description of the implementation of the strategy \n     required by subsection (b);\n       (2) examples of best practices or programs to prevent child \n     marriage in developing countries that could be replicated; \n     and\n       (3) an assessment, including data disaggregated by age and \n     sex to the extent possible, of current United States funded \n     efforts to specifically prevent child marriage in developing \n     countries.\n       (d) Coordination.--Assistance authorized under subsection \n     (a) shall be integrated with existing United States \n     development programs.\n       (e) Activities Supported.--Assistance authorized under \n     subsection (a) may be made available for activities in the \n     areas of education, health, income generation, agriculture \n     development, legal rights, democracy building, and human \n     rights, including--\n       (1) support for community-based activities that encourage \n     community members to address beliefs or practices that \n     promote child marriage and to educate parents, community \n     leaders, religious leaders, and adolescents of the health \n     risks associated with child marriage and the benefits for \n     adolescents, especially girls, of access to education, health \n     care, livelihood skills, microfinance, and savings programs;\n       (2) support for activities to educate girls in primary and \n     secondary school at the appropriate age and keeping them in \n     age-appropriate grade levels through adolescence;\n       (3) support for activities to reduce education fees and \n     enhance safe and supportive conditions in primary and \n     secondary schools to meet the needs of girls, including--\n       (A) access to water and suitable hygiene facilities, \n     including separate lavatories and latrines for girls;\n       (B) assignment of female teachers;\n       (C) safe routes to and from school; and\n       (D) eliminating sexual harassment and other forms of \n     violence and coercion;\n       (4) support for activities that allow adolescent girls to \n     access health care services and proper nutrition, which is \n     essential to both their school performance and their economic \n     productivity;\n       (5) assistance to train adolescent girls and their parents \n     in financial literacy and access economic opportunities, \n     including livelihood skills, savings, microfinance, and \n     small-enterprise development;\n       (6) support for education, including through community and \n     faith-based organizations and youth programs, that helps \n     remove gender stereotypes and the bias against girls used to \n     justify child marriage, especially efforts targeted at men \n     and boys, promotes zero tolerance for violence, and promotes \n     gender equality, which in turn help to increase the perceived \n     value of girls;\n       (7) assistance to create peer support and female mentoring \n     networks and safe social spaces specifically for girls; and\n       (8) support for local advocacy work to provide legal \n     literacy programs at the community level to ensure that \n     governments and\n\n[[Page S3657]]\n\n     law enforcement officials are meeting their obligations to \n     prevent child and forced marriage.\n\n     SEC. 6. RESEARCH AND DATA.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the President and all \n     relevant agencies should, as part of their ongoing research \n     and data collection activities--\n       (1) collect and make available data on the incidence of \n     child marriage in countries that receive foreign or \n     development assistance from the United States where the \n     practice of child marriage is prevalent; and\n       (2) collect and make available data on the impact of the \n     incidence of child marriage and the age at marriage on \n     progress in meeting key development goals.\n\n     SEC. 7. DEPARTMENT OF STATE'S COUNTRY REPORTS ON HUMAN RIGHTS \n                   PRACTICES.\n\n       The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended--\n       (1) in section 116 (22 U.S.C. 2151n), by adding at the end \n     the following new subsection:\n       ``(g) The report required by subsection (d) shall include, \n     for each country in which child marriage is prevalent, a \n     description of the status of the practice of child marriage \n     in such country. In this subsection, the term `child \n     marriage' means the marriage of a girl or boy, not yet the \n     minimum age for marriage stipulated in law or under the age \n     of 18 if no such law exists, in the country in which such \n     girl or boy is a resident.''; and\n       (2) in section 502B (22 U.S.C. 2304), by adding at the end \n     the following new subsection:\n       ``(j) The report required by subsection (b) shall include, \n     for each country in which child marriage is prevalent, a \n     description of the status of the practice of child marriage \n     in such country.

I now ask the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, \nthere be no intervening action or debate, and any statements related to \nthis measure be printed in the Record as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/24/senate-section/article/S3657-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3657-S3658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     AUTHORIZING THE ARCHITECT OF THE CAPITOL TO ESTABLISH BATTERY \n                          RECHARGING STATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 44, S. 739.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 739) to authorize the Architect of the Capitol \n     to establish battery recharging stations for privately owned \n     vehicles in parking areas under the jurisdiction of the \n     Senate at no net cost to the Federal Government.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to the bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate today is \npassing legislation that would allow the Senate to continue its \nleadership of our country toward a clean-energy future. This bill \nprovides the authority for the Architect of the Capitol to provide for \ncharging of batteries for privately owned vehicles in parking areas \nunder the jurisdiction of the Senate and, of great importance, at no \ncost to the Federal Government.\n  Plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles offer great potential in meeting \nour goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and auto manufacturers \nare moving toward developing a broad choice of electric-drive vehicles. \nBatteries and components are now being manufactured in the U.S., and we \nare developing the supply chain necessary to support these home-grown \ntechnologies. But in addition to making the vehicles and components \navailable, we also need to take steps to ensure the infrastructure \nexists to make these vehicles desirable and accessible to consumers. \nIncreased use of plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles will bring \nchanges in how we think about cars and driving. Instead of looking for \ngas stations, drivers will need to have places where they can replenish \nthe batteries that power their vehicles.\n  This bill will ensure that the Senate leads by example as we \ntransition to that cleaner-energy future. It will ensure that the \ncapability to charge plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles will exist in \nthe Senate--at no cost to the taxpayer. I am a proud owner of a \nChevrolet Volt, but I also want to ensure that the taxpayers do not \nsubsidize the cost of my or anyone else's use of electricity to power \nthese vehicles.\n  I appreciate the efforts and support of the cosponsors of this bill--\nSenators Alexander, Schumer, Kerry, Murkowski, Bingaman, Stabenow, and \nMerkley--and the great assistance of the staffs of Senators Schumer and \nAlexander on the Rules Committee in getting this bill passed. It has \nbeen our explicit intention to ensure there would be no cost to the \ntaxpayer in providing access to electricity for those wishing to charge \ntheir vehicle batteries in the parking areas of the Senate, but I am \npleased that we were able to include language to clarify any questions \nin that regard.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss S. 739, a bill \nwhich authorizes the Architect of the Capitol, AOC, at no cost to the \nFederal government, to create and install electric vehicle recharging \nstations in Senate parking facilities.\n  This bill likely would have never seen the light of day it were it \nnot for the perseverance and hard work of my good friend Senator Levin. \nHe worked tirelessly to make this bill a reality, and I am so proud to \nstand with him. This bill was drafted with bipartisan support. Senator \nAlexander and I join Senators Kerry, Murkowski, Bingaman, Merkley and \nStabenow in supporting this bill sponsored by Senator Levin.\n  It bears repeating: This bill creates a program that will not cost \nthe Federal government one dime. S. 739 funds the installation and \nmaintenance of the charging stations by billing the individuals who use \nthe plug-in stations. S. 739 works on a simple premise: the more people \nwho drive electric cars on campus, the more plug-in stations the AOC \nwill install. S. 739 insures that the demand for plug-in stations will \nmatch the number of dues paying participants who fund the program.\n  This bill is needed as more and more people decide to buy electric \ncars. Currently, the Architect does not have the authority to install \nplug-in stations on the Capitol campus. This bill fixes that problem in \na smart, cost effective manner.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Levin \namendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate, and any statements related to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2155) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To improve oversight over the program and ensure no subsidy \n                 is received by Senators and employees)\n\n       On page 4, strike lines 14 through 19, and insert the \n     following:\n       (e) Reports.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the end of \n     each fiscal year, the Architect of the Capitol shall submit a \n     report on the financial administration and cost recovery of \n     activities under this section with respect to that fiscal \n     year to the Committee on Rules and Administration of the \n     Senate.\n       (2) Avoiding subsidy.--\n       (A) Determination.--Not later than 3 years after the date \n     of enactment of this Act and every 3 years thereafter, the \n     Architect of the Capitol shall submit a report to the \n     Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate \n     determining whether Senators and covered employees using \n     battery charging stations as authorized by this Act are \n     receiving a subsidy from the taxpayers.\n       (B) Modification of rates and fees.--If a determination is \n     made under subparagraph (A) that a subsidy is being received, \n     the Architect of the Capitol shall submit a plan to the \n     Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate on how to \n     update the program to ensure no subsidy is being received.
