Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes today to honor \nmy colleague, the senior Senator from New Mexico, Jeff Bingaman, as he \nretires from a long career of service to our country.\n  For 30 years Senator Bingaman has been a dedicated representative of \nthe people of New Mexico, but for 26 of those years he was the junior \nSenator from New Mexico. The only person I know of who was a junior \nSenator longer than Senator Bingaman was Fritz Hollings. He was a \njunior Senator for many decades to Strom Thurmond. But 26 years as a \njunior Senator still makes you a fairly senior Senator. Jeff served \nalongside Senator Pete Domenici, the longest serving Senator in New \nMexico's history. Until 2009 he was the most senior junior Senator.\n  Jeff Bingaman has never been one to get hung up on titles and \ncredits. If there was ever a conscience of this body, it is Jeff \nBingaman, a man who has been called by others, including Byron Dorgan, \na workhorse. That is really true. For three decades he has quietly but \ndiligently fought for the people of New Mexico and this country.\n  American industrialist Henry Kaiser once gave this bit of advice: \n``When your work speaks for itself, don't interrupt.'' And that is Jeff \nBingaman. That could have been written for Jeff Bingaman by Henry \nKaiser. That has been Jeff Bingaman's motto for years. He is not one \nfor flashy press conferences. Most of the time he is too busy.\n  Jeff learned humility in the small town of Silver City, NM, where he \ngrew up. His father was a professor and his\n\n[[Page S8236]]\n\nmom a teacher, and they instilled in him a love and appreciation for \neducation--and that is an understatement. He got his bachelor's degree \nfrom Harvard and his law degree from Stanford. Those are two of the \nfinest educational institutions in the world, and he has a degree from \nboth of them, Harvard and Stanford.\n  At Stanford, where he was going to law school, he met his wonderful \nwife Anne. I have such warmth for this woman. We have traveled \ntogether. I can remember trips we took on Senate codels; she was always \nthe life of the party. She is a great match for Jeff--Jeff being quiet, \nsubdued; Anne, not always so. I love them both. Anne is a political \npowerhouse in her own right. She served 3 years as head of the \nAntitrust Division of the Department of Justice under President Bill \nClinton.\n  After they finished their law degrees, Jeff and Anne returned to New \nMexico, and they both entered the private practice of law. There, Jeff \nspent 6 years in the Army Reserve, and at that time he and Anne had \ntheir son John. Senator Bingaman served a year as assistant attorney \ngeneral before being elected attorney general of New Mexico in 1978. \nFour years later he was elected to the U.S. Senate.\n  As time evolves here, you see it in the face of our children. I can \nremember that when I first came to this body, Jeff had already been \nhere 4 years. We had our Senate retreats, and there was little John, \nand I watched him grow as we did the retreats. I saw him just a short \ntime ago, this handsome young man, now working on his own in New York \nin a very important job.\n  In addition to being a committed advocate for the people of New \nMexico, Jeff has been a distinguished chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee. As chairman, he has pushed for solutions \nto perhaps the greatest crisis of our time: global climate change. He \nhas run into brick walls many times. As the Presiding Officer knows, it \nhas been difficult to get much done. But it is not because Jeff \nBingaman hasn't tried. I am so disappointed that Jeff is leaving that \ncommittee with so much unfinished work. Certain Senators have held up \nhundreds of bills in that committee. What a shame. But that is what has \nhappened.\n  The Energy Policy Act of 2005--passed thanks to Senator Bingaman's \nleadership--changed the Federal Government's role in energy policy. It \ncreated energy efficiency and renewable tax credits that have grown the \ncrucial green energy industry. He led that charge. Two years later Jeff \nguided Congress to raise vehicle fuel efficiency standards for the \nfirst time in 32 years.\n  Senator Bingaman also serves on the Finance Committee. He is tireless \nthere, whether working on ObamaCare--and he was instrumental in the \nprogress of that, working with Senator Baucus, Senator Conrad, and \nothers. He has also served on the Joint Economic Committee. He has been \na valued Democratic Member of this body. In the caucus, he has been \nterrific.\n  He has been someone I can call upon to ask for advice. Over the years \nwe have served together, he didn't come and visit with me often, but \nwhen Jeff Bingaman wanted to see me, I knew immediately that he had \nthought through and knew what he wanted to talk about and knew what he \nwanted me to help him with. I think so much of him, I admire him, and I \nappreciate him. I will always remember this good man and the work he \nhas done. I am sorry to see this brilliant, hard-working leader depart \nthis body.\n  When Jeff announced his retirement a couple years ago, this is what \nhe said:\n\n       It is not easy to get elected to the Senate, and it is not \n     easy to decide to leave the Senate. There is important work \n     that remains to be done. That is true today, and it will be \n     the case at the end of this Congress. It will be true at the \n     end of every future Congress as well.\n\n  Again, he hit the mark: There is plenty of important work left to be \ndone. I am only sorry he won't be here to help us do that work.\n  I congratulate Senator Bingaman and his wife Anne on their long, \nproductive careers. I wish them the very best in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/20/senate-section/article/S8236-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to start out today with a little \ncontext.\n  For more than a year, President Obama and Democrats in Congress have \nknown, as well as I have, that every single taxpayer is scheduled to \nget slammed with an automatic tax hike on January 1, and for an entire \nyear, they have been running out the clock.\n  Think about it. For President Obama, there is no better outcome than \nfor taxes to go up on absolutely everybody. Why do I say that? Why does \nthe President want taxes to go up on absolutely everybody? Because, \nfrankly, that is the only way to pay for the big government this \nPresident wants. You have to raise taxes on everybody--the super-rich, \nthe rich, the middle class, the lower class--you name it. Everybody has \nto have a tax increase because if all you do is whack the so-called \nrich, you only get enough money for about a week of government. If all \nyou do is whack the super-rich, you only get enough money for about a \nweek of government. So let's be clear about this matter. He wants to \nsoak everybody, and there is only one way to do it, and that is exactly \nwhat he gets if we do nothing.\n  If that wasn't obvious before this week, it should be perfectly \nobvious now. Here we are less than a week before Christmas, and what is \nthe President doing? What is his quarterback here in the Senate, the \nmajority leader, doing? They have been playing Lucy and the football \nwith the American people for months. They have said no to every single \nproposal that has been offered to avoid this tax hike, including their \nown. They are running out the clock, moving the goalposts, sitting on \ntheir hands. They aren't doing anything.\n  Well, I say enough. Enough. The time for games is over. The President \nmay want to soak the American people to fund his vision of a social \nwelfare state, but we are not going to let him do it.\n  Later today Republicans in the House will pass a bill that protects \nmore than 99 percent--99 percent--of Americans from the tax hike \nDemocrats want to slap them with within 2 weeks. The House bill will \nprotect 99 percent of America's taxpayers from the tax hike that is \ncoming in 2 weeks.\n  As I have said endlessly, we don't want to see taxes go up on anybody \nor anything. The problem isn't that government taxes too little, it is \nthat it spends too much. The problem isn't that government taxes too \nlittle, it is that it spends too much.\n  But the President is determined to leap off the cliff. Well, we are \nnot going to let him take the middle class with him. We are going to do \neverything we can to protect the American people from this scheme.\n  There is no reason in the world that Democrats actually shouldn't \njoin us. I have literally a book of quotes from Democrats saying they \nwant to protect the middle class.\n  It was the theme of the recently completed campaign. Well, here is \nyour chance. We are at the end of the line. We have one chance to put \nyour money where your mouth is and that is by voting on the bill the \nHouse sends over later today.\n  It will be, obviously, up to the majority leader to act. Will the \nmajority leader act to protect the American taxpayers? Will he sit on \nhis hands and do absolutely nothing? Will the Senate just sit back and \nwatch the tax rates go up or will the Senate act? Enough is enough. \nLet's get this done. Let's show the American people we are working on \ntheir behalf. It is time to act to prevent this tax increase on 99 \npercent of America's taxpayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/20/senate-section/article/S8236-3", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, with the retirement of Senator Ben Nelson \nat the close of the 112th Congress, the Senate will lose one of its \nmost respected members, and a distinguished career in formal public \nservice will come to an end. I use that adjective ``formal,'' because \nit's hard to imagine Ben Nelson not finding new avenues for public \nservice as a private citizen in the years ahead.\n  Senator Nelson and I come from neighboring States in the rural, upper \nMidwest, and we have much in common. But we differ in at least one \nrespect: I come from the small town of Cumming, IA, population 351; Ben \ncomes from the big city, McCook, NE, population 8,000.\n  Senator Nelson is often described as one of the most conservative \nDemocrats in the Senate, frequently voting with the minority party. I \nprefer to describe him simply as the most independent Democrat in the \nSenate, a progressive at heart who--like so many from our part of the \ncountry--is also deeply imbued with respect for traditional values and \nfiscal prudence.\n  As we all know, Senator Nelson prides himself on reaching across the \naisle to get things done. He is a pragmatist, not a partisan. He has \nnever allowed ideology or party to stand in his way of doing what he \nbelieves is right for Nebraska and the United States of America.\n  As my colleague on the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry, Senator Nelson has been a passionate advocate for family \nfarms and rural America, and he has been a leading advocate for \nincreasing the use of clean, renewable biofuels in order to decrease \nour Nation's dependence on foreign energy sources.\n  As a member of both the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee \non Veterans Affairs, no one has been a stronger supporter of both \nactive duty and retired servicemembers.\n  Ben Nelson has been a successful CEO of an insurance company, a \npopular two-term governor of Nebraska, and, for the last 12 years, an \naccomplished and effective United States Senator. He has been a \nwonderful hunting colleague of mine on more than one occasion.\n  Our friendship, of course, will continue. And I wish Ben and Diane \nthe very best in the years ahead.\n\n\n                                Jim Webb\n\n  Mr. President, in these final days of the 112th Congress, the Senate \nis bidding farewell to a very special member, the junior Senator from \nVirginia, Senator Jim Webb.\n  He came to this body with unique and extraordinary credentials: a \ngraduate of the Naval Academy and first in his class of 243 at the \nMarine Corps officer school at Quantico, a much-decorated combat \nveteran of the Vietnam War, and Secretary of the Navy during the Reagan \nadministration.\n  I would point out one more of his sterling credentials. I guess I can \nsay this now, because he is retiring, and a political opponent will not \nuse it against him: Jim Webb is an intellectual with a passion for \nideas and knowledge. For goodness sake, he writes books, excellent \nbooks, the kind that win glowing reviews in the New York Times, and get \nturned into documentaries on the Smithsonian Channel.\n  Senator Webb has put this past experience to superb use here in the \nSenate as an active member of the Committee on Armed Services, the \nCommittee on Veterans Affairs, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs.\n  To his great credit, before coming to the Senate, he was an outspoken \ncritic of the invasion of Iraq, warning that it would be a unilateral \nwar with no exit strategy. After the invasion, he was equally outspoken \nin challenging the Bush administration's conduct of that war.\n  At the same time, as a member of the Committee on Veterans Affairs, \nhe worked hard to pass legislation to provide enhanced education \nbenefits for veterans, a 21st century GI Bill, for those who have \nserved in the military since the attacks of 9/11.\n  I admire Jim Webb as a friend and colleague. I have the greatest \nrespect for his life-long commitment to protecting America's national \nsecurity, and fighting for economic and social justice here at home. \nThere is no question in my mind that Jim will find other avenues for \npublic service in the years ahead. I certainly wish Jim and Hong Le all \nthe best in the years ahead.\n\n\n                             joe lieberman\n\n  Mr. President, with the close of the 112th Congress, our friend and \ncolleague Senator Joe Lieberman is retiring after nearly a quarter \ncentury of dedicated service in this body to the people of Connecticut \nand the United States.\n  As we all know, Senator Lieberman is a fiercely independent Senator \nwho prides himself on speaking his conscience and reaching across party \nlines in order to get things done. He is a pragmatist, not a partisan. \nYet he has never allowed his ideology or his party or what is popular \nto stand in the way of doing what he believes is right for Connecticut \nand the United States of America.\n  In the years since Senator Lieberman left the Democratic Party to \nbecome an independent, he has sometimes disagreed with his colleagues \non this side of the aisle, but he has never been disagreeable. To the \ncontrary, he has been unfailingly decent, gracious, and reasoned. He \nhas been unfailingly a gentleman and a friend, a person with a great \nsense of humor and always has a smile. It is these sterling personal \nqualities that are a big reason he will be greatly missed by Senators \non both sides of the aisle.\n  During his four terms in this body, Senator Lieberman has earned a \nreputation as one of the Senate's most influential and knowledgeable \nvoices on interests of national security. In the wake of the attacks of \n9/11, he was the lead sponsor of the bill to establish the Department \nof Homeland Security. As chairman of Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs, Senator Lieberman has been a vigilant leader in safeguarding \nAmerica.\n  Throughout his distinguished tenure in this body--and before that as \na Connecticut State senator and attorney general--Joe Lieberman has \nbeen a proud and principled progressive with a passion for social and \neconomic justice for all Americans.\n  To cite just one example: Senator Lieberman deserves enormous credit \nfor introducing and successfully championing legislation to repeal the \nmilitary's discriminatory don't ask, don't tell policy, which banned \npatriotic gay and lesbian Americans from serving openly in our Armed \nForces.\n  As we all know, Joe Lieberman is a person of deep faith, a faith that \ninspires him to public service and informs his progressive vision for \nAmerica. Last January, when he announced his decision to retire, he \nsaid:\n\n       I go forward with a tremendous sense of gratitude for the \n     opportunities I have had to make a difference.\n\n\n[[Page S8238]]\n\n\n  With Senator Lieberman's retirement in the days ahead, a truly \ndistinguished career in formal public service will come to an end. I \nuse the adjective formal because it is hard to imagine that Joe \nLieberman will not be finding new avenues for public service as a \nprivate citizen.\n  Senator Lieberman's career in this body will end, but our friendship \nwill continue. I know that his smile and his gracious unfailingly \ngentlemenly ways will also continue. I wish Joe and Hadassah much \nhappiness in the years ahead.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. First, I want to thank my colleague and \nneighbor Senator Harkin for his timely remarks, and particularly for \nnoting that we have been hunting partners. As a matter of fact, that \nhas been in the news today. Not only has Senator Harkin noted our \nexploits together, but in this morning's Washington Post the senior \nSenator from New York noted that I have taken him pheasant hunting in \nNebraska as well. I am going to be known not only for my hair but \nperhaps for hunting as well, so I appreciate that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Of course.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator has been a great friend. I enjoyed hunting \nwith my friend before, and I read that in the paper before about \nSenator Schumer going out.\n  Here is a real test for my friend from Nebraska: Aren't I a better \nshot than Chuck Schumer?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. He noted that he learned to shoot at camp and \nthat he was a marksman, so that is probably a dispute I should not get \nin the middle of.\n  Mr. HARKIN. No, the Senator doesn't want to get in the middle of \nthat.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I thank the Senator very much for his kind \nremarks.\n  It is, obviously, a difficult time to speak about leaving the Senate, \nand I did that earlier. I leave with a great deal of melancholy and \nwith a lot of friends and a lot of hope for the future of our country.\n\n\n                               Dan Inouye\n\n  I rise today to express my support for passage of a 5-year farm bill \nand call on the House to act on this critical piece of legislation \nbefore Congress adjourns this year.\n  However, first I would like to briefly note how sorry I am at this \nmoment--as I know we all are--about the passing of our good friend, \nSenator Dan Inouye. I would like to briefly reiterate the sentiments \nexpressed by a number of my colleagues.\n  Senator Inouye was a man of courage and wisdom. He represented his \nState and country proudly. He will be sincerely missed.\n  As everyone knows, today Senator Inouye lies in state just a few \nsteps away from this Chamber. It is an honor the very few--only 31--\nhave ever received. I feel privileged to have had the opportunity to \nserve with the Senator. I thank him for his friendship and guidance and \noffer the most sincere condolences to his family.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  I appreciate the opportunity to make those remarks, and I would now \nlike to turn to the farm bill, which is a critical piece of legislation \nin the Senate. We produced a bipartisan bill that cuts spending by $23 \nbillion. Agriculture represents 2 percent of the Nation's budget, and \n$23 billion represents 2 percent of the spending cuts proposed in the \ndeficit legislation Congress worked on last year but could not pass \nbecause of extreme partisanship.\n  As we work in these final days to reach a deal on how best to reduce \nspending in government and set a trajectory for the future, I am \ndisappointed that the House was unable, or perhaps unwilling, to follow \nthe example the Senate has given. By moving forward in passing a farm \nbill, we would save money, create a market-oriented safety net, \neliminate direct farm subsidy payments, streamline, simplify, and \nconsolidate programs. It would also create jobs our economy needs to \ngrow.\n  I am disappointed this is not moving forward. The House's inaction is \ncausing a continuing uncertainty for our Nation's producers as they \nbegin to plan for the next planting year. It also affects our financial \ninstitutions which provide lending for our farmers, ranchers, and \nsmall-town rural businesses that benefit from the commerce provided by \na strong agricultural economy.\n  Unfortunately, this comes at a time when farms throughout the entire \nState of Nebraska and across the country are also dealing with the \nworst drought conditions since the 1930s. The Senate farm bill \naddresses this crisis through the elimination of subsidies, replacing \nthem with the Agriculture Risk Coverage, or what is known as the ARC, \nProgram. It is a program that provides producers with a market-\noriented, straightforward choice to determine how best to manage their \noperations risks. The safety net is then bolstered by expanded access \nto profit shares, which serves as the focal point of risk management \nand will ensure that farmers are not wiped out by severe weather or \neconomic conditions.\n  The Senate farm bill also reauthorizes the 2008 farm bill permanent \ndisaster relief programs and makes them retroactive to cover producers \nharmed by the 2012 drought. This includes the Livestock Forage Disaster \nProgram, which provides compensation for the eligible livestock \nproducers who have suffered in critical places such as Nebraska which \nhas been hard hit by the drought and wildfires this summer, not to \nmention the continuing drought at this time.\n  I could go on regarding all the major reforms and improvements that \nthe Senate farm bill makes to conservation, rural development, \nrenewable fuels, in addition to the reforms of the commodities and \nlivestock programs. However, without the House acting on any farm bill \nlegislation--let alone the Senate bill which is a solid reform-minded \nbill, which strikes the right balance between the need to cut spending \nwhile maintaining a strong safety net--it will all be for naught. It is \ndisappointing that jobs and our Nation's stable supply of food, feed, \nfuel, and fiber continues to be put at risk because of inactions \nspurred on by partisan gamesmanship.\n  As we seek to find commonsense solutions to the fiscal and \nlegislative challenges before us in Congress, I urge the House to now \nact on the 5-year farm bill. It will help us achieve savings, bring \nneeded reforms to commodity programs, and provide our Nation's farmers, \nranchers, and rural communities the certainty they need to continue to \nbe the world leader in agricultural production.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/20/senate-section/article/S8238-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8238-S8251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAREWELL TO THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I would like to give my farewell address. \nWe spent a lot of time in my office writing out a long speech. However, \nonce I read it, I realized it is more emotional than I thought, and we \nset that speech aside. Last night I made a lot of notes of what I \nwanted to say, and then I realized this morning that I was just trying \nto get the last word on a lot of the politics we have been discussing, \nso I set that aside and decided to speak from my heart.\n  Certainly, this is much more emotional than I thought, and as I look \naround this room, the realization that I am standing on the Senate \nfloor speaking for the last time is a lot to digest. It makes me very \nappreciative of the privilege we have all been given by the American \npeople, and particularly those who have come before us and who have \ngiven their lives for us to have the opportunity to settle our \ndifferences in a civil and democratic way. This is a great opportunity \nand privilege to share a few thoughts before I go on to the next phase \nof my life.\n\n[[Page S8239]]\n\n  First, I have to give a particular thanks to my wife Debbie, who, for \nthe last 15 years, has spent many days and nights alone as I have tried \nto change things in Washington. She has often reminded and questioned \nme how I thought I could change the world when I could not even mow the \ngrass. But she has been a supporter and certainly so important as I \nleft my children, who were still in school when I began serving in the \nHouse, keeping them on the right track. I particularly wanted to thank \nthem.\n  All of those who serve here know that when we sign up for public \nlife, we also sign our families up for public life. In a lot of ways it \nmakes their lives much more difficult. So I want to thank my children, \nmy wife Debbie, and my family for putting up with this and being so \nsupportive of me.\n  I also have to thank the people of South Carolina who have entrusted \nme with this job in the Senate for the last 8 years, and in the House 6 \nyears before that. All of us who serve our States know that as we \ntravel around and meet people and tour businesses and speak to groups, \nit creates a deep love and appreciation for everyone back home.\n  I look at what we are making in South Carolina in these small \nbusinesses. When we drive by we don't know anything is even there, and \nthen we go and find that they are making things and shipping them all \nover the world. It makes me very proud of what we are doing in South \nCarolina, and I know everyone here feels the same way about their \nStates.\n  I am very appreciative that the people of South Carolina have given \nme this opportunity. I am very grateful to my colleagues whom I have \noften scrapped with on a lot of issues. I appreciate their patience. I \nthink I can leave claiming to have good friends who are Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  I am particularly grateful for a lot of the new Senators. Some are \nsitting here today. I have had the opportunity to work with the folks \nin their States around the country. Their respective States have \nelected some new people to the Senate who are bringing the right ideas \nand some new voices to those principles that we know have made our \ncountry successful. So I feel as I leave the Senate, it is better than \nI found it, and that our focus now, despite the difficult challenges, \nis on America and how we turn America around.\n  I also want to spend some time thanking my staff. I have to say my \ngreatest inspirations have come from the staff who I have had the \nopportunity to serve with in the House and in the Senate. As all of my \ncolleagues know who are serving here in the Senate, this country is \nbeing run by people in their twenties and thirties who get us so busy \nthey have to follow us to meetings to tell us where we are going and \nwhat we will be talking about. But it is incredible to see that these \nyoung people, particularly those whom I have served with, have such a \npassion for our country and freedom and they are willing to put it all \non the line to make a difference here. They feel a lot like my family, \nand I am certainly going to miss them, but it is encouraging to watch \nthem moving to other office, taking their ideas and that courage to \nother places on the Hill.\n  I want to add my thanks to all the Hill staff, the folks sitting in \nthe front here and those who have worked with us. I know sometimes we \nhave pushed the envelope a little bit on things we were trying to get \ndone, and I have seen a lot of very intelligent, active, and engaged \nstaff all across the Hill, both Democrat and Republican, and I am very \nthankful for what they do.\n  About 15 years ago, I started campaigning for the House. I had never \nrun for public office. At that time, I believed--and I think it still \nholds true today--that there were normal people such as myself and then \nthere were politicians. I was a businessman. I had a small business for \nabout 15 years. I had four children. I was active in my church and in \nthe community. I had begun to see that well-motivated, well-intended \ngovernment policies were making it harder for us to do the things at \nthe community level we know actually worked. That is what I have always \nbeen about here. It really was not about politics. I had no strong \npolitical affiliation before I decided to run for office, but I saw \nideas from the time I was a young person. Ideas that worked.\n  I actually saw this statement the other day which I wish to read \nbecause it reflects what I think a lot of us know works in our country. \nThis is one thing I will try to read today:\n\n       I do not choose to be a common man. It is my right to be \n     uncommon. If I can seek opportunity, not security, I want to \n     take the calculated risk to dream and to build, to fail and \n     to succeed. I refuse to barter incentive for dole. I prefer \n     the challenges of life to guaranteed security, the thrill of \n     fulfillment to the state of calm utopia. I will not trade \n     freedom for beneficence, nor my dignity for a handout. I will \n     never cower before any master, save my God. It is my heritage \n     to stand erect, proud, and unafraid, to think and act for \n     myself, enjoy the benefit of my creations, to face the whole \n     world boldly and say, ``I am a free American.''\n\n  I saw this on a plaque called ``The American Creed.'' In South \nCarolina, at least, we have adopted this as what we call ``The \nRepublican Creed.'' But it is really not a Republican idea or a \npolitical idea, it is an American idea. The ideas in this statement are \nideas we all know work, and ideas we would hope for our children and \neveryone around us. We know there are people all around us who are \nhaving difficulty, but this idea of helping them to become independent, \nself-sufficient, and responsible creates the dignity and fulfillment in \ntheir life that we know we want for all Americans. This is not for a \nsmall few. This is an American idea, and it is an idea I know has \nworked in my life, and I have seen it work all around me.\n  That is what I wish to talk about for a second today; not political \nideas but ideas where we can look back through history and all around \nus today and point to them and say, That is working. I think if we did \nthat more here in the political sphere, we might find a lot more \nconsensus.\n  As we look around the country today, we can see a lot of things that \nare working. Sometimes we couch them in our political rhetoric, but I \ncan guarantee my colleagues they are not being done for political \nreasons at the State level; they are being done because they work and \nthey have to get things to work at the State level.\n  We saw last week the State of Michigan adopted a new law that gave \nworkers the freedom not to join a union. They didn't do it because it \nwas politically expedient or because they thought it was a good idea. \nActually, it probably will get a lot of the politicians in hot water in \nMichigan. But what they did is looked at 23 other States that had \nadopted the same idea and saw they were attracting businesses and \ncreating jobs, and these States, without raising taxes, had more \nrevenue to build schools and roads and hospitals. It is just an idea \nthat worked. It is not a political idea to give people the freedom not \nto join a union; it is an American idea and it is an idea that works.\n  We can look around the country today--and, again, we make these \nthings political and give them labels that are good or bad, depending \non I guess which party one belongs to--and see that a number of States \nhave been very innovative and creative with what they are doing with \neducation. We see what they have done in Florida, creating more \nchoices, and in Louisiana particularly, forced by Hurricane Katrina to \nstart a new system, in effect. They see more choices and opportunities \nfor parents to choose are helping low-income, at-risk kids, minority \nkids. We can see it working. It is not political. It is an American \nidea to give parents more choices to put their children in an \nenvironment where they can succeed. It is an idea that works.\n  We can look around the country at States that try to create a more \nbusiness-friendly environment not because they are for businesses or \nfor any political reason, or they are for special interests, but \nbecause they know the only way to get jobs and prosperity and create \nopportunity is to create an environment where businesses can thrive. We \nmake it political here and we ask our constituents to make choices \nbetween employers and employees, but States such as Texas have created \na business-friendly environment with lower taxes and less regulation. \nThey have passed some laws that reduce the risk of frivolous lawsuits. \nWhat they have seen is businesses moving to their State. They have seen \njobs and opportunity created not for the top 2 percent but expanding a \nmiddle class, creating\n\n[[Page S8240]]\n\nmore opportunities and more tax revenues to do the things at the State \ngovernment level that we all want for everyone who lives there. This is \nnot for a few; this is for 100 percent.\n  We see specials now on TV comparing California and Texas, businesses \nmoving out and delegations from California going to Texas to try to \nfigure out why businesses are moving and families are moving there. It \nis not political at all. We make it political and we talk about it in \npolitical terms, but creating an environment where businesses can \nthrive is an American idea and it is an idea that is working. We see it \nall over the country, where some States are going down one road, with \nhigher taxes, bigger government, and more spending, and they are losing \nto States such as Texas, and I hope more and more like South Carolina. \nThey are moving to where they can thrive. This benefits every American.\n  We look at energy development and we talk about that at the national \nlevel of how it can create prosperity for our country if we open it up. \nWe don't have to guess at whether it works. We can look at North \nDakota, we can look at Pennsylvania--States that have gone around the \nFederal rules and figured out how to develop their own energy and are \ncreating jobs and tax revenue for their governments. They are able to \nlower their taxes and use the revenue to improve everything about their \nStates. Here we make it political and partisan, whether our country can \ndevelop more energy, but at the State level it is about what works. All \nwe have to do is look at what works.\n  This is not rocket science. I came to Washington as a novice in \npolitics, believing in the power of ideas, seeing how ideas could \nrevolutionize different industries, can create new products and \nservices, meeting the needs of customers everywhere. That is what I \nhoped we could do here in Washington. Maybe naively, I went to work in \nthe House, often working with the Heritage Foundation, to create a \nbetter product here in Washington. I saw Social Security--and not too \nmany people look below the surface--but we knew it was going broke. We \nknew people were paying for this Social Security retirement benefit, \nbut we were spending it all. I thought, What an opportunity it would be \nfor future generations--for my children--if we actually saved what \npeople were putting into Social Security for their retirement, and we \ndidn't have to do too much math to see that even for middle-class \nworkers, Americans could be millionaires when they retired if we even \nkept half of what was put into Social Security for them. It seemed like \na good idea to create wealth and independence for individuals in \nretirement, but we made it a political idea and somehow convinced \nAmericans it was riskier to save their Social Security contribution \nthan it was to spend it.\n  I am leaving the Senate to work on ideas I know work. I have seen \nthem work all over our country. We can look all over our country and \nshowcase these ideas that are working. I know there is power in ideas. \nHowever, I have learned one thing about the political environment: \nUnless there is power behind the ideas, they will not emerge here in \nthe Congress. There is too much pressure from the outside to maintain \nthe status quo. No matter how much we show it is working, it won't be \nadopted here unless we are able to win the argument with the American \npeople.\n  I spent most of my life in research and advertising and marketing and \nstrategic planning. What I hope I can do from this point is to take \nthese ideas and policies I know work--and the Heritage Foundation for \n40 years has been creating the research and analyses that show these \npolicies work--and what I hope I can do is to help connect those ideas \nwith real people, real faces, and to show these people that these ideas \nare not theory, they are not political policies, but they are ideas \nthat are working right in their State or the State right next to them. \nIf we can win the arguments, if we can win the hearts and the minds of \nthe American people with these ideas, I know we can engage them and \nenlist them to convince all of my colleagues here to set the politics \naside, the parties aside, and to adopt those ideas that work. My hope \nis to make conservative ideas so pervasive, so persuasive across the \ncountry that politicians of all parties have to embrace those ideas to \nbe elected.\n  I am not leaving to be an advocate for the Republican Party. I hope \nwe can create more common ground between the political parties by \nshowing everyone that ideas that work for their constituents and our \nconstituents are right in front of our faces if we are willing to set \naside the pressure groups, the special interests, and just focus on \nwhat is working.\n  Over the next few years, we are going to see more and more States \ndoing the right things, becoming more prosperous, creating a better \nenvironment for people to live and work. We are going to see some \nStates that will continue to raise taxes, to create more regulations, \nand make it harder to start businesses and be profitable in those \nStates. They will continue to lose businesses and people. Many of those \nStates will come to Washington and ask us to help them out from their \nbad decisions.\n  I hope at that point we can show, by pointing at these States and \ntheir right ideas, that we know the solutions at the State level and we \nalso know we can change how we think at the Federal level and make our \ncountry work a lot better.\n  I leave with a lot of respect for my colleagues. I know my Democratic \ncolleagues believe with conviction their ideas, and I know my \nRepublican colleagues do too. But I hope we can look at the facts. I \nhope we can look at the real world. I hope we can look at what is \nworking and set aside the politics and realize what makes the country \ngreat and strong is when we move dollars and decisions out of \nWashington back to people and communities and States, it works not for \n2 percent but for 100 percent of Americans.\n  I feel our customers in the Senate, at the Heritage Foundation or \nwherever we go are 100 percent of Americans for whom these ideas can \nwork to build a better future and a stronger America. I am not leaving \nthe fight. I hope to raise my game in my next phase, and I hope I can \nwork more closely with all of you, as well as Governors and State \nlegislators, to take these ideas and to convince Americans, as well as \ntheir legislators, their Senators, and their Congressmen, that we have \nthe solutions all around us if we have the courage to adopt them.\n  I thank you for this opportunity to serve. Certainly, I will miss my \nrelationships. But I hope we will have the opportunity to continue to \nwork together for what is the greatest country in the world, in what I \nbelieve is a generation that could be the greatest and most prosperous \ngeneration of all if we just look to the ideas that work.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I thank my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Tributes to Departing Senators\n\n                             Joe Lieberman\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, one of the most overused quotes about \nthis town is Harry Truman's observation years ago that if you want a \nfriend in Washington, go out and get a dog. I have spent a good many \nyears here now. I suppose there is a little truth in that advice. Some \nWashington friendships are a little like temporary alliances between \nnations that for a brief period of time have mutual interests or \nenemies. But not all friendships here are like that, not all of them.\n  Today I say a formal fond farewell to a departing colleague whose \nfriendship has been and will always be one of the greatest treasures of \nmy life. My friend Senator Joe Lieberman is retiring from the Senate \nafter 24 years of service. Of course, he is not leaving, nor will he \never leave, the affections of those of us who have come to value him so \nhighly as a statesman and as a friend, but we will not see him around \nthe place as much.\n  His office will not be near ours. We will not hear him speak from \nthis floor\n\n[[Page S8241]]\n\nor in committee hearings. We will not have the daily benefit of his \ncounsel and his example. We will miss his contributions to the Senate. \nWe will miss his good humor, his wisdom, and sincerity, especially in \nthose moments when we find ourselves again wrapped around the axle of \npartisanship and politics has taken primacy over the Nation's \ninterests, when tempers are frayed and we are consumed with putting \neach other at a disadvantage. That is when we will miss him the most, \non those occasions when Joe's thoughtfulness and patriotism stirred him \nto remind us again, as he did earlier this week, that the public trust \nand not our party's fortunes is our most important responsibility.\n  Joe's presence, his wit and courtesy and kindness have improved the \nconviviality of our institution. But more than that, he has set an \nexample that I think our constituents surely wish more of us would \nemulate. It is his conscience and devotion to America, not his party \naffiliation, that has inspired his work.\n  He has been a very accomplished legislator and a recognized leader on \nnational security issues. He is a nationally prominent politician, \nmajority leader in his State senate, the attorney general of the State \nof Connecticut, elected to the Senate of the United States four times, \na vice presidential nominee in the year 2000, a candidate for \nPresident, and I should probably add nearly a nominee for vice \npresident again.\n  That he managed to achieve such prominence while being the least \npartisan politician I know is a credit to his character and to the \nexemplary quality of his public service and to the public's too often \nfrustrated desire for leaders who seek office to do something, not just \nto be someone.\n  He has been a tireless advocate for the rights of the oppressed, the \nmisfortunate, the disenfranchised, and tireless too in his concern for \nthe security of the United States, for the strength of our alliances, \nthe excellence of our Armed Forces, and the global progress of our \nvalues. He came here to do justice, to love mercy, and to walk humbly \nwith his God.\n  It is hard to find anyone here who does not like and admire Joe. He \nis impossible to dislike, even if one only knows him a little. Most of \nhis detractors seem to be people who do not know him and who tend to \nview people very strictly through the perspectives of their ideology \nand partisan identity. The only thing to resent about Joe Lieberman is \nthat he is so damn considerate of everyone that you can find yourself \nfeeling a little ashamed when he catches you raising your voice to \nsomeone or behaving in other ways that fall short of his unfailing \ngraciousness.\n  He is not an easy example to emulate. I have fallen short of his \nstandard more often than I care to concede. But I know, as I suspect \nmost of us know, that our constituents deserve and our country needs \nmore public officials who keep their priorities in the right order, as \nJoe always has, and who offer their respect for their colleagues \nwithout expecting anything in return but our respect.\n  We spent a lot of time together, Joe and I. We have traveled many \nthousands of miles together. We have attended scores of international \nconferences together, met with dozens of world leaders, with human \nrights activists, and the occasional autocrat. We have visited war \nzones, shared the extraordinary experience with equal parts gratitude \nand awe of talking with and hearing from the Americans who risk \neverything so the rest of us may be secure in our freedom.\n  I have been able to study Joe at close quarters. He has never failed \nto impress me as a dedicated public servant, a loyal friend, a \nconsiderate gentleman, a kind soul, and very good company. I have also \nbeen privileged to witness the sincerity of his faith. I have awaken in \nthe middle of the night on a long plane ride to find Joe in his prayer \nshawl, talking to the God he tries very hard to serve faithfully every \nday. I have witnessed the lengths he goes to always keep the Sabbath, \nand occasionally I have even filled in as his Shabbos goy. I have \nenjoyed every minute of our travels together. He is a quality human \nbeing, and time spent in his company is never wasted.\n  I have worked with Joe on many issues and opposed him on more than a \nfew. But I have always been just as impressed by him when we disagree \nas I am when we agree. He is always the same: good natured, gracious, \nand intent on doing his best by the people who sent him and the country \nhe loves.\n  He is leaving the Senate, and I am going to miss him a lot. But I \ndoubt any of the many friends he has made here will let him stray far \nfrom our attention. We will still rely on his wise counsel and warm \nfriendship. I know I will. I hope we are not done traveling together. I \nhope to see him in other conferences and meetings abroad. I want to go \nback on the road and learn from him and just pretend he has not left \nthe place that brought us together. He is as fine a friend as I have \never had and irreplaceable in my life and I cannot let him go.\n  Thank you, Joe, for all you have done for me; for your many \nkindnesses, your counsel, your company, and for teaching me how to be a \nbetter human being. I will see you again soon.\n  I yield the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                            The Fiscal Cliff\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, for the past several weeks I have come \nto the floor to talk about the fiscal cliff and the threat it poses to \nour economy and to our Nation. As the deadline nears, the fiscal cliff \nhas caused a lot of concern and a lot of uncertainty around the \ncountry. It appears that too many people in Washington are not serious \nabout real solutions to get us back on solid economic ground. The White \nHouse and Democrats in the Senate are still not focused on spending \ncuts. They continue ignoring the real drivers of Washington's debt.\n  We know what they are. They are out-of-control entitlement programs: \nSocial Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Until we find a way to save \nand strengthen these programs, no amount of tax revenue will be able to \nmatch the increases in entitlement spending. According to the latest \nnumbers from the Congressional Budget Office, the problem is actually \ngetting worse.\n  In its monthly budget review for December, the Congressional Budget \nOffice said the budget deficit for just the first 2 months of this \nfiscal year was already $292 billion. When we take a look at that and \ncompare this pace, we will record our fifth straight year of a \ntrillion-dollar deficit.\n  In just October and November alone, which are the first 2 months of \nthis fiscal year, we are already $300 billion in the red. Total outlays \nfor those 2 months were $638 billion. That is an increase of almost 4 \npercent over the same period 1 year ago. This increase in spending is \nmuch faster than the growth we are seeing in our economy. Defense \nspending is actually down about 2 percent from the first 2 months of \nlast year. That may be the lone bright spot in the CBO's number. The \nproblem is entitlement spending is growing even faster than the rest of \ngovernment.\n  Social Security spending is up 6.8 percent. Medicare is up 8.1 \npercent. Medicaid is up over 9 percent compared to last year. Those are \nhuge increases in just 1 year and they point straight to the problem we \nface. Those three programs by themselves account for 43 percent of all \nWashington spending for the first 2 months of this fiscal year.\n  Some Democrats say we cannot take steps to save and to protect these \nimportant programs for future generations. They say we cannot even \ndiscuss fixing this out-of-control spending as part of the fiscal cliff \nnegotiations. That is unrealistic, and it is unsustainable. Without \nreform, we are facing the kinds of increases we see on this chart but \ngetting worse next month and the month after that and then again \nbeyond.\n  Without reform, it will keep getting worse until we drive our economy \ninto the ground just trying to pay for these programs. There is a \npotential solution, and one potential solution or at least something \nthat would help would be to adjust how we calculate entitlement \nbenefits for inflation. As it stands now, the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics calculates two different versions of what is called the \nConsumer Price Index.\n  Both of these assume that a consumer buys a certain basket of goods \nand then they track the total cost of\n\n[[Page S8242]]\n\nthat basket. A family buys a certain amount of gasoline, so much milk, \nso many muffins to have for breakfast and so on. The first measure is \ncalled the CPI-U, and it is what we consider the headline measure. It \nis what we read in the papers. It looks like what all urban consumers \nspend on that market basket of goods. That is why they call it the CPI-\nU--U is for ``urban.'' It is a number we use to index the tax brackets \nfor inflation. That is how we decide what those brackets will be.\n  The second way they measure the CPI is called the CPI-W. That \nincludes urban wage earners. The W is for ``wage earners,'' not all \nconsumers. It also includes clerical workers and a few other \nprofessions. So it excludes anyone who is unemployed, retired, self-\nemployed, and many other occupations. This is what the government uses \nfor the cost-of-living adjustment to Federal benefits such as Social \nSecurity.\n  So we have one that they use to calculate the CPI for tax purposes \nand the tax brackets and the other, different, is what they use for \nSocial Security benefits. It is very complicated. Both these systems \nhave several problems. They both overestimate inflation. First, they \nassume consumers purchase the exact same basket of goods regardless of \nwhat happens to prices. So if the price of something such as muffins \ngoes up, the CPI does not account for some consumers who will switch to \ntoast or having something else for breakfast.\n  All American families understand that people change their behavior \nwhen prices change. Our understanding of inflation should take that \ninto account. Another problem is that these versions of CPI cannot \neasily deal with the introduction of new products into the market. So \nhow does something like the iPod affect consumer spending? How do we \naccount for that, when the iPod was not in the market basket of goods \nbefore.\n  At what point do we start including cell phone bills or Internet \naccess into a family's monthly expenses? It is not happening now. So we \nhave these two different ways to measure inflation. They both have \nmultiple flaws. As I have said, the flaws tend to overestimate the \ninflation people actually experience when they go to the store and they \npay their bills each month.\n  We can see how this could be a problem over time. When the government \nincreases what it pays based on an exaggerated inflation adjustment, \nthe impact continues to accelerate. If we give someone an extra dollar \nto make up for inflation but their expenses only went up 75 cents, \npretty soon all those quarters add up. It is bad fiscal policy and we \nactually cannot afford it anymore.\n  The cost-of-living adjustment should track, as closely as possible, \nto the actual cost of living. To address those flaws, what the Bureau \nof Labor Statistics has done is actually come up with a new and an \nimproved measure for inflation.\n  It is called chained CPI, and it accounts for those changes in \nconsumer choices and for new products and new technology.\n  If we use this version of CPI to adjust Federal benefits and tax \nbrackets, CBO estimates that we would actually reduce the deficit by \n$200 billion over the next 10 years--over $200 billion in the next 10 \nyears. That is the benefit of not overcompensating for inflation. The \nsavings would be small at first, but over time they would grow, until \n10 years from now we would have saved more than $200 billion. The \nsavings get even bigger beyond the 10 years shown here in the chart, \nand that is because of the impact of compounding.\n  Now, with budget deficits of $1 trillion and more this year, last \nyear, the year before, 5 years in a row, this one change to the \ninflation index--well, it won't wipe out the deficit on its own, but it \nis a start, and it is something we can do now that will pay big \ndividends down the road.\n  Of course, this isn't the only option. There are other ways to slow \nthe increase in Social Security and make sure it is still around to \ntake care of seniors in the future. We need to do something. Setting \nthe cost-of-living adjustment using chained CPI is worth considering.\n  Now, even some Democrats have been open to this idea. According to \nBob Woodward's book ``The Price of Politics,'' the White House was \nwilling to look at changing the CPI as part of the so-called grand \nbargain last year. The Simpson-Bowles Commission included it as one of \ntheir solutions. The President himself reportedly had a version of \nchained CPI in his latest offer on the fiscal cliff. That is progress. \nIt shows that some Democrats are open to serious ideas and real \nsolutions. Because we need to do something to relieve the burden of \nWashington's crushing debt, this is something to consider.\n  More revenue is going to have to be part of the solution, and \nRepublicans have said so. Substantial cuts in spending must be part of \nthe answer as well. Washington does not have a revenue problem, it has \na spending problem. That problem is centered on entitlement programs \nthat are growing far too quickly. Switching to the chained CPI is a \nreasonable first step that we could take now to start to rein in \nWashington's out-of-control spending, allowing us to save and protect \nSocial Security and Medicare for generations to come.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise today to talk about the farm bill, \nwhich is typically a 5-year bill, and we hope we can achieve that once \nagain. We know the Senate passed a farm bill a number of months ago--\nactually, in June--but the House has yet to bring the bill to the floor \nof the U.S. House of Representatives. There is really no excuse for \nthat. It doesn't make any sense, first and foremost, because of the \nimpact this bill has on our economy, our farm families, the \nagricultural sector of our economy, and what it also means to make sure \nfolks have enough to eat. This includes the antihunger and nutrition \nstrategies in the farm bill as well. But, unfortunately, the House has \nnot passed it.\n  I think the leadership in the House should consider why we need the \nfarm bill to pass, and they should also consider what happened here in \nthe Senate. We had a very bipartisan process, lots of amendments, and \nplenty of debate, but not some of the harsh debate we have seen in the \ncontext of other issues, and it worked very well. Not everyone got \neverything they wanted, and folks were willing to work together and \ncompromise. We got a bipartisan vote in the Senate, and that is hard to \nachieve even on something as important as a farm bill.\n  I wish to commend the work that was done at that time by our \nchairwoman, Senator Stabenow of the State of Michigan. She led the \nfight, working with Senator Roberts. They worked together not just on \nthe substance, but they worked together in a manner that allowed it to \nbe bipartisan.\n  In my work representing the people of Pennsylvania, I have made it a \npriority to keep Pennsylvania's agricultural industry and our rural \neconomy strong to support families in Pennsylvania. Agriculture is our \nState's largest industry. Pennsylvania's farm gate value, which is \nanother way of describing cash receipts to growers, in the last number \nthat we have, which is a 2010 number, was $5.7 billion.\n  A lot of people who probably haven't spent much time in Pennsylvania \nthink of it as a State of big cities and small towns, but they may miss \nthe substantial agricultural economy we have. Agribusiness in our State \nis a $46.4 billion industry, with 17.5 percent of Pennsylvanians \nemployed in the so-called food and fiber system.\n  One of the questions we have to ask is, What does this all mean? \nWell, I think it certainly means at least that we need a 5-year farm \nbill, not a short-term farm bill. We do too much of that around here on \nother areas of public policy. We should do what we have always done in \nthe Senate, long before I got here--pass 5-year bills with regard to \nthe farm bill. It does create economic opportunities in rural areas, \nand it sustains the consumers and businesses that rely upon our rural \neconomy.\n  The Senate-passed farm bill would reduce the deficit by approximately \n$23 billion through the elimination of some subsidies, the \nconsolidation of programs, and by producing greater efficiencies in the \ndelivery mechanisms in programs.\n\n[[Page S8243]]\n\n  We are having a big debate about the end of the year and the fiscal \nchallenges we have. When you have those debates, you have to come to \nthe table with deficit reducers, ways to reduce deficit and debt. \nPassage of the farm bill would be in furtherance of that goal--a $23 \nbillion reduction in the deficit. A short-term extension wouldn't \nprovide the same reforms, nor would a short-term extension provide the \ncost savings.\n  When we consider what farmers and farm families have to do every \nday--I mean, they have to milk cows, and our dairy farmers do it so \nwell and do it every day; they have to just do their job. Sometimes \nthey wonder about Congress when they know we have a job to do and it \ndoesn't get executed. We should follow their example and do our job. \nThe House can lead on this because it is in their court, so to speak, \nright now, by reauthorizing the farm bill in a responsible way that \nhelps contribute to deficit reduction.\n  I mentioned dairy farmers in terms of our agricultural economy in \nPennsylvania. Dairy is the largest sector of that, so dairy is the \nlargest sector of the biggest part of the Pennsylvania economy, which \nis agriculture. The industry generates more than $1.5 billion in cash \nreceipts and represents about 42 percent of our total agricultural \nreceipts.\n  Dairy farmers deserve the best program possible. The Senate bill \ncontains many improvements that I support, but right now dairy farmers \ndon't have any program to manage their risks in a time of low prices. \nBy the first of January, the Department of Agriculture will be \nobligated to implement for dairy products what we call permanent law. \nWhat this means is that prices farmers receive can almost double, but \nit also means higher costs to the government and consumers, as well as \nlonger term risks of lower consumer demand and increased imports.\n  So we need to make sure we take steps now to prevent some of the \nconsequences of inaction, some of the consequences of the House not \nmoving a 5-year farm bill through their process in the House.\n  There are so many other important items. I will just rattle off a few \nof them in the context of having a 5-year farm bill, not something \nless.\n  In the Senate-passed bill, we worked to address the unique concerns \nof specialty crop farmers, organic farmers, and new farmers--so-called \nbeginning farmers. We did so in a bipartisan way.\n  Second, I am committed--and I know a lot of folks in this Chamber are \ncommitted--to rural communities. Those in my State of Pennsylvania are \ntoo numerous to count, the number of communities that are considered \nrural. Part of that effort that I have to undertake--and all of us \nshould--is to support rural development programs that provide access to \ncapital for rural businesses to provide economic opportunities and \ncreate jobs.\n  We have people take the floor here all the time and talk about small \nbusinesses or businesses in general and that Congress isn't responsive \nenough to businesses. Often, that is true. I would hope they would walk \nacross and give the same speech to their friends in the House that one \nof the best ways to help rural businesses is to pass the 5-year farm \nbill right away.\n  We know farmers are the original stewards of the land and continue to \nlead the charge in protecting our natural resources. I believe the \nvoluntary conservation programs in the farm bill provide important \ntools to help farmers comply with Federal and State regulations while \nkeeping farmers in business. Conservation programs are an extremely \nimportant resource for many Pennsylvania farmers. We have a great \nconservation tradition in our State. This bill would enhance and build \nupon that great record of conservation in Pennsylvania and across the \ncountry.\n  We also wanted to focus on helping those who don't have enough to eat \nand making sure we are doing everything possible to enhance or improve \nnutrition by the many strategies in the farm bill that involve \nnutrition. There is no better opportunity to strengthen nutrition \npolicy in the nutrition programs than through a well-crafted 5-year \nfarm bill.\n  The people of Pennsylvania and folks across the country deserve \ncertainty, and a 5-year farm bill would help us move in that direction. \nIf the House leadership is serious about a prosperous future for the \ncountry, the House must pass the 5-year farm bill right now. I urge the \nHouse leadership to appreciate the significance of having a 5-year bill \nfor farmers, for consumers, and for families. If the Senate, as it has \ndone, can pass a bipartisan farm bill the way we did, I have no doubt--\nno doubt whatever--that the House can do the same.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                      Remembering Daniel K. Inouye\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I wish to talk about the disaster \nsupplemental today, but before I do that, I would like to spend a \nminute talking about the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye. We were at \nthe service this morning in the Rotunda of the Capitol, where only 31 \nAmericans in the history of the country have been honored by that \nopportunity for Americans to think about them as they lie in the center \nof the Capitol on the catafalque that was used by Abraham Lincoln and \nothers. I was able to place the wreath in the Capitol when Rosa Parks \nwas in that same place.\n  I want to say how honored I was to get to serve in the Senate with \nMr. Inouye. He not only was a hero in so many ways but I think \nconnected all of us to the ``greatest generation,'' as Tom Brokaw \ntitled that generation, and there was no better example of that quiet, \npurposeful, heroic dedication to service than the Senator from Hawaii, \nthe President pro tem, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nbut most of all just a great American.\n  Last year when school was out, my youngest son Charlie was here for \nlunch. In the Senate Dining Room, he saw Mr. Inouye, and he had seen \nKen Burns' World War II documentary in which the Senator was being \nrecognized. He said: ``I saw him in the documentary on World War II.'' \nI asked Senator Inouye to come over to speak to Charlie and his \nfriends, and he did. They were so thrilled to meet him.\n  Then, when that was over and the Senator walked away, Charlie then \ntold a story from the documentary, which he had only seen once, and it \nhad been about a month before, and he was 7. But he said that during \nthe war, he captured a German soldier, and the German soldier reached \nin his pocket, and he thought he was going for a weapon, so he knocked \nhim down, and as he fell down, the German soldier's hand--a bunch of \npictures fell out. And at that time, young Daniel Inouye picked up the \npictures, and they were of the man's family. And Charlie repeated--he \nsaid that he saw the pictures, and he said: ``He is a man just like \nme.'' The greatness of that moment, his courageous actions later in the \nwar, his leadership have often brought to mind--particularly as I sat \nin the Appropriations Committee and would look down the table and see \nhim sitting there in the middle of the table--the thought that when \nthat man leaves, there won't be anyone quite like him to take his \nplace.\n\n  I would say, Madam President, to you and to my colleagues how honored \nI was to serve with him and how proud I am of the great and dedicated \nservice he gave to the country. I hope we can all learn from his \nexample.\n  Madam President, let me spend a few minutes talking about the current \ndisaster supplemental.\n  I believe when disasters exceed the ability of communities and States \nto deal with them, the Federal Government should help. That has been \nsomething we have done for sometime now. I think there are some \nproblems in the system and the way we respond. Unfortunately, in \nMissouri, we have had too many opportunities in recent years to have \nexperience with disasters and responses. On occasion, they have been \ndisasters we could deal with. And actually, I have told people where I \nlive: No, this is a disaster that really is a bad thing--the tornado \nhit, it didn't stay for long--but we can deal with this ourselves. I \nsaid that last year at an event we had in Branson, MO.\n  But when we had this devastating tornado in Joplin, MO, following two \ndifferent floods in the same time period, I said: No, we can't deal \nwith this on our own. We need others to come in and help us, as we will \nhelp them when they have a big problem. And that is what this \nsupplemental should be doing.\n\n[[Page S8244]]\n\n  In my view, the $60 billion supplemental is not the best way to deal \nwith this at this time. I would rather see us deal with this when we \nknow more about the money we need to spend. We have a March 27 deadline \nwhen the continuing resolution runs out. One of the questions I would \nhave is: How much money do we need between now and then? There are \nothers who might say, and I could possibly be persuaded, well, let's at \nleast go until the end of the fiscal year. How much money do we need \nbetween now and September 30? But this goes beyond that.\n  When we had the Katrina disaster a few years ago we did at least \nthree supplementals for Katrina. Eventually, we may spend more than \n$60.4 billion. But my view would be there are probably better ways to \napproach this than appropriating that money right now as opposed to \nappropriating it later when we know what it is for.\n  This bill should not be viewed, either, as an opportunity for Members \nof Congress to fundamentally alter the disaster funding programs. There \nis a legislative process to do that. It shouldn't be the disaster \nfunding bill that we use to change the law. We should have that debate \nat another time, and I hope we will.\n  In the past, and under the Stafford Act, which is the disaster \nfunding act, we have limited what we can do beyond just replacing what \nthe disaster took away, and we have added a little to it. There is an \nargument one could make: Well, if the disaster destroys this, and there \nis a way to put it back within reason that makes it harder to destroy, \nwe should do that. In fact, there was a cap. I think it was 7\\1/2\\ \npercent was the most we could spend for preventing future things from \nhappening, mitigation. This spends about four times that much, and it \nchanges the law permanently to allow it to spend four times that much. \nThat is not the way this should be done. And my guess is, before we are \ndone, it will not be the way it is done.\n  For too long I think we have not looked at how we spend money on \ndisasters. We have not only worked in recent times within the Budget \nControl Act, we had, as I said, disasters in Missouri in 2011 where we \nhad two major floods and we had an E5 tornado that devastated the \nsizable community of Joplin.\n  I was in Joplin last week at one of the temporary middle schools. The \nhigh school was destroyed, the vocational school was destroyed, the \nparochial school was destroyed, and I think six elementary schools. I \ndon't mean they were damaged, I mean they were destroyed. To replace \nthose we were able to figure out how to work within the Budget Control \nAct. We even put some disaster funding in the regular appropriations \nbills as it became obvious what was going to be necessary beyond what \nwe immediately knew as a country was necessary. And I think we could do \nthat here.\n  I was so concerned about what happened in 2011 I asked the General \nAccounting Office to evaluate several things: the disaster declaration \nprocess, the standards that FEMA uses to make a declaration, FEMA's \nmanagement of its disaster relief fund, and the overall costs that were \nassociated with disasters at the State, local, and Federal level.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the GAO report as part of this discussion.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe Conclusions and Recommendations for Executive Action of the GAO \nReport ``Federal Disaster Assistance.'' (GA0-12-838)\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Conclusions\n\n       Disaster declarations have increased over recent decades, \n     and FEMA has obligated over $80 billion in federal assistance \n     for disasters declared during fiscal years 2004 through 2041, \n     highlighting the importance of FEMA's assessment of \n     jurisdictions' capabilities to respond and recover without \n     federal assistance. The PA per capita indicator is \n     artificially low because it does not reflect the rise in per \n     capita personal income since 1986 or 13 years of inflation \n     from 1986, when the indicator was set at $1.00 and adopted \n     for use, to 1999. By primarily relying on an artificially low \n     indicator, FEMA's recommendations to the President are based \n     on damage estimates and do riot comprehensively assess a \n     jurisdiction's capability to respond to and recover from a \n     disaster on its own. For example, on the basis of FEMA's \n     actual and estimated disaster assistance obligations, more \n     than one-third of the 539 major disasters declared during \n     fiscal years 2004 through 2011 are expected to have total DRF \n     obligations of less than $10 million, and more than 60 \n     percent are expected to have total obligations of less than \n     $25 million. Therefore, many of these declarations were for \n     relatively small disasters. At a minimum, adjusting the \n     existing PA per capita indicator fully for changes in per \n     capita income or inflation could ensure that the per capita \n     indicator more accurately reflects changes in U.S. economic \n     conditions since 1986, when the indicator was adopted. Making \n     the appropriate inflation adjustment to the indicator would \n     raise it from $1.35 to $2.07. A change of this size in 1 year \n     could present challenges for jurisdictions, which could find \n     that disasters with PA damage estimates that would now \n     qualify for PA would no longer qualify. Thus, phasing in the \n     adjustment over several years could provide jurisdictions \n     time to take actions, such as increasing any rainy day funds, \n     to adjust to the effects of higher qualifying indicators.\n       A more comprehensive approach to determine a jurisdiction's \n     capabilities to respond to a disaster would be to replace or \n     supplement the current indicator with more complete data on a \n     jurisdiction's fiscal resources, such as TTR, and would be \n     informed by data on a jurisdiction's response and recovery \n     assets and capabilities. Because FEMA's current approach of \n     comparing the amount of disaster damage with the PA per \n     capita indicator does not accurately reflect whether a \n     jurisdiction has the capabilities to respond to and recover \n     from a disaster without federal assistance, developing a \n     methodology that provides a more comprehensive assessment of \n     jurisdictions' response and recovery capabilities, including \n     a jurisdiction's fiscal capacity, could provide FEMA with \n     data that are more specific to the jurisdiction requesting \n     assistance. For example, developing preparedness metrics in \n     response to the Post-Katrina Act and Presidential Policy \n     Directive-8 could provide FEMA with readily available \n     information on jurisdictions' response and recovery \n     capabilities. Without an accurate assessment of \n     jurisdictions' capabilities to respond to and recover from a \n     disaster, FEMA runs the risk of recommending to the President \n     that federal disaster assistance be awarded without \n     considering a jurisdiction's response and recovery \n     capabilities or its fiscal capacity. As we recommended in \n     2001, we continue to believe that FEMA should develop more \n     objective and specific criteria to assess the capabilities of \n     jurisdictions to respond to a disaster. Given the legislative \n     and policy changes over the past decade, we believe that \n     including fiscal and nonfiscal capabilities, including \n     available preparedness metrics in its assessment, would allow \n     FEMA to make more informed recommendations to the President \n     when determining a jurisdiction's capacity to respond without \n     federal assistance.\n       Making informed recommendations to the President about \n     whether cost share adjustments should be granted is important \n     for FEMA and the requesting jurisdictions because every cost \n     share adjustment has financial implications for both \n     entities. A specific set of criteria or factors to use when \n     considering requests for 100 percent cost share adjustments \n     would provide FEMA a decision-making framework and enable \n     more consistent and objectively based recommendations to the \n     President. Also, when FEMA recommends that a cost share \n     adjustment be approved and the President approves it, the \n     federal government assumes the financial burden of paying 15 \n     percent or 25 percent more in PA, which could total millions \n     of dollars. Tracking the additional costs to the federal \n     government because of cost share adjustments would allow FEMA \n     to better understand the financial implications of its \n     recommendations to the President.\n       FEMA's average administrative costs as a percentage of \n     total DRF disaster assistance obligations have risen for \n     disasters of all sizes. The agency recognized that delivering \n     assistance in an efficient manner is important and published \n     guidance to be used throughout the agency to help rein in \n     administrative costs. However, FEMA has not implemented the \n     goals and does not track performance against them. Over time, \n     reducing administrative costs could save billions of \n     dollars--dollars that could be used to fund temporary \n     housing, infrastructure repairs, and other disaster \n     assistance. Therefore, incentivizing good management over \n     administrative costs by adopting administrative cost \n     percentage goals and measuring performance against these \n     goals would help provide FEMA with additional assurance that \n     it is doing its utmost to deliver disaster assistance in an \n     efficient manner.\n\n                  Recommendations for Executive Action\n\n       To increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the process \n     for disaster declarations, we recommend that the FEMA \n     Administrator take the following four actions:\n       1. Develop and implement a methodology that provides a more \n     comprehensive assessment of a jurisdiction's capability to \n     respond to and recover from a disaster without federal \n     assistance. This should include one or more measures of a \n     jurisdiction's fiscal capacity, such as TTR, and \n     consideration of the jurisdiction's response and recovery \n     capabilities. If FEMA continues to use the PA per capita \n     indicator to assist in identifying a\n\n[[Page S8245]]\n\n     jurisdiction's capabilities to respond to and recover from a \n     disaster, it should adjust the indicator to accurately \n     reflect the annual changes in the U.S. economy since 1986, \n     when the current indicator was first adopted for use. In \n     addition, implementing the adjustment by raising the \n     indicator in steps over several years would give \n     jurisdictions more time to plan for and adjust to the change.\n       2. Develop and implement specific criteria or factors to \n     use when evaluating requests for cost share adjustments that \n     would result in the federal government paying up to 100 \n     percent of disaster declaration costs.\n       3. Annually track and monitor the additional costs borne by \n     the federal government for the cost share adjustments.\n       4. Implement goals for administrative cost percentages and \n     monitor performance to achieve these goals.\n\n                   Agency Comments and Our Evaluation\n\n       We provided a draft of this report to DHS for comment. We \n     received written comments from DHS on the draft report, which \n     are summarized below and reproduced in full in appendix V. \n     DHS concurred with three recommendations and partially \n     concurred with the fourth recommendation.\n       Regarding the first recommendation, that FEMA develop and \n     implement a methodology that provides a more comprehensive \n     assessment of a jurisdiction's capability to respond to and \n     recover from a disaster without federal assistance, DHS \n     concurred. DHS stated that a review of the criteria used to \n     determine a state's response, recovery, and fiscal \n     capabilities is warranted and that such a review would \n     include the need to update the per capita indicator as well \n     as a review of alternative metrics. DHS stated that any \n     changes would need to be made through the notice and comment \n     rulemaking process and that, if changes are made to the per \n     capita indicator, FEMA's Office of Response and Recovery will \n     review the feasibility of phasing them in over time. However, \n     the extent to which the planned actions will fully address \n     the intent of this recommendation will not be known until the \n     agency completes its review and implements a methodology that \n     provides a more comprehensive assessment of a jurisdiction's \n     capability to respond and, if the per capita indicator \n     continues to be used, adjusts the per capita indicator to \n     accurately reflect annual changes in the U.S. economy since \n     1986. We will continue to monitor DHS's efforts.\n  Mr. BLUNT. In the response portion of the report we will file, the \nGAO said a third of the disasters over the last 8 years cost the \nFederal Government less than $10 billion. They also said the level of \nloss necessary to declare a disaster hasn't changed in a couple of \ndecades.\n  My concern was--and the report leveled it out--that when we do have a \nbig disaster, such as Sandy, we have almost always spent all the money \nbecause it was pretty easy to have a Governor ask for a disaster and \nthe President to declare it and then the money is gone.\n  FEMA primarily relied on the per-capita damage indicator as the \ncriteria rather than whether the local community had the resources to \ndeal with this on its own. There was no specific criteria at FEMA to \ndecide at what point we paid various percentages up to 100 percent \ncoming from the Federal Government. The FEMA administrative costs from \n1989 to 2011 had doubled. It had increased from 9 percent of every \ndisaster to an average of 18 percent of every disaster. So GAO \nrecommended we do several things: that FEMA develop a methodology to \nmore accurately assess what a jurisdiction was able to do; that we \ndevelop criteria to know when the Federal Government should accept all \nof the obligation--100 percent of the adjusted cost--and that we \nimplement new goals to track why these costs of administering disasters \nwere going up so dramatically.\n  Hopefully, we can do that, and we can look at the law at the right \ntime in the right way. I know my colleague Senator Coats has led the \nway to propose an alternative to the $60 billion supplemental bill. His \nalternative of about $24 billion would provide the money necessary to \nbe spent by good calculations between now and the end of March. This \ncould be the right step for us to take now. I suspect, as we deal with \nthe House of Representatives, it ultimately will be closer to the step \nwe take. I just think we shouldn't use this bill as a time to change \nthe law so we can spend money in ways the law currently doesn't allow. \nWe shouldn't use this bill to speculate on what costs will be when we \nwill know what those are. At the same time, I understand and appreciate \nthis is a disaster where we should step in. We absolutely should step \nin and help people and the communities devastated by this disaster get \nback on their feet. We should do that, and I am going to do everything \nI can to see we do that. I just hope we do it in the best possible way \ninstead of using this as an opportunity to do things that don't have \nanything to do with Sandy but may have some other goals that should be \nachieved in a more appropriate way.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Daniel Inouye\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I rise to speak about a subject which I \nknow I and the Presiding Officer and a number of our colleagues have \nspent an enormous amount of time on; that is, the challenges of our \nfiscal circumstances. Before I start, I wish to join with so many of my \nother colleagues who have come to the floor in the last few days to \ncelebrate the legacy of our departed colleague Senator Inouye. I didn't \nknow him as long as many of our colleagues did, but in the 4 years I \nhave served in this body, he was truly someone who was always a \ngentleman and represented the best of what I think the Senate is all \nabout.\n\n\n                            The Fiscal Cliff\n\n  I wish to, as I mentioned, spend this time to speak about the need in \nour country to have a balanced deal on the debt and deficit and to \navoid the fiscal cliff. We have witnessed these conversations going \nback and forth between the President and the Speaker, hoping--I think \nspeaking for many--they would reach some deal. I am very disappointed \nby the recent actions of the Speaker and his so-called Plan B--a plan \nthat would do nothing to make a significant dent in our fiscal \nchallenges. I think many of us on our side, and I imagine many on the \nRepublican side, realize it is not an approach that will get us where \nwe need to go.\n  There have been many of us in this body who have been working on this \nissue for a number of years. I think the American public is probably \ngrowing fairly tired of hearing about the fiscal cliff and why this has \nall come about and why all of a sudden we are only now focusing on this \nissue.\n  The fact is our Nation has been on an unsustainable fiscal path for \nsome time. We are currently $16 trillion in debt. Every day we do \nnothing, we add $3 billion to that total--debt that will at some point \nhave to be paid by our children and, because it has gotten larger, by \nour grandchildren. The reality is this is debt we are going to have to \ndeal with, those of us who serve in this body now, and we have got to \nstart paying for it.\n  The remarkable thing as we look at this debt is there is nothing \nabout it that is self-correcting. Time alone will not solve this \nproblem. What I hear from around Virginia, and I am sure the Presiding \nOfficer hears around Missouri, is: How did we get to be in such a \ndramatic, difficult position in the last 12 years, when 12 years ago \nour country was looking at surpluses? I think as a former business guy, \nlooking at what our Nation has done--and mechanically both parties have \nbeen responsible for this--it is not too hard to understand why we are \nin such a deep hole.\n  Over the last 12 years, we have done a series of things that have put \nus in an unsustainable position. On the revenue side, we cut taxes by \n$4.5 trillion over 10 years, the largest tax cuts in American history. \nIf we had simply cut taxes $4.5 trillion over 10 years and done nothing \nelse on the spending side, we might have been able to sustain that. But \nat the very time we took this dramatic decrease in our revenues, we did \nfive things on the spending side--again, things that for the most part \nwere bipartisanly supported--that would ultimately make our financial \nsituation unsustainable.\n  First, in the aftermath of 9/11, we doubled our defense spending. \nSecond, also in the aftermath of the challenges we faced in a very \ndangerous world after 9/11, we created a whole new category of \ngovernment spending called homeland security; again, much of it \nnecessary. Third, we did something\n\n[[Page S8246]]\n\nthat in American history was unprecedented. Our Nation went to war not \nonce but twice without asking Americans for any level of sacrifice \nbeyond our military and their families, and the cost of those wars \ndidn't even go through the normal appropriations process; they simply \nwent on the credit card.\n  The fourth thing we did was we recognized in our country that our \nparents and grandparents were having increasing burdens with the high \ncost of prescription drugs, so we created a brand new entitlement \nprogram, bipartisanly supported, called Medicare Part D; but, again, we \ndidn't pay a dime for it. On top of all that--and this is one of the \nbiggest challenges we have and this is actually a blessing--we are all \nliving a lot longer than anyone would have anticipated. The guy who \noriginally set 65 as a retirement age was Bismarck, when he was Premier \nof Germany in the 1870s, and he set it there because average life \nexpectancy was mid-fifties. In this country, we are blessed to live to \nan average age of 80. A healthy woman in America has a life expectancy \nof 100. That is a blessing, but it means the math that goes into our \nentitlement programs no longer makes sense.\n  What does this fiscal cliff mean? It means the gap between our \nrevenues and our spending is clearly unsustainable. We need to find a \nsolution before our unsustainable debt swallows our economy.\n  Some folks argue we don't need a solution now; we have time and \nspace, and we should stimulate the economy with more deficit spending. \nI think an appropriate measure of additional stimulus activity makes \nsome sense, so I do support investing in our infrastructure, in \nresearch and development, and workforce investments. As a former \nbusiness guy, those are characteristics any strong business would \ninvest in and any strong country should invest in if we are going to \ncontinue to grow. But that alone is not enough, and our problems, which \nonly continue to accrue and grow over the long term, must be dealt \nwith. The U.S. Government, similar to any large enterprise, takes time \nto turn. The sooner we start that turn the better. As this crisis \nevolves and as we get into the final days before Christmas, we need a \nreal deal now--one that addresses these problems in the long run and \nstarts by phasing in improvements that will start to address our \nproblems on the spending side, revenue side, and, yes, entitlement \nside, over the course of the next 10, 15, and 20 years.\n  Some people look to Europe and say austerity there is not working, \nand I agree. An austerity program that is too quick can only make our \nproblems worse. But I also see parts of Europe that have said by simply \nkicking the can down the road they can ignore their problems, and the \nonly thing worse than austerity is the bond markets forcing a crisis \nupon the economy--forcing a crisis that would require a spike in \ninterest rates and make this divide between spending and revenues even \nmore unsustainable. So if we wait 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, 12 years \nfrom now, we will be unable to safely deal with these problems. That is \nwhy we need a balanced and responsible deal now.\n  After the election, many of my colleagues, particularly those on the \nRepublican side, have somewhat publicly acknowledged that we need new \nrevenue and it has to be a part of the solution. Candidly, I believe \nthat even some of the numbers the President has put forward dealing \nwith revenue goals are too modest in terms of what is needed to be put \nback into the revenue stream--not to grow the size of government, but \nto simply pay our bills. It is critically important this new revenue is \nquantifiable, scorable, and maintains the progressive nature of our Tax \nCode.\n  I, as do many on my side, appreciate those on the Republican side for \ntheir willingness to accept this reality. At the same time, we must \nacknowledge that every serious, bipartisan group that has looked at the \nissue of our fiscal circumstances understands that if we are going to \nput our fiscal house in order, in addition to achieving additional \nrevenue, we are going to have to find additional places to cut \ngovernment spending and take on the question of entitlement reform.\n  I understand many of our entitlement programs are a critical lifeline \nfor our seniors and those who are the most vulnerable among us, but we \nneed to ensure these programs are able to continue not just for the \ncurrent beneficiaries but for our kids and grandkids alike. We must \nrealize entitlement reform has to be part of any long-term response to \nour fiscal challenges.\n  Members come to the floor all the time and throw out lots of facts \nabout the challenges around entitlements. I wish to cite just two which \nshow that while, for example, Medicare and Social Security have been \nremarkably successful and must be preserved, the current math around \nboth of these programs doesn't work. In Medicare, for example, an \naverage couple, over their lifetime, would pay in about $113,000 in \npayroll taxes. As they hit retirement and go on Medicare, they would \nreceive back $380,000 in benefits over their lifetime. Obviously, this \ngap can't be maintained.\n  How were we able to do it for so long?\n  Well, for a long time in our country there were a lot more folks \npaying in than there were folks paying out. When I was a child, there \nwere 16 people working for every one individual on Medicare or Social \nSecurity. Today that ratio has gone down to three folks working for \nevery one retiree. In about 10 to 12 years, that ratio will go down to \ntwo people working for every one person on Medicare or Social Security.\n  Think: again, paying in an average of $113,000 in payroll taxes; \ntaking out $380,000 in health care expenses. Folks, the math just does \nnot work. So we must have a real, balanced, and responsible approach to \ndeal not only with this fiscal cliff but to make sure the promise of \nMedicare, the promise of Social Security, is maintained.\n  But this is where we run into problems, and I fear we may not get to \nthe solution we need. Knowing that we need both new revenue, that we \nhave to find places to cut spending, and reform our entitlement \nprograms to bring them back into sustainability, we have to have a \nsolution that looks at both sides of our balance sheet, and Members of \nboth parties must come together to support it.\n  It is remarkable that in this body there are still Members who \nbelieve there is going to be a Republican-only solution to this \nproblem. We sometimes see those activities coming out of the House. \nBut, just as there is not going to be a Republican-only solution, there \nis not going to be a Democratic-only solution as well. And one of the \nmost remarkable things I have found in my 4 years of service in this \nSenate--and I think again about the Presiding Officer, who has taken on \nso many challenges--for those of us who have tried time and again to \nwork across the aisle, there is very little reinforcement effort in \nthis town for Members to do the right thing. In fact, in many cases, \nopposite forces dominate.\n  On both sides--both the left and the right--a number of stakeholders \nuse scare tactics to preserve their own portion of the status quo. They \ndress up and use misinformation to scare the American people and run \nads against politicians who would dare to break with their orthodoxy, \nin order to drive Americans apart.\n  In the last week or 10 days, we have started to take a look at some \nof the ads that have started to run in all of the Hill press and \nperiodicals. Every day I get groups that come in--as I am sure the \nPresiding Officer does--and they all say: Senator, thanks for trying to \nwork on this fiscal cliff problem. Thanks for trying to work in a \nbipartisan way. Try to get it done, just don't touch mine.\n  Let me give you a little bit of a sampling:\n  One ad we have seen recently has to do with the mortgage interest \ndeduction. It is terribly important. Anybody who says tax reform has to \ntake place, says it is going to generate more revenues; unfortunately, \nhowever, mortgage interest is one of the biggest tax expenditures in \nour Tax Code.\n  I like this one--Congress: Let's fight fraud first.\n  Well, who has not heard and said that the solution to all of our \nproblems is if we can get rid of the waste and fraud? That may be part \nof the solution set, but that is not going to solve $16 trillion in \ndebt.\n  Next we hear: Who cares if Medicare and Medicaid are cut?\n  Well, this is from the hospitals. I know what great job hospitals \nacross\n\n[[Page S8247]]\n\nVirginia, across Missouri, and across America do. But if we wall off \nthese, where are we going to find the additional resources?\n  Next we see this: Graduate medical education.\n  It is very important, something I have fought for as Governor, \nsomething I want to preserve. In this debate, as we look to try to \nexpand health care in America, we have to train more doctors to make \nsure those who have been uninsured can receive the health care they \nneed. But, again, one more program: Do not touch mine.\n  We could go all day with additional posters.\n  But here again: Let's make sure airlines do not pay any more; let's \nmake sure we avoid sequester; let's make sure we do not touch \ncharitable donations; let's make sure defense is not touched.\n  Well, everyone wants to solve the problem. Everyone says: Atta-boy. \nBut they then turn around to say: Atta-boy, but do not touch mine. That \nis not how the real world works. That is not what the Founders set up \nwhen they created this unique experiment in democracy.\n  One of the most remarkable things about the American government was \nthey set up an institution that was slightly dysfunctional on purpose--\nan independent House, an independent Senate, an independent Presidency. \nThe only way things got done was if all groups worked together.\n  For the past 2 months, there has been--not just the past 2 months, \nbut for many, many months--there has been lots of talk about the forces \nof division and reflexive ideology. I think we all are tired of those \ngroups that go around and ask politicians: Sign this pledge, not a dime \nof new revenue. It is one I find one of the most repulsive.\n  And we have seen, and I believe, that additional revenues are needed. \nLet me assure you, frankly, if there is any deal, they will be part of \nthe deal. And while we are not there yet, the President and the Speaker \nhave come to an agreement that additional revenue must be part of the \ndeal.\n\n  But that is not the end of the story. If we--those of us on the \nDemocratic side--say we have an extra trillion dollars of revenue, that \nwe can then walk away from this problem now and say we were victorious, \nwell, if we do that, all we are doing is simply kicking the can. The \ntruth is--and this is from economists from left to right--if we do not \nhave a deal that is at least a minimum of $4 trillion in deficit \nreduction over the next 10 years--and that is at the low end--then we \nwill not start to drive our debt-to-GDP ratio back into a sustainable \nposition. The only way we are going to get there is, yes, counting the \ncuts we have already made, yes, looking for additional revenue, but \nalso finding additional spending cuts and entitlement reform.\n  The President gets this, and he knows we cannot kick the can down the \nroad. What I think has been remarkable is, as the President has laid \nout his plan and his vision, he has acknowledged that he has been \nwilling to be open to hard choices, including reforms to our \nentitlement programs. One of which he has said he would be open to, \nwith the appropriate protections, the so-called chained CPI. But once \nthis was even mentioned, some groups, progressive groups that I have \nbeen proud to have the support of, have said that any change--any \nchange--to Social Security or Medicare or anything that is as sinister \nas chained CPI cannot be a part of any deal. For these groups, they say \nany single dollar of what they consider to be a benefit cut in these \nentitlement programs is unacceptable, even if it helps ensure the \nsustainability of Social Security or Medicare.\n  This is not a path to a successful deal. This is not the path, the \nkind of compromise and balance that will make sure we actually do \npreserve Medicare and Social Security for the long term.\n  I have to say, it is surprising to me, when I hear some in my own \nparty who come down and rightfully call out those on the other side who \ndeny the science around climate change, that those very same folks \nsometimes then deny the math around entitlement reform.\n  I wish to take a moment to talk about this so-called chained CPI. \nChained CPI, as certified by our official scorekeeper, the \nCongressional Budget Office, is an alternative measure of inflation \nthat takes into account how people change the mix of products and \nservices they buy or substitute as prices change.\n  What does that mean in English? It means in the old days, the way we \nused to measure how much inflation was taking place was if the price of \nbananas went up, well, you would not buy bananas. This says, in a more \nrealistic estimation, if the price of bananas goes up, well, you might, \ninstead of buying bananas, buy apples.\n  What does that affect? It means the chained CPI ``. . . provides an \nunbiased estimate of changes in the cost of living from one month to \nthe next.'' Is it a perfect formula? Absolutely not. But there is no \nperfect formula to measure inflation.\n  What is remarkable about this debate--and this is just one small \npiece of any kind of comprehensive reform--is that experts on the left \nand right agree that this new measurement formula is more accurate and \nmore appropriate. And it does mean that the rate of inflation will be \nmeasured as slightly less. It actually says that it will cut the rate \nof increase by roughly three-tenths of one percent.\n  I have heard Members come out here and say this will account for \nchanges and dramatic cuts of 10, 15, 20 percent. This is cuts of three-\ntenths of one percent.\n  Who supports this so-called chained CPI? It must be only those forces \non the right. And, yes, groups such as the Heritage Foundation and the \nAmerican Enterprise Institute have come together and said this is a \nmore accurate measure. What has not been emphasized is that groups that \nhave bona fides on the Democratic side that are unquestioned--the \nCenter for American Progress, the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities, the Washington Post editorial board, the President's fiscal \ncommission, the Bipartisan Policy Center--have all said this ought to \nbe one of the tools we use as we look at trying to make sure Medicare, \nSocial Security, and other entitlement programs are reformed and made \nsustainable.\n  Now why do economists support chained CPI? Because it honors the \ncommitment to maintain the purchasing power of spending and revenue \npolicies. It provides savings across the budget, not just in \nentitlement programs but across other areas. It also raises revenues, \nand it contributes meaningfully to the long-term fiscal sustainability \nof the programs we want to protect. Because across the government we \nhave indexed things to inflation. The Tax Code, the entitlement \nprograms, all are indexed. They rise and decrease based upon inflation.\n  So again, this tool, while not perfect, all these groups have said \nneeds to be part of any reform. This is not a new idea--I know, \nperhaps, it is on this floor--but this is an idea that has been \ndiscussed, debated, and endorsed by these groups from left to right for \nover the last 10 years. It does, as I mentioned, both increase revenues \nand lower spending. Because, again, it is a more accurate measure of \npolicy adjustments that Congress has already decided to make.\n  There are some who say: Well, what will this do to Social Security? \nThat is an important part of this conversation. I for one believe \nSocial Security needs to be reformed, and I believe Social Security \nreform ought to take a separate path from debt and deficit reform. I \nunderstand for many seniors, Social Security is a lifeline and it is \nwithout question the greatest social program in the history of our \ncountry. We as legislators need to protect that program.\n  But what we do not hear from those who come out and advocate for \nSocial Security is the recognition that Social Security is on a path \ntoward insolvency. If we do nothing about this wonderful program, under \ncurrent law it will basically run out of money, which will mean a 25-\npercent across-the-board cut in benefits as early as 2033. And that \nnumber--as we continue to grow older, the actuaries keep coming up each \nyear and making it earlier and earlier.\n  Now 2033 sounds like a long time away. What it means is, for some of \nour folks who work here, if you are 46 years old today, that would mean \nat age 67 you would see your benefits cut by more than a quarter--\nagain, unless we act. This is not a self-correcting problem.\n\n[[Page S8248]]\n\n  There are other things we need to do around Social Security, such as \nraising the cap on the amount of income that is taxed. But those who \nsay we should put off questions about Social Security or Medicare to \nsome other day refuse to also recognize the reality that none of this \nself-corrects, and the sooner we start down the path of reform, the \nsooner we can make sure the promise of these programs will last.\n  But, again, instead of worrying about the potential of a 25-percent \ncut in Social Security benefits for folks who today are 46 years old, \nthey talk about the fact that, yes, there may be some slight cutback in \nimmediate benefits--not, though, 20 percent, not 3 percent, not 1 \npercent, but a decrease of three-tenths of 1 percent in the amount of \nincrease each year.\n  There are ways that if we use this tool, to make it more fair and \nbalanced. Because we must make sure that we protect the most vulnerable \nin our society.\n  I was part of a group the Presiding Officer, I believe, supported, \nthe so-called Gang of 6, which built on the President's Commission on \nFiscal Responsibility, that said if we are going to do something like \nchained CPI, we also need to make sure we ensure protections for the \nmost vulnerable. Which basically included things such as raising the \nminimum benefit for that bottom 20 percent of folks on Social Security; \nfor making sure, as we add our aging population, that those individuals \nwho outlive their pensions--the fastest growing group of Americans are \nfolks above the age of 85--that they would receive an additional bump \nup as well.\n  We must also recognize, if we are looking at something like chained \nCPI, that we have special obligations to protect our veterans and the \nleast fortunate among us. So any use of this tool ought to have special \nrules and include exclusions for veterans and SSI beneficiaries.\n  As I mentioned before, I personally believe raising the cap on the \npayroll tax is another part of the tools that we ought to use. But too \nmany of the groups that are attacking this or any other effort to look \nat a balanced approach of, yes, additional revenue; yes, additional \ncuts; and, yes, reforms to our entitlements, do not mention that there \nare ways to mitigate some of these challenges.\n  It is also important to mention, with these ideas, at least from my \nposition, every dime of impact that chained CPI would have on Social \nSecurity, those savings would have to remain in Social Security to make \nthe program more solvent.\n  But this discussion about chained CPI is just the current flashpoint. \nThe bigger issue is how we are going to get to that question of what I \nbelieve is, at minimum, a $4 trillion deal. Any budget deal between the \nSpeaker and President, I believe, will probably contain enough things \nthat everyone will look at it and find a lot to dislike. If not, they \nprobably have not done their job. To single out any one thing and to be \nabsolutely opposed to a deal, regardless of the other parts of the \npackage, to me, would be the height of irresponsibility.\n  Again, I know there are others who say this whole debate about the \nfiscal cliff is imaginary and simply created by politicians. Well, I \nhave to acknowledge, as somebody who spent 20 years in business and a \nnumber of years now in elective office, I do not know for sure what the \neffect would be if we go over the cliff and see taxes go up on all \nAmericans, to see these across-the-board cuts take place.\n  But I do know this: If the chance is only 5 or 10 or 15 percent that \ngoing over the cliff would throw this economy back into a deep \nrecession, there would be nothing that would rob more Americans, and \nhurt our most vulnerable citizens more, than having their house go back \nunderwater because of a rise in interest rates, or the potential that a \njob disappears because an employer decides to end up--no longer to \nplay, or unemployment benefits not get extended because we chose to \npunt rather than to deal with this issue.\n  Again, if we go over a cliff, and if the chances are only 10 percent \nthat it throws us back into a deep recession, unlike in the past, \nunlike the fiscal crisis in 2008, we do not have extraordinary measures \nof stimulus or the Fed being able to dramatically lower interest rates.\n  So I believe we do need this balanced, responsible--at least a $4 \ntrillion deal; a deal, again, that I believe counts the cuts we have \nalready made, that adds additional real revenue.\n  Again, as I mentioned earlier, I think the President has started too \nlow in terms of the amount of revenue we need. We took $4\\1/2\\ trillion \nout of the revenue stream over the last 10 years. I think to say that \nputting back at least one-third or 40 percent of that would be much \nmore appropriate than what is being discussed right now.\n  It does mean that all of us need to make some hard choices about \nspending, and make sure the entitlement programs which have been so \nsuccessful are sustained.\n  In closing, let me make a few final comments. I believe any final \ndeal must ask those of us who have done well--and I have been blessed \nin this country to do very well--to pay their fair share. Beyond that, \nwe have to look at a tax reform package that will actually make our Tax \nCode simpler, fairer, and generate more revenue than even what has been \nsuggested in the current conversation.\n  It means, though, recognizing that we cannot solve this problem with \nbudget cuts alone, it means Medicare and other entitlement reform must \nbe serious and part of the conversation; that we honor our commitment \nnot only to those beneficiaries who receive these important benefits \nnow, but to make sure that 20-year-old, 40-year-old, and 50-year-old is \ngoing to have those benefits as well.\n  No matter what we do, we cannot only cut and tax our way out of this \nproblem. It must include a growth agenda. Finally, as I know the \nPresiding Officer has made points time and again, it must contain real \nprotections for the most vulnerable amongst us.\n  The President and Speaker are still working. I am hopeful they will \nget a deal. We, as Americans, and as legislators, owe them the space to \nmake a deal, the opportunity to combine things people on each side \nmight not like, in isolation, with policies that address these greater \nconcerns. But now is not the time to be against things without knowing \nthe critical details about how and where they will work.\n  It is not time to confuse the true facts or the actual math involved, \nregardless of which side to which you belong. I have spent the last \n2\\1/2\\ years in this body trying to work with folks on both sides to \nget us to a deal. I believe there is nothing that will do more to \ngenerate job growth and economic activity than making sure we have a \nreal deal that does not kick the can and actually passes muster.\n  I have to acknowledge at times I, like I know many of my colleagues, \ngrow very frustrated with the back and forth. Clearly, what is going on \nin the House right now is not a serious effort to address this problem.\n  I see the new chair of the Appropriations Committee here. I will wrap \nup. I want to commend the Senator from Maryland, my good friend, for \nher new position. I believe she will lead us back to a path where we \nhave regular order to make sure we appropriately look at how we spend \nthe resources we receive. But we must no longer punt on this issue.\n  At moments of greatest frustration--and there are many for me as I \nknow there are for many Americans, as they get tired of hearing about \nthe back-and-forth and the Kabuki dance going on right now. It is in \nmoments of greatest frustration, that I always fall back on that \nwonderful Winston Churchill quote:\n\n       You can always count on the Americans to do the right \n     thing, after they have tried everything else.\n\n  Well, it seems to me, in this debate we have tried everything else. \nWe have accused back and forth. We have been unwilling to recognize the \nreality for the need for revenues or the recognition that we have to \nmake sure our entitlement programs are sustainable. I hope and pray as \nwe move closer to this Christmas season that our leaders, and then all \nof us from both sides, can come together and make sure that we address \nthis issue; which I believe that until we address it, we will not be \nable to address the host of issues which confront our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate?\n\n[[Page S8249]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders.) The pending business is H.R. 1.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise and ask unanimous consent to \nspeak for 3 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Appropriations Committee Chairmanship\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I just wanted to come to the floor--I \nknow other Senators are speaking--to say to the rest of my colleagues \nand to many people who have expressed interest, the Democratic caucus \nhas just confirmed me to be the full chair of the U.S. Senate \nAppropriations Committee.\n  I take the floor today to announce that with great humility. I am \nfilling the footsteps of Senator Danny Inouye, who was indeed a giant \namong men, a war hero, and an advocate for social justice, national \nsecurity, and a compassionate government.\n  I want to just say to my colleagues, as I assume this chairmanship, I \nlook forward to working with each and every Member of the Senate, both \nwithin my own caucus and across the aisle, to have a committee that \nfunctions on a bipartisan basis.\n  The Appropriations Committee is a constitutionally mandated \ncommittee. The Appropriations Committee is governed by the Constitution \nof the United States, by the laws of the land, and by the rules of the \nSenate. Under the Constitution, the Founding Fathers said every year \nthere should be a review of the annual Federal expenditures. That is \nwhat our committee will do. We will bring forward legislation that will \nshow what are the expenditures of the United States Government, what we \npropose to be ratified by the full Senate.\n  We will do it, first of all, on a bipartisan basis. One of the first \ncalls I received when I knew this honor would come to be chair was to \nreach across the aisle to Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, my good \nfriend and colleague who is now the ranking member on the \nAppropriations Committee, to reach out to him, as I did in a phone \ncall. And I say publicly today that when we look at how we are going to \nspend the money and how we are going to meet our national security \nneeds--but our compelling human needs in this country, and public \ninvestment in our children, in our future, and how to promote our \neconomy--we need to do it on a bipartisan basis. I want to thank \nSenator Shelby because he assured me of his cooperation to do so.\n  Our committee will function in a way that is open, transparent, and \nwe wish to follow the regular order. What we want to do in following \nthe regular order is to ask our colleagues to join with us so that we \nmove the urgent supplemental which so many American people are \ndepending on us to pass, this legislation to meet the needs of \nindividual assistance to restore homes, lives and livelihoods.\n  It is going to be a new day in the Appropriations Committee, but we \nare going to follow old-school values of the men who went before us: \nDan Inouye, Ted Stevens, men who fought in World War II to defend \nAmerica. They stood on this Senate floor to defend the Constitution. \nThey spoke for their States. That is what we are going to do. I want \neveryone to know, we also will want to ensure that our spending \nreflects our values to protect our country, to protect vulnerable \npopulations, and to also prepare America for the future.\n  I will have more to say about all of this at a later time. I just \nwanted to say, I take this not as an honor but as a great \nresponsibility. I am so appreciative of the caucus that confirmed me. I \nam very appreciative of the way Members of the other side of the aisle \nalso reached out.\n  If we take the time to listen to each other, to respect each other \nand listen to the needs of the people, we can work to get more bang out \nof the buck, get more value for the dollar. We can have a strong \neconomy, a safer country. We can be frugal without being heartless.\n  At the same time, we can assure the taxpayers we have heard them. \nThey want us to do a better job with our spending, but at the same time \nthey want to see it in an open process. I just wanted to come to the \nfloor to say that.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                Jon Kyl\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I rise to pay tribute to a dear friend and an \nextraordinary public servant, Senator Jon Kyl. For the past 18 years, \nit has been my honor to serve alongside Jon in the Senate, and it has \nbeen my great privilege to get to know him personally and to work with \nhim as closely as I have.\n  Jon has built a well-earned reputation as one of the great policy \nminds of our time. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of domestic and a \nkeen interest in foreign policy, and we all know he is one of the \nhardest working Members of Congress.\n  He has been a leader on his own State's interests, and he has emerged \nas one of the strongest leaders in our entire party on the issues of \nnuclear strategy and arms control. Jon has explained to an entire \ngeneration of Republicans President Reagan's enduring philosophy of \npeace on strength and then applied it.\n  Jon has been a zealous proponent of a strong missile defense, and \nmore than any other Senator he helped ensure that the United States had \na working nuclear arsenal after the Cold War had ended because, in his \nview, a strong America that can deter a threat is always the best \navenue to peace.\n  Over the past decade, Jon has applied that same standard to the war \non terror, and no one, no one has worked harder to explain the threat \nof Islamist terrorism or helped equip our Nation with the tools we need \nto confront and defeat it than Jon Kyl.\n  Not enough thought has been given to the role of nuclear weapons in \nAmerican foreign policy and how strategy will evolve as our \nconventional military is drawn down due to a diminishing investment and \nhow nuclear weapons will be employed to support the articulated \nstrategic pivot to the Asian Pacific theater. The Senate and the \ncountry will be well served by Jon's thoughts on these challenges over \nthe coming years. Fortunately, he has thought ahead by encouraging \nothers to step into the void after he leaves.\n  Throughout his time in Washington, Jon has been guided, as he \nexplained in eloquent detail yesterday, by a profound belief in and \ncommitment to the expansion of freedom and the three primary areas \nwhere that commitment plays out in the public square: growth-oriented \neconomics, the social policies that make limited government possible, \nand any policy that emphasizes a strong and sovereign America. These \nthree pillars have been Jon's guidepost, and we have all benefited \ntremendously over the years as a party and as a nation from his \nfaithful application and patient explanation of the enduring importance \nof all three.\n  In short, Jon is whip smart, and he is a passionate believer and \ndefender of American exceptionalism. But besides all this, he is also a \nfantastic individual, with a peerless reputation on both sides of the \naisle as a man of principle and integrity. I have personally benefited \nfrom Jon's policy mind and advice countless times, and, Jon, I want to \nsay how grateful I am for your steady hand and wise counsel over the \nyears.\n  I always knew I could throw Jon into the middle of any fight, \nconfident our team would own the field. He wasn't just prepared, he was \neager to take on the most thankless tasks, and he never ever let me \ndown.\n  One suspects the seeds of Jon's wisdom and equanimity were planted in \nhis upbringing in the Midwest. As a young boy growing up in Nebraska \nand Iowa, he learned the value of hard work. His dad led the local \nchamber of commerce and worked as a high school principal and \nsuperintendent. Later on, he joined Jon's uncle in the clothing \nbusiness--and eventually he served six terms in Congress.\n  It was a stable, happy, middle-class childhood centered on work, \nfamily, and service. It laid a solid foundation for Jon's later \nsuccesses. ``It was very important to Dad,'' Jon once said, ``that we \nrecognize that even though we weren't rich, we still had an obligation \nto get involved and give back to the country.''\n\n[[Page S8250]]\n\n  After graduating from high school, Jon enrolled at the University of \nArizona, where he was very much the bundle of energy that anybody who \nhas ever walked more than 10 feet with him is familiar with. \nIncidentally, I am told that you don't want to go on a hike with Jon \nunless you are a trained Olympian. He hikes up Camelback Mountain \nalmost every weekend he is home, and there are two routes; one is \nsomewhat challenging and the other one is akin to a Stairmaster. Jon \ntakes the Stairmaster because it is faster. He climbs up without \nstopping, and then as soon as he gets to the top, he comes right back \ndown. Most people stop to eat an apple or look at the vista--not Jon. \nHe powers right back to the bottom. There is too much work to be done.\n  During his college years, Jon got involved in debate, politics, and a \nnumber of service organizations, graduating with honors in 1964. It was \nalso during his college years that Jon fell in love with Arizona, its \nred sunny vistas, big skies and warm inviting people. It is there that \nhe fell in love with Caryll Collins, whom he met at church one Sunday \nand who has been his constant companion and his anchor ever since.\n\n  I know Jon would agree that without Caryll's support, patience, and \nunderstanding he would never have been able to accomplish all he has \nover the years. Jon and Caryll have been married nearly 50 years. They \nhave raised two great kids, Kristine and John. They have seven \ngrandchildren. They have been blessed.\n  After college, Jon went on to earn a law degree from the University \nof Arizona College of Law, where he was editor of the Law Review. He \nmust have had some great teachers because it is hard to imagine anyone \nwho loves the study and the application of the law as deeply as Jon \nKyl.\n  Jon practiced at a firm in Phoenix for 20 years when he decided to \nfollow his father's footsteps instead and take a turn toward public \nservice. As one long-time friend described it:\n\n       [Jon] sat down with . . . Caryll, who is really his \n     partner, and decided it was time. . . . He could have been a \n     rich man. But he decided this was more important.\n\n  Jon ran for Congress in Arizona's Fourth District and won handily, \nserving eight terms before winning his Senate seat in 1994.\n  One way to illustrate how hard Jon has worked over the years is to \nlook at the coverage he got then versus the coverage he gets now. When \nhe first ran for office, one unfriendly paper called him an enigma. But \nby 2006, that same paper would describe him as a ``national, political \nfigure . . . and one of the five most powerful Senators in Washington . \n. . a man who most everyone says is a hardworking, keenly intelligent, \nhumble, civilized gentleman who seems always to be doing what he \nbelieves is best for America.'' Most of us couldn't get that out of our \nown press secretaries, let alone the hometown paper.\n  But it says everything we need to know about Jon Kyl. His work ethic \nis legendary. For 15 years, Jon labored mostly behind the scenes on one \nof the most complicated and sensitive issues in Arizona politics, \nsettling American Indian claims to Colorado and Gila River water and \nresolving an intergovernmental dispute about how much money Arizona \nshould pay for the Central Arizona Project, completed in 1993.\n  These were longstanding, thorny, legal, and political issues in \nArizona. Some thought a settlement was impossible. They didn't know Jon \nwell enough. By 2004, he had succeeded in passing the Arizona Water \nSettlement Act, simultaneously resolving the outstanding Indian \nlawsuits and resolving the issue of Arizona's reimbursement rate to the \nFederal Government.\n  According to one political commentator, ``It was the most far-\nreaching Indian water settlement in history,'' and it ``wouldn't have \nhappened without the hard work and keen legal mind of Jon Kyl.''\n  As Jon himself put it:\n\n       It was one of the hardest things I've ever done, but I was \n     in a position to be the catalyst. There wasn't anybody else \n     who could do that water deal. And it had to be done.\n\n  Jon's work on water settlements carries a lesson for all of us. \nSimilar to any true leader, he saw the need to do something, not just \nfor the folks who elected him but for the generations of Arizonans to \ncome. He thought ahead, and now the people of Arizona can go about \ntheir daily lives without having to worry about water at all for \ngenerations to come. It will be a huge part of his legacy--and it went \nmore or less unnoticed by most folks in Washington. That is why Jon \ntruly embodies the old maxim, popularized by President Reagan, who had \nit placed on his desk, that there is no limit to what a man can do or \nwhere he can go if he doesn't mind who gets the credit. He almost seems \nto relish the thankless task. A lot of people don't know this, but Jon \nactually volunteered to serve on the supercommittee.\n  At press conferences, Jon has even been known to lean up against a \nwall so others get noticed instead of him, which, as we all know, is \npretty unthinkable to most of the folks around here.\n  Jon's intelligence and personal humility are just two of the reasons \nhe has been so good at persuading people to his view. He persuaded his \ncolleagues to oppose President Clinton's Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban \nTreaty. He has used his immense powers of persuasion literally \ncountless times as minority whip, and he has done all this without ever \noffending anybody.\n  He is that rare politician who manages to always stand on principle \nwithout ever damaging a relationship. I mean it when I say that to the \ndegree I have had any success at all in my role, it has been only \nbecause Jon Kyl has been my partner, counselor, and friend.\n  Jon always tells folks he is serious because the issues he deals with \nare serious, and I can't tell you how grateful I am that we have had \nhim for as long as we did and how much I will miss having Jon Kyl \naround when the gavel falls on the 112th Congress.\n  One last point. People who know Jon well know he is a huge NASCAR \nfan. He knows the drivers. He knows the lingo. He goes to two big races \nevery year in Phoenix and nothing, I mean nothing, can keep him from \ngoing.\n  Why do I mention this? As a young lawyer, Jon used to volunteer to be \nthe lookout guy on the hill around the track. This is a guy who keeps a \nlookout for oil on the track. His view was it might not be the most \nglamorous work but that it was essential to maintain the safety and the \nintegrity of the race to have someone up there on the lookout. I can't \nthink of a better way to sum up his service in Washington.\n\n  Jon has been that serious, behind-the-scenes legislator who always \ndid what needed to be done. He was happy to do the work while others \ntook the credit, and he was happy to explain any issue to anyone and to \nprovide not only the intellectual explanation for the right policy but \nthe elbow grease to get it enacted into law. What mattered to Jon was \nthe good of the country.\n  He has been a model public servant. And, Jon, I can't tell you how \ngrateful we all are that you were. Thank you for everything, my friend. \nI truly hate to see you go.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will just say thank you to my leader. There \nis a lot that is enjoyable, some not so enjoyable, about serving here \nin the Senate. But my time as whip in particular has been one of the \nmost enjoyable things I have done, both because it is in behalf of our \ncolleagues here, helping to get things done, but also because I have \nbeen able to work alongside a great leader in Republican leader Mitch \nMcConnell. I will treasure that always, and I am deeply grateful for \nthe comments he made today.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, before Senator Kyl leaves the floor, I \nwould like to join the Republican leader in congratulating him on his \npublic service. He and I came to the Congress the same year, after the \n1986 elections--we are part of the 100th Congress--and we became \nfriends. I couldn't agree more with the Republican leader and his \nexample of following your convictions with the highest degree of \nintegrity in the work you have done. I had a chance to serve with you \non the Judiciary Committee, and I can tell you that you added greatly \nto the respect for that committee and our respect for the process and \nfor the rule of law and for civil liberty issues. And most recently, \nwith the work you did on the Magnitsky bill, the Republican leader\n\n[[Page S8251]]\n\nis absolutely right--you did not seek the headlines on that \nlegislation, but it could not have been done without your direction and \nyour help.\n  I just want to thank you for what you have done to advance the \nreputation of the Senate and public service, standing by your \nconvictions, yet doing so in a way that we could work together, \nrespecting everyone's right to be heard and our right to work together. \nYou are indeed a model Senator, and it has been an honor to serve with \nyou in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would respond by saying thank you very, \nvery much. I would just add one other thing. In this Senate family, \nalthough we may be of different parties, we make good friendships, and \nit should not go unnoticed that our spouses also make good friendships. \nThis is a case where my wife and Senator Cardin's wife are very good \nfriends, which necessarily draws us closer together, and for that we \nshould both be grateful as well.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Senator Kyl is absolutely right. I get my best \ninformation from Myrna as to what is going on in the Senate. So I \nappreciate his comments.\n\n\n                                Hungary\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, as the Senate chair of the Helsinki \nCommission, I have a longstanding interest in Central Europe. For many \nyears the Helsinki Commission was one of the loudest and clearest \nvoices to speak on behalf of those oppressed by communism and to call \nfor democracy, human rights, and freedom from Soviet oppression. It has \nbeen a great triumph and joy to see the peoples of this region free \nfrom dictatorship.\n  Over the past two decades I have been profoundly heartened as newly \nfreed countries of Central Europe have joined the United States and \nNATO and have become our partners in advocating for human rights and \ndemocracy around the globe. Leadership on those issues may be \nespecially important now as some countries in the Middle East undertake \ntransition, the outcome of which is far from certain. Even in Europe, \nin the western Balkans, there is a crying need for exemplary \nleadership, not backsliding.\n  Americans know from our own history that maintaining democracy and \npromoting human rights are never jobs that are finished. As my friend \nand former colleague Tom Lantos said, ``The veneer of civilization is \npaper thin. We are its guardians, and we can never rest.''\n  For some time I have been concerned about the trajectory of \ndevelopments in Hungary, where the scope and nature of systemic changes \nintroduced after April 2010 have been the focus of considerable \ninternational attention.\n  At the end of November, Hungary was back in the headlines when Marton \nGyongyosi, a member of the notorious extremist party Jobbik and also \nvice chairman of the Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, suggested \nthat Hungarian Jews are a threat to Hungary's national security and \nthose in government and Parliament should be registered. The ink was \nbarely dry on letters protesting those comments when another Hungarian \nmember of Parliament, Balazs Lenhardt, participated in a public \ndemonstration last week where he burned an Israeli flag.\n  The fact is that these are only the latest extremist scandals to \nerupt in Budapest over the course of this year. In April, for example, \njust before Passover, a Jobbik MP gave a speech in Parliament weaving \ntogether subtle anti-Roma propaganda with overt anti-Semitism blood \nlibel. After that, Jobbik was in the news when it was reported that one \nof its members in Parliament had requested and received certification \nfrom a DNA testing company that his or her blood was free of Jewish or \nRomani ancestry.\n  At issue in the face of these anti-Semitic and racist phenomena is \nthe sufficiency of the Hungarian Government's response and its role in \nensuring respect for human rights and the rule of law. And the \ngovernment's response has been, to say the least, wanting.\n  First, it has been a hallmark of this government to focus on blood \nidentity through the extension of Hungarian citizenship on a purely \nethnic basis. The same Hungarian officials have played fast and loose \nwith questions relating to its wartime responsibilities, prompting the \nU.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum to issue a public statement of concern \nregarding the rehabilitation of fascist ideologues and political \nleaders from World War II.\n  I am perhaps most alarmed by the government's failure to stand \nagainst the organized threats from Jobbik. For example, in late August \na mob estimated at 1,000 people terrorized a Roma neighborhood in \nDevecser, taunting the Romani families to come out and face the crowd. \nThere were reportedly three members of Parliament from the Jobbik party \nparticipating in that mob, and some people were filmed throwing bricks \nor stones at the Romani homes. The failure to investigate, let alone \ncondemn such acts of intimidation, makes Prime Minister Orban's recent \npledge to protect ``his compatriots'' ring hollow.\n  Of course, all this takes place in the context of fundamental \nquestions about democracy itself in Hungary.\n  What are we to make of democracy in Hungary when more than 360 \nreligious organizations are stripped of their registration overnight \nand when all faiths must now depend on the politicized decisionmaking \nof the Parliament to receive the rights that come with registration?\n  What are we to make of the fact that even after the European \nCommission and Hungary's own Constitutional Court have ruled against \nthe mass dismissal of judges in Hungary's court-packing scheme, there \nis still no remedy for any of the dismissed judges?\n  What is the status of media freedom in Hungary, let alone the fight \nagainst anti-Semitism, if a journalist who writes about anti-Semitism \nfaces possible sanction before the courts for doing so?\n  What are we to make of Hungary's new election framework, which \nincludes many troubling provisions, including a prohibition on campaign \nads on commercial radio and TV, onerous new voter registration \nprovisions, and limits on local election committees, which oversee \nelections?\n  I find it hard to imagine that Jews, Roma, and other minorities will \nbe safe if freedom of the media and religion, the rule of law, the \nindependence of the Judiciary, and the checks and balances essential \nfor democracy are not also safeguarded. With that in mind, I will \ncontinue to follow the overall trends in Hungary and the implications \nfor the region as a whole.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Alabama.\n\n[[Page S8252]]\n\n                      Remembering Daniel K. Inouye\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, earlier today a lot of us, Members of the \nSenate, joined the family and friends of our great colleague who passed \naway earlier in the week, as they brought his body into the U.S. \nCapitol. I rise here this afternoon to extend some of the tributes that \nwe have made to the memory and to the life of Senator Inouye.\n  For the past 26 years I was privileged to serve alongside Senator \nInouye in this Chamber. I came to know him as a wise counselor, a \nskilled legislator, a formidable negotiator, and a trusted friend. His \nunassailable reputation as an American hero, however, had been forged \nlong before any of us here ever met him.\n  Senator Inouye did not demand respect. He commanded it. The reasons \nfor this are many. In 1941, he witnessed firsthand the horror at Pearl \nHarbor. As a Red Cross volunteer, he cared for his fellow citizens \ninjured in the attack. Not long thereafter, he joined the 442nd \nRegimental Combat Team. He was determined to serve his country despite \nthe fact that he, like all Japanese-Americans, had been deemed an \n``enemy alien'' when the U.S. declared war on Japan.\n  As a young military officer in 1945, Daniel Inouye led his unit in a \nsuccessful attack against a Nazi fortification in northern Italy. The \nvalor, courage, selflessness, and determination he displayed during the \nbattle are the stuff of legend, and would later earn him the Medal of \nHonor. During this attack he sustained serious permanent injuries that \nserved as constant reminders of his sacrifice for our country.\n  Senator Daniel Inouye began his political career as a member of \nHawaii's Territorial House of Representatives in 1954. Almost \nimmediately, his colleagues tapped him as the majority leader of that \nbody. His tremendous leadership ability was already apparent. He then \nascended to the Territorial Senate in 1958, and became Hawaii's first \nU.S. Congressman upon the granting of statehood in 1959. Only 3 years \nlater, Daniel Inouye became a U.S. Senator. He was elected to a \nstaggering 9 consecutive terms, continuing to serve until his passing. \nIt is a testament to his effectiveness as a Senator and his devotion to \nhis State that no challenger ever mounted a serious threat for his \nseat.\n  Through his hard work in the U.S. Senate, Senator Inouye helped to \nensure that Hawaii's economy and people prospered. As a member, and \nlater chairman, of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Inouye \nskillfully secured myriad infrastructure, natural resource, cultural, \njob training, and agriculture projects for his State. As a member of \nthe Appropriations Committee I learned valuable lessons by observing \nSenator Inouye over the years. He understood the art of the deal, \nalways operating out of mutual respect toward shared interests. And I \ncan not recall a time when he did not deliver for the people of Hawaii. \nWhile he never lost focus on the interests of his State, he also \nmaintained eternal vigilance on matters of national security. As a war \nhero, his attention to veteran affairs and military needs was \nunsurpassed.\n  In addition, Senator Inouye served as the first chairman of the \nSelect Committee on Intelligence. As a former Chairman of this \ncommittee, I was honored to carry forward the rigorous oversight \nexample he set. By the time his career ended, Senator Inouye had become \nthe second longest serving senator in U.S. history.\n  His list of accomplishments and honors is seemingly unending. In \nfact, it is among the most impressive compiled by any who ever set foot \nin this Chamber.\n  Senator Inouye never talked about any of this. He was not brash or \nboastful or domineering. Rather, he carried himself with quiet reserve \nand firm resolve.\n  Senator Inouye's life story speaks for itself and demonstrates a \nfaith in and devotion to our country second to none. He was one of the \nmost decent and inspiring people I have ever known. I am proud to have \nserved with this great man and to have called him a friend. I offer my \ndeepest condolences to his wife and family during this difficult time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. I ask unanimous consent I may speak on the Senate floor as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Senate Rules Changes\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, the Senate, of which I am a new Member, was \nat one time called the world's greatest deliberative body. Its rules \nhave remained largely unchanged since the origin of the Senate. This \nChamber's distinguishing attribute has undoubtedly been its right of \nunlimited debate and its greatest protections are the rules put in \nplace to defend that right of debate.\n  I am worried about the talk now of destroying any Senator's ability \nto filibuster, to delay consideration of a bill, because it is a \nfundamental right of all Senators to express their opposition to \nlegislation even when that Senator stands alone--when you are the only \none who opposes that legislation. This is an important right, \nprotecting a Senator's right to object and a Senator's right to \nrepresent his or her own constituency.\n  Something tells me the desire to curb this unlimited debate of the \nSenate doesn't really come from a failure of the Senate's rules but, \nrather, a desire by some to see that an agenda can be pushed through by \nignoring that minority right, by overriding the objections of an \nindividual Senator on behalf of his or her constituents.\n  The rules of the Senate should not be targeted for change until we \nlook at what the problems are in the way we conduct our business \ncurrently. For so long--again, I have only been here 2 years, but for \nthe 2 years I have been here, it seems to me that often the majority \nhas obstructed the ideal of unlimited debate and put undue stress on \nthe rules of our Chamber. The practice of the majority party has \nprevented me and my colleagues from contributing to the legislative \nprocess in several ways. Rather than encourage debate and compromise by \nwelcoming amendments, often, as we say here, ``the tree has been \nfilled,'' or, in the way we would say it in Kansas, we fill up the \nopportunity for amendments with certain amendments that then preclude \nother amendments being considered, that being the amendments of the \nrest of us.\n  In addition to that, the majority leader has filed cloture more than \n100 times on the very day the measure was first raised on the Senate \nfloor, which basically ends debate on that day.\n  We get compromise whenever everyone, the majority and minority, have \nthe opportunity to present their points of view. Then we sit down and \ntry to figure out the difference, how we can make things work among \nourselves. We have seen rule XIV used to bypass committee work nearly \n70 times in the last 6 years.\n  I am honored to serve on a long list of committees in the Senate and \nI attend many committee meetings and we hold hearings. We listen to our \nconstituents, we listen to the experts, and we try to reach a \nconclusion as to what is best in a piece of legislation. When that \nprocess is bypassed, we lose that opportunity to gain from that \ninsight.\n  In so many instances the committee process is bypassed. I am a member \nof the Senate Appropriations Committee, with the example of our \ninability to have appropriations bills and no budget. I am a member of \nthe Banking Committee on which we have lots of hearings but very few \nmarkups. I think it undermines the ability for each of us to do our \njobs on behalf of America.\n  I think we have been forced away from what is most valuable here--\ndiscussions. Not that any of us gets our own way. That is not the \nnature of this place. It is not the nature of America. But we each have \nour own voice, and by being able to express ourselves we have the \nopportunity to flesh out the best ideas and ultimately to require \npeople to come together and reach an agreement--that word that \nsometimes is not said often enough--compromise.\n  I recognize this as a Member of the Senate representing the State of \nKansas. I consider my State often in the\n\n[[Page S8253]]\n\nminority. We are very rural. The issues we care about are different \nthan those of places in the rest of the country. I represent a small \npopulation and many of my colleagues represent large urban areas with \nlarge populations. In the absence of rules protecting me as a Senator \nrepresenting a minority, I think my ability to represent that minority \nis diminished. I recognize that I do not always have the right answer \nto every question. I have great respect for everyone's opinion. I was \nnever ordained by God to have all the answers to every problem, but I \nthink we find answers by having respect and listening to others, and to \nsort out what we think is the best of our ideas and the best of other \nideas to see that good things happen on behalf of America.\n  We need to make certain that Republicans and Democrats have the \nopportunity to defend their opinions and then come together. We need to \nmake certain the legislative process works in the committee and we need \nto make certain that we are not precluded from standing here, day after \nday, in opposition to legislation that we believe is bad for America. \nIt is the Senate that has the opportunity to keep bad things from \nhappening.\n  Again, I worry that as a result of the lack of function of the Senate \nover the last years that we are going to make dramatic changes in the \nrules that change the nature of this body, who we are and what we can \naccomplish, what our purpose is.\n  We need to work together, no doubt about it, but the idea of changing \nthe rules, in my view, diminishes the need to do so. Our constituents \nexpect us to represent them and their best interests and that means \nthat we have the right--the necessity--of participating in the \nlegislative process. I owe that to Kansas. I owe them nothing less. \nWithout the right to use the filibuster to stop consideration of a bill \nuntil all ideas, all issues are heard, we risk the loss of that \ndissenting voice for a minority--no matter what party may be in power.\n  Previous Members of the Senate have understood the importance of \nprotecting the minority's rights and have spoken out in defense of \nunlimited debate as it exists in the Senate today. I worry that the \nSenate is becoming a different place. As I studied history, there was \nalways the voice of the institution, the Senator who had been here for \na long time. There was the collective wisdom that, yes, we are in the \nminority now--or we are in the majority now--but that someday it will \nbe the reverse, and we want the rules to apply no matter what the \nposition. It seems to me that in the past, Members of the Senate would \nspeak out--whether a Democrat or Republican--for the institution of the \nSenate and what it means to the American people and the Constitution of \nthe United States.\n  The late Senator Byrd once said this about the design of the Senate:\n\n       The Senate was intended to be a forum for open and free \n     debate and for the protection of political minorities. As \n     long as the Senate retains the power to amend and the power \n     of unlimited debate, the liberties of the people will remain \n     secure.\n\n  When then-Senator Joe Biden was a part of this Chamber, he once said \nin defense of the filibuster:\n\n       At its core, the filibuster is not about stopping a nominee \n     or a bill, it is about compromise and moderation.\n\n  In 2005, when Republicans controlled the Senate and President Obama \nwas a Senator, he said:\n\n       If the majority chooses to end the filibuster--if they \n     choose to change the rules and put an end to democratic \n     debate--then fighting and bitterness and the gridlock will \n     only get worse.\n\n  I think this statement applies today. I am tired of the fighting, \nbitterness, and gridlock. The American people do not want to see even \nmore partisan bickering in Washington, DC. They want us to work \ntogether and solve our Nation's problems. They want us to get things \ndone.\n  Preserving the rules of the Senate is not a partisan issue, but it is \nabout protecting the nature of the Senate and the rights of the \nminority. Without the ability to compromise or debate on the floor of \nthe Senate, I fear the greatest deliberative body will be drastically \nchanged for the worse.\n  The original design of the Senate enables each Senator to be equal to \none another no matter the party label, and each has the right to \nprotect using the filibuster. If we choose to silence the Senators in \nthe minority now for the sake of political expediency and lower the \nnumber of votes needed for a bill to pass without dissent, then we risk \nchanging the very nature of the Senate.\n  I see this as a former Member of the House of Representatives. I am \naccustomed--after 14 years--to having these words spoken: I yield to \nthe gentleman from Kansas 60 seconds.\n  The Senate is different from the House. We are entitled to more than \n60 seconds of being able to speak in support or in opposition to issues \nbefore the Senate. If that filibuster were to be destroyed, and if the \nlast protection of the rights of the minority were to be disregarded, \nthen the Senate would become substantially no different from the House. \nIt would be marked by limited debate where the majority runs against \nthe basic nature of the Senate rules based largely upon population.\n  When the Republicans were in control of the Senate in 2005, Senator \nReid, our majority leader, said:\n\n       The threat to change the Senate rules is a raw abuse of \n     power and will destroy the very checks and balances our \n     Founding Fathers put in place to prevent absolute power by \n     any one branch of government.\n\n  It is my belief that the Senate still exists today in the form that \nthe Framers intended and that we must put a stop to this raw abuse of \npower. The Senate represents the embodiment of freedom of speech, and \nwe should encourage the full exercise of our hard-won freedoms and \nunlimited debate. This tradition stands as a testament to the \nsacrifices of generations of early Americans and Americans throughout \nthe history of our country. This freedom is one that will certainly be \nfought for in this Congress and the next.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Tributes to Departing Senators\n\n                               Herb Kohl\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Madam President, I rise to pay tribute to a \nman who has been generous with his time, his treasure, and his heart, \nto his friends, his family, the State of Wisconsin, and to America, \nSenator Herb Kohl.\n  America and Wisconsin have always been defined by immigrants arriving \nin this country seeking freedom, opportunity, and a better life for \nthemselves and their families. Such was the case for Senator Kohl's \nfather Max, an immigrant from Poland, and his mother Mary, an immigrant \nfrom Russia. Their family's story was just one among the many millions \nof stories of fulfillment of the American dream.\n  Max and Mary's son Herb attended Washington High School in the \nSherman Park neighborhood of Milwaukee. He graduated from the \nUniversity of Wisconsin Madison in 1956 and went on to earn an MBA from \nHarvard Business School in 1958.\n  Senator Kohl's service to his country started at a young age. He \nenlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve after receiving his MBA and served in \nthe military for 6 years. After his military service, he began \ncontributing to our Nation not in government but in the private sector. \nDuring the 1970s, he managed his family's well-known retail businesses. \nThe stores built by the Kohl family remain the legacy that all \nWisconsin respects and appreciates.\n  When Wisconsin's NBA team, the Milwaukee Bucks, was considering \nmoving out of the State for financial reasons, Citizen Kohl stepped in \nand purchased the franchise. He prevented the team from leaving and \npreserved professional basketball as an integral part of Wisconsin's \nstrong sports tradition. Suffice it to say, Citizen Kohl had \nestablished himself as a very successful member of this Nation's \nbusiness community. But he didn't hoard his financial success; he \nshared it and he shared it generously.\n  Senator Kohl's philanthropy was widespread, but he particularly \nseemed to enjoy directing his generosity to\n\n[[Page S8254]]\n\nhelping Wisconsin students and educators. In 1990, he established the \nHerb Kohl Educational Foundation Achievement Award Program. This \nprogram provides a total of $400,000 to hundreds of students, teachers, \nand schools throughout the State of Wisconsin each and every year. In \n1995, Senator Kohl continued his generosity to education and sports in \nour State by donating $25 million to the University of Wisconsin \nMadison for a new sports arena. The Kohl Center, as it is now known, is \nthe home for the school's basketball and hockey teams.\n  Senator Kohl was first elected in 1988 and even though his duties \nrequired him to spend time in Washington, his heart has always been \nwith the people of Wisconsin. For the past 24 years, he has maintained \na strong passion for Wisconsin's children, seniors, farmers, and \nmanufacturers.\n  As a man whose life has been distinguished by generosity, it is worth \nnoting that his final speech on the floor of the Senate was not a long \nlist of his many accomplishments; instead, it was a short heartfelt \nspeech of gratitude to those who made him the generous man he is today, \nthose he served with, and those he represented in the Senate for four \nconsecutive terms. Now it is our turn to thank Senator Kohl for the \nhonorable 24 years he has served his State and this Nation.\n  During his first election, the slogan of Senator Kohl's campaign was \n``Nobody's Senator but Yours.'' There can be no doubt in anyone's mind \nthat he has lived up to that promise each and every day.\n  On behalf of all the citizens of Wisconsin, I wish to thank Senator \nHerb Kohl for his generous spirit and his many years of service to \nWisconsin and America.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\nDaniel Akaka, Jeff Bingaman, Scott Brown, Kent Conrad, Jim DeMint, Kay \nBailey Hutchison, Herb Kohl, Jon Kyl, Joseph Lieberman, Richard Lugar, \n                Ben Nelson, Olympia Snowe, and Jim Webb\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, at this time, I wish to take a few minutes \nto salute my colleagues who are retiring at the end of this year with \nthe conclusion of the 112th Congress: Daniel Akaka of Hawaii, Jeff \nBingaman of New Mexico, Scott Brown of Massachusetts, Kent Conrad of \nNorth Dakota, Jim DeMint of South Carolina, Kay Bailey Hutchison of \nTexas, Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, Jon Kyl of Arizona, Joseph Lieberman of \nConnecticut, Richard Lugar of Indiana, Ben Nelson of Nebraska, Olympia \nSnowe of Maine, and Jim Webb of Virginia. They have all worked \nceaselessly to give their constituents the best representation and give \nthe country the benefit of their views, their wisdom, and their \nexperience. They are men and women who are committed to the Nation, and \nthey have every day in different ways contributed to this Senate and to \nour great country.\n  I wish to thank them personally for their service, and, in so many \ncases, their personal kindness to me; for listening to my points and \nfor, together, hopefully, serving this Senate and this Nation in a more \npositive and progressive way.\n  In particular, let me say a few words about some of the Members with \nwhom I have had the privilege to work more closely.\n  Senator Daniel Akaka, like his colleague, the late and revered \nSenator Daniel Inouye, proudly served our Nation during World War II. I \nam stepping into the huge shoes of Danny Akaka as the cochair of the \nArmy Caucus. From one soldier to another, I salute him.\n  He has also been an extraordinarily forceful advocate not just for \nactive-duty personnel but for veterans and, of course, for the men and \nwomen of his beloved Hawaii.\n  Jeff Bingaman has distinguished himself through his work on the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee to improve our Nation's energy \npolicy, particularly improving our energy efficiency. He has the vision \nand knowledge which he has displayed so many times to deal with the \ndifficult issues that face us with respect to the appropriate use of \nenergy.\n  He has also focused on some of the greatest challenges facing our \neducational system, including preventing dropouts and promoting the use \nof education technology.\n  Scott Brown has drawn from his over 30 years of experience in the \nNational Guard to advocate for our servicemembers. I am particularly \npleased we were able to work together to create the new Office of \nService Member Affairs at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n  I have had the honor of serving with Kay Bailey Hutchison on the West \nPoint Board of Visitors, and I am also grateful that she joined with me \non a bill to improve care for children who survive cancer.\n  Joe Lieberman and I have worked many hours to protect the submarine \nindustrial base that is crucial not only to our strategic posture but \nalso to our local economies. He has done it with great vision and great \nenergy, and I thank him for that.\n  Richard Lugar is one of the most decent and thoughtful individuals \never to serve in this body. We will miss his wisdom and his voice, \nparticularly on nuclear nonproliferation and arms control. I am also \npleased to have joined him on so many other issues, and he leaves an \nextraordinary mark on this institution.\n  I have also had the privilege to work closely with another Member of \nthis body, my colleague and friend, Olympia Snowe of Maine. Her \nwillingness to reach across the partisan divide to advance legislation \nto benefit the Nation and the Senate and her State of Maine is, in my \nview, legendary. I was pleased to work with her when it came to \nsupporting our fishermen and lobstermen, who are critical to our local \neconomies. She and I have worked closely together on a host of other \nissues, including supporting strong investments in LIHEAP and our \nNation's libraries.\n  Jim Webb, a decorated combat veteran, is someone whose love for this \nNation was manifested very early, as he led marines in combat in \nVietnam. His extraordinary courage is only matched by his quiet \ndemeanor and his calm sense of confidence that project outward in every \ndifferent capacity.\n  Of course, he has taken it upon himself to make sure we do not forget \nour veterans. He was the architect of the post-9/11 GI bill and, in \ndoing so, he has enriched the lives of so many who were willing to risk \ntheir lives for this Nation. I, again, salute him for all he has done.\n  Kent Conrad is an extraordinary budget chairman. No one knows more \nabout the intricacies of the budget and no one brings to that very \ndifficult debate more of an innate sense of fairness and decency than \nKent Conrad.\n  I could go on with all of my colleagues, just thanking them for their \nfriendship, for their camaraderie, and for their commitment to the \nNation and the Senate. As they depart, they have left an extraordinary \nlegacy. Now it is our responsibility to carry on in so many different \nways, and I hope we measure up to what they have done. If we do, then \nwe can go forward confidently.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                             Joe Lieberman\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I wish to say a few words about my \nfriend Joe Lieberman, the gentleman from Connecticut.\n  Shortly after I arrived in the Senate, Senator Lieberman was assigned \nto serve as my mentor--someone from the other side of the aisle who \nwould be a source of wisdom and guidance as I made my way in my first \nterm in the Senate.\n  I considered myself extremely fortunate that he agreed to mentor me. \nWe are both from New England. We both had the privilege of serving our \nState as attorney general and have a deep respect for the rule of law. \nAnd we are both deeply concerned about issues impacting the security of \nour country.\n  Over the last 2 years, I have been able to work with Senator \nLieberman more closely, and I have personally seen his character, his \ncourage, and his conviction. Both in tone and in substance, Senator \nLieberman has been one of the most respected and effective statesmen in \nthe history of this institution--someone who transcended politics to \nstand up for what he believed in\n\n[[Page S8255]]\n\nand what he believed was right on behalf of our country.\n  Senator Lieberman understands that neither party has a monopoly on \ngood ideas and that the American people expect Members of both parties \nto work together to get things done on behalf of our country.\n  Senator Lieberman understands that our children will not ask us \nwhether we were Democrats or Republicans and how good we were at that, \nat being a member of a party; they will ask us whether we were willing \nto make the tough decisions necessary to ensure that they continue to \nenjoy prosperity and freedom in the greatest country on Earth.\n  What I admire about my friend Joe Lieberman is that he is someone who \nalways puts country first above all else. For Senator Lieberman, this \nhas been especially true in the area of national security and homeland \nsecurity.\n  As our Nation has encountered difficult economic headwinds at home--\nover $16 trillion in debt--there have been Members of both parties who \nhave argued for excessive cuts to our military and that we disengage \nfrom the rest of the world. Yet, in the great traditions of Presidents \nTruman, Kennedy, and Reagan, Senator Lieberman has made the compelling \ncase that the United States best promotes its values and protects its \ncitizens when we remain engaged around the world, maintaining our \nmilitary strength, having the best military in the world.\n  Having had the chance to work with Senator Lieberman on the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, his commitment to our men and women in \nuniform has been inspiring. He has shown a deep commitment to make sure \nthey have the best equipment they need and that we remain the strongest \nmilitary in the world; and that when our soldiers come home, they \nreceive the support they need. He has been such an amazing advocate for \nthe military and their families.\n  I also appreciate that like Winston Churchill, Senator Lieberman \nunderstands the value of alliances between democracies and has spoken \nwith moral clarity regarding the enemies of freedom. He has not \nhesitated to call terrorism an evil by its name and to speak out for \ndissidents and freedom fighters around the world.\n  I will never forget a trip I had the privilege of taking with him to \nAsia, where we had the opportunity to meet individuals who were \nimprisoned. And they spoke with tears in their eyes of the work Senator \nLieberman and Senator McCain and others had done to speak up on their \nbehalf.\n  Senator Lieberman has spoken for those who have been oppressed around \nthe world time and time again, and he has left his legacy on this \ninstitution in making sure that America stands for our values and for \npeople around the world who are struggling for basic human rights and \nfreedom.\n  In this Chamber, he will also, of course, be remembered for the \nincredibly important work he did as a strong and resolute member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee but also as the chairman of the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. He helped to lead \nthe Federal Government's response to September 11, to those horrible \nattacks on our country, and every American is safer because of the work \nJoe Lieberman did as chairman of that committee, and the work he did on \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee in this body--and the work I know \nhe will continue to do when he leaves the Senate.\n  My friend Joe Lieberman represents the very best of public service. \nHe has stood firm for freedom, international engagement, and American \nmilitary strength. He will be remembered among Members of this body not \nonly for his accomplishments but for the way he has conducted himself. \nAlways a gentleman, he has conducted himself with great decency, \ncivility, and humility.\n  At a time when our country faces great challenges, his quiet and \neffective leadership and commitment to working across party lines will \nbe sorely missed in this body. He will certainly continue to serve as a \nmodel for all of us who remain serving in the Senate, and I know in \nfuture endeavors I will certainly seek him out to seek his advice and \ncounsel, as we face great challenges not only here at home but also in \nterms of our military and the role America plays in the world.\n  We all admire his leadership here, and it has been a true privilege \nfor me to have had him mentor me the last 2 years. I have learned so \nmuch from him. And, again, I think he serves as a model public servant \nof what it means to be committed to doing the right thing for your \ncountry.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COONS). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Remembering Daniel K. Inouye\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to salute my colleague, Senator \nDan Inouye, and remember him for his great service to our country. Like \nso many of my colleagues, I come down to the Senate floor with a great \ndeal of sadness but also admiration for the incredible life that Danny \nInouye led.\n  He certainly was a giant among Senators, and for the work he did--\neverything from investigating Watergate to fighting for Native Hawaiian \nrights, to everything he did in the United States every day--he will be \nremembered as a man who fought for justice. When I think about Danny \nInouye and the mentoring he has done for me and my colleague Senator \nMurray and for the State of Washington, I can tell you he will be \nsorely missed.\n  We know something about long-term Senators in the State of \nWashington. Certainly, Danny Inouye and Scoop and Maggie were all \nfriends. He was also a friend to Washington State. He forged a great \nrelationship with Scoop and Maggie. That started when Scoop Jackson \nactually championed statehood for Hawaii starting as early as the late \n1940s. He played a key role in supporting it and passing it into the \nHawaii Statehood Act. That is something Danny Inouye was so \nappreciative of. They forged a great relationship.\n  Senator Inouye and Senator Maggie were great friends and mentors. I \nhad the opportunity many years ago to hear both of them at Senator \nMagnuson's house in Seattle reminisce about their days together. Some \nof those stories I could share on the floor; some I could not. But they \nwere longtime friends.\n  The one story that is written about in Warren Magnuson's biography by \nShelby Scates is a story about how, when Mount St. Helens blew up, \nSenator Magnuson went to Senator Inouye and said: We need about $1 \nbillion to help for the cleanup of Mount St. Helens.\n  You can imagine in 1980 what a tremendous amount of money that would \nbe. Senator Inouye said: Senator Magnuson, we have volcanoes blowing up \nall the time in Hawaii, and we never get a dime.\n  Magnuson responded: Just wait, it will be your turn soon.\n  So these are two incredible individuals who forged a relationship \nand, along with Jackson, were some of the big giants of our day in the \nSenate. We in the State of Washington certainly benefited greatly from \nSenator Inouye's incredible help and support. I know he traveled to our \nState many times at my request and participated in many different \nevents. Probably one of the most important things he did for us in the \nState of Washington was the Puyallup land claim settlement and how \nSenator Inouye led the fight as the chairman of the Indian Affairs \nCommittee to make sure the right thing was done.\n  Together with Congressman Norm Dicks, we had a very difficult \nsituation. The Puyallup Tribe, the Port and the City of Tacoma, and \nothers all had a difficult dispute going on. The end result was the \nsecond largest Native American land claim settlement in U.S. history. \nThe deal led to tremendous economic growth for the tribe, for the port, \nand for the surrounding committees.\n  Senator Inouye, as I said, was the chairman of the Select Committee \non Indian Affairs in 1980 when the Puyallup Tribe successfully sued to \nassert\n\n[[Page S8256]]\n\nits claim for land around its reservation. This land included the Port \nof Tacoma, many parts of downtown Tacoma, and the towns of Fife and \nPuyallup. Because of his strong commitment to Native American rights, \nthe Puyallup Tribe trusted Senator Inouye to serve as an intermediary \nbetween the parties involved in the negotiation to try to resolve this \ndispute. He made around a dozen trips to Washington State at key \nmoments of this negotiation.\n  If you can imagine, a Senator who has to represent his State, be a \nleader on the Appropriations Committee, and who would spend so much \ntime on one particular dispute.\n  During one tense session at a Tacoma hotel, Senator Inouye described \nhis role as ``messenger boy,'' running between tribal negotiators on \nthe second floor and non-Indian negotiators on the fifth floor. By his \nown estimate, he shuttled between those two floors 21 times. His \ntireless commitment and work helped keep the negotiations moving along. \nFinally, in 1988, a deal was struck and the settlement was passed into \nlaw in 1989.\n  The tribe relinquished claims to land it originally held. In \nexchange, they received $162 million that included 200 acres of \ndisputed land. Of this total, $77 million were Federal funds, which \nSenator Inouye and Congressman Dicks worked to obtain.\n  When Senator Inouye was asked about the Federal Government's \ncontribution toward the settlement, he replied: ``I got my training \nfrom Magnuson.''\n  For the Puyallup Tribe, the results have been dramatic. Today the \ntribe is one of the largest employers in Pierce County, and it is \nmoving forward with its port development partnership. The Puyallups \nhave become a prominent leader for other tribes in important areas such \nas protecting natural resources, providing law enforcement, and \nimproving health care.\n  As for the Port of Tacoma, the results have been impressive as well. \nWith the settlement, the port was able to tear down the Blair Bridge \nand open the waterways to the world's largest container ships. Removing \nthe uncertainty of land ownership and relocating Highway 509 also \nunlocked land in the upper Blair Waterway for development, and a lot of \nnew development occurred.\n  According to the port, these improvements provided 43,000 jobs in \nPierce County. The volume of cargo at the port has nearly doubled, \ngrowing from 782,000 containers in 1988 to nearly 1.5 million \ncontainers in 2011. Now the Port of Tacoma handles more containers than \nits friendly rival to the north, the Port of Seattle, so it is \nsomething they very much take with great pride.\n  Senator Inouye has stood with Washingtonians on an issue that was so \nimportant to us and has led to so much growth and economic development, \nand only his leadership provided the necessary oversight to navigate \nthis thorny issue. He also has helped us on many other issues, \nprotecting salmon and our other fisheries, fighting for Native \nAmericans and supporting strong defense and veterans' issues.\n  He certainly will be remembered in the Northwest as a true friend. \nOur Nation's veterans had no greater friend than Senator Inouye. But \nwhen it came time to pass national legislation recognizing the \nJapanese-American veterans' contributions to our country during World \nWar II, he let others take the lead, knowing he, himself, would also be \nan honorary recipient of this award.\n  During a ceremony in November of 2001, with the other Nisei veterans \nat his side, Senator Inouye accepted the Congressional Gold Medal on \nbehalf of the 100th Infantry Battalion, the 442nd Regimental Combat \nTeam, and the Military Intelligence Service.\n  In his remarks, Senator Inouye said, ``Seventy years ago, we were \nenemy aliens, but today, this great Nation honors us in this special \nceremony.'' I can tell you because there were many Nisei veterans from \nthe Pacific Northwest who traveled to our Nation's Capital to \nparticipate in that event. Their families were so honored to be there \nwith their parents and to honor them in this great ceremony. It would \nnot have happened if it had not been for Senator Inouye's incredible \nleadership.\n  He also successfully fought to honor the veterans who served in the \nCommonwealth Army of the Philippines on the side of the United States \nduring World War II. Because of a law passed in 1946, their service was \nnot recognized. They were denied access to health care and given only \nhalf the disability and death compensation of U.S. veterans.\n  Senator Inouye changed that. Over the years, he secured nearly $200 \nmillion in compensation for Filipino veterans, and he fought to grant \nFilipino veterans the same access as U.S. veterans to VA hospitals.\n  Senator Inouye's strong sense of honor and justice drove him to fight \nfor the recognition of these veterans' service. He was fond of saying \n``justice is a matter of continuing education.''\n  For that reason, he also made sure injustices endured by U.S. \ncitizens and permanent residents of Japanese ancestry during World War \nII will never be forgotten. He led passage of the Civil Liberties Act \nof 1988, which acknowledged their forced internment and provided \ncompensation for those surviving detainees. Senator Inouye also \nunderstood that recognizing and honoring the service of these veterans \nmeant helping them prosper as they were entering civilian life.\n  I was proud to work with Senator Inouye and my colleague Senator \nMurray on the VOW to Hire Heroes Act of 2011. Because of the act, \nbusinesses that hire qualified veterans can get tax credits up to \n$9,600. Back in April of this year, Senator Inouye and I visited a \ncompany in Seattle, VECA, which hires primarily veterans, and I can \ntell you they were so happy to meet him. They were so excited to see \none of our Nation's true heroes and to honor him by talking about the \nservice they were trying to give back to our country.\n  From the battlefields of World War II to the Halls of Congress, \nSenator Inouye brought grace, charm, and an unbelievable sense of duty \nto our country. He truly was a giant of a statesman, not just in Hawaii \nbut in the State of Washington.\n  A few years ago, Senator Inouye was visiting some underprivileged \nchildren in Hawaii to see the digital media center he helped support. \nOne of the students he met said, ``I feel like I met one of the most \nimportant people in the world.''\n  I couldn't agree more. Senator Inouye's legacy and impact cannot be \noverstated. He was an old-school Senator who was always courteous, \nrespectful to his colleagues no matter what the circumstances, and he \nwill not be forgotten.\n  I join our Nation in praying for his wife Irene, his son Ken, and \ndaughter-in-law Jessica, his stepdaughter Jennifer, and his \ngranddaughter Maggie. I hope they understand how much we appreciate \nthem sharing him with us and all he did.\n  His service to our country will not be forgotten, and it certainly \nwill be impossible to match.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I come \nhere today to talk about my friend: Senator Danny Inouye. Danny was a \nfriend of mine since I came to the Senate 20 years ago. He had a unique \nability to connect with people, to befriend them. I know. He always \nhelped me. He was smart, able and someone that over 20 years I grew to \nlove.\n  He was a war hero who fought bravely in World War II, even at a time \nwhen many in this country actively discriminated against Japanese-\nAmericans.\n  And he served in this body for 50 years--the second longest serving \nSenator of all time.\n  Danny and I worked closely together on the Appropriations Committee \nfor many years. I often sought his counsel, and he was always an \nadvocate for me.\n  I want to say something personally to his beloved wife Irene: You \nwere married to a truly wonderful man and an American hero. Death of a \nloved one is hard. I know. I have been through it. But, Irene, the love \ndoes remain. I know you were so proud to be his wife, to help him share \nhis dreams through these years.\n  I want you to know that you have many friends here, who now want to \nhelp you through this most difficult part of life.\n  Danny, you will be greatly missed.\n  Thank you for your service, thank you for your friendship.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, it was with great sadness \non\n\n[[Page S8257]]\n\nMonday that we learned of the passing of a member of our Senate family, \nSenator Daniel Inouye. My deepest sympathy goes out to his wife, Irene, \nhis son, Kenny, and to all of his family. I also extend my sympathy to \nthe great people of Hawaii, who have lost one of their champions.\n  Over the past few days, I have heard my colleagues pay tribute to \nthis wonderful man. They have used words such as statesman, public \nservant, hero, patriot, leader, mentor, and champion. Each of these \ntributes is without a doubt deserved. I echo all of these accolades, \nbut above all I was honored to call Senator Inouye ``friend.''\n  Senator Inouye and I served on two committees together, with him \nserving as my Chairman on both of those committees: Indian Affairs and \nAppropriations. The lessons I learned from him will forever be with me. \nHis commitment to American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native \nHawaiians was unparalleled. In our home States, we both have large \npopulations of Native people and his leadership on these issues has \ntaught me that our work is never done when it comes to bettering the \nlives of our first people. I had the opportunity to work with him on a \nnumber of important issues impacting South Dakota Natives over the \nyears, and I very much appreciated his visit to South Dakota in 2002 to \nconduct a hearing in Rapid City on Native issues.\n  A man of quiet reflection, Danny was a giant among men. A Medal of \nHonor recipient for his efforts in World War II and recipient of two \nPurple Hearts, he was a true American hero. His acts of valor during \nthe war are nothing short of legendary. His care for veterans rivals \nthat of any past or present Member of this body.\n  To put Senator Inouye's service into perspective, eight Members of \nthis Chamber had not even been born when Danny was sworn into his first \nterm as the third Senator from the State of Hawaii. Not many Senators \nin the history of this Chamber have done more for their home States \nthan what Senator Inouye did for his beloved Hawaii. His legacy is \nspread far and wide throughout the Hawaiian Islands.\n  Senator Inouye will be greatly missed in this Chamber. His mark on \nthis body and on his home State of Hawaii shall be felt for generations \nto come. Aloha, my friend.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in remembrance of \nan incredible statesman and American hero, Senator Daniel Inouye of \nHawaii. Senator Inouye passed away Monday evening, and to say that his \nleadership will be missed would be a tremendous understatement--not \nonly of his influence as a policymaker but of his iconic status as a \npillar of the Senate.\n  In terms of political longevity, he follows only Robert Byrd as the \nsecond longest serving Member in Senate history. This is significant \nbecause second place never came naturally for Senator Inouye. He was, \nafter all, the face of so many ``firsts'' for our country and for his \nState. In 1959, he became the first ever Asian American to serve in the \nUnited States Congress, elected during Hawaii's first ever federal \nelection cycle, representing the State as part of its first ever \ncongressional delegation.\n  He almost added another impressive ``first'' to his resume, when \nMinnesota's own Hubert Humphrey put Dan at the top of his short list \nfor running mates in the 1968 presidential election.\n  But perhaps the greatest legacy Senator Inouye will leave behind is \nhis record of standing up for our men and women in uniform. As Chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee and the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee, he revolutionized the way our country serves those who \nhave served for us--not just on the battlefield, but also here at home \nin the form of stronger benefits for veterans and better support for \nmilitary families.\n  Senator Inouye knew a thing or two about service. He enlisted in the \nArmy after the attack on Pearl Harbor and fought for our country on the \nfront lines during World War II. He did it despite our government's \ndecision to place his own people, Japanese Americans, in internment \ncamps because he believed that he and his family owed the United States \nan ``un-repayable debt.'' I would argue that he paid back that debt and \nmuch, much more.\n  To this day, the unit of all Japanese-American soldiers that he \nserved with is the most decorated in history for its size and length of \ncommitment. Senator Inouye himself earned a Bronze Star, a \nDistinguished Service Cross and, eventually, the Congressional Medal of \nHonor.\n  The story of how he earned it--and how he lost his right arm--is the \nstuff of legend. A grenade exploded near his right elbow during a \nfirefight in Italy, shredding his arm and severing his hand just as he \nwas preparing to throw a grenade of his own. Afraid the weapon might \ndetonate in his nearly severed right first, Senator Inouye used his \nleft hand to pry it out and throw it towards enemy lines. He was, and \nis, a true America hero.\n  From his decorated military career to his long-time service for \nHawaii, Senator Inouye was a dedicated public servant. Humble to the \nend, Senator Inouye was and always will be known as a true gentleman in \nthe Senate. Aloha, Senator Inouye.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. With his family at his side, the last \nword spoken by Senator Daniel Inouye in this life was ``aloha.'' To the \npeople of Hawaii, it is a word with a meaning far beyond simply \n``hello'' or ``goodbye.'' It is a word of profound significance, one \nthat describes a spirit of service to others, of compassion, and \nreverence.\n  It is the best possible epitaph for my cherished friend and \ncolleague.\n  Dan Inouye lived that spirit every day of a long and remarkable life. \nWhen Pearl Harbor was attacked on December 7, 1941, he was there, \nserving as a medical volunteer in the most horrific and dangerous \ncircumstances. When the ban on Japanese Americans serving in the U.S. \nmilitary was lifted in 1943, he immediately enlisted. In the closing \ndays of World War II, when his platoon came under intense enemy fire, \nSecond Lieutenant Inouye led the attack, despite grievous wounds.\n  That extraordinary heroism earned Dan Inouye the Medal of Honor but \ncost him his right arm and his dream of becoming a surgeon. In the true \n``Aloha Spirit,'' he found another way to serve, first as a member of \nthe Hawaii Territorial Legislature, and then, when statehood was \nachieved in 1959, as Hawaii's first Member of Congress.\n  In 1962, Dan was elected to the Senate, beginning a half century of \ncontributions, accomplishments, and leadership on behalf of this \ninstitution and our Nation. He was the first Japanese American elected \nto the Congress and a stalwart champion of civil rights for all. He was \na decorated hero who fought for the rights and benefits of all \nveterans. From his daily work in the Senate to his exceptional service \non the Watergate and Iran-Contra committees, Dan approached every task \nwith the determination to do what was best for our country.\n  I was privileged to serve with Dan on the Appropriations Committee \nand honored to join him in the Gang of 14 to preserve the tradition of \nopen debate in the Senate. No matter how difficult the issue, he always \nconducted himself with dignity and civility.\n  In this time of sorrow, I offer my deep condolences to the Inouye \nfamily. I hope they will find comfort in knowing that this great \npatriot and public servant leave a legacy that will inspire Americans \nfor generations to come. And to Senator Daniel Inouye I say, aloha \npumehana, my friend. Farewell with my deepest regards and affection.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate having this opportunity to join \nmy colleagues in expressing not only my great sadness on the passing of \nSenator Inouye but my great appreciation of his lifetime of service to \nhis beloved Hawaii and to our Nation. Danny Inouye lived a full and \nactive life, and his great gifts enabled him to make a difference that \nwill continue to be felt for a long time to come.\n  I had the honor of introducing Danny Inouye during one of our Prayer \nBreakfasts earlier this year. Even though I thought I knew him pretty \nwell, as I read the interviews and personal reflections he had shared \non his life, I realized more than before the importance of the role he \nhad played over the years as he worked so very hard to make Hawaii all \nthat it is today.\n  Danny learned at an early age all about the importance of observing \nthe great values that served to help direct his life--love of country, \nlove of family, service to all those who needed his help, and, equally \nimportant, service to God. Over the years those great principles helped \nto make him a leader in\n\n[[Page S8258]]\n\nevery sense of the word as people looked to him for his leadership in \ndifficult times of both war and peace.\n  Over the years, he was often asked about his experience during World \nWar II and the impact it had on him. Danny would begin his reflections \nwhen he was a young man, still in high school and pursuing his dream of \na career in medicine. As so often happens in our lives, his life was \nchanged forever in a moment that began one morning as he was getting \nready for church. He heard a report on his radio that Pearl Harbor was \nbeing attacked. Without hesitation, Danny headed over to the base to \nsee what he could do to help those who had been injured. Danny had \nlearned a great deal about first aid, and his skills were put to good \nuse to help those who had been injured that day.\n  That was just the first part of Danny's story and his experience with \nthe war effort of those years. In the days to come it would present him \nwith one of the toughest challenges that anyone could have ever faced \nas he played an important role in the effort to protect our Nation and \nrestore peace to the world.\n  As he would continue with his story, Danny's war experiences told a \npowerful and compelling story about what so many of our Nation's \nveterans have experienced in battle. That is why Danny will always be \nknown as one of our great war heroes. Even with that standard, however, \nthere was something special about him and the courage and bravery he \nshowed on the battlefield. His efforts were so extraordinary they were \nrecognized with a Medal of Honor, one of our Nation's highest awards. \nThey place him on the roster of our most distinguished heroes, and they \nremind us all of the great sacrifices that he and so many of our \nveterans have made over the years to keep our Nation strong and free. \nThanks to Danny and those with whom he served, we were able to emerge \nfrom that world war victorious and bring peace and freedom to those \nnations that had been overrun by an evil alliance led by a ruthless \ndictator in Germany.\n  That was just the start of Danny's life, but it had taken a heavy \ntoll from him that would change it forever. With the loss of his arm, \nit was no longer possible for him to complete his dream of being a \nsurgeon. Those who knew him and his great caring heart urged him to \nfind another field in medicine to pursue. He decided to follow another \npath, and as we are told in the Bible, God had a hand in helping to \ndirect his steps.\n  As soon as he could, Danny attended George Washington University, my \nalma mater, and earned his law degree. He then became a part of the \neffort that would lead Hawaii to statehood. Danny knew the result would \nbring great changes to his home State and increase the opportunities \navailable to the people who lived there. Thanks in part to Danny, those \nefforts to achieve statehood were successful, and they resulted in the \naddition of Hawaii to the roster of our States--and placed another star \non the American flag he loved so dearly.\n  Danny knew that statehood would not be the end, it would be just the \nbeginning of the next great chapter in the history of Hawaii. Danny \nwanted to be a part of that effort, too, so he was encouraged to run to \nserve as Hawaii's first Representative in the House. He was successful, \nand his election to the Congress gave him an opportunity to take on \nanother leadership role--crafting the future of his beloved home State. \nOnce again, it brought out the best in him, as he dedicated himself to \nmaking Hawaii a better place for all those who called that special \nplace their home.\n  It wasn't long before Danny then ran for and won his election to the \nU.S. Senate. It began a Senate career that was to enable him to make a \ndifference in more ways than we will ever know. As he served here, he \ndid more than observe history or participate in it--he helped to write \nit day by day, chapter by chapter.\n  Danny's career has been so active, so full, and so productive, it \nwould be impossible to list all his achievements that make up his \nlegacy of service both here in the Senate and back home in Hawaii. One \nthing will always stand out in my mind, however--Danny's great loyalty \nto all those with whom he served. In every sense Danny was a gentleman \nand a gentle man. He had a quiet and understated way of doing his work \nday by day. He was man of great kindness, and he shared that kindness \nwith everyone he knew or worked with. His service as a Member of the \nSenate provided us with a great example of how we should all approach \nour duties and our work together, putting our country, our God, our \nfamily, and our home States first.\n  That is why Senators on both sides of the aisle have come to respect \nand appreciate him and his character so very much. I will long remember \nthe great friendship and close working relationship he had with Ted \nStevens. They shared such a strong bond that they often referred to \neach other as brothers. He had strong and supportive friendships with \nother Senators, too, and that is why we will all miss him so very much \nin the days and months to come.\n  I know I will never forget that Prayer Breakfast and all Danny had to \nshare with us that day. He had a great and powerful faith in God and \nthe special relationship they had built up over the years. It helped \nstrengthen him on the battlefield. It helped to guide his efforts when \nhe was called to serve the people of Hawaii. It gave him a source of \ninner strength that firmed his resolve as he worked to serve the people \nof our Nation.\n  By any and all standards, Danny Inouye lived a life we would all be \nproud of. He packed more into each day than some people experience in a \nlifetime. Although we had him with us for so many years, it still feels \nlike he was taken from us all too soon.\n  Now we come together to say goodbye to our colleague--confident in \nthe knowledge that he has made a difference in Hawaii and in Washington \nthat will continue to have an impact for many years to come. It is \noften said but always bears repeating that one person can make a \ndifference in the world that will equal their determination to do so. \nDanny is the proof of that, and his memory will continue to inspire all \nthose who knew him or will read about him and his great love for the \nUnited States of America.\n  As a grandfather, I will also long remember that day just a few years \nago when Danny became a grandfather, too--for the first time. It was a \nday he had long anticipated and looked forward to. It reminded me of \nhow much it means to all grandfathers to hold the next generation of \ntheir family in their arms and to be reminded of the great circle of \nlife and all that it means as the memories of the past give way to our \nhopes for the future. Now that grandchild will proudly carry the legacy \nDanny Inouye leaves behind to all those who knew and loved him. It is \nmore than a record of great achievements, it is a challenge he leaves \nto all those who will follow him to dare to try to do even greater \nthings than Danny Inouye has done.\n  God bless and be with you, Danny. Thanks for your service, but most \nespecially thanks for your friendship. Our faith reminds us that we \nwill be parted for only a short time and the day will come when we will \nsee you again. Until that time, you will be greatly missed and you will \nnever be forgotten. Diana and I will keep your family in our prayers. \nMay God bless and be with them all.\n\n\n                     Tributes to Departing Senators\n\n                              Kent Conrad\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there are many people in this town who say \nthey are worried about the deficit. But all too often, those claiming \nthe mantle of ``deficit hawk'' are pretty dovish about making the hard \ndecisions required to reduce the budget deficit and bring down the \nnational debt. Some use the deficit to argue for damaging important \nprograms that provide for the safety and well-being of Americans. \nOthers, in a brazen bit of obfuscation now decades-old, make the \ndisproven claim that the budget-busting tax cuts they prefer would \nactually reduce the deficit.\n  In this maze of distortion and debunked arguments, Kent Conrad is \nlike a clean prairie breeze. He cares deeply about the fiscal health of \nour Nation, and for more than two decades, he has been dismantling \nfaulty arguments and fuzzy budget math with facts and figures and with \ncharts, yes, charts. In naming Senator Conrad one of the 10 best \nSenators in 2006.\n\n[[Page S8259]]\n\n  Time magazine reported that the support staff here in the Senate had \nbecome so overwhelmed by Senator Conrad's chart requests that they gave \nup and gave him his own printing equipment. Kent Conrad doesn't just \nknow the facts. He wants you to know them too--and in bright colors.\n  Behind the flash charts are deep substantive knowledge and a rigorous \napproach that eschews wishful thinking. Senator Conrad knows that the \nway out of our deficit problem, the path that avoids the fiscal cliff, \nmeans looking at our entire budget picture, both the spending that goes \nout and the revenue that comes in. He laid out the facts recently here \non the Senate floor, saying:\n\n       The public understands we face both a spending and a \n     revenue problem. Spending is near a 60-year high, as this \n     chart shows. The red line is the spending line; the green \n     line is the revenue line. But for those who say it is just a \n     spending problem, I don't think the facts bear that out, \n     because the revenue is near a 60-year low. I think most \n     logical people would say we have to work both sides of this \n     equation.\n\n  This logical approach makes Senator Conrad a strong ally. I have been \nproud to join with him on efforts to end some of the many distortions \nand loopholes that increase the deficit and make our Tax Code less fair \nto working families. Earlier this year, he and I introduced the CUT \nLoopholes Act, which would reduce the deficit by $155 billion over 10 \nyears through elimination of several offshore tax loopholes, and \nthrough elimination of the stock-option loophole, which forces American \ntaxpayers to subsidize the large stock-option packages regularly \nawarded to corporate executives. In March, we were joined by Senator \nWhitehouse in advocating for inclusion of a portion of the CUT \nLoopholes Act in the Senate's surface transportation bill, and our \namendment was adopted by the Senate. It did not become law, but the \nSenate's action represented real progress in the fight against tax \nloopholes.\n  Senator Conrad and I have worked together on another important \nissue--the effort by many multinational corporations to secure a \n``repatriation'' tax break for some of the billions of dollars they \nhold offshore. That was tried once, in 2004, and as Senator Conrad \naccurately notes, that repatriation holiday was ``a complete and utter \nfailure at job generation.''\n  He also has been a forceful advocate for the need to address the tax \nrates on capital gains and dividend income. The low rates on these \nforms of income is a driver of our budget deficits and of rising income \ninequality. As Senator Conrad said in a recent interview about the need \nto address tax rates:\n\n       It's very clear to me. You do have to have rate increases, \n     especially on capital gains and dividends it's needed and \n     fair.\n\n  Not just needed, he said--fair. And that is what I think we should \nkeep in mind about Senator Conrad's work to address the deficit in an \nhonest and forthright way. Yes, he knows the facts and figures, knows \nthem as well as anyone. But knowing the numbers is not enough. Budget \nmath is not an academic exercise. We are not here to represent numbers \non spreadsheets. We represent people--actual human beings, with dreams \nand ambitions and hope. And always, Kent Conrad has marshaled the facts \nand figures in support of real people. He knows the toll that out-of-\ncontrol deficits can have on generations to come. He recognizes the \nneed to address rapidly rising entitlement spending--but also the need \nto preserve important programs that have made so much of a difference \nin the lives of Americans, especially the most vulnerable.\n  He and his wonderful wife Lucy have been dear friends to my wife \nBarbara and me. The four of us have hosted dinners together to deepen \nour understanding of both the pressing issues of the day and of \ntranscendent issues such as the origins of matter and the universe.\n  Senator Conrad is leaving the Senate, but the need for his kind of \nrigorous approach and concern for the impact of our policies is not \ngoing away. I hope we can learn from and follow his example as we move \nforward to confront our Nation's challenges.\n\n\n                               Ben Nelson\n\n  Mr. President, there are few issues we deal with on the Armed \nServices Committee in which the stakes are so high or the policy \nquestions so complex as in dealing with our Nation's strategic forces \nand capabilities. The fearsome power of our strategic weapons, the \nurgency of avoiding mistakes, the difficult strategic calculations they \nrequire, the advanced technologies involved, all of these combine to \nmake strategic forces complicated and of paramount importance.\n  It has also been the signature issue for Senator Ben Nelson during \nhis service on the Armed Services Committee. Chairman of the Strategic \nForces Subcommittee since 2009, Senator Nelson has long been one of the \nSenate's most thoughtful voices on issues related to our nuclear \narsenal, space programs, missile defense and other strategic issues. As \nhe prepares to leave the Senate, we are losing an outstanding \ncontributor to our nation's strategic thinking and decision-making.\n  Certainly the presence of Offut Air Force Base and U.S. Strategic \nCommand in Senator Nelson's home State give him first-hand evidence of \nthe importance of these issues. And appropriately, he brings a common-\nsense Nebraska viewpoint to our consideration of them.\n  Senator Nelson's efforts were important to the Senate's 2010 aproval \nof the New START treaty, a significant step forward in our nuclear arms \nreduction efforts. He made it clear in that debate that he is a firm \nbeliever in the need to ensure that the Department of Energy's nuclear \nweapons laboratories are modernized and able to support the existing \nnuclear stockpile so that we do not have to return to nuclear testing.\n  His common-sense approach has been especially noticeable in issues \ninvolving management of the nuclear weapons laboratories as they \nbalance the science behind stockpile stewardship and meeting day-to-day \nproblems with the deployed nuclear forces.\n  As Chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, he has helped \nensure strong oversight of and support for the development, testing and \ndeployment of effective ballistic missile defenses, including the \nPhased Adaptive Approach to missile defense in Europe that is already \nproviding protection for our forward deployed forces, our allies and \npartners against Iran's current and emerging ballistic missiles.\n  He has been an advocate for improving our deployed and planned \nhomeland ballistic missile defense capabilities, including efforts to \nunderstand and correct the problem that led to a flight test failure of \nthe Ground-based Midcourse Defense system in December of 2010. In this \nregard, he has supported rigorous and operationally realistic testing \nof our missile defense systems.\n  Of course, strategic issues are not Senator Nelson's only concern. On \nthe Armed Services Committee, before he chaired Strategic Forces, he \nwas chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee, demonstrating a keen \nunderstanding of the issues and a deep concern for the men and women of \nour military and their families. He has been a tireless advocate for \nthe National Guard and for Nebraska's farm families, and a fighter for \nworking families across America, advocating for a reasonable minimum \nwage and for important workplace protections. And he has been among our \nmost passionate voices for an end to the partisan gridlock that has \nmarked Washington, and the Senate, for far too long.\n  None of these issues are simple. All of them are vitally important. \nSenator Nelson's thoughtful, careful contributions have without \nquestion made our Nation safer, made our military forces more \neffective, our use of precious taxpayer dollars more effective. He has \nearned the respect and affection of the people of Nebraska, and he will \nbe sorely missed on the Armed Services Committee and in the Senate. \nBarb and I wish all the best for Ben and Diane as they continue their \nefforts to serve their State and our Nation.\n\n\n                                Jim Webb\n\n  Mr. President, Jim Webb has served our Nation in ways that few \nAmericans can match. He is a decorated combat veteran of the Vietnam \nWar, where he was awarded the Navy Cross, the Silver Star, two Bronze \nStar Medals, and two Purple Hearts. His experiences in Vietnam helped \nhim shape a series of novels for which he has received justified \ncritical praise and which helped readers understand the experience of \nwar and those who fight it. He served as the first Assistant Secretary \nof Defense for\n\n[[Page S8260]]\n\nReserve Affairs, and later as Secretary of the Navy. He won enormous \npraise for his television coverage of the Marine mission to Beirut in \nthe 1980s, and later for ``Born Fighting,'' a history of Scots-Irish \nimmigrants to America.\n  For the last 6 years, he has been serving his Nation in the capacity \nwe in the Senate have seen firsthand, as United States Senator from \nVirginia. It has been my privilege to serve with him on the Armed \nServices Committee, and as chairman, I have benefitted greatly from his \nintelligence, his experience, and his dedication to the men and women \nwho wear the uniform of our military. Let me reflect on a few of the \nways in which I have seen up close Senator Webb's dedication to \nservice.\n  Senator Webb is rightly recognized for his work on national security, \nbut that has not been his only concern in the Senate. He has been a \nwelcome voice here on issues of economic fairness. Soon after his \nelection to the Senate, he wrote in the Wall Street Journal of an \nurgent need to address growing economic inequality. He wrote:\n\n       [T]he current economic divisions in society are harmful to \n     our future. It should be the first order of business for the \n     new Congress to begin addressing these divisions, and to work \n     to bring true fairness back to economic life.]\n\n  And he has acted on those words, fighting for a tax system that is \nmore equitable to working families; for trade policies that recognize \nnot just the benefits, but the costs, of free trade; and for education \npolicies that give all Americans, including those already in the \nworkforce, the skills and opportunities to prosper.\n  An issue on which I have been able to work closely with Senator Webb \nis the posture of U.S. military forces in the Asia-Pacific region and, \nin particular, the plan to realign Marine forces in the Pacific. I \ntraveled with him to Okinawa and Guam, and even the island of Tinian, \nand saw firsthand his extraordinary knowledge and understanding of the \nissues. I have benefitted greatly, as I know Senator McCain has, from \nhis insights on this complex and difficult issue, which involves \npressing strategic issues, enormous budget pressures, and the concerns \nof our close ally Japan. Senator Webb's hard work on this issue has \nhelped resolve the impasse that was blocking progress on the plan to \nmove some of the marines off of Okinawa and move us closer to an \nachievable, affordable plan for Marine realignment that will benefit \nthe people of Japan and the United States while better serving our \nnational strategic and security interests in this important region.\n  But what is perhaps most notable about Senator Webb's service in the \nSenate is the way that he has joined three of his concerns--America's \nnational security, the need for greater economic fairness, and his \naffection for the men and women of our military.\n  This is perhaps best expressed by the post-9/11 GI bill, legislation \nhe introduced on his first day in office, and whose passage he pursued \nwith great determination. When signed into law in 2008, the post-9/11 \nGI bill provided the largest expansion of educational benefits for \nveterans since World War II. Just as the original GI bill honored the \nservice of World War II veterans and helped pave the way for millions \nof servicemembers to earn college degrees, so, too, has Senator Webb's \nlegislation honored the generation that has served in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and elsewhere. The impact of this legislation, in improving \nthe lives of our veterans and in its benefits for our Nation as a \nwhole, will be large and long lasting.\n  Senator Webb has been a tireless advocate for the men and women of \nour military, and in particular for our junior enlisted troops. As \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Personnel, he has fought for adequate \npay and benefits, and against the unscrupulous who would seek to profit \nby taking advantage of these young men and women. Senator Webb speaks \neloquently of the great strains of more than a decade of high \noperational tempo on these men and women and their families, and of the \n``moral contract'' between our Nation and the troops who defend us. He \nspeaks as the descendant of veterans, as a veteran himself, and as the \nfather, father-in-law and brother of veterans. The Senate, and the \nNation, have been better off the last 6 years having that voice in the \nSenate. I have been grateful for his counsel, and I am sorry we soon \nwill no longer have the benefit of his service on the Armed Services \nCommittee or in the Senate. But even though we will miss him, I have no \ndoubt Jim Webb's service to our Nation will long continue, and I wish \nhim every success.\n\n\n                                Jon Kyl\n\n  Mr. President, if success in the United States Senate depended only \nupon working alongside those with whom we agree, this would be a pretty \nuncomplicated and uninteresting place. We are a large and complex \nNation, made up of people with varying interests, preferences and \nbeliefs. This is where the representatives of a diverse Nation come to \ntry to resolve those differences into coherent national policy. And \nsuccess in this body depends on the efforts of Senators of differing \nbeliefs and backgrounds who labor to discover common ground.\n  This is on my mind as I consider the career of Senator Jon Kyl, who \nis leaving the Senate at the end of his third term representing the \npeople of Arizona. We have differed many times here in the Senate. And \nwe also have sought common ground. These efforts are totally \nconsistent.\n  In the wake of the 2001 terror attacks, our Nation's response took \nmany forms. Our military, intelligence and security agencies were \nobviously essential to that response, but importantly, we did not \nneglect a less obvious need: the need to cut off terrorist financing. \nSenator Kyl played an important role in this. He was a co-sponsor with \nme of legislation to give financial regulators important new \nauthorities to act against terror financing.\n  We found common ground on the need to speak out in strong and clear \nopposition to the repressive regime in Iran. Last year, he and I were \npart of a bipartisan group that offered a resolution calling for an end \nto the violent repression Iran's government has carried out against its \nown people, urging international action to support the people of Iran, \nand reaffirming America's commitment to universal freedoms.\n  I was proud to work with Senator Kyl on these and other important \nissues before the Senate. I respect and deeply appreciate his \ncommitment to protecting our Nation and to the universal standards of \nhuman rights that are such an important part of America's legacy. I \nwish Senator Kyl and his family every success and happiness as he \nreturns to Arizona.\n\n\n                            Daniel K. Akaka\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President in his farewell message to the people of \nHawaii, Senator Daniel Akaka wrote that his dream was always to work in \na job in which he could help people. In his 36 years in Congress--14 in \nthe House of Representatives and 22 here in the Senate--Danny Akaka has \ndone that job exceedingly well.\n  He has done it with statesmanship and perseverance. As just one \nexample, just a few weeks ago, President Obama signed into law landmark \nlegislation to better protect Federal employees who come forward to \ndisclose government waste, fraud, abuse, and other wrongdoing. The \nAkaka-Collins Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act would not have \npassed without Danny's determination to help both our dedicated Federal \nworkers and the citizens they serve.\n  Serving with Danny on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, I appreciate the priority he always placed on making the \nFederal Government more efficient and transparent, and on advancing \npolicies to attract, recruit, and retain the skilled workforce needed \nto meet today's challenges. From safeguarding our Nation against \nterrorist attacks to supporting the first responders in our \ncommunities, Danny has been a great ally and a true leader.\n  It also has been an honor to work with Danny on the Armed Services \nCommittee. As a World War II veteran, he brought to the committee a \ndeep and personal understanding of the sacrifices made by our men and \nwomen in uniform, and by their families. He is a champion of efforts to \nensure that our Active National Guard and Reserve personnel have the \nequipment and training to remain the best fighting force in the world, \nand he is dedicated to providing our veterans with the services they \nearned and deserve.\n  Danny Akaka has been described as the ``Aloha Senator.'' To most of \nus,\n\n[[Page S8261]]\n\nthat multi-purpose word can mean anything from ``hello'' to \n``goodbye.'' To the Hawaiian people, it is a word of deep spirituality \nand profound meaning.\n  The late Reverend Abraham Akaka, Danny's oldest brother and one of \nHawaii's most beloved clergymen, defined the ``Aloha Spirit'' this way: \n``God first, others second, yourself last.'' As a patriot and \nstatesman, Senator Daniel Akaka embodies that spirit through his desire \nto promote the true good of others and to help people. Aloha pumehana, \nSenator Akaka, farewell with my deepest regards and affection. Thank \nyou for your friendship and for your service to our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to speak on an amendment to \nthe pending bill--an amendment I will not be able to offer because I \nunderstand the majority filled the amendment tree so that we cannot \nmake amendments pending at this time. So I would like to take some \ntime, though, to inform Members about the importance of my amendment \nand why it ought to be included.\n  I think it is simply about smart government. It is about ensuring \nthat taxpayers' dollars are spent wisely, while at the same time \nguaranteeing Federal law enforcement agencies that face challenges \nfollowing Hurricane Sandy have the resources they need to get the job \ndone.\n  On December 7, the White House Office of Management and Budget \ntransmitted a legislative proposal to Congress seeking supplemental \nappropriations for disaster mitigation relating to Hurricane Sandy. By \nall accounts, this action was a normal response to a Federal disaster \nand one that nearly all Members have supported for various disasters \nthat have occurred in our home States. However, this request was \nunusual in several respects. For example, a large portion of the funds \nincluded in the President's request are unrelated, or at least \nextremely remote to the damage caused by the storm. This includes \nfunding for fisheries in Alaska, funding for increased Amtrak capacity, \nand funding to be spent years into the future. Further, the funding \nrequest sent up by the President does not include any recommendation \nwhatsoever for offsetting the spending. So, long story short, this \nrequest means more deficit spending.\n  There is one part of the request that causes me particular concern--\nand the purpose of my amendment--because it relates to my work as the \nranking member of the Committee on Judiciary. In the President's \nrequest, there are specific line items for repairing and replacing \nFederal vehicles damaged by Hurricane Sandy. Specifically, the Justice \nDepartment requested $4 million for the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, $1 million for the Drug Enforcement Administration, \n$230,000 for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, \nand $20,000 for vehicles for the Department of Justice inspector \ngeneral. Among other things, these funds are largely to repair and \nreplace Federal vehicles damaged by water from the storm.\n  The Department of Homeland Security requested $300,000 for the Secret \nService, $855,000 for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Again, this \nfunding is largely for repairing or replacing damaged motor vehicles. \nThe President requested this funding in an effort to replace these \ndamaged vehicles. He cited operational use of these vehicles by law \nenforcement agencies as the reason they need to be replaced.\n  Now, I understand that vehicles are a very important part of the work \nthat these Federal law enforcement agencies undertake and are critical \nto ongoing operations in the field. However, I am concerned about \nsimply providing funding for replacement vehicles in the field because \nthe way the government operates, this funding will not reach the \nagencies immediately. Even when it does, it will take time for \nreplacement vehicles to be located, purchased, and prepared for use. \nBut given that this is an emergency spending bill, we can assume that \nthese agencies need vehicles for immediate operational use.\n  As such, my amendment seeks to place these vehicles into the hands of \nthe agents in the field as fast as possible. Instead of simply \nproviding funding, my amendment requires that, within 7 days, the \nDepartment of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security identify \nand relocate vehicles based at the Washington, DC, headquarters of the \nDepartment of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security that are \nused for nonoperational purposes. The vehicles identified will then be \nused to replace those damaged by Hurricane Sandy that are used by the \nFBI, DEA, ATF, ICE, and the Secret Service.\n  The amendment limits the funding provided for these vehicle purchases \nuntil a report is produced to Congress identifying the vehicle \nrelocations. I think it is a very good government amendment and one \nthat actually achieves the goal of replacing operational vehicles used \nby Federal law enforcement actually faster than in the underlying bill.\n  Since we are told this funding is absolutely necessary for these \nagencies--so necessary as to warrant emergency funding that is not \noffset with spending reductions--this amendment actually improves the \nbill by getting vehicles to law enforcement immediately.\n  The agencies who will likely oppose this will argue that this is \nunnecessary and that we should just write a check for the new cars. \nThat is a ridiculous position to take, and we see the damage on \ntelevision so you know there is a purpose for the underlying bill. But \nif this is an emergency for these vehicles, these agencies can spare \nsome of the vehicles they have sitting around at their headquarters for \nnonoperational purposes.\n  These vehicles are given to employees in offices such as legislative \naffairs, budget, facility managers, and chief information officers and \nchief financial officers who may get cars to drive to and from work. \nMany may even sit unused for periods of time. Those are not operational \nneeds.\n  Just last year, there was an article in the Wall Street Journal \ntitled ``Free Ride Ends for Marshals,'' which addressed how 100 \nheadquarters employees of the U.S. Marshals Service returned \ngovernment-owned vehicles to the motor pool instead of using them to \ncommute to and from work. The article described how in recent years the \nproliferation of take-home vehicles for headquarter employees had \nexploded.\n  While the article focused on reducing take-home cars at the Marshals \nService, it is clear that the same argument can be made for reducing \ntake-home cars at other agencies. In the case of this supplemental, if \nthis is actually an emergency worthy of millions of taxpayer dollars, \nthese agencies can inconvenience nonoperational personnel at \nheadquarters to get these vehicles out to the fields and end the fringe \nbenefits. In fact, according to inventory numbers provided to the \nAppropriations Committee, the Justice Department has 3,225 vehicles at \nthe Washington, DC, headquarters of their agency alone. Surely, the \nJustice Department can find a handful of vehicles out of these 3,225 \nvehicles that could be sent to the field to replace the damaged \nvehicles--and get it done a heck of a lot faster than appropriating \nthis money and going through a process that would not get them out \nthere for a longer time.\n\n  On top of that, my amendment would allow the funds to replace these \nnonoperational vehicles after they are relocated. So my amendment would \nat most create a very small inconvenience for these nonoperational \nstaff for a short time. This amendment makes sense by modifying a \nrequest that, quite honestly, doesn't make a lot of sense. If this is \nan emergency, as we are told, the agencies should have no problem doing \nwhat my amendment asks.\n  We owe it to the American taxpayers to spend their tax dollars \nwisely. This amendment doesn't go as far as we could, which would be to \nstrike the provision outright. Instead, it gives the administration the \nbenefit of the doubt that this is a true emergency and that these cars \nare needed. However, it forces the agencies to make a decision to \ntemporarily inconvenience a few employees in Washington, DC, while \nensuring the operational law enforcement elements in the field have the \nequipment they need.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support a commonsense, good-government \namendment, and I hope it can be considered somewhere along the line \nbefore we pass this final legislation. If I could say just a few words \non the issue as a whole, I would like to take that opportunity.\n\n[[Page S8262]]\n\n  There is no doubt in my mind that every dollar that Sandy victims and \nlocal communities and infrastructure are entitled to, if it comes under \nexisting law, they ought to have. Our country is always having \ndisasters. That is a foregone conclusion. Throughout any year, there \nare always disasters to appropriate money for. Then, on a specific \ndisaster, these problems go on for years after the money is \nappropriated--and it is years before some of the money is spent. All I \nhave to do is look at Cedar Rapids, IA, and how they are fighting with \nFEMA after a 2008 flood to get some money as an example.\n  So let's just understand in this body, so that there is no mistake, \nthat New York and surrounding areas will get their money because the \nprinciple of FEMA money--and probably other disaster money as well--is \nsimply this: At the beginning of a year, you have some money in FEMA. \nYou never know what the disasters are going to be throughout the next \n12 months, but when a disaster is declared there is money there to \nflow. When that disaster money runs out, as far as I know it has always \nbeen replaced--whether there is an earthquake in California or a \nhurricane in the Gulf of Mexico, or tornadoes like we have in the \nMidwest, and Sandy as the most recent example.\n  As far as I know, there has never been any dispute under the laws at \nthat time--and those laws don't change very often--that they do get the \nmoney out to the people who need it. Then when that fund goes dry, it \nis replenished by Congress.\n  Unless somebody is seeking money in some way other than disasters \nthat have been taken care of in this particular instance--and I don't \nknow that they are, other than what has been pointed out that ought to \nbe done through the appropriations process and not really an emergency. \nBut for the emergency, I don't hear anybody wanting money for Sandy any \ndifferent than any other emergency.\n  I hope nobody is saying that Sandy ought to be treated differently \nthan an earthquake in California or a hurricane in the South or \ntornadoes in the Midwest or wherever they might happen. I haven't \nsurmised that is what they are trying to do. But if they are, they \nshouldn't say that Sandy ought to be treated differently than another \ndisaster because generally a disaster is a disaster--whether it is an \nearthquake, hurricane, tornado, or Sandy.\n  So the money is going to be there, and it will be there on time. You \ndon't know 1 month after a disaster exactly how much money is needed. \nIn fact, they asked for $80 billion from the Governors of those States. \nThe President sent up $64 billion. Some people of expertise on this in \nour caucus have said there are certain things that aren't authorized, \nso that shouldn't be expended.\n  Then I point out about some vehicles that can't be purchased right \nnow to do the good they are supposed to do.\n  We ought to be comforted that there is an attitude in this Senate, \nover decades, that the Federal Government is an insurer of last resort \nfor disasters, whatever kind of disaster you have, at least disasters \nas described by existing law. New York will get its money and it \ndoesn't necessarily have to be the $64 million; it is just to make sure \nthere is money there for what is needed tomorrow and the next day and \nthe next day. But we are not going to have a final figure on this for a \nlong time. So we ought to move with some money to make sure it is there \nfor what can be spent right now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Tribute To Janice Shelton\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a woman by the name of \nJanice Shelton for her friendship and 32 years of dedication as an \nemployee of this body, the Senate. Twenty-five of those years Janice \nworked as my executive assistant. She has demonstrated sincere \ndedication to me, my office, my family, and this body, the Senate. It \nis an understatement to say she will be sorely missed. She will be. She \nhas always been kind and thoughtful to me, to my wife Landra, all my \nchildren, and to everyone with whom she comes in contact. If there is a \nproblem, everyone knows: Go to Janice. No one has had my ear over the \npast 25 years like Janice Shelton has.\n  She has spent her professional career creating order where there \ncould easily be chaos. Over the course of her productive career with \nthe Army, the White House, and the Senate, each benefited from her \nunique expertise, professionalism, and hard work.\n  She began her professional life at the Department of the Army as \nsecretary to the Chief of the Personnel and Training Division \nHeadquarters. Her gift of completing tasks quickly and with ease, all \nwhile maintaining a positive outlook, served her well when she moved on \nto a position of trust at the White House. It is not merely her \nprofessionalism but the equally valued personal qualities she has \nbrought to the job: graciousness, unflagging energy, and a willingness \nto take on any task, large or small, that made her so treasured to \neveryone who came in contact with her.\n  From the White House she transited to the Senate with Senator Hawkins \nand Senator Mikulski and, as I said, for the last 25 years has been a \nsource of calm and order in my office, despite the often long hours and \nthe endless to-do lists that come with working with me. I say with \ncertainty that had it not been for Janice, my office would not have \nfunctioned nearly as smoothly as it has over the years.\n  She is also a woman of tremendous faith and her life revolves around \nher family. She has been married to Robert Lee Shelton for 58 years. \nThey have two daughters, Robin LeCroy and Laurie Nelson. She has eight \ngrandchildren and one great-grandson. I know four of her grandchildren. \nI got up every Sunday to see what happened in Shelton's college \nfootball game. Shelton was big. He was an offensive lineman--played at \nthe college level. He must have weighed 300 pounds of muscle.\n  I followed Shelton's little brother--little brother?--6 foot 3 or 4, \na big, strapping, left-handed pitcher; also a college baseball player. \nAnd then I had two of her granddaughters who worked for us as pages, \nRebecca and Holly.\n  She spends long hours at her desk. I do not go home early but I could \ncall and she would be there at 9, 10 clock at night, and that is no \nexaggeration. But when she is not at that desk, Janice was usually in \nGeorgia or North Carolina with her children or grandchildren.\n  She has probably been a little bit political, but I think she has \ngotten a little more political working for me. She has made sure each \nof her grandchildren understands the importance of their political \nvoice. During the recent election she called those eligible to vote to \nmake sure they had voted. I did not press very hard, but she may have \nurged them how they should vote.\n  While Janice's professional accomplishments deserve great \nrecognition, it is really Janice herself who will be missed so dearly. \nShe has served not only as a deeply trusted and committed assistant to \nme, but as a mentor to many who have worked with her. I know I am not \nthe only one who will note her absence. She has been so wonderful to my \nfamily. During times of crisis, my boys know: Call Janice. They can \nalways get through to me through Janice. She has given them advice. She \nhas counseled them. My wife Landra is a dear friend of Janice and \nconversely the case, Janice is her good friend. She has helped Landra \nin so many different ways--social events that Landra has committed to \ntake care of here, because of what I do, and other reasons.\n  During Landra's very bad accident Janice was always there. She was \nthe one who walked to my desk and said to me: Landra has been hurt \npretty bad. You have to stop doing what you are doing--and we were \ntrying to do a health care bill. During Landra's battle with breast \ncancer she has helped her in so many different ways. I am so indebted \nto Janice for how she has treated my family in addition to how she has \ntreated me and everyone who comes in contact with her.\n  At our Christmas party last night, we gave Janice a little present. I \ntold everyone there that she and I had shed all the tears that we were \ngoing to. I guess it was not true.\n\n[[Page S8263]]\n\n  She combined an unflinching honesty with a generous and kind nature. \nOne always trusts she has one's best interests at heart. Her charm \ncauses even the hardest cases, many times, to crack a smile. And her \nquick wit often brings a grin or a smile, sometimes a laugh. These \ntraits, more so even than her skill and dedication, have made her \nsuccessful.\n  I will miss her both as an employee and as a person. Today is her \nlast day--just a few more hours to work here.\n  On the back of my desk I have a picture of my mentor, Michael \nO'Callahan. In fact, I have two pictures on my credenza right behind my \ndesk. He was my mentor and my best friend. He taught me something that \nI have always remembered: You can buy a resume, you can buy good looks, \neducation, experience, but the one thing you cannot buy is loyalty. \nThere is no one who has ever been more loyal to me than Janice Shelton.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S8263, December 20, 2012, the Record reads: . . . of my \nmentor, Michael Callahan.\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . of my \nmentor, Mike O}Callaghan.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  I congratulate her on her service to the Senate and wish her the best \nin her retirement, along with her dear friend Bobby, who is also my \nhusband and always will be.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S8263, December 2012, the Record reads: . . . along with \nher dear friend . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . along with \nher dear husband . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Remembering Daniel K. Inouye\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, this has been a hard week in the Senate as \nwe have said goodbye. As we have just seen in the remarks of the \nmajority leader, retirements are very difficult. Parting with the \ncompany of honored and treasured colleagues in the Senate is as hard as \nit is anywhere in the world, but we have had some particularly \ndifficult moments earlier today. We assembled in the Rotunda of this \ngreat building of the Capitol to celebrate the life of one of our \ngreatest colleagues, Senator Dan Inouye of Hawaii. His desk sits draped \nin black, and his chair has a lei that was flown in from his home State \nof Hawaii.\n  This week we have all felt and known the change in the Chamber. The \nSenate has lost a giant and America has lost a hero. Danny Inouye was \ntruly a great man, and I feel blessed in my 2 years here to have had \nthe opportunity to sit with him over a private lunch, to joke with him \noccasionally in the anteroom, and to learn something of his spirit and \nhis personality. He had such a big heart and a wonderfully gracious \nspirit.\n  Most of the Senators I have had the honor to come to know in these 2 \nyears I only knew from a great distance as a local elected official or \nas someone in the business community at home in Delaware. When I asked \nSenator Inouye to lunch, I was intimidated. As a Congressional Medal of \nHonor winner, as a giant in the Senate, as the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, and the President pro tempore of this Senate, \nfrankly, I trembled to sit with him at a lunch and was delighted to \ndiscover a person who was so approachable, so warm, so human, so hard \nworking, so loyal, so spirited, and so passionate. In the minutes \nahead, I would like to share, if I can, a few insights about a dozen \nother Senators who are retiring from this body and a few among them \nwhom I have had the joy of getting to know in the last 2 years.\n  We don't often see the level of humanity in the Senate that we have \nseen this week, but it is important to know that the people who work in \nthis building can be better than the passing politics that sometimes \ndominates, and Senator Danny Inouye knew that. His enduring friendship \nwith Senator Ted Stevens, a Republican from Alaska, was legendary. He \nbelieved passionately that it was important for us to work together and \nto get past party affiliation and the picayune matters and get together \nto do right for our country.\n  Of the many speeches I heard in this Chamber and the remarks we heard \nearlier today in the Capitol Rotunda, one thing leaps out at me about \nDanny Inouye: Even when he was declared an enemy alien--as were all of \nhis ancestry at the outset of one of the greatest conflicts this world \nhas known--Senator Inouye volunteered for service in Europe. He was a \nmember of our most decorated military unit, the 442nd Combat Battalion. \nHe engaged in the fields of Europe and the hill country of Italy in a \nmoment of such personal sacrifice and remarkable bravery as to humble \nany who hear its details.\n  In his service over decades after that moment, he proved what he \nshowed forth on that battlefield: that Danny Inouye believed in America \neven before America believed in him. Even in a moment of such immense \ninjustice, which was bitterly unreal to thousands of people across this \ncountry of Japanese ancestry, this man's great heart, aloha spirit, and \nembrace of the American dream led us forward. He pulled us into the \ngreatness that was meant for this country.\n  The star of Senator Inouye may have dimmed in this Chamber that is \nsurrounded in its boarder by stars, but as I share the honor as the \nPresiding Officer over this Chamber, I will--in the days and months and \nyears ahead--look to our flag and remember this Senator. He represented \nthe 50th State, the State of Hawaii, from its very first moment of \njoining the stars on our flag in statehood. He has shown ever more \nbrightly in his decades of service here, and that example of service \npulls us forward into an ever brighter commitment to human dignity, \ndecency, and the respect for all in this country that his lifelong \nservice challenged us to believe in.\n  There are so many other Senators I want to speak about today, but let \nme turn to a few, if I might, and give some insight for the folks who \nonly see Members of this Chamber on cable TV shows or in the give-and-\ntake of election season or who only know them as the cutout and \ncaricatures that the public thinks of as Senators. If there is a common \nthread between them, it is that they share that loyalty, work ethic, \nand humility that so characterized Senator Inouye in his decades here.\n\n\n                               Dick Lugar\n\n  I had the honor to serve with Senator Dick Lugar of Indiana on the \nForeign Relations Committee. He subscribes to the same philosophy. Over \nthe 35 years he served in the Senate, he applied the practical \nperspective that experience as the mayor of Indianapolis gave him. He \nworked to make the world a safer place for all of us.\n  Along with nine of our colleagues, Senator Lugar will retire from \nthis Chamber this month after a remarkable career. He knew the stakes \nwere too high to let partisan politics and personality prevent \nprogress. He partnered with Senator John Kerry, Senator Sam Nunn, and \nthen-Senator Joe Biden of Delaware on the Foreign Relations Committee. \nBecause of their work together, there are thousands fewer nuclear \nweapons in our world. Serving with Dick Lugar these last 2 years has \nbeen a tremendous honor.\n\n\n                                Jim Webb\n\n  Serving with Senator Jim Webb of Virginia has also been an honor. He, \ntoo, is also a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. As a retiring \ncolleague, he knows there are things in this world and in our lives \nmore important than our politics. He was a decorated marine, a \ncelebrated author, a former Secretary of the Navy, and now a respected \nSenator. His tireless work has helped to make the world safer, our \nveterans stronger, and our criminal justice system more fair. I will \ntruly miss his company.\n\n\n                              Kent Conrad\n\n  There are a few more retiring Senators I would like to share some \nmore detailed stories about today, and I will start with the chairman \nfrom the Budget Committee, Senator Conrad. Senator Kent Conrad of North \nDakota is a Senator I met many years ago. But if I am going to talk \nabout him, I believe I have to have a chart. I really cannot speak to \nKent Conrad's service and record in the Senate without a chart.\n  For decades Senator Conrad tackled the challenge of educating the men \nand women of the Senate and the people of this country about the very \nreal fiscal and budgetary challenges facing our country. As we can see, \nespecially after the debut of Microsoft Excel, and then after he was \nnamed Budget Committee chair, the steady increase and usage of floor \ncharts by Senator Conrad has paved a path which few of us can hope to \nfind.\n\n[[Page S8264]]\n\n  Senator Conrad is a budget wonk after my own heart. He is a numbers \nguy. He is not afraid to get into the weeds and to project in a clear \nand legible format the minutia and magnifying details of the complex \nFederal budget. I am not sure I have met anyone in the Senate so \npassionately serious about the numbers and getting them right as my \nfriend, Senator Conrad.\n  The first time I met him was more than 15 years ago. He had come to \nWilmington for an event that then-Senator Biden hosted at the Delaware \nart museum. There were 200 folks in a big auditorium. I will never \nforget Senator Biden introducing Senator Conrad as the most thoughtful \nand detailed budget leader in Washington.\n  Senator Conrad stood up and fired up the overhead projector, the \nlights dimmed, and he launched into a lengthy discourse on the minutia \nof the Federal budget and deficit. After 30 minutes and more than 40 \nslides later, the lights came back up, and I think there were maybe 20 \nof us left in the auditorium. Everyone else wandered outside for the \ncocktails.\n  I was enthralled by his presentation, the clarity of his thinking, \nand his dedication to get things right for the American people. Today I \nam on the Budget Committee, and I have enjoyed serving with Senator \nConrad as my chairman. It was, for this budget nerd, a dream come true \nto have the chance to show up on time and know that this Budget \nCommittee chairman was the other member of the committee who always \nshowed up on time. It gave us a moment to reflect on the challenges we \nfaced and the very real solutions he has offered over these many years \nof service.\n  Senator Conrad has earned the deserved respect of his colleagues the \nold-fashioned way: through hard work, attention to detail, and \nthoughtful leadership. He has been trying and working hard for many \nyears to get us to make the tough choices in the Senate that we need to \nmake to deal with our national debt. He has not given up, and I don't \nintend to either. I am grateful for his friendship and service.\n\n\n                             Jeff Bingaman\n\n  Another full committee chairman with whom I have had the honor to \nserve these past 2 years is Senator Bingaman of New Mexico, chairman of \nthe Energy Committee. He is one of the kindest, smartest, gentlest \npeople I have ever met. He has been a pleasure to work with on the \nEnergy and Natural Resource Committee.\n  I remember we were both speaking at a conference on advanced energy \nresearch last year out at National Harbor. Thousands of scientists, \ninvestors, and entrepreneurs were there. I pulled up in front of the \nmassive convention hall, and right out in front was a Prius with New \nMexico plates. Sure enough, Chairman Jeff Bingaman jumped out of the \ndriver's seat with no staff.\n  Here was the chairman of the Energy Committee and a Senator for \nnearly 30 years driving himself to a major policy speech in his Prius. \nHe practiced what he preached as he prepared to deliver an important \nspeech in a moment that showed his humility.\n  As unassuming a man as Senator Bingaman is, when he speaks, you \nlisten. He is living proof that the value of one's words can and should \nexceed their volume. On that day at National Harbor, Senator Bingaman \ndelivered a message similar to one he had given a decade earlier in a \nreport entitled ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm.'' Senator Bingaman \nsaw that this country was falling behind in the race for innovation and \ninvestment in research and education. These are things that lay the \nfoundation for long-term competitiveness. This vision and concern \nhaunted him, so he teamed up with our great colleague from Tennessee, \nLamar Alexander, and challenged the National Academy of Sciences to \nstudy this trend and offer recommendations. From that challenge, we got \nthe Seminole study, ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm.''\n  It asked what it would take for America to continue to lead in \ninnovation. That led to the America COMPETES Act and the creation of \nARPAE, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy. The very \nconference at which we had been speaking was the ARPAE annual \nconference. Both of these important accomplishments played vital roles \nin our future competitiveness. They are focused on nurturing innovation \nand creating a political system where political, scientific, and \neconomic forces work together and not against each other.\n  That is Jeff Bingaman. That is his sweeping, long-range vision, and \none we should all heed. His commitment to thoughtful and forward-\nlooking service on our Nation's long-term competitiveness will be \nsorely missed. But even more, I know many of us will miss his reserved, \ndignified passion.\n\n\n                               Herb Kohl\n\n  I had a similar experience with Senator Herb Kohl, my colleague on \nthe Judiciary Committee. I remember in my first few months there that \nSenator Kohl spoke so rarely that when I first heard him speak at an \nevent on the manufacturing extension partnership--one of his passions, \nand mine--I was struck by the power and reach of his voice. It is \nbecause he uses it so sparingly, but his example speaks even louder. He \nnever sought the spotlight here but worked tirelessly to make a \ndifference fighting for the little guy on antitrust issues in the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  He believes, as do I, if an American entrepreneur has a great idea, \nwe should help protect that idea by preventing trade secret theft and \nother intellectual property threats. We also share a deep commitment to \nthe idea that higher education should be more accessible and affordable \nto every student who wants to pursue it. I am honored to have the \nopportunity to take up from Senator Kohl's work on these and other \nimportant issues.\n  Outside this Chamber Senator Kohl has just as strong a voice and \nbroad an impact with his philanthropy, but we would never hear him \nspeak about it; that is just not his style. He has earned my abiding \nrespect with his unassuming grace and his determined leadership.\n\n\n                             Joe Lieberman\n\n  Those who adhere to the Jewish faith around the world are inspired by \nthe ancient concept of ``tikkun olam''--``to heal the world''--to \nchallenge each of us who seek to serve each other and our communities. \nLike Senator Kohl, my dear friend Senator Joe Lieberman has certainly \nrisen to that challenge. He is a man deeply committed to his faith, \nwhich has significantly influenced his career and his drive to serve, \nand it is something I share with Senator Lieberman.\n  On my very first congressional delegation, my first trip as a Senator \njust a few months after being sworn in, I visited Pakistan, \nAfghanistan, Jordan, and Israel. Senator Lieberman was on a different \ncodel, and our paths crossed and we got to share a shabbat dinner at \nthe David Citadel Hotel in Jerusalem one night. As he was crossing the \nroom for us to sit, I realized he could be elected mayor of Jerusalem.\n  As we sat and broke bread and shared, it was a great comfort for me. \nEarlier that day I had gotten word that Delaware had lost one of our \ngreat leaders, Muriel Gilman, a personal friend and a remarkable leader \nand a person of kindness and spirit. She was a pioneer for women in my \nState and personified this spirit of tikkun olam. So over dinner that \nnight in Jerusalem, Senator Lieberman and I talked about Muriel, about \nwhat I had seen in Jordan and in Israel, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and \nmy experience on my first trip as a Senator. It was a remarkable \nmoment. Senator Lieberman was engaging and warm, interesting and \npassionate as we wove between talk about policy and faith, and he \nreflected with me on the point of his own life when his religion became \nhis faith, when he really took ownership of the religion of his birth \nand how that faith and its lessons have shaped his public service. For \nme as a young Senator, it was a formative moment.\n  His passion for the stability of the world and the security of the \nUnited States and our vital ally, Israel, and his dedicated work for \nthe clarity of the air we breathe and his tireless advocacy for the \nequality of all Americans regardless of whom they love have been an \ninspiration. His desire to work together and find responsible \ncompromise has been motivating.\n  I am deeply grateful to Joe Lieberman for his service, his counsel, \nhis friendship, and his lesson that no matter what faith tradition we \nare from, we can use our service in this Chamber as an opportunity to \nrepair our world.\n  So here we are, 5 days before my family celebrates Christmas and 12 \ndays\n\n[[Page S8265]]\n\nbefore the new year and the beginning of the so-called fiscal cliff. \nOur politics have paralyzed this Chamber and this town. But what the \nexample of all of these remarkable Senators has shown us, what it has \ntaught me is that we can still be better than our politics.\n  The humanity of this place, too often shoved aside by the politics of \nthe moment, shows us that we can do better. One by one, these Senators, \nin delivering their farewell addresses to this Chamber, stood at their \ndesks and each in turn urged us to find a way to return to the days \nwhen Senators knew each other and worked together. What will it take to \nget us to that point again--a horrific tragedy in an elementary school, \na dangerous economic cliff, some devastating attack, a cyber assault on \nAmerica?\n  Our retiring colleagues are each telling us, each in turn, that it is \nnot too late to restore the humanity of this Chamber and make a \npositive difference in the lives of all we serve. Will we heed their \ncall? I hope and pray we will because we can do better. We must do \nbetter. And in the spirit of each of these departing colleagues, I will \ndo my level best. I hope we all can commit to doing the same.\n  Thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator have Louisiana.\n\n\n                            Too Big to Fail\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, as we continue to face enormous economic \nchallenges and uncertainty, I rise to join with others in continuing to \nexpress concern about too-big-to-fail--a policy we saw clearly in large \nmeasure coming out of the 2008 crisis and a policy many of us think \ncontinues to this day and puts the American taxpayer and the American \neconomy at great risk.\n  This isn't a Republican concern or a Democratic concern; it is not \njust a conservative concern or a liberal concern. A lot of us on both \nsides of the aisle have this concern. A good example is a Democratic \ncolleague I have been working closely with on these ideas--Senator \nSherrod Brown of Ohio. We both serve on the Banking Committee. We \ndisagree on a lot of issues outside and within the Banking Committee's \njurisdiction, but we agree on some things too, including real concern \nabout too-big-to-fail institutions and the continuation of the implicit \npolicy of too-big-to-fail. That is why he and I have come together on a \nnumber of fronts related thereto, including legislation we can pass \nthis week before we end this Congress that would simply authorize a \nstudy. It is an important GAO study about too-big-to-fail and those \ninstitutions.\n  The idea is very simple. We would ask the GAO--a clearly nonpartisan, \nclearly expert entity with a lot of smarts, with a lot of ability to do \nvalid, unbiased research--to study whether there is an implicit policy \nof too-big-to-fail with regard to our largest financial institutions \nand, if so, what benefits that implicit taxpayer guarantee gives those \ninstitutions.\n  Specifically, it would look at bank holding companies with $500 \nbillion or more of consolidated assets, and it would look specifically \nat three things, among others: first, the favorable pricing of the debt \nof those institutions resulting from the perception that those \ninstitutions would again be bailed out during times of financial stress \nas they were during 2008; second, any favorable funding or economic \ntreatment they received from increased credit ratings directly \nresulting from perceived government support; and third, the favorable \neconomic benefit of the 2008 bailouts and existing safety nets of the \nFederal Reserve and FDIC. I think these questions are very legitimate, \nand having an unbiased, academic look at that would be very helpful in \nterms of our continuing work on these issues.\n  We talk about this and debate this all the time. Wouldn't it be \nuseful to have an unbiased, apolitical, expert source look at these \nquestions: Do these big institutions with $500 billion or more in \nconsolidated assets--are they considered too-big-to-fail by the market, \nand does that perception give them advantages, such as favorable \npricing of debt, such as favorable funding or economic treatment from \ntheir increased credit ratings, et cetera?\n  There is a lot at stake. It would be very helpful to have factual, \nunbiased answers to these questions.\n  First of all, there is a whole question of too-big-to-fail continuing \nto exist, and I believe it does. This would put nonpartisan eyes on the \nquestion and give us a good sense of, do we have more work to do if, in \nfact, we want to get rid of too-big-to-fail, which we, virtually to a \nperson in this Chamber, profess we want to get rid of. Secondly, to the \nextent too-big-to-fail continues as a policy and/or a perception, is it \ngiving advantages to these institutions, market advantages, market \ndistortions--which, by the way, if they are the winners, there also by \ndefinition have to be losers, which are the smaller institutions that \nare at a competitive disadvantage because of these market distortions, \nbecause of these advantages that too-big-to-fail gives these mega-\ninstitutions.\n  So I hope this is pretty much a no-brainer. It is a study. It doesn't \nmandate any actions, and it asks valid questions to which getting \nunbiased answers would be very helpful in our continuing work. That is \nwhy Senator Sherrod Brown and I have come together in a bipartisan way \nto ask these questions. We have developed legislation mandating this \nGAO study, and we are trying to get what we consider to be very \nnoncontroversial legislation passed before the end of the year.\n  As it stands now, we have cleared this legislation on the Republican \nside. Every Republican Member is perfectly willing to let this pass by \nunanimous consent. That process has just begun on the Democratic side. \nI urge all of my colleagues to follow the lead of Sherrod Brown to \nallow us to ask and get unbiased answers to these very legitimate \nquestions. I urge everyone on that side to clear it themselves, to join \nus on our side in clearing it so we can pass it through the Senate and \nget this passed in the House, hopefully on the consent calendar, which \nwe are already working on. That clearing process will take a little bit \nof time, but I look forward to coming back and having it cleared by UC. \nI will probably ask for a live UC at some appropriate point tonight or \ntomorrow when everyone has clearly had a chance to look at the study \nlegislation.\n  I look forward to our coming together, I think in a very sound way, \nasking these legitimate questions, asking a nonpolitical expert entity \nto give us valid answers to these questions so we can move forward with \nthe proper policymaking.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 15 minutes as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Remembering Our Armed Forces\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, just a few months ago I spoke on the \nSenate floor about the men and women of our Armed Forces who are \ndeployed overseas. Particularly, I spoke about remembering the men and \nwomen who give selflessly of themselves, who died for the good of our \nNation; these souls who live lives illuminated by purpose and who \ntravel long roads paved with sacrifice. They are the important 1 \npercent, the tiny fraction who go wherever in the world our country \nasks them to go, who honorably shoulder the burden of fear and \nsacrifice for the rest of us because they love this country and believe \nin defending it.\n  Today, as we prepare to celebrate the holiday season with our family \nand loved ones, I once again wish to ask each and every one of my \ncolleagues to remember these men and women, these great souls whose \nbelief in this country is so great they willingly and without \nqualification put life and limb on the line so that 99 percent of us \ndon't have to spend our days and nights wondering if our loved ones are \nsafe.\n  Remember that we are still a nation at war, that there are over \n170,000 members of our Armed Forces deployed, many of them in harm's \nway, and many of them are from my home State of North Carolina. This \nyear these deployed servicemembers will not be celebrating with those \nnear and dear to them because they will be on watch protecting the very \nfreedoms\n\n[[Page S8266]]\n\nand the way of life we hold so dear. Our service men and women don't \nask for anything from us, but please think of them, remember them, \nthank them, and please keep them in your prayers.\n  Remember the sacrifices endured by so many of our military families \nwho are at home now without their dad, mom, brother, sister, husband, \nor wife. And most importantly at this time of year and always, remember \nthat there are many servicemembers who will never come home. While many \nfamilies miss their loved ones now, especially during the holiday \nseason, some will endure that loss for the rest of their lives. These \nhusbands and wives, moms and dads, brothers and sisters, sons and \ndaughters did not bargain for the pain of waking up each and every day \nwithout their partner, a child, a friend, or the person who used to \ntuck them into bed each night. They did not ask to spend the rest of \ntheir lives missing someone so important to them. Remember them as you \ndo your holiday shopping, go to parties, exchange gifts, and otherwise \nget caught up in the spirit of the season.\n\n\n                         SGT Justin C. Marquez\n\n  Remember the family of SGT Justin Z. Marquez, U.S. Army, from \nAberdeen, NC. Justin died this past October 6 from small arms fire \nwounds he received while on foot patrol in Wardak Province, \nAfghanistan, just 1 month after he arrived in theater. Justin was 25 \nyears old.\n  I spoke with Justin's mom Terry. She told me that as a boy, Justin \nquestioned authority--a lot. But she said it was always because he was \nstanding up for what he thought was right, defending someone else \nagainst an injustice or prejudice.\n\n  Justin was a good son. He believed in helping others, standing up for \nothers. He was a kid other parents trusted and a big brother to many--a \nneighborhood guardian, if you will. His house was the weekend hangout. \nYounger kids would come over. When his mom questioned when the younger \nkids should go home, her son told her: Mom, don't worry. They are happy \nbeing here. Not everyone has the fairytale life like our family does.\n  Justin's family was a little surprised when he announced that he \nwanted to join the Army at 18. They wanted him to finish school, to \ncontinue growing up, but Justin had other plans. He wanted to go out in \nthe world and make a difference for others, and the Army was how he was \ngoing to do this. He was eager to do his part--to stand for our \ncountry, our government, our people, and our way of life. He understood \nhow precious our freedoms are and how fortunate he was to be an \nAmerican.\n  Justin's life was cut short, tragically so, but his dad, mom, and \ntwin brother got to see him grow from a boy to a man. He made their \nlives full and challenged them to be better people. According to Terry, \nhis mom, as Justin grew up in the Army, he was like a fine wine: he \njust kept getting better with age.\n  Justin understood that the freedoms we enjoy as citizens of our great \nNation are precious and valuable. He believed in protecting others. He \nbelieved in making the world a better place. He believed in standing so \nthat others might not have to.\n  Interestingly, Justin's mom brought Justin and his twin brother Drew \nto Washington, DC, when they were in middle school. They sat in the \ngallery in this very Chamber. I think it is fitting that we remember \nand honor him here.\n  SGT Justin Marquez was a dedicated soldier. He had found his purpose. \nHe believed in what he was doing. We must remember how fortunate we are \nto have countrymen like him--people committed to fighting for the \nfreedoms we so often take for granted.\n  Mrs. Marquez shared with me that she does not worry about Justin \nanymore. He is taken care of and is safe now. But because of him, she \nnow worries for all the other soldiers. We all need to keep these men \nand women in mind too and support them and stand with them and their \nfamilies.\n\n\n                      Corporal Daniel L. Linnabary\n\n  We also need to remember the family of Cpl Daniel L. Linnabary, U.S. \nMarine Corps, from Hubert, NC. Daniel died on August 6 at the age of 23 \nwhile conducting combat operations in Helmand Province, Afghanistan.\n  Dan always wanted to be a marine. He made his decision at the early \nage of 4 and wanted to be a marine until the day he died. He was the \nthird generation of his family to serve in the Marine Corps, and for 46 \nyears there has been at least one Linnabary in the Marine Corps. No \nwonder he knew he wanted to be a marine at such a young age.\n  Dan loved the Corps, but more than that he loved his wife of just a \nyear, Chelsea, and baby daughter Rosalie. I spoke with Dan's wife \nChelsea, and she impressed upon me that Dan was much more than a \nmarine. She needed me to know that he was first and foremost a good \nhusband and a good father, just a really great guy who loved his wife \nand loved being a dad.\n  Dan's baby girl Rosalie just turned 7 months old this past weekend. \nDan got to spend only 7 weeks with her before deploying--3 of those \nweeks an extra blessing because baby Rosalie was in such a hurry to \nmeet her dad that she arrived 3 weeks early. From the minute Dan first \nheld his tiny daughter, he and everyone else knew that he was made to \nbe a dad, that he would always love and do whatever was necessary to \ncare for his family. Now Rosalie will grow up with only photos of her \ndad, but she will always have a connection to him through those who \nserved with him.\n  The men of 2nd Tank Battalion have told Dan's wife that they look \nforward to meeting baby Rosalie when they get back from their \ndeployment early next year. That is just what these men and women do. \nThey look out for one another and the families who are left behind. \nYes, they are servicemembers, but first and foremost they are human \nbeings putting others before themselves. We need to follow their lead.\n  Another thing Chelsea shared with me is that Dan loved her enough to \nbe honest with her always. He did not sugarcoat things. He prepared her \nas much as anyone could for any eventuality. But how much can you \nreally prepare someone to live the rest of their life without their \nsoulmate? To raise their daughter without her dad? To explain to her \nthat dad gave his life to protect others--especially when too many of \nus are not even aware of these sacrifices?\n  Dan was a marine. He was doing what he believed in. His wife knew \nthat it was a dangerous job and that the worst could happen because Dan \ntold her. She just never thought it would be on this, his first \ndeployment, or in this war. He died fighting for our freedoms and lived \nby a code that most of us will never understand but for which we must \nbe thankful.\n  As you spend time with your loved ones this season, remember Cpl Dan \nLinnabary and thank him.\n  This is a time of year about belief. Different cultures and different \nfaiths have different beliefs. And this is what makes our country the \ngreatest Nation on Earth. Be it faith, politics, or other things, we \nare all free to believe what we choose. And we must remember that there \nare special men and women in this world, oftentimes strangers to us, \nwho are willing to give their lives for our right to believe in what we \nchoose. But one thing we should all agree upon is that we must--we \nmust--stand behind and beside the men and women who are willing to pay \na debt they do not owe so that other Americans do not have to.\n  Our servicemembers are from our small towns, our big cities, and our \nrural areas. They are our neighbors, they are our fellow Americans, and \nthey are my fellow North Carolinians. Justin Marquez, Daniel \nLinnabary--just a couple of the heroes who lived among us. We must \nremember them and honor them now and always.\n  So at this time of the year, I wish to extend my warmest wishes of \nthe holiday season to our servicemembers, both those serving now and \nthose who have gone before us, and to the families and friends who \ncannot be with their loved ones.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n\n[[Page S8267]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Roger Barta\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, there are certainly so many serious issues \nthat we face in this country, and so many tragedies have occurred. I \nwas on the floor earlier this week paying tribute to the lost lives in \nConnecticut and the two police officers killed in the line of duty in \nTopeka, KS, this week and the death of our colleague--certainly serious \nissues that we face--and now awaiting the House to pass legislation in \nregard to the fiscal cliff.\n  This is perhaps a lighter subject. I want to pay tribute to something \nthat is such a great tradition in our State of Kansas and really across \nthe country. Football is something that is important to communities \nacross my State. On Friday nights, in the fall of each year, thousands \nof Americans gather at their local high school football fields to cheer \non their favorite teams. This tradition has stood strong for decades on \nthe Kansas prairie, but it is especially true in a little town not too \nfar from my hometown, in the town of Smith Center.\n  There are few if any high school football fans in our State who are \nunaware of Smith Center's reputation. Coach Roger Barta and his Redmen \nfootball team have won more than 320 games and 8 State championships--5 \nof them in a row. They are even known here in Washington, DC.\n  A few years ago, when they were on their 79-game winning streak, \npeople would come to me and ask me if I had ever heard of Smith Center, \nKS. And I would say: Certainly. Yes. What is the story? And they had \nread on the sports page that Smith Center had scored 74 points on \nanother team in the first quarter. It turned out to be my hometown of \nPlainville. Mr. President, 74 points in the first quarter--this is an \namazing team.\n  Under the leadership of Coach Barta, the Redmen football team has set \nState and national records. That 79-game winning streak is a remarkable \nachievement, and it caught the attention of the New York Times. In \nfact, a New York Times sportswriter, Joe Drape, moved his family from \nNew York City to Smith Center, KS, and lived there for an entire school \nyear to chronicle the team's achievements and to write about the \ncommunity. He tells their story in his best-selling book called ``Our \nBoys: A Perfect Season on the Plains with the Smith Center Redmen.''\n  There are many reasons for this team's success that would, in fact, \nbring a New York Times reporter to this small town, but I think the \ncommunity of Smith Center would agree with me that perhaps the greatest \nreason behind their success is their head coach--Coach Roger Barta. The \ncoach's 323 victories place him among the top 5 coaches on the alltime \nKansas football coaching wins list, and in 2007 he was named the \nGatorade National Coach of the Year. But this season, after 35 years of \ncoaching, Coach Barta announced he is ready to hang up his whistle and \nretire.\n  I have had the opportunity to participate in several pregame coin \nflips with Coach Barta and his team over a number of seasons, including \ntheir 2009 State title game. Each time, I watched a very talented and \nsportsmanlike football team and a very spirited set of fans from Smith \nCenter and across the region. Yet all the success this team has enjoyed \non the field is not what makes them so remarkable. The truly \nexceptional work being done on the plains of Kansas is the development \nof character in the boys of the Smith Center football team. It is the \nrespect the athletes learn to have for their teammates and opponents on \nthe field. It is the integrity the boys are expected to have both on \nand off the field. And it is the hard-working spirit they take with \nthem when they graduate.\n  As a member of the Redmen football team, the athletes are not \nexpected to just excel on the field but in the classroom and the \ncommunity as well. From school plays to school concerts, the Redmen do \nmore than simply play football. And Coach Barta serves more than just \nto coach football--he serves as a role model and mentor for young men \nand the community.\n  I remember a story in the book that says when one of the team members \nviolates a team rule--young fourth grade students in Smith Center, KS, \nhave a player card, and that football team member who violates a rule \nhas to go to the fourth grade member and explain his error in violation \nof the team rule and apologize to the fourth grader.\n  Coach Barta's wife had this to say about her husband's commitment to \nthe Redmen:\n\n       Roger likes everything about football, but what he loves \n     most are the practices, the camaraderie, and watching the \n     boys learn a little more. He lets them know how much he wants \n     them to succeed.\n\n  In the book about the Redmen, the writer Joe Drape extols the virtues \nwe in America hold so dear. Humility, sacrifice, and unwavering \ncommitment are all characteristics that are exemplified by the Redmen \nand their fans.\n  But perhaps Coach Barta's greatest legacy as he leaves the coaching \nfield in Smith Center is within the Smith Center city limits: former \nRedmen who left town for college or work but eventually returned home.\n  Broch Hutchison, one of the Coach Barta's former players, is now an \nassistant coach, and he had this to say about working alongside Coach \nBarta:\n\n       We've all had opportunities, but this is where we've \n     learned to love one another and work hard and build a \n     community. If we can have an impact on a kid's life like \n     Coach Barta, we want to do it in our hometown.\n\n  This attitude exemplifies the teaching, coaching, and parenting \nphilosophy of rural America. Our populations are dwindling and our \ncommunities are aging, but our commitment to raising responsible \nchildren and preparing them to be successful in life is something that \nwill never leave us. I am thankful that Coach Barta and his staff \nunderstand this, and I am proud to come from a part of the country that \nremains committed to that way of life.\n  Coach Barta summed it up best when he said this about his coaching \nphilosophy:\n\n       What we do real well around here is raise kids. . . . None \n     of this is really about football. What we're doing is sending \n     kids into life who know that every day means something.\n\n  Congratulations to Coach Barta for his outstanding achievements over \nthe last three decades. But most importantly, thank you, coach, for \nyour investment in the lives of young men of Smith Center. Their lives \nare forever changed because of you.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise as my friend, my colleague, my \nbrother, Danny Inouye lies in state in the Capitol Rotunda just a few \nyards from where I stand now. In life, he received our Nation's highest \nmilitary honor, the Medal of Honor. Today he is receiving a tribute \nreserved for just a handful of American heroes such as Abraham Lincoln.\n  I come to the floor to speak about an important piece of legislation \nI developed and worked with Dan Inouye on for over 12 years. Today, in \nSenator Dan Inouye's honor, for all the people of Hawaii, I am asking \nthe Senate to pass the Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act.\n  Dan and I developed our bill to create a process that could address \nthe many issues that continue to persist as a result of the legal \noverthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893.\n  As you know, Dan Inouye was a champion for Hawaii and worked every \nday of his honorable life to solve problems and help our island State.\n  Dan also served on the Indian Affairs Committee for over 30 years and \nchaired it twice. He was an unwavering advocate for the United States' \ngovernment-to-government relationships with native nations. He \nconstantly reminded our colleagues in the Senate about our Nation's \ntrust responsibilities and our treaty obligations to America's first \npeoples. Dan believed that through\n\n[[Page S8268]]\n\nself-determination and self-governance, these communities could thrive \nand contribute to the greatness of the United States.\n  When asked how long the United States would have a trust \nresponsibility to native communities, he would quote the treaties \nbetween the United States and native nations, which promised care and \nsupport as long as the Sun rises in the east and sets in the west.\n  Dan Inouye's sheer determination to improve the lives of this \ncountry's indigenous peoples and make good on the promises America made \nto them led him to introduce more than 100 pieces of legislation on \nbehalf of American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians.\n  Senator Dan Inouye secured passage of the Native Hawaiian Health Care \nImprovement Act, the Native Hawaiian Education Act, the Hawaiian Home \nLands Recovery Act, and the Native Hawaiian Homeownership Opportunity \nAct.\n  He was instrumental in helping me to enact the apology resolution to \nthe Native Hawaiian people for the suppression of their right of self-\ndetermination. It was enacted on the 100th anniversary of the overthrow \nof the Kingdom of Hawaii.\n  In 1999, Dan and I worked together to develop the Native Hawaiian \nGovernment Reorganization Act to give parity to Native Hawaiians. For \nover 12 years now, we worked together to pass the bill to ensure that \nNative Hawaiians have the same rights as other native peoples, and an \nopportunity to engage in the same government-to-government relationship \nthe United States has already granted to over 560 native nations \nthroughout this country, across the continental United States, and in \nAlaska, but not yet in Hawaii.\n  Over the years, people have mischaracterized the intent and effect of \nour bill, so let me be plain. For me, as I know it was for Dan, this \nbill is about simple justice, fairness in Federal policy, and being a \nNation that acknowledges that while we cannot undo history, we can \nright past wrongs and move forward. To us, this bill represented what \nis ``pono'' in Hawaii, what is just and right.\n  Our bill is supported by President Barack Obama and the U.S. \nDepartments of Justice and Interior. It has the strong support of \nHawaii's Governor, the State legislature, and a large majority of the \npeople of Hawaii. Our bill has the endorsement of the American Bar \nAssociation, the National Congress of American Indians, the Alaska \nFederation of Natives, and groups throughout the Native Hawaiian \ncommunity.\n  As a Senator and senior statesman, Senator Dan Inouye advocated that \nCongress do its job and legislate where native communities were \nconcerned. Dan Inouye believed that a promise made should be a promise \nkept.\n  In the days since my dear friend Dan's passing, there has been a \ntremendous outpouring of love from Hawaii and every other State in the \nUnion. Native American communities across the country are mourning the \nloss and paying tribute to their great champion. Dan Inouye's absence \nwill be felt in this Chamber and the Nation for many years to come. May \nhis legacy live on for generations of Native Americans and inspire all \nAmericans to always strive toward justice and reconciliation.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass the Native Hawaiian Government \nReorganization Act in the memory of Senator Daniel K. Inouye and his \ndesire to provide parity to the Native Hawaiian people he loved so \nmuch.\n  To Dan, I say: Aloha 'oe and a hui hou, my brother.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Native American Affairs\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I was watching my friend and colleague \nSenator Akaka as he was delivering his comments earlier about Senator \nInouye and the legislation that both he and our dear friend and former \ncolleague have worked so hard on over the years, and I wanted to come \nto the floor this evening and tell my friend that I am deeply \nappreciative of the words he has delivered as the chairman of the \nSenate Committee on Indian Affairs. I would certainly hope the Senate \nwould respect the thinking the Senator has outlined as it relates to \nthe Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act.\n  As the Senator knows well, I have long been a supporter of that act. \nIt is indeed an honor to have worked with him on it, as well as our \ndear friend and late colleague, Senator Inouye.\n  This legislation has been going on for some 12 years now, and I think \nit is fair to say that it truly has been a bipartisan effort, not only \nhere in Washington, DC, but in Hawaii as well.\n  For several years, when Governor Lingle was Governor of Hawaii, she \nwas back here helping on the Republican side of the aisle.\n  I firmly believe this cause of Native Hawaiians is just. The native \npeople of Hawaii are similarly situated to the native people of Alaska. \nBoth are aboriginal peoples from former territories. Yet the fact is \nthat the two peoples are not treated the same for purposes of Federal \nIndian law. The native people of Alaska are recognized as among the \nfirst peoples of the United States. Their tribes appear on the Interior \nDepartment's list of federally recognized Indian tribes, and they have \naccess to important Federal Indian programs that truly have improved \nthe quality of life for Alaska natives.\n  The native people of Hawaii, however, are not federally recognized \namong the first peoples of the United States. For more than a decade \nnow, efforts to provide Federal recognition have been filibustered, and \nI would suggest unjustly so.\n  Senator Inouye and Senator Akaka have worked valiantly to create \nprograms for Native Hawaiians that parallel those available to American \nIndians and Alaska Natives, but this is not enough. Justice demands \nthat the native people of Hawaii earn the Federal recognition that is \nrightfully theirs.\n  The time to provide parity and justice for Hawaii's native people is \nnow. The Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act, which has \npassed out of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, I think is a \nresponsible bill. It is a constitutional vehicle to accomplish this \nobjective.\n  We began our mourning paying tribute to our friend and former \ncolleague Senator Inouye. As we think about Hawaii and its peoples, and \nas we remember the contributions of Senator Inouye, and as we recognize \nSenator Akaka as he departs from this body after years and years of \nhonorable service, I would hope that within this body we would not \nforget the efforts they have worked on so valiantly.\n  I will commit to my friend, Senator Akaka, that the cause the Senator \nhas taken up, that he has worked on so hard with Senator Inouye, will \nnot die until justice for the native people of Hawaii is achieved. I \nthank the Senator for his leadership.\n  Mr. President, I was going to yield the floor, but I would like to \ntake a moment to provide my remarks regarding Senator Akaka and his \ncontribution here, if I may.\n\n\n                            Daniel K. Akaka\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of my friend, my colleague, \nSenator Daniel Akaka, who is set to retire after 22 years of dedicated \nservice in the Senate. He has been a personal friend to me, he has been \na personal friend to my family, and to my parents. He and his wife \nMillie, a wonderful, beautiful woman, have been leaders on behalf of \nthe people of Hawaii and have long been friends and partners to the \npeople of Alaska.\n  Senator Akaka has served our Nation and the great State of Hawaii \nhonorably for nearly 70 years. That is an incredible contribution. His \nservice began in 1943, immediately following his graduation from the \nKamehameha School for Boys in Honolulu. The Japanese attack on Pearl \nHarbor had taken place a year earlier, only 5 miles from his dormitory \nsteps. In the hours immediately following that attack, Senator Akaka, \nwho was a 17-year-old ROTC cadet, helped his classmates search for \nparatroopers in the fields above his school grounds. Like so many \nothers of his generation, Senator Akaka answered the call of duty, \njoined the U.S. Army, first with the Corps of Engineers as a mechanic \nand a\n\n[[Page S8269]]\n\nwelder, and later as a noncommissioned officer.\n  In 1952, Senator Akaka used the GI bill to earn his degree in \neducation from the University of Hawaii and began his lifelong \ndedication to our Nation's students, first as a teacher, then as a \nprincipal at a high school in Honolulu, and later with the Department \nof Health, Education and Welfare.\n  Senator Akaka was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives \nin 1976 and then went on to win six more elections. It was clearly \nevident to the people of Hawaii within that second congressional \ndistrict they valued his passion and his dedication for the office. In \n1990, after the death of Senator Spark Matsunaga, Senator Akaka was \nappointed and then subsequently elected to the seat in the Senate that \nhe has held for 22 years now.\n  Senator Akaka's fortitude and his determination have not waned in \nthese 70 years. As the first Native Hawaiian ever to serve in the \nSenate, and the only indigenous person currently serving in the Senate, \nhe is a proven champion for American Indians, Alaska Natives, and \nNative Hawaiians. It was just in October of this year that Senator \nAkaka came to Alaska and was honored by the Alaska Federation of \nNatives with the Denali Award. This award is presented to an individual \nwho is not an Alaska Native for their contributions to the growth and \ndevelopment of the Alaska Native community's culture, economy, and \nhealth. Senator Akaka has done that repeatedly over the years.\n  The efforts he has worked on, whether it was bigger initiatives or \nwhether to ensure the people in King Cove had access to an airport so \ntheir lives weren't threatened in a medical emergency and they could \nget out, Senator Akaka has stepped up to ensure the people of Alaska \nare cared for.\n  It has truly been a pleasure to work with Senator Akaka over these \npast 10 years on the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. The chairmanship \nhe has administered has been admired and appreciated by all of us who \nare on that committee.\n  Senator Akaka's leadership, wisdom, and grasp of issues has helped us \nwork together toward many visions and goals that we shared. The Save \nNative Women Act--a bill to help protect native women and children \nacross our 565 federally recognized tribes--was largely incorporated \ninto the Senate version of the 2012 Violence Against Women Act. We need \nto make sure that legislation passes. And again, as we think about the \nstatistics that so many of our native peoples face, we need to make \ncertain we are making appropriate gains and strides to help address \nthem, and Chairman Akaka has worked with us on that. We fought to \nensure the preservation of native languages not only in our communities \nbut within our classrooms.\n  As I mentioned, I have long supported the concept that Senator Inouye \nand Senator Akaka have championed with regard to Federal recognition of \nNative Hawaiians.\n  But Senator Akaka is also special to two other constituencies--our \nFederal employees and our veterans. He is one of this body's leading \nexperts on some of the more arcane laws that apply to Federal civil \nservice. Alaska's Federal employees clearly appreciate his leadership \non the Non-Foreign AREA Act, which made them eligible for locality pay \nthat counts toward retirement. This is an issue in my State that took \nsome time to negotiate and to move through, but the Federal employees \nin Alaska--as they are seeing the benefits of that locality pay--owe \nthanks and gratitude to the work of Senator Akaka. And of course he \nknows well the laws that govern the U.S. Postal Service probably as \nwell as anyone in this body.\n  During Senator Akaka's tenure as chairman of the Senate Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, this body has made great progress in ensuring that \nthe VA had a budget commensurate with its needs. His contributions to \nensuring that post-9/11 veterans had access to critically needed health \nand education resources will endure.\n  As neighbors in the Pacific, Alaska and Hawaii have always shared a \nvery special bond, not only because of our geography and our time \ndifferences. Every time I endure a 12-hour flight across the country to \ngo home--and home is four time zones away--I am reminded that it takes \nSenator Akaka a couple hours more and one time zone more to get home. \nBut it is not only our geography that binds us; we have many other \nsimilarities: our indigenous peoples, the relative youth of our States, \nour unique landscapes, and for years our delegations have worked \ntogether across the aisle for the good of our people.\n  Senator Akaka's bipartisan approach, his willingness to work toward \nsuccess, will be missed by myself and so many of our colleagues. And, \nof course, I don't think Senator Akaka would call it bipartisanship. He \nwould call it aloha. We work in the aloha spirit.\n  With that, I wish to tell my friend and my colleague, mahalo. From \nthe bottom of my heart, mahalo. I am going to miss you, Senator Akaka. \nI am going to miss your wife Millie and your entire extended family. \nBut as you return home to your beloved Hawaii, know that you have left \nan impression on so many.\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/20/senate-section/article/S8269-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8269-S8274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             RULES CHANGES\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the challenge of \nthis Chamber being a Chamber that can deliberate and decide issues, the \nbig issues facing America.\n  I don't think it will come as a surprise to anyone that the Senate, \nonce famed as the world's greatest deliberative body, has become \nparalyzed. At the heart of that paralysis is a change in the use of the \nfilibuster. ``Filibuster'' is a term I believe comes from the Dutch, \nand it refers to piracy. In this context, it is about someone taking \nover this Chamber--taking over the normal process by which we debate \nissues and decide issues by majority vote.\n  In the past, when everyone understood the very heart of what we do is \nto make decisions by majority vote, the filibuster--the takeover of \nthis Chamber, the objection to a simple majority vote--was very rare. \nPeople did this only once or twice in a career for some issue of \nprofound personal values or of extreme concern to an issue in their \nState, and it was most often small factions who would do this.\n  In 1916, there was a debate--a debate that went on about whether to \nput weaponry on our commercial shipping. This was pre-World War I. In \nthe course of that debate, there was a small faction who said: We are \ngoing to interrupt and we are going to object to the simple majority \nbecause we strongly oppose the United States putting any defenses on \nits merchant vessels, even though those vessels were being sunk by the \nGermans as they went over to Europe.\n  This was enormously frustrating to President Woodrow Wilson, and it \nwas enormously frustrating to the Members of this Chamber who said: We \nmust complete debate and make a decision and only a small number want \nto block us from making that decision.\n  The following year, in 1917, they adopted a rule that we could close \ndebate if we had two-thirds of this Chamber voting to close debate. \nThat is called cloture. Cloture continued to be an instrument that in \nsituations where there was an individual or a small group who stretched \nthe limits of the courtesy of full debate, then the Chamber as a whole \ncould say: Enough is enough. We need to bring this debate to an end and \nmake a decision.\n  Over time, things have changed. This objection to a simple majority--\nwhich makes it impossible for the Chamber to end debate--has grown from \nits occasional use to a routine instrument of legislative destruction. \nIt is used on virtually every debatable motion.\n  A single bill can have as many as seven or so steps where you have a \ndebatable motion. In that situation, then an objection to a simple \nmajority can be done multiple times. Each one of those objections \nwastes a week of the Senate's time on this floor, which means the \nSenate not only cannot decide the issue at hand, it runs out of\n\n[[Page S8270]]\n\nthe time to debate and deliberate on the other issues that we should be \ndoing on the floor.\n\n  As I will show in a chart later, we can measure this in part by the \naction on appropriations bills. We have an expectation of--it used to \nbe 13 appropriations bills; now it is 12. In the last 2 years we have \ndone exactly 1, 1 out of 24--totally unacceptable in terms of this \nChamber fulfilling its responsibility just in that one area of \nappropriations, decisions about how to spend moneys in different parts \nof the government.\n  I know when people hear the word ``filibuster'' they do not think of \nsimply a silent objection. Yet that is what is in the rules, a silent \nobjection to a simple majority. They think of someone taking the floor \nand making their case on an issue of deep principle or deep concern to \ntheir State. They might be thinking a little bit about a picture that \nlooks a little like this.\n  This is that famous scene from ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.'' \nJimmy Stewart is on the floor. He talks through the night, making his \ncase. He is fighting for fairness and justice in the face of \ncorruption. That is what people think of when they think of a \nfilibuster.\n  But the way it works today, it is a simple objection. We ask for a \nunanimous consent request, meaning do all 100 Senators agree to go to \nfinal vote, and someone says: I object. That is all that is required. \nThat is all it ever meant. But in the past, that objection to the heart \nof democracy, to the simple majority, meant you felt honor bound to \ncome to the floor of the Senate and make your case while you stood in \nthe way of the decisionmaking of this august Chamber. But that sense of \nhonor-bound responsibility to make your case before your colleagues, \nmake your case before the American people, has disappeared. Indeed, \ninstead of the filibuster being something done by an individual or a \nsmall group, it is now used as an instrument of party warfare.\n  The minority party, be it the Democrats or be it the Republicans, \nsay: You know, we can slow down the majority by eating up their time. \nWe can do it by filing an objection on every debatable motion, and we \nwill simply eat up the calendar and prevent them from getting their \nwork done. Then we will say how incompetent they are, that they can't \nget their work done--after we have caused them to be unable to do it.\n  I thought I would go through the enormous expansion of this tool of \nlegislative destruction in many different categories in the years since \n1970. Before we do that, by the way, every now and then someone says: \nYou know, the Senate was designed as a supermajority body. Indeed, that \ncould not be further from the truth. There are specific cases where our \nforefathers said a supermajority makes sense; for example, in the case \nof overriding a Presidential veto, in the case of approving a treaty, \nin the case of having a constitutional amendment. But they viewed that \nthese legislative Chambers, like every legislative chamber in the \nworld, would make decisions by simple majority.\n  In fact, they addressed this in the Federalist Papers. Here we have \nAlexander Hamilton and his commentary on supermajority decisionmaking \nthat was fierce. He said--and this is just a small part of his diatribe \nabout how destructive it would be to have this Chamber tied up in a \nsupermajority. He referred to it as driving ``tedious delays; continual \nnegotiation and intrigue; contemptible compromises of the public \ngood.''\n  We have seen some of those tedious delays, we have seen some of those \ncontemptible compromises, and certainly he was looking into a crystal \nball and accurately summarizing the situation.\n  He was not alone. Here we have compatriot James Madison, also in the \nFederalist Papers. He noted ``the fundamental principle of free \ngovernment would be reversed.''\n  By ``fundamental principle,'' he is talking about the fact that when \nyou make a decision by simple majority, you make the decision that most \npeople think is the right direction in which to go. But when you make a \ndecision by supermajority, and a minority can block it, you are making \nthe decision the smaller number thinks is the right decision. In that \nsense, you have a series of worst decisions rather than a series of \nbest decisions. So the wisdom of the group tapping into the expertise \nof colleagues who came from many directions, many walks of life, is not \nrealized.\n  Let's take a look at what has happened in this use of the objection \nto a simple majority, otherwise known as a filibuster. Here we are \nevaluating it in terms of the cloture motions that are filed. These are \nmotions that are designed to drive a vote on whether to close debate. \nIt is one way of measuring the number of filibusters. How about \nnominations? We can see that basically the first filibusters on \nnominations were in about 1970. I was about 14 years old. I was \nstarting high school. That is when this started to be done. We can see \nthat as time passed, we have an enormous increase in the number of \nfilibusters on nominations. Over here, in 2012-24. It is a situation \nwhere these are only cloture motions. So many other nominations were \nblocked because of threatened filibusters.\n  We have this vast number of positions in the executive branch, this \nvast number of judge positions that are unfilled. The advice and \nconsent clause in the Constitution that gives this Chamber, the Senate, \nthe chance to weigh in has been turned, through the expanded use of the \nfilibuster, into a tool that damages the other branches of government. \nIt prevents the President from having his team that he would like to \nhave, and that blocks us from getting the judges onto the courts so we \ncan have the sort of speedy criminal justice system we envision and \npromise.\n  That was just nominations. Let's take a look at some other areas. The \nmotion to proceed is the very first step for a bill. It is just a \nmotion to get the bill on the floor to debate. That was virtually never \nfilibustered. We have one time down here in 1932, until we are in the \n1960s, and then early 1970s. It takes off. We see this massive \nexpansion that makes no sense unless you are just trying to paralyze \nthe system because these filibusters are not in any way construed to \nenhance debate.\n  These are to prevent debate, prevent us from getting to a bill to \ndebate it, prevent an agenda from ever being considered by this body. \nHere we have over 30, and over 20--in recent years just a huge number \nof efforts to prevent these bills from ever coming to the floor to be \ndebated. How can we weigh in and address the big issues facing \nour Nation if we cannot get the bill on the floor to begin with? Again, \nin recent times, and enormous change in strategy used by the minority \nto prevent debate.\n\n  Here we have amendments. The first time, about 1962, the filibuster \nwas used on an amendment because people envisioned the filibuster as \nsomething to be used at the end of the process on a bill when all the \ndifferent pieces have been put in place, and you say: Is their a core \nprinciple compromise after I have fought and won or fought and lost? \nBut then folks got the clever idea: We can do this on any debatable \nmotion, including an amendment. So the number of filibusters on \namendments also grew enormously from the early 1970s forward.\n  Final passage? This is where we see the traditional role of the \nfilibuster, one or two or three a year over these many years from the \n1920s on through the 1960s. Stop the chart right here in the middle. \nThat is what the filibuster was, very occasional battles over core \nprinciples. Then we have 1970 and look what happened. We had this \nexplosion of 25--that was 1974. What happened as a result?\n  In 1975 there was a big battle on this floor about changing the rules \nbecause this abuse was preventing the Senate from doing its business. \nSo in 1975 we have this enormous battle. There are three votes in which \na simple majority says, yes; we can change the rules by simple \nmajority, and we intend to do so. The majority leader who opposed this \nfinally said: OK, I get the message. A simple majority is prepared to \nchange the rules if we do not address the paralysis of the Senate, and \nthey changed the rules.\n  The compromise was to change it from 67 required to close debate down \nto 60, from two-thirds down to three-fifths. You can see the number of \nfilibusters then dropped off, and they were resolved more easily.\n  But what do we have? Again, this enormous explosion until 2012, 35 \nfilibusters. We are deeply afflicted. This is\n\n[[Page S8271]]\n\nwhy we are having this conversation over how to save the Senate from \nitself, from this instrument of the objection to a simple majority that \nis being used to thwart the ability of the people's elected leaders \nfrom addressing the issues our Nation faces.\n  After a bill has gone through passage, it goes over to the House or \nthe House bill comes to the Senate. When both Chambers have passed the \nsame bill in different forms, then you need to get it to negotiation. \nThat is done through a conference committee. It used to be nobody \nfilibustered a conference committee. Here we have in 1972 the first \nfilibuster on a conference committee.\n  Why would you object to getting the three motions done that are \nrequired to get a bill into negotiation with the House? That doesn't \nfacilitate debate in any conceivable way. But it was an instrument to \neat up the time of this Chamber so they could not address other issues. \nIt is like walking knee deep in molasses. You just cannot get very far \nvery quickly.\n  Then we see this huge explosion in using this filibuster, the \nobjection to a simple majority, in the latter part of this last decade. \nThe result has been this: We have basically given up on conference \ncommittees. It is too hard to get to conference. So we have informal \nnegotiation, or we have kind of a process called ``pinging,'' where we \nchange the House bill after we pass our own version, we change it, send \nit back over, they change it, send it back over to us--not a very \neffective way to negotiate a compromise that can pass in the same form. \nAnd until and unless it passes both Chambers in the same form, it \ncannot get to the President. So this was a huge change as well.\n  Then we have, after conference committee, reports coming back from \nconference. Now you have the same version; it normally has not changed \nvery much. Again, we see this explosion--once, basically, in about \n1945, and then about 1970 an explosion, and then we see the dropoff in \npart because we just started giving up on conference committees.\n  In each one of these debatable motions we have a problem, a problem \nthat has grown enormously from 1970 forward, the last 40 years. This is \nsomething I have witnessed within my own lifetime. I came here in 1976 \nas an intern for Senator Hatfield. I was assigned to the Tax Reform Act \nof 1976. In those days there was no camera on this floor and there was \nno e-mail, so essentially the only way the Senator had to monitor a \nbill was that he or she would meet with a staff member outside these \ndoors where the elevators are.\n  I would sit up in the staff gallery and monitor the debate on the Tax \nReform Act, and I would rush down with each vote, meet Senator Hatfield \ncoming out of the elevators, and brief him on the details of the \namendment. There were sometimes a couple of layers of motions, and I \nwould proceed to say: Here is what the folks are thinking about back \nhome; here is what folks back home are thinking about this issue.\n  He would come back to vote, and I would rush back upstairs and see \nhow he voted, how everyone else voted, how it came out.\n  I would rush back and start making notes on the next debate. Well, \nthis Chamber deliberated on amendment after amendment. When one \namendment was done, then a series of folks near the Chamber would raise \ntheir hand and call on the Presiding Officer. Whoever the Presiding \nOfficer called on--and according to the rules, the Presiding Officer is \nsupposed to call on the first person he or she hears--and that person \nwould present the next amendment and then the debate would begin. They \nwould debate for an hour, hour and a half, and then they would vote.\n  These amendments were germane and relevant to the issue. They had to \ndo with different aspects of the Tax Code: Was it Employee Stock \nOwnership Plan, ESOPs. That was something Senator Hatfield cared a \ngreat deal about. Was it the change in a provision regarding teachers' \nhome offices? It seemed that was something every teacher in Oregon was \nwriting us about. We debated these issues, we decided these issues, and \nit was a simple majority. That is the way the Senate deliberated and \ndecided on issues over our history until the last 40 years when this \nmassive expansion of the use of the objection to the simple majority \nhas paralyzed this body.\n  I thought it was interesting to see this cartoon. It says: I will \ntell you all the reasons we shouldn't reform the filibuster. I assume \nit is depicting a Senator on the floor of the Senate. And it says, No. \n1, it will restrict my ability to frivolously stymie everything. And \nthen the Senator says, No. 2--well, the Senator thinks about it, \ngrimaces, frowns, and cannot think of any other reason that we should \nnot reform the filibuster other than the ability to frivolously stymie \neverything. Finally the Senator says: How long do I have to keep \ntalking? A little farther down here it says: You can read recipes for \nparalysis.\n  Well, that is what we have in the Senate right now. Due to the \nextraordinary abuse of the filibuster, we have a recipe for paralysis.\n  It is time to do something about that. The first thing we should do \nis eliminate the filibuster on the motion to proceed. That was the \nfirst step in the process I showed in the earlier chart. It doesn't \nmake sense to debate whether to debate. We should be able to vote on \nwhether the bill comes to the floor. Let's have a couple of hours to \ndebate that. Then we have a simple majority vote. Either we decide we \nare taking up that bill or nomination or we are not taking up that bill \nor nomination, and we go on to the next order of business. We should \nnot waste a week of Senate time trying to decide whether we are going \nto have a debate on a bill or nomination.\n  Those listening may wonder why there is a week of wasted time. Well, \nit works like this: First of all, we have the motion and then we have \ndebate that takes place and we think we will wrap it up, but we don't. \nThen we think we have a motion to close debate, but to do that there \nhas to be a petition signed by 16 Senators. So on day three we get the \npetition. Then the petition has to ripen, which means it has to sit \nover on intervening days. So we start the debate on Monday, sign the \npetition on Tuesday, and now we cannot vote on whether to close debate \nuntil Thursday. Then if we are able to vote and get 60 votes, we have \nto have 30 hours of postcloture debate. Now the week is gone. The 30 \nhours wipes out Friday.\n  If that is done multiple times on a bill, it means multiple weeks are \nwiped out with nothing productive. There is no productive conversation \non this floor, no point and counterpoint, no insights with people's \nlife experience, no questions asked or questions answered. Nothing \nproductive gets accomplished.\n  If we want to sum up all of the filibusters on all of these different \nmotions, here is one way to compare it. Lyndon Johnson was the majority \nleader for 6 years. During those 6 years, he had to file one petition. \nTechnically it is called a motion, but actually 16 people have to sign \na petition. He had one motion to end debate in 6 years.\n  Now we have Harry Reid who has been the majority leader for 6 years. \nAs this poster says, ``387 and counting.'' I think the number today is \n391. There have been 391 1-week delays in 6 years. How many weeks are \nthere in 6 years? Well, that would be about 312 weeks. Is that right? \nYes, 312. So that is 312 weeks, and as it says here, ``387 and \ncounting''--390 weeks wasted.\n  No wonder we don't get things done, such as our nominations for the \nexecutive branch or the judiciary, our appropriations bills, our \nauthorizing bills, or the policy changes that are going to make a big \nimpact on the challenges we face in America. As we can see here it is 1 \nversus 387. This is now a couple of days old, so it is 391 and \ncounting. We cannot allow this to continue. We have a responsibility to \nthe people who elected us to be a seasoned, deliberative body.\n  Some say: Well, this is what the Senate is all about. There is a \nstory recited by historians that says that is apocryphal. It is a story \nabout President Washington and Thomas Jefferson. They are having a \ndiscussion. Washington says the Senate is meant to be the cooling \nsaucer. Just as we poured our hot tea out of our cup and into our \nsaucer to let it cool so we can drink it, the Senate is meant to be a \ncooling saucer. Well, perhaps the Senate was meant to be a cooling \nsaucer, but it was not meant to be a deep\n\n[[Page S8272]]\n\nfreeze. The cooling saucer concept is that the Senate is a little more \ndetached from the immediate fashion of the moment. It is a little more \ndetached because we are elected for 6-year terms, not 2-year terms. It \nis a little more detached because we are staggered so some have been \nhere 2 years, some 4 years, and some 6 years. After their first term, \nthen they will be here many years thereafter. It is supposed to have a \nlittle more distance on the immediate trends because in the beginning \nwe were indirectly elected by State legislators. Of course, we changed \nthat. We changed that in the early 1900s because of the abuses that \noccurred and went to directly electing Senators.\n  The idea was longer terms, a little bit more deliberation, a smaller \nbody of folks in the Senate, two per State. That was so we could \ndeliberate thoughtfully, not so we could not deliberate. There is a big \ndifference. This is unacceptable. If this majority leader were a \nRepublican and the Democrats were doing this, it would be unacceptable. \nIt is unacceptable for either minority party to devise and execute a \nstrategy that prevents this body from doing its work.\n  The thing that is diabolical about the filibuster is that in the \nprocedural sense it is invisible. So we have this unanimous consent \nrequest--this courtesy--is everyone ready? Should we vote? When the \nSenate was a small Senate, and prior to 1970, virtually the answer \nwas always yes, except for those rare moments on issues of deep values. \nBut now it is done as a minority party strategy to obstruct, and it is \ndone on virtually every motion. And because it is an objection to a \nvote, it has never required people to talk on the floor. Of course, we \nall believed someone would talk on the floor because that is the way it \nwas done. If someone violated the majority principle, that person had \nthe courage and principle to come to this floor and explain that to \ncolleagues and the American people. That is no longer true. Now there \nis no courage. It is in hiding.\n\n  I will give an example. We had a bill on the floor in 2010. It was \ncalled the DISCLOSE Act. The DISCLOSE Act said that for every donation, \nthe public should know where it comes from. If it comes from ranchers, \npeople should know about it; if it comes from Oklahoma, people should \nknow about it; if it comes from the tobacco industry, people should \nknow it. The people have a right to understand who is financing the ads \nthey are seeing or who is financing the literature they are seeing. \nThat is part of a transparent and accountable democracy.\n  We had 59 folks on the floor of the Senate say: Yes, we have debated \nenough, let's close debate, and we could not get the 60th vote. Not \nbecause there was more to be said, but no one among those who were \nvoting for additional debate would want to be seen debating. They \ndidn't want to be seen defending secrecy. They didn't want to be seen \ndefending the creation of vast pools of cash that flowed freely between \nsuper PACs and dumped into campaigns at the last second with nobody \nknowing where it came from. They didn't want anyone to know where vast \npools of money were going under deliberately misleading names. Maybe it \nwas a group that wanted to keep some polluting factory open, but they \ncalled themselves the Blue River Coalition or the Blue Skies Coalition \nbecause the money could not be traced. No one wanted to come here and \ndebate that, but they voted for a debate. That is the silent secret \nfilibuster that has wiped out accountability to colleagues and \naccountability to the American public. We need to end that.\n  Right now the minority leader has come down and said several times he \ndoesn't like this idea. He doesn't like it at all. He has called those \nof us who promoted transparency and accountability sophomoric. Well, I \ndidn't think that was particularly a polite thing to say, but let's say \nwe have a difference of opinion. I am out here advocating for this \nChamber to be able to do its responsibility before the American public. \nI am out here advocating that if someone votes for more debate, they \nhave to have the courage of their convictions to make their case before \ntheir colleagues and come to the floor. If they don't have the courage, \nthen we go ahead with the simple majority vote. It is that \nstraightforward.\n  There are some folks who say: We can already have a talking \nfilibuster under current rules. We don't need to change the rules. I \nfound this interesting because the fact is that all of the writing \nabout the theory and historical efforts--I will say one thing, and that \nis that over any length of time it is impossible for the majority to \nkeep a filibustering minority talking. Why is that? It is because it \ntakes the majority of 51 Senators to create a quorum and force 1 \nfilibustering Senator on the floor. That has been a myth that some of \nmy colleagues have been perpetrating. I thought I would go over it a \nlittle bit more. There was a recent book by two very well-steeped \nscholars. Richard Arenberg was one of those scholars. Richard Arenberg \nwas an aide to Senator Carl Levin as well as to Senator Tsongas and \nmajority leader George Mitchell, so he has had a long career of \nexperience here on the floor of the Senate. The other scholar is Robert \nDove. Who is Robert Dove? He was a Parliamentarian in this Chamber. He \nspent his time working here from 1966 until 2001. In the chapter of \ntheir book entitled ``Bring in the Cots,'' they explained how this \nworks. Here are a couple of passages between pages 146 and 152 that I \nthought summed it up:\n  Those who call for forcing the filibusterers to talk either ignore or \nare unaware of the fact that for a sizable organized minority, and \ncertainly for a minority of forty-one senators or more, lengthy \nsessions are a little more than exercises in scheduling.\n  The filibusterers are able to take turns holding the floor, and since \nthey can demand the presence of a quorum at virtually any moment, it is \nthe majority that carries the heavier burden because they need to keep \nfifty-one senators nearby. If the filibusterers call for a quorum and \nit is not produced, under the rules the Senate must adjourn.\n  So they lay out the theory, and they go on for several pages doing \nthis. They also quote some other experts. One of those they quote is \nFranklin Burdette. He was a scholar who wrote ``Filibustering in the \nSenate.'' It is referred to as the classic text on the \nfilibuster. Franklin Burdette said this:\n\n       Any experienced maneuverer in the Senate knows that a \n     determined group of filibusterers, before they are themselves \n     exhausted, can usually manage to wear out the patience and \n     endurance of the majority.\n\n  Dove and Arenberg go on to quote commentator Elizabeth Drew and she \nsays this:\n\n       Many people now insist that those who use filibusters \n     should actually be made to stand up and talk through the \n     night, but there's a reason that doesn't happen anymore. In \n     the 1970s, Majority Leader Mike Mansfield realized that the \n     real punishment was not to the small band of all-night \n     speakers, but to the majority party, which had to keep a \n     quorum on hand, sleeping on the famous cots near the Senate \n     floor, lest the person conducting the filibuster suddenly \n     make a motion to adjourn the Senate, thus defeating the \n     purpose of keeping them talking.\n\n  Then Elizabeth Drew quotes Historian Ritchie who says:\n\n       The all night filibuster wore down the majority much faster \n     than it did the minority, and majority leaders haven't used \n     the tactic since.\n\n  But then Dove and Arenberg go on to cite the historical record, go \nthrough the different filibusters that have been on this floor, and one \nof the examples they cite is majority leader Lyndon Johnson's 1960 \neffort to defeat a civil rights filibuster:\n\n       Senator Johnson's effort did not work. . . . Civil rights \n     supporter Senator William Proxmire, Democrat from Wisconsin, \n     described the scene.\n\n  Now we are quoting Proxmire. He said:\n\n       We slept on cots in the old Supreme Court chamber and came \n     out to answer quorum calls. It was an absolutely exhausting \n     experience. The southerners who were doing the talking were \n     in great shape, because they would talk for two hours and \n     leave the floor for a couple of days.\n\n  Then Arenberg and Dove proceed to take a look at other cases, \nincluding majority leader Robert Byrd's 1988 effort to break a \nfilibuster against campaign finance reform:\n\n       Senator Alan Simpson frustrated this effort for much of the \n     time, simply by repeatedly requesting quorum calls. . . . The \n     bottom line is the bill never passed. The minority that was \n     blocking the bill was able to sustain their filibuster \n     through a record eight cloture votes. In the end, Majority \n     Leader Byrd had to back down.\n\n\n[[Page S8273]]\n\n\n  In most theory and practice, we can't sustain a process of having \nthose who are filibustering actually debate what they voted to debate. \nSo what many of us are proposing is that we change the rule and say \nthat if a Senator votes to debate, then that takes a minimum of 41 \nsaying, yes, we want more debate, and of those 41, at least 1 has to be \non the floor talking. This is only fair to the American people. They \nturn on C-SPAN and they see quorum calls. They see silence, and they \nwonder why the Senate isn't working on that jobs bill they had on the \nfloor a few days before. They don't know it is still on the floor, but \nthe silent secret filibuster is being used to prevent the Senate from \nproceeding and nobody is even willing to talk because they don't want \nto be seen in public defending their position. That needs to end. This \nprocess in which Senators do not have the courage to come down and make \ntheir case before the American people has to end because only if folks \nmake their case on the floor can the public weigh in, can colleagues \nweigh in and say: Yes; you are a hero. Thank you for your filibuster \nbecause you are defending some core principle I too share or you are \ndefending some key interest for my State that I too care about or they \ncan weigh in and say: You know what. You are a bum. You aren't making \nany points. You haven't described any position. You are simply \nparalyzing the Senate or, worse yet, I disagree with you. You are \ndefending big, vast pools of secret funds used to corrupt the American \npolitical system. Why would you do that? Why don't you, my Senator, \njoin the next cloture vote to close debate and get on with solving this \nproblem of vast pools of secret funds or some other key issue.\n  The Presiding Officer and I have been here just 4 years. Had I not \nbeen here as a young man and seen this Chamber as one that deliberates \nand decides, I wouldn't feel so passionately because I wouldn't \nunderstand what we had lost. What we have lost is something that \nstarted with a constitutional vision of the design of this Senate, \nincluding the courtesy of hearing everyone out before making decisions, \nand what we lost in losing the deliberative, decisionmaking body was \neverything--everything in terms of this body upholding its \nresponsibility to address the big problems facing America.\n  When we come into session on January 3, we are going to have a debate \nover rules. There are some who say let's get rid of the debate on the \nmotion to proceed, the filibuster on the motion to proceed. We know \nwhat happens then. We get a double down in the paralysis at the later \nstage at which a bill goes through. At a minimum, we must change this \ndynamic of the secret silent filibuster and say if a Senator votes for \nmore debate, a Senator must make their case on this floor.\n  I encourage citizens around this country--citizens who have watched \nthis Chamber decline and be broken and fail to address the issues we \nshould address--to weigh in with their Senators and their home States \nand let all the Senators know it is irresponsible and unacceptable for \nus to continue the current procedures in which we are so paralyzed and \nincapable of fulfilling the work that needs to be done.\n  Thank you. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Critical Job Programs\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I would like to engage my colleague, \nthe Senator from Iowa, in a colloquy.\n  I would first like to take this opportunity to commend Senator \nHarkin, Senators Inouye and Cochran and the rest of the Members of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee for crafting a responsible, commonsense \nand critical supplemental appropriations bill to allow New York, New \nJersey, Connecticut, and other impacted areas recover from the \ndevastation left by Superstorm Sandy.\n  I would like to highlight an important aspect of the recovery effort, \nand that is addressing the employment and workforce crisis following \nthe storm that has exacerbated the already chronically high \nunemployment rates in many of the impacted areas in New York and \nbeyond.\n  The human, infrastructure, and economic devastation that Superstorm \nSandy inflicted upon New York has been crippling and only comparable \nmost recently to the tragedy of the September 11 terrorist attacks. \nWhile it will be months before the economic impact of Sandy can be \nfully assessed, particularly as it relates to the dislocation of \nworkers, initial figures clearly indicate a long economic recovery for \nbusinesses and employees, particularly given that the most densely \npopulated region of the United States was at the center of the storm. \nIn fact, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that four of the \nfive counties with the highest number of labor force participants per \nsquare mile were among those hardest hit by Sandy. In addition, all 26 \nof the counties designated as major disaster areas are among the top 10 \npercent of U.S. counties in terms of labor force density, highlighting \nthe sheer number of workers impacted by Sandy.\n  Preliminary estimates are that Sandy destroyed 265,000 businesses in \nNew York State and 189,000 businesses in New Jersey, the two hardest \nhit States. To put these figures in perspective, it is estimated that \n18,700 businesses were impacted by the devastation of Hurricane Katrina \nin 2005. The estimated 265,000 New York businesses impacted employed \napproximately 3.8 million workers with over $264 billion in annual \nwages. It is also worth noting that preliminary estimates point to the \nfact that 90 percent of the impacted firms are small businesses. Worth \nnoting is also the surge in applications for jobless benefits \nincreasing by 78,000 to 439,000 in the week of November 10, the highest \nsince April 2011, mostly because a large number of applications were \nfiled in States damaged by the storm. Given these staggering numbers, \nwe can only assume that the recovery efforts of our impacted businesses \nand displaced workers will be long and difficult, demanding investment \nin government programs that can effectively help get businesses back on \ntheir feet and put people back to work.\n  While all levels of government have been very responsive in \naddressing the immediate emergency needs, it is essential to understand \nthe lessons of previous catastrophic events when designing and \nimplementing appropriate, long-term strategies for the impacted \nregion's recovery. In particular, business closures and layoffs \nresulting from the storm's devastation could prolong the economic \ndistress Sandy has caused without a dynamic, immediate, and \ncomprehensive workforce initiative to head off these impacts.\n\n[[Page S8274]]\n\n  It is well recognized that small- and medium-sized business are the \nbackbone of our economy, employing half of private sector workers and \naccounting for the creation of two out of three new jobs in the United \nStates. Immediate support and stabilization is critical to full \nrecovery of small businesses, which, as noted, make up about 90 percent \nof the 265,000 estimated New York firms impacted by Sandy. Business \ncontinuation, including keeping the doors open while loans, insurance \npayments and other incentives are realized, is essential. One Federal \ninvestment worthy of consideration is temporary employment support, \nwhich will help maintain both business operations and help prevent the \nloss of jobs through the recovery, reducing the need for unemployment \nand other Federal benefits.\n  In addition to Federal investment in workforce retention programs, \nrapid response in identifying and servicing impacted businesses and \nunemployed workers is required. As recovery efforts move forward, \nFederal, State, and local authorities should look for ways to invest in \nand partner with the extensive networks of community-based \norganizations, economic development groups, as well as organized labor \nand affiliated management to deliver workforce development services, \nincluding outreach for job opportunities, job training, and placement \nfor in-demand occupations and other related reemployment activities.\n  For example, the Consortium for Worker Education, CWE, a nonprofit \nagency specializing in workforce preparation, industry specific \ntraining, and employment services has partnered in the past with all \nlevels of government and other community based organizations to deliver \njob placement services and temporary employment support programs to \nensure worker retention in the aftermath of disasters. Their efforts \nalone have helped train and put back to work thousands of people during \nsimilar workforce crisis situations as New York finds itself in now \nfollowing Sandy.\n  By investing in innovative programs like CWE's, workforce recovery \nefforts will more effectively take into account the unique needs of \neach impacted area and deliver tailored services to impacted businesses \nand displaced workers alike.\n  Mr HARKIN. Mr. President, let me commend the Senator from New York \nfor highlighting the critical employment and workforce needs in the \nareas impacted by Superstorm Sandy. Now more than ever, Congress must \ngive our States and localities that have been hard hit by Sandy the \ntools and resources that help dislocated workers return to their jobs \nor, if necessary, find new, good-paying employment. The supplemental \nappropriations for disaster assistance bill's funding for dislocated \nworkers is just one step in the recovery process, but an important one \nto help workers get back on their feet.\n  As New York, New Jersey, and the other impacted areas move forward \nwith their recovery, I will continue to work with Senator Gillibrand so \nthat the short- and long-term needs of impacted workers are addressed.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to engage my colleague, \nSenator Tester, in a colloquy regarding language he authored in this \nbill that would amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act. This language would authorize chief \nexecutives of federally recognized tribes to submit a request for a \nmajor disaster or emergency declaration directly to the President of \nthe United States.\n  The principal effect of this language would be to eliminate the \ncurrent requirement that tribal chief executives submit such requests \nto the Governor of the State in which the tribal reservation is \nlocated; tribal chief executives would be permitted to submit such \nrequests to the President without first obtaining the Governor's \napproval.\n  The tribes of Maine--the Penobscot, the Passamaquoddy, the Houlton \nBand of Maliseet Indians, and the Aroostook Band of Micmacs--have a \njurisdictional relationships with the State of Maine which is unique \namong the 50 States. Although, based on my analysis, this language \nwould not in any way affect the relationship between the State of Maine \nand the tribes of Maine, to make this clear, I would like to pose some \nquestions to the Senator regarding the intent of the language.\n  The jurisdictional relationship between the tribes of Maine and the \nState of Maine is set forth in the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act \nand the Maine Implementing Act, the latter having been enacted by the \nMaine State Legislature and ratified and approved by Congress when it \nenacted the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act.\n  If the language the Senator authored was to be enacted into law, \nwould this in any way change the relationship of the State of Maine and \nthe tribes of Maine?\n  Mr. TESTER. No. I understand that the Maine Indian Claims Settlement \nAct not only recognized the uniqueness and significance of that \njurisdictional arrangement but specifically provided that, following \nthe enactment of the Settlement Act, no future congressional \nlegislation would in any way alter or affect that arrangement unless \nCongress specifically so provided. This requirement is set forth in \nTitle 25, Section 1735, of the United States Code.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Did the Senator take Section 1735 into account in his \ndrafting of this legislation?\n  Mr. TESTER. Yes. I understood that, given the requirement that \nSection 1735 imposed on Congress, this provision would not and should \nnot apply within or to the State of Maine unless Congress specifically \nso provided. Knowing that Section 1735 operated to that effect, I did \nnot include specific language making this legislation inapplicable to \nMaine, as such language was unnecessary. Our Senate colleagues should \nunderstand that this legislation in no way supersedes Section 1735.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Did my colleague also consider the unique foundation for \nthe Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act and the Maine Implementing Act, \nas well as the subsequent acts for the Houlton Band and the Aroostook \nBand?\n  Mr. TESTER. Yes, I understood that the Maine Indian Claims Settlement \nAct and the Maine Implementing Act constitute statutory settlement \ndocuments. Therefore, our colleagues should understand that the current \nlegislation respects the intent of the parties to Maine's historic and \ncomplex settlement and does not in any way disturb the settlement \nagreement or the statutory construct on which that settlement rests.\n  The intent of this legislation is to improve communication, response \ntimes, and recovery of disasters in Indian Country while better \nrespecting tribal sovereignty. I understand that tribes in Maine have a \nunique relationship with the State of Maine and nothing in this Act \nshould be interpreted to change or degrade that relationship.\n  This legislation, if enacted into law, would in no way change the \nrelationship between the State of Maine and the tribes of Maine. That \nmeans that, even after the enactment of this legislation, if any of the \ntribes of Maine wished to obtain a declaration from the President that \na major disaster existed, they would have to bring their request to the \nGovernor of Maine, who would have to consider the request in accordance \nwith existing standards and procedures but who would retain the \ndiscretion to deny that request.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I appreciate the time and attention of my colleague from \nMontana, Senator Tester, regarding the intent of this language, as well \nas the care that he took in crafting this legislation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/20/senate-section/article/S8274-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8274-S8275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, my home county of St. Clair, IL, lost a \ndedicated public servant this week. Mearl Justus--aptly named \n``justice''--passed away Tuesday at the age of 81. He had retired only \n1 week earlier after serving eight terms as St. Clair County sheriff.\n  Mearl Justus was a legend. He was funny, he was innovative, and he \nwas a creative thinker who was always looking for new and better ways \nto run his department. Above all, he was deeply dedicated to the people \nhe served in the county.\n  An editorial in the Belleville News-Democrat described him as ``a 6 \nfeet 2 inch teddy bear with a sailor's vocabulary and a hero's heart. \nHe was gruff. He was endearing. He was a champion, rescuing us from the \nbad guys for 60 years.'' What an epitaph.\n  He got off to a rocky start in life. He was 19 months old when his \ndad died, and he was raised by his grandparents. He was a high school \ndropout in 1953 when the mayor of Cahokia, IL, suggested he join the \nlocal police force. That is how the aptly named Mr. Justus began his \nnearly 60-year-long career in law enforcement.\n  He started as a part-time officer in the Cahokia Police Department. \nHe earned his GED and went on to earn an associate's degree at \nSouthwestern Illinois College in Belleville and then earned a \nbachelor's degree in criminal justice. He advanced quickly up the ranks \nand served as Cahokia's police chief for 22 years. He ran for sheriff \nof St. Clair County in 1983 and won--his first run for elective office. \nHe would be reelected seven times, never losing an election, and nobody \ncame close.\n  Sheriff Justus loved his job and loved having fun. One of the most \nlegendary tales of his years as sheriff was when he sent notices to \nseveral hundred fugitives from justice telling them they had won a free \npair of sneakers from the fictional Nabbir Shoestore. When the \nscofflaws turned up to claim their sneakers, the sheriff's department \nlocked them up. The department made over 50 arrests that day and 1 the \nnext despite the fact that the prior day's arrests had been widely \nreported in the news.\n  He closed up shop with a sign that read: ``Closed. Catch ya next \ntime.'' He once explained to a reporter, ``In this business, to keep \nfrom going off the deep end, you need that humor.''\n  Mearl Justus didn't drink or smoke and rarely carried a gun because \nhe said it was bulky and ``it tears my clothes up.''\n  He sold advertising space on patrol cars and put public service \nannouncements on their fenders. He provided jail inmates with a garden \nto grow vegetables. The prisoners grew their produce and gave any extra \nto local nursing homes.\n  Sheriff Justus was so dedicated to his work that he and his wife \nAudrey lived for years in a three-bedroom apartment above the county \njail. He said he figured that is where he was needed. At first, the \ncouple found the routine cell checks a little disturbing, but they grew \nfond of their living arrangement and even raised a granddaughter in \ntheir apartment.\n  Over the course of his six decades of public service, Mearl Justus \nestablished several programs for local schools, including Stranger \nDanger awareness training. He also introduced the D.A.R.E. Program in \nthe St. Clair schools long before others had it.\n  Sheriff Justus's success and dedication were widely admired by his \npeers, who elected him president of the Illinois Sheriffs' Association. \nHe was also chairman of the board of his region's Major Case Squad.\n  In recent years Sheriff Justus led efforts to combat crime and \nvandalism on MetroLink trains, the county's light rail transit system, \nmaking the system safer for those who depend on it. That is where I \ncame to know him. You see, this MetroLink is a light rail train service \nthat has been one of the most popular things that has happened in that \nregion. I grew up in that region. I used to kid my friends from St. \nLouis that I grew up in a suburb known as East St. Louis, and they all \nlaughed because nobody considers Illinois to be part of St. Louis.\n  Well, it turned out that station in East St. Louis for MetroLink was \na critical part of the political agreement that led to the creation of \nthis important light rail system. But we had a problem. East St. Louis \nhas been notoriously dangerous for years, and there was a question: How \nin the world could we expect anybody to wait at the train station with \nall the dangerous street crime in East St. Louis?\n  Mearl Justus stepped up. His St. Clair County Sheriff's Department \nprovided the protection that was needed to establish that MetroLink \nstation in my hometown of East St. Louis and to give people the peace \nof mind that if they wanted to board or leave a train or park their car \nthere, there would always be reliable law enforcement. Mearl Justus \nshowed the way for many of us when we couldn't think of how to resolve \nthis quandary. That is the kind of problemsolver he was.\n  Mearl Justus had an amazing sense of humor. For many years, his own \nWeb site featured the sheriff wearing a sombrero and a boast that any \nlocal event featuring Mearl Justus as the master of ceremonies would \ndraw twice as many people.\n  He cared deeply about the people. He hosted ``Slumber in the \nSlammer'' fundraisers for a women's crisis center, allowing people to \nsleep in the jail in exchange for a donation to the local crisis \ncenter. He once arranged cataract surgery for a woman whose savings had \nbeen stolen.\n  He said he looked forward to coming to work every day and wanted \npeople to think of him as an honest, people-oriented public official. \nHe is going to be remembered for that and so much more. Mearl Justus \nmade St. Clair County not just a safer place but a better place. I am \nhonored to have known him. He was a fun person to be around, but you \nknew that when it came to his job, he took it very, very seriously.\n  My wife Loretta and I send our condolences to his wife Audrey, his \ndaughters Kay and Debra; and his three granddaughters and three great-\ngrandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/20/senate-section/article/S8275-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8275-S8276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RETIREMENT OF ILLINOIS STATE SENATOR JEFFREY M. SCHOENBERG\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my friend, Illinois \nState Senator Jeff Schoenberg, on his more than two decades of service \nin the Illinois General Assembly.\n  Jeff was elected to the Illinois House in 1990 at the age of 30. He \nserved six terms there before being elected to the Illinois Senate in \n2003, where he rose through the ranks, serving as assistant majority \nleader, chairman on the Commission on Government Forecasting and \nAccountability, and vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee. More \nimportantly, Jeff Schoenberg has been a dedicated public servant to his \nconstituents in Evanston and to the people of Illinois for 22 years.\n  During his time in the Illinois General Assembly, Jeff sponsored a \nbill that would provide better access to quality health care and give \nconsumers the opportunity to make better choices for their health. He \nalso secured more than $5 billion in Federal funds for safety net \nhospitals such as Mount Sinai, Mercy, and Holy Cross.\n  Jeff Schoenberg supported the Illinois Safe Choice Zones Act, which \nhelped pave the way for Illinois' pioneering work in stem cell \nresearch, and insisted on greater accountability and oversight at the \nIllinois State Toll Highway Authority.\n  A father of two himself, Jeff was critical to the passage of a \nmeasure allowing schools to keep and administer epinephrine for \nanaphylactic shock following the death of a 13-year-old girl from \nChicago who had an allergic reaction to peanut oil while at school.\n  Jeff also understood foreign policy issues, including support for \nlegislation to divest State pension funds from foreign countries doing \nbusiness with Iran and drawing attention to the genocide in Cambodia. \nJeff visited Cambodia last month as part of a delegation representing \nthe U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.\n  Incoming State Senator Daniel Biss will have large shoes to fill \ngiven how well Jeff has served the Illinois Senate's Ninth District. \nSince the outset of his political career, Jeff has been inspired by the \nlikes of Congressman and Federal Judge Abner Mikva and U.S. Senator \nPaul Simon, for whom he and I both worked.\n  Jeff's dedication to service now takes on a new focus in improving \nthe lives\n\n[[Page S8276]]\n\nof children and families through an expanded role advising the J.B. and \nM.K. Pritzker Family Foundation on its philanthropic endeavors. His \napproach to this work is made clear by something he said just last \nyear:\n  My position in the Senate is only one point of entry into public \nservice.\n  As Jeff moves into his new role, I can only say to him: Thanks for \nbeing my friend and my ally in so many good causes. While you may be \nretiring from the Illinois State Senate, your constituents and I know \nthat you will never retire from working for the public good.\n  Thanks to Jeff Schoenberg and his family for all they have given to \nour State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/20/senate-section/article/S8276-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MAYOR JOHN REDNOUR\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to wish Mayor John \nRednour of Du Quoin, IL, a happy 78th birthday and to thank him as he \nprepares to retire after so many great years of public service to his \ntown and Illinois.\n  John Rednour, known to most people as simply Rednour, has served as \nmayor of Du Quoin since 1989. Public service was his third career. He \nstarted work as an ironworker, a member of the United Ironworkers. He \nworked on projects in St. Louis and in Chicago and served as site \nsuperintendent during construction of the U.S. Federal penitentiary in \nMarion.\n  In 1970 John moved to Du Quoin with his wife Wanda and three kids. In \nthe early 1980s John began his second career when he and some local \nshareholders took control of the Du Quoin State Bank, converting it \ninto a community bank that served downstate Illinois. Today the bank \nstands as one of the strongest in our State, and John remains the \nbank's chairman.\n  But it was John Rednour's work as mayor of Du Quoin that really \ndistinguished his public service. In his 23 years as mayor, he focused \non balancing the city's budget and investing in its infrastructure. His \nlegacy to Du Quoin includes construction of the Poplar Street \noverpass--a major thoroughfare for travel on Highway 51 through \nsouthern Illinois--improved water service and the development of an \nindustrial park. He managed to do all of this with a balanced budget, \ncreating new opportunities for his community even in tough times.\n  He is a member of the five-person Illinois State Police Merit Board \nand a proud Democrat, I might add, but he knows there are some things \nthat need to be done on a bipartisan basis. He has made it his habit to \nmeet with the Du Quoin city council members and offered to take advice \nfrom each and every one of them. He told them to always vote for what \nis good for Du Quoin.\n  Loretta and I consider ourselves lucky to count John and Wanda \nRednour among our friends. We have many happy memories of State fair \nparties at the Rednour home during our trips to the Du Quoin State \nFair. Loretta and I have been regular visitors to Rednour's home and \nhave warm memories of staying overnight after the fair party and having \nWanda greet us at breakfast with her so-called Texas pancakes--and they \ncould fit in the State of Texas.\n  As a labor leader, businessman, mayor, husband, and father, John \nRednour has contributed enormously to Du Quoin, downstate Illinois, and \nto our entire State and Nation. While his day-to-day presence in city \nhall is going to be missed, residents of Du Quoin can take comfort in \nknowing that John Rednour's leadership is still in their community, \nwith a strong foundation and a bright future.\n  In addition to three children, John and Wanda are blessed with five \ngrandchildren and five great-grandchildren, who I am sure are going to \nbe glad to have more time with John and Wanda now.\n  I thank John for his many years of distinguished public service. \nLoretta and I wish him and his family all the best in retirement. We \nlook forward to many more stories and more pancakes in the years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/20/senate-section/article/S8276-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8276-S8277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE S.S. BADGER\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Chicagoans were asked in a recent poll to \nidentify the one asset in the city of Chicago that meant the most to \nthem. The overwhelming vote was for Lake Michigan--not surprising.\n  Lake Michigan is the primary source of drinking water for more than \n10 million people--not just in my State of Illinois but in Wisconsin, \nIndiana, and Michigan. It supports a multibillion-dollar fishing \nindustry that is important to local economies. And it is beautiful. It \nis a recreational asset for swimming, kayaking, boating, or just taking \na walk along the beach. It is a gorgeous lake.\n  I always look forward to getting up to Chicago. We have a condo that \noverlooks Lake Michigan that I consider to be a great place to sit and \njust look at this beautiful lake and what happens on it, whether I am \ndrinking a cup of coffee in the morning with my wife or a glass of wine \nin the evening.\n  But, unfortunately, the health of our great Lake Michigan is \nthreatened every summer when a coal-burning ferry boat dumps tons of \ncoal ash into the lake every day, all summer long.\n  Meet the S.S. Badger. Many people have fond memories of this boat, \nthe S.S. Badger, steaming from its homeport of Ludington, MI, to \nManitowac, WI, every summer. But they need to be reminded of one thing: \nThe S.S. Badger is the last coal-fired ferry in the United States, and \nthere is a reason it is the last one.\n  Every year, based on the estimates given to us by the company, this \nboat dumps 600-plus tons of coal ash into Lake Michigan--600-plus tons \nevery year since 1953. That is their record. What does that do to Lake \nMichigan? In the 59 years the S.S. Badger has been in operation, it has \ndischarged a conservative estimate of 35,400 tons of coal ash into Lake \nMichigan. That is enough to coat the entire floor of Lake Michigan with \na layer of ash 2\\1/2\\ inches thick.\n  A recent article in the Chicago Tribune did a comparison of the \namount of coal ash discharged from the Badger to the dry cargo residue \ndischarged by all other vessels operating on Lake Michigan. Here is \nwhat they found:\n  Fifty U.S. ships and 70 Canadian ships on Lake Michigan are \nresponsible for a combined total of 89 tons of solid waste dumped every \nyear. That is 120 ships, 89 tons in a year. The Badger by itself is \nresponsible for almost 6 times more waste than these 120 vessel \ncombined, even when using the most conservative estimate of what the \nBadger dumps overboard during the course of a summer.\n  Yesterday the EPA vessel general permit that has enabled the coal-\nfired car ferry S.S. Badger to discharge coal ash into Lake Michigan \nexpired. The owner of the Badger insists that the coal ash is basically \njust sand. We know better.\n  Scientists are concerned about coal ash because it contains such \nthings as arsenic, lead, and mercury. Once in the lake, these chemicals \nenter the food chain through the water we drink and the fish we eat, \nand then they accumulate in our bodies and are associated with cancer \nand reproductive and neurological damage. We know how dangerous mercury \ncontamination in fish is to human health.\n  Well, it is time for the S.S. Badger to stop adding to the problem \nand either clean up its operation or close it down. If the Badger's \nowners had only recently realized that dumping coal ash was a problem, \nit might be OK to cut them some slack. But the Badger's owners have a \nlong history of avoiding the steps needed to clean up their act.\n  Most other vessels of the Great Lakes converted from coal to diesel \nfuel before the Badger made its first voyage. In 2008, when conversion \nto a new fuel was way overdue, the Bush administration granted the \nferry a waiver to continue dumping coal ash through 2012. That was 5 \nyears too many of toxic dumping by this boat, but to make matters \nworse, the Badger's owners still have not made any reasonable efforts \nto stop dumping coal ash in the lake.\n  Now they are attempting to persuade the EPA to give them just 5 more \nyears to take a look at this problem. After I came out in opposition to \nthis 5-year extension, the Badger's owner asked to meet me in my \noffice. I, of course, agreed. He said he was applying for an EPA permit \nto continue dumping coal ash while he looks for ways to convert the \nBadger to run on liquefied natural gas. He wanted to make the Badger, \nhe\n\n[[Page S8277]]\n\nsaid, the greenest vessel on the Great Lakes. What a great idea, I \nthought. But it turns out it isn't even close to being realistic.\n  Today there are few suppliers of liquefied natural gas in the area. \nThere are no shipyards in the United States that are qualified to \nconvert passenger vessels to run on liquefied natural gas. And it would \ntake close to $50 million just to develop the infrastructure on the \nland needed to transport fuel to the dock for the Badger.\n  One day, all the boats on Great Lakes might be powered by natural \ngas, but that isn't a realistic plan right now or within the next few \nyears. It is just another delaying tactic from the owners of the S.S. \nBadger. These owners were given a deadline to convert the ship's fuel \nor dispose of the ash in a responsible way 5 years ago. The Badger has \nblatantly avoided complying with these EPA regulations.\n  There has been an effort in the House of Representatives to provide a \nspecial exemption for this filthy boat on Lake Michigan forever. They \nwant them declared some sort of a national historic monument or \nsomething and say that it shouldn't be governed by environmental \nregulations.\n  These are Congressmen whose districts are on Lake Michigan. I have to \nask them, what do you think about the lake and its future, when this \nboat is responsible for six times the solid waste of all the other \nships that use Lake Michigan in commerce on an annual basis? Six times. \nThat to me is a horrible thing to continue.\n  They have had plenty of time to clean up their act and they failed. \nNow we have to get serious. I am hoping the EPA decides very quickly \nthat it is time to end the coal-fired ferry tradition of the S.S. \nBadger. This is a vessel that generates and dumps 5 tons of coal ash \nlaced with mercury, lead, and arsenic into Lake Michigan every single \nday. This great lake cannot take any more toxic dumping, no matter how \nhistoric or quaint the source may be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/20/senate-section/article/S8277-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8277-S8295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  LETTERS FROM THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES RE: MEDICAL \n                        DEVICE USER FEE PROGRAM\n\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S8277, December 20, 2012, the Record reads: Mr. \nHARKIN.

Nothing in this letter \n     precludes the Agency from protecting the public health by \n     exercising its authority to provide a reasonable assurance of \n     the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. Both FDA and \n     the industry are committed to the spirit and intent of the \n     goals described in this letter.\n\n\n                        I. Process Improvements\n\n     A. Pre-Submissions\n       FDA will institute a structured process for managing Pre-\n     Submissions. Pre-Submissions subject to this process are \n     defined in Section VIII, Definitions and Explanations of \n     Terms. The Agency will continue to improve the Pre-Submission \n     process as resources permit, but not to the detriment of \n     meeting the quantitative review timelines and statutory \n     obligations. FDA will issue a draft guidance document and \n     final guidance document on Pre-Submissions.\n       Upon receipt of a Pre-Submission that requests feedback \n     through a meeting or teleconference, FDA intends to schedule \n     the meeting or teleconference to occur within a timely \n     manner. In the Pre-Submission, the applicant will provide at \n     least three suggested dates and times when the applicant is \n     available to meet.\n       It is FDA's intent that within 14 calendar days of receipt \n     of a request for a meeting or teleconference, FDA will \n     determine if the request meets the definition of a Pre-\n     Submission, and will inform the applicant if it does not meet \n     the definition. FDA will also determine if the request \n     necessitates more than one meeting or teleconference. A \n     determination that the request does not meet the definition \n     of a Pre-Submission will require the concurrence of the \n     branch chief and the reason for this determination will be \n     provided to the applicant. If the request meets the \n     definition of a Pre-Submission, FDA and the applicant will \n     set a mutually agreeable time and date for the meeting.\n       At least 3 business days prior to the meeting, FDA will \n     provide initial feedback to the applicant by email, which \n     will include: written responses to the applicant's questions; \n     FDA's suggestions for additional topics for the meeting or \n     teleconference, if applicable; or, a combination of both. If \n     all of the applicant's questions are addressed through \n     written responses, to the applicant's satisfaction, FDA and \n     the applicant can agree that a meeting or teleconference is \n     no longer necessary and the written responses provided by \n     email will be considered the final written feedback to the \n     Pre-Submission.\n       Meetings and teleconferences related to Pre-Submission will \n     generally be limited to 1 hour. A longer meeting or \n     teleconference time can be scheduled by mutual agreement by \n     the applicant and FDA.\n       Applicants will be responsible for developing draft minutes \n     for a Pre-Submission meeting or teleconference, and provide \n     the draft minutes via email to FDA within 15 calendar days of \n     the meeting. The minutes will summarize the meeting \n     discussions and include agreements and any action items. FDA \n     will provide any edits to the draft minutes to the applicant \n     via email within a timely manner. These minutes will become \n     final 15 calendar days after the applicant receives FDA's \n     edits, unless the applicant indicates that there is a \n     disagreement with how a significant issue or action item has \n     been documented. In this case, within a timely manner, the \n     applicant and FDA will conduct a teleconference to discuss \n     that issue with FDA. At the conclusion of that \n     teleconference, within a timely manner FDA will finalize the \n     minutes either to reflect the resolution of the issue or note \n     that this issue remains a point of disagreement.\n       FDA intends that feedback the Agency provides in a Pre-\n     Submission will not change, provided that the information \n     submitted in a future investigational device exemption (IDE) \n     or marketing application is consistent with that provided in \n     the Pre-Submission and that the data in the future submission \n     do not raise any important new issues materially affecting \n     safety or effectiveness. Modifications to FDA's feedback will \n     be limited to situations in which FDA concludes that the \n     feedback does not adequately address important new issues \n     materially relevant to a determination of safety or \n     effectiveness. Such a determination will be supported by the \n     appropriate management concurrence consistent with applicable \n     guidance and SOPs.\n     B. Submission Acceptance Criteria\n       To facilitate a more efficient and timely review process, \n     FDA will implement revised submission acceptance criteria. \n     The Agency will publish guidance outlining electronic copy of \n     submissions (e-Copy) and objective criteria for revised \n     ``refuse to accept/refuse to file'' checklists. FDA will \n     publish draft and final guidance prior to implementation.\n     C. Interactive Review\n       The Agency will continue to incorporate an interactive \n     review process to provide for, and encourage, informal \n     communication between FDA and applicants to facilitate timely \n     completion of the review process based on accurate and \n     complete information. Interactive review entails \n     responsibilities for both FDA and applicants. As described in \n     the guidance document, Interactive Review for Medical Device \n     Submissions: 510(k)s, Original [Premarket Approvals] PMAs, \n     PMA Supplements, Original BLAs, and BLA Supplements, both FDA \n     and industry believe that an interactive review process for \n     these types of premarket medical device submissions should \n     help facilitate timely completion of the review based on \n     accurate and complete information. Interactive review is \n     intended to facilitate the efficient and timely review and \n     evaluation by FDA of premarket submissions. The interactive \n     review process contemplates increased informal interaction \n     between FDA and applicants, including the exchange of \n     scientific and regulatory information.\n     D. Guidance Document Development\n       FDA will apply user fee revenues to supplement the \n     improvement of the process of developing, reviewing, \n     tracking, issuing, and updating guidance documents. The \n     Agency will continue to develop guidance documents and \n     improve the Guidance Development process as resources permit, \n     but not to the detriment of meeting the quantitative review \n     timelines and statutory obligations.\n       FDA will update its website in a timely manner to reflect \n     the following:\n       1. The Agency's review of previously published device \n     guidance documents, including the deletion of guidance \n     documents that no longer represent the Agency's \n     interpretation of, or policy on, a regulatory issue, and \n     notation of guidance documents that are under review by the \n     Agency;\n       2. A list of prioritized device guidance documents (an ``A-\n     list'') that the Agency intends to publish within 12 months \n     of the date this list is published each fiscal year; and\n       3. A list of device guidance documents (a ``B-list'') that \n     the Agency intends to publish, as the Agency's guidance-\n     development resources permit each fiscal year.\n       The Agency will establish a process allowing stakeholders \n     an opportunity to:\n       1. Provide meaningful comments and/or propose draft \n     language for proposed guidance topics in the ``A'' and ``B'' \n     lists.\n\n[[Page S8278]]\n\n       2. Provide suggestions for new or different guidance \n     documents; and\n       3. Comment on the relative priority of topics for guidance.\n     E. Third Party Review\n       The Agency will continue to support the third party review \n     program and agrees to work with interested parties to \n     strengthen and improve the current program while also \n     establishing new procedures to improve transparency. The \n     Agency will continue to improve the third party review \n     program as resources permit, but not to the detriment of \n     meeting the quantitative review timelines and statutory \n     obligations.\n     F. Patient Safety and Risk Tolerance\n       FDA will fully implement final guidance on the factors to \n     consider when making benefit-risk determinations in medical \n     device premarket review. This guidance will focus on factors \n     to consider in the premarket review process, including \n     patient tolerance for risk, magnitude of the benefit, and the \n     availability of other treatments or diagnostic tests.\n       Over the period of MDUFA III, FDA will meet with patient \n     groups to better understand and characterize the patient \n     perspective on disease severity or unmet medical need.\n       In addition, FDA will increase its utilization of FDA's \n     Patient Representatives as Special Government Employee \n     consultants to CDRH to provide patients' views early in the \n     medical product development process and ensure those \n     perspectives are considered in regulatory discussions. \n     Applicable procedures governing conflicts of interest and \n     confidentiality of proprietary information will be utilized \n     for these consultations.\n     G. Low Risk Medical Device Exemptions\n       By the end of FY 2013, FDA will propose additional low risk \n     medical devices to exempt from premarket notification. Within \n     two years of such proposal, FDA intends to issue a final rule \n     exempting additional low risk medical devices from premarket \n     notification.\n     H. Emerging Diagnostics\n       FDA will work with industry to develop a transitional In \n     Vitro Diagnostics (IVD) approach for the regulation of \n     emerging diagnostics.\n\n\nII. Review Performance Goals--Fiscal Years 2013 Through 2017 As Applied \n                           to Receipt Cohorts\n\n       The overall objective of the review performance goals \n     stated herein is to assure more timely access to safe and \n     effective medical devices.\n     A. Original Premarket Approval (PMA), Panel-Track \n         Supplements, and Premarket Report Applications\n       The performance goals in this section apply to all Original \n     Premarket Approval, Panel-Track Supplements, and Premarket \n     Report Applications, including those that are accepted for \n     priority review (previously referred to as expedited).\n       FDA will communicate with the applicant regarding whether \n     the application has been accepted for filing review within 15 \n     calendar days of receipt of the application. This \n     communication consists of a fax, email, or other written \n     communication that (a) identifies the reviewer assigned to \n     the submission, and (b) acknowledges acceptance/rejection of \n     the submission based upon the review of the submission \n     against objective acceptance criteria outlined in a published \n     guidance document.\n       If the application is not accepted for filing review, FDA \n     will notify the applicant of those items necessary for the \n     application to be considered accepted for filing review.\n       For those applications that are accepted for filing review, \n     FDA will communicate the filing status within 45 calendar \n     days of receipt of the application.\n       For those applications that are not filed, FDA will \n     communicate to the applicant the specific reasons for \n     rejection and the information necessary for filing.\n       If the application is filed, FDA will communicate with the \n     applicant through a Substantive Interaction within 90 \n     calendar days of the filing date of the application for: 65% \n     of submissions received in FY 2013; 75% of submissions \n     received in FY 2014; 85% of submissions received in FY 2015; \n     and 95% of submissions received in FY 2016 through FY 2017.\n       When FDA issues a major deficiency letter, that letter will \n     be based upon a complete review of the application and will \n     include all deficiencies. Any subsequent deficiencies will be \n     limited to issues raised by the information provided by the \n     applicant in its response, unless FDA concludes that the \n     initial deficiencies identified do not adequately address \n     important new issues materially relevant to a determination \n     of safety or effectiveness. Such a determination will be \n     supported by the appropriate management concurrence \n     consistent with applicable guidance and SOPs. Issues related \n     to post-approval studies, if applicable, and revisions to \n     draft labeling will typically be addressed through \n     interactive review once major deficiencies have been \n     adequately addressed.\n       For submissions that do not require Advisory Committee \n     input, FDA will issue a MDUFA decision within 180 FDA Days \n     for: 70% of submissions received in FY 2013; 80% of \n     submissions received in FY 2014 and FY 2015; and 90% of \n     submissions received in FY 2016 and FY 2017.\n       For submissions that require Advisory Committee input, FDA \n     will issue a MDUFA decision within 320 FDA Days for: 50% of \n     submissions received in FY 2013; 70% of submissions received \n     in FY 2014; 80% of submissions received in FY 2015 and FY \n     2016; and 90% of submissions received in FY 2017.\n       If in any one fiscal year, the number of submissions that \n     require Advisory Committee input is less than 10, then it is \n     acceptable to combine such submissions with the submissions \n     for the following year(s) in order to form a cohort of 10 or \n     more submissions, upon which the combined years' submissions \n     will be subject to the performance goal for the fiscal year \n     in question. If the number of submissions that require \n     Advisory Committee input is less than 10 for FY 2017, it is \n     acceptable to combine such submissions with the submissions \n     in the prior year in order to form a cohort of 10 or more \n     submissions; in such cases, FDA will be held to the FY 2017 \n     performance goal for the combined years' submissions.\n       To facilitate an efficient review prior to the Substantive \n     Interaction, and to incentivize submission of a complete \n     application, submission of an unsolicited major amendment \n     prior to the Substantive Interaction extends the FDA Day \n     review clock by the number of FDA Days that have elapsed. \n     Submission of an unsolicited major amendment after the \n     Substantive Interaction extends the FDA Day goal by the \n     number of FDA Days equal to 75% of the difference between the \n     filing date and the date of receipt of the amendment.\n       For all PMA submissions that do not reach a MDUFA decision \n     by 20 days after the applicable FDA Day goal, FDA will \n     provide written feedback to the applicant to be discussed in \n     a meeting or teleconference, including all outstanding issues \n     with the application preventing FDA from reaching a decision. \n     The information provided will reflect appropriate management \n     input and approval, and will include action items for FDA \n     and/or the applicant, as appropriate, with an estimated date \n     of completion for each party to complete their respective \n     tasks. Issues should be resolved through interactive review. \n     If all of the outstanding issues are adequately presented \n     through written correspondence, FDA and the applicant can \n     agree that a meeting or teleconference is not necessary.\n       In addition, information about submissions that miss the \n     FDA Day goal will be provided as part of FDA's Performance \n     Reports, as described in Section VI.\n     B. 180-Day PMA Supplements\n       FDA will communicate with the applicant through a \n     Substantive Interaction within 90 calendar days of receipt of \n     the submission for: 65% of submissions received in FY 2013; \n     75% of submissions received in FY 2014; 85% of submissions \n     received in FY 2015; and 95% of submissions received in FY \n     2016 through FY 2017.\n       FDA will issue a MDUFA decision within 180 FDA Days for: \n     85% of submissions received in FY 2013; 90% of submissions \n     received in FY 2014 and FY 2015; and 95% of submissions \n     received in FY 2016 through FY 2017.\n     C. Real-Time PMA Supplements\n       FDA will issue a MDUFA decision within 90 FDA Days for: 90% \n     of submissions received in FY 2013 and FY 2014; and 95% of \n     submissions received in FY 2015 through FY 2017.\n     D. 510(k) Submissions\n       FDA will communicate with the applicant regarding whether \n     the submission has been accepted for review within 15 \n     calendar days of receipt of the submission. For those \n     submissions that are not accepted for review, FDA will notify \n     the applicant of those items necessary for the submission to \n     be considered accepted.\n       This communication includes a fax, email, or other written \n     communication that a) identifies the reviewer assigned to the \n     submission, and b) acknowledges acceptance/rejection of the \n     submission based upon the review of the submission against \n     objective acceptance criteria outlined in a published \n     guidance document. This communication represents a \n     preliminary review of the submission and is not indicative of \n     deficiencies that may be identified later in the review \n     cycle.\n       FDA will communicate with the applicant through a \n     Substantive Interaction within 60 calendar days of receipt of \n     the submission for: 65% of submissions received in FY 2013; \n     75% of submissions received in FY 2014; 85% of submissions \n     received in FY 2015; and 95% of submissions received in FY \n     2016 through FY 2017.\n       Deficiencies identified in a Substantive Interaction, such \n     as a telephone/email hold or Additional Information Letter, \n     will be based upon a complete review of the submission and \n     will include all deficiencies. Any subsequent deficiencies \n     will be limited to issues raised by the information provided \n     by the applicant in its response, unless FDA concludes that \n     the initial deficiencies identified do not adequately address \n     important new issues materially relevant to a determination \n     of substantial equivalence. Such a determination will be \n     supported by the appropriate management concurrence \n     consistent with applicable guidance and SOPs.\n       For submissions received in FY 2013, FDA will issue a MDUFA \n     decision for 91% of 510(k) submissions within 90 FDA Days.\n       For submissions received in FY 2014, FDA will issue a MDUFA \n     decision for 93% of 510(k) submissions within 90 FDA Days.\n       For submissions received in FY 2015 through FY 2017, FDA \n     will issue a MDUFA decision for 95% of 510(k) submissions \n     within 90 FDA Days.\n       For all 510(k) submissions that do not reach a MDUFA \n     decision within 100 FDA\n\n[[Page S8279]]\n\n     Days, FDA will provide written feedback to the applicant to \n     be discussed in a meeting or teleconference, including all \n     outstanding issues with the application preventing FDA from \n     reaching a decision. The information provided will reflect \n     appropriate management input and approval, and will include \n     action items for FDA and/or the applicant, as appropriate, \n     with an estimated date of completion for each party to \n     complete their respective tasks. Issues should be resolved \n     through interactive review. If all of the outstanding issues \n     are adequately presented through written correspondence, FDA \n     and the applicant can agree that a meeting or teleconference \n     is not necessary.\n       In addition, information about submissions that miss the \n     FDA Day goal will be provided as part of FDA's Performance \n     Reports, as described in Section VI.\n     E. Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) Waiver \n         by Application\n       FDA will engage in a Substantive Interaction with the \n     applicant within 90 days for 95% of the applications.\n       During the pre-submission process, if the applicant informs \n     FDA that it plans to submit a dual submission (510(k) and \n     CLIA Waiver application), FDA will issue a decision for 90% \n     of such applications within 210 FDA days.\n       For ``CLIA Waiver by application'' submissions FDA will \n     issue a MDUFA decision for 95% of the applications that do \n     not require Advisory Committee input within 180 FDA days.\n       For ``CLIA Waiver by application'' submissions FDA will \n     issue a MDUFA decision for 95% of the applications that \n     require Advisory Committee input within 330 FDA days.\n       To provide greater transparency, FDA will issue guidance \n     regarding review and management expectations throughout the \n     entire submission process.\n     F. Original Biologics Licensing Applications (BLAs)\n       FDA will review and act on standard original BLA \n     submissions within 10 months of receipt for 90% of \n     submissions.\n       FDA will review and act on priority original BLA \n     submissions within 6 months of receipt for 90% of \n     submissions.\n     G. BLA Efficacy Supplements\n       FDA will review and act on standard BLA efficacy supplement \n     submissions within 10 months of receipt for 90% of \n     submissions.\n       FDA will review and act on priority BLA efficacy supplement \n     submissions within 6 months of receipt for 90% of \n     submissions.\n     H. Original BLA and BLA Efficacy Supplement Resubmissions\n       FDA will review and act on Class 1 original BLA and BLA \n     efficacy supplement resubmissions within 2 months of receipt \n     for 90% of submissions.\n       FDA will review and act on Class 2 original BLA and BLA \n     efficacy supplement resubmissions within 6 months of receipt \n     for 90% of submissions.\n     I. BLA Manufacturing Supplements Requiring Prior Approval\n       FDA will review and act on BLA manufacturing supplements \n     requiring prior approval within 4 months of receipt for 90% \n     of submissions.\n\n\n                       III. Shared Outcome Goals\n\n       The program and initiatives outlined in this document are \n     predicated on significant interaction between the Agency and \n     applicants. FDA and representatives of the medical device \n     industry agree that the process improvements outlined in this \n     letter, when implemented by all parties as intended, should \n     reduce the average Total Time to Decision for PMA \n     applications and 510(k) submissions, provided that the total \n     funding of the device review program adheres to the \n     assumptions underlying this agreement. FDA and applicants \n     share the responsibility for achieving this objective of \n     reducing the average Total Time to Decision, while \n     maintaining standards for safety and effectiveness. Success \n     of this program will require the cooperation and dedicated \n     efforts of FDA and applicants to reduce their respective \n     portions of the total time to decision.\n       FDA will be reporting total time performance quarterly as \n     described in Section VI. FDA and industry will participate in \n     the independent assessment of progress toward this outcome, \n     as described in Section V above. As appropriate, key findings \n     and recommendations from this assessment will be implemented \n     by FDA.\n     A. PMA\n       Beginning in Fiscal Year 2013, FDA will report on an annual \n     basis the average Total Time to Decision as defined in \n     Section VIII.G for the three most recent closed receipt \n     cohorts. For submissions received beginning in Fiscal Year \n     2013, the average Total Time to Decision goal for FDA and \n     industry is 395 calendar days. For submissions received \n     beginning in Fiscal Year 2015, the average Total Time to \n     Decision goal for FDA and industry is 390 calendar days. For \n     submissions received beginning in Fiscal Year 2017, the \n     average Total Time to Decision goal for FDA and industry is \n     385 calendar days.\n     B. 510(k)\n       Beginning in Fiscal Year 2013, FDA will report on an annual \n     basis the average Total Time to Decision as defined in \n     Section VIII.G for the most recent closed receipt cohort. For \n     submissions received beginning in Fiscal Year 2013, the \n     average Total Time to Decision goal for FDA and industry is \n     135 calendar days. For submissions received beginning in FY \n     2015, the average Total Time to Decision goal for FDA and \n     industry is 130 calendar days. For submissions received \n     beginning in FY 2017, the average Total Time to Decision goal \n     for FDA and industry is 124 calendar days.\n\n\n                           IV. Infrastructure\n\n     A. Scientific and Regulatory Review Capacity\n       The Agency will apply user fee revenues to reduce the ratio \n     of review staff to front line supervisors in the Pre-Market \n     review program and to enhance and supplement scientific \n     review capacity by hiring device application reviewers and \n     leveraging external experts needed to assist with the review \n     of device applications.\n       The Agency will seek to obtain streamlined hiring authority \n     for all MDUFA-related positions prior to and during the MDUFA \n     III period.\n       During MDUFA III, FDA will also work with industry to \n     benchmark best practices for retaining employees (both \n     financial and non-financial).\n     B. Training\n       Prior to the commencement of MDUFA III, CDRH will implement \n     its Reviewer Certification Program. FDA commits to holding a \n     minimum of two medical device Vendor Days each year.\n       CDRH will apply user fee revenues to supplement the \n     following training programs:\n       1) Management training for Branch Chiefs and Division \n     Directors.\n       2) MDUFA III Training Program for all staff.\n       3) Reviewer Certification Program for new CDRH reviewers. \n     FDA will publish the curriculum of this program and other \n     course offerings. FDA will consider comments from \n     stakeholders when making updates to courses and determining \n     course offerings.\n       4) Specialized training to provide continuous learning for \n     all staff.\n     C. Tracking System\n       FDA will continue efforts to improve its IT systems with a \n     future expectation of facilitating availability of real-time \n     status information for submissions.\n\n\n         V. Independent Assessment of Review Process Management\n\n       FDA and the device industry will participate in a \n     comprehensive assessment of the process for the review of \n     device applications. The assessment will include consultation \n     with both FDA and industry. The assessment shall be conducted \n     in two phases under contract to FDA by a private, independent \n     consulting firm capable of performing the technical analysis, \n     management assessment, and program evaluation tasks required \n     to address the assessment scope described below. For Phase 1, \n     FDA will award the contract no later than the end of the \n     second quarter of FY13. Findings on high-priority \n     recommendations (i.e., those likely to have a significant \n     impact on review times) will be published within six months \n     of award; final comprehensive findings and recommendations \n     will be published within 1 year of contract award. FDA will \n     publish an implementation plan within 6 months of receipt of \n     each set of recommendations. For Phase 2 of the independent \n     assessment, the contractor will evaluate the implementation \n     of recommendations and publish a written assessment no later \n     than February 1, 2016.\n       The assessment will address FDA's premarket review process \n     using an assessment framework that draws from appropriate \n     quality system standards, including, but not limited to, \n     management responsibility, document controls and records \n     management, and corrective and preventive action.\n       The scope of the assessment will include, but not be \n     limited to, the following areas:\n       1. Identification of process improvements and best \n     practices for conducting predictable, efficient, and \n     consistent premarket reviews that meet regulatory review \n     standards.\n       2. Analysis of elements of the review process (including \n     the Pre-Submission process, IDE, 510(k) and PMA reviews) that \n     consume or save time to facilitate a more efficient process. \n     This includes analysis of root causes for inefficiencies that \n     may affect review performance and total time to decision. \n     This will also include recommended actions to correct any \n     failures to meet MDUFA goals. Analysis of the review process \n     will include the impact of combination products, companion \n     diagnostics products, and laboratory developed tests on the \n     review process.\n       3. Assessment of FDA methods and controls for collecting \n     and reporting information on premarket review process \n     resource use and performance.\n       4. Assessment of effectiveness of FDA's Reviewer Training \n     Program implementation.\n       5. Recommendations for ongoing periodic assessments and any \n     additional, more detailed or focused assessments.\n       FDA will incorporate findings and recommendations, as \n     appropriate, into its management of the premarket review \n     program. FDA will analyze the recommendations for improvement \n     opportunities identified in the assessment, develop and \n     implement a corrective action plan, and assure its \n     effectiveness. FDA also will incorporate the results of the \n     assessment into a Good Review Management Practices (GRMP) \n     guidance document. FDA's implementation of the GRMP guidance \n     will include initial and ongoing training of FDA staff, and \n     periodic audits of compliance with the guidance.\n\n\n                        VI. Performance Reports\n\n       The Agency will report its progress toward meeting the \n     goals described in this letter, as\n\n[[Page S8280]]\n\n     follows. If, throughout the course of MDUFA III, the Agency \n     and Industry agree that a different format or different \n     metrics would be more useful, the reporting will be modified \n     accordingly as per the agreement of both FDA and Industry.\n       1.

Any \n     submission subject to a fee waiver or reduction under this \n     discretionary authority shall not be subject to the goals \n     specified in this letter and shall be reviewed by the Agency \n     as resources permit. This discretionary authority will expire \n     at the end of MDUFA III.\n\n\n              VIII. Definitions and Explanations of Terms\n\n     A. Applicant\n       Applicant means a person who makes any of the following \n     submissions to FDA: an application for premarket approval \n     under section 515; a premarket notification under section \n     510(k); an application for investigational device exemption \n     under section 520(g); a Pre-Submission; a CLIA waiver \n     application.\n     B. Electronic Copy (e-Copy)\n       An electronic copy is an exact duplicate of a paper \n     submission, created and submitted on a CD, DVD, or in another \n     electronic media format that FDA has agreed to accept, \n     accompanied by a copy of the signed cover letter and the \n     complete original paper submission. An electronic copy is not \n     considered to be an electronic submission.\n     C. FDA Days\n       FDA Days are those calendar days when a submission is \n     considered to be under review at the Agency for submissions \n     that have been accepted (510(k)) or filed (PMA). FDA Days \n     begin on the date of receipt of the submission or of the \n     amendment to the submission that enables the submission to be \n     accepted (510(k)) or filed (PMA).\n     D. MDUFA Decisions\n       Original PMAs: Decisions for Original PMAs are Approval, \n     Approvable, Approvable Pending GMP Inspection, Not \n     Approvable, Withdrawal, and Denial.\n       180-Day PMA Supplements: Decisions for 180-Day PMA \n     Supplements include Approval, Approvable, and Not Approvable.\n       Real-Time PMA Supplements: Decisions for Real-Time PMA \n     supplements include Approval, Approvable, and not Approvable.\n       510(k)s: Decisions for 510(k)s are substantially equivalent \n     (SE) or not substantially equivalent (NSE).\n       Submissions placed on Application Integrity Program Hold \n     will be removed from the MDUFA cohort.\n     E. Pre-Submission\n       A Pre-Submission includes a formal written request from an \n     applicant for feedback from FDA which is provided in the form \n     of a formal written response or, if the manufacturer chooses, \n     a meeting or teleconference in which the feedback is \n     documented in meeting minutes. A Pre-Submission meeting is a \n     meeting or teleconference in which FDA provides its \n     substantive feedback on the Pre-Submission.\n       A Pre-Submission provides the opportunity for an applicant \n     to obtain FDA feedback prior to intended submission of an \n     investigational device exemption or marketing application. \n     The request must include specific questions regarding review \n     issues relevant to a planned IDE or marketing application \n     (e.g., questions regarding pre-clinical and clinical testing \n     protocols or data requirements). A Pre-Submission is \n     appropriate when FDA's feedback on specific questions is \n     necessary to guide product development and/or application \n     preparation.\n       The following forms of FDA feedback to applicants are not \n     considered Pre-Submissions. However, if the requested \n     feedback meets the criteria for a Pre-Submission, outlined \n     above, FDA will contact the sponsor, and with the concurrence \n     of the sponsor, may convert the request to a Pre-Submission.\n       General information requests initiated through the Division \n     of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance \n     (DSMICA)\n       General questions regarding FDA policy or procedures\n       Meetings or teleconferences that are intended to be \n     informational only, including, but not limited to, those \n     intended to educate the review team on new device(s) with \n     significant differences in technology from currently \n     available devices, or to update FDA about ongoing or future \n     product development, without a request for FDA feedback on \n     specific questions related to a planned submission\n       Requests for clarification on technical guidance documents, \n     especially where contact is recommended by FDA in the \n     guidance document. However, the following requests will \n     generally need to be submitted as a Pre-Submission in order \n     to ensure appropriate input from multiple reviewers and \n     management: recommendations for device types not specifically \n     addressed in the guidance document; recommendations for \n     nonclinical or clinical studies not addressed in the guidance \n     document; requests to use an alternative means to address \n     recommendations specified in a guidance document.\n       Phone calls or email messages to reviewers that can be \n     readily answered based on a reviewer's experience and \n     knowledge and do\n\n[[Page S8281]]\n\n     not require the involvement of a broader number of FDA staff \n     beyond the routine involvement of the reviewer's supervisor \n     and more experienced mentors.\n       Interactions requested by either the applicant or FDA \n     during the review of a marketing application (i.e., following \n     submission of a marketing application, but prior to reaching \n     an FDA Decision).\n     F. Substantive Interaction\n       Substantive Interaction is an email, letter, \n     teleconference, video conference, fax, or other form of \n     communication such as a request for Additional Information or \n     Major Deficiency letters by FDA notifying the applicant of \n     substantive deficiencies identified in initial submission \n     review, or a communication stating that FDA has not \n     identified any deficiencies in the initial submission review \n     and any further minor deficiencies will be communicated \n     through interactive review. An approval or clearance letter \n     issued prior to the Substantive Interaction goal date will \n     qualify as a Substantive Interaction.\n       If substantive issues warranting issuance of an Additional \n     Information or Major Deficiency letter are not identified, \n     interactive review should be used to resolve any minor issues \n     and facilitate an FDA decision. In addition, interactive \n     review will be used, where, in FDA's estimation, it leads to \n     a more efficient review process during the initial review \n     cycle (i.e., prior to a Substantive Interaction) to resolve \n     minor issues such as revisions to administrative items (e.g., \n     510(k) Summary/Statement, Indications for Use statement, \n     environmental impact assessment, financial disclosure \n     statements); a more detailed device description; omitted \n     engineering drawings; revisions to labeling; or clarification \n     regarding nonclinical or clinical study methods or data.\n       Minor issues may still be included in an Additional \n     Information or Major Deficiency letter where related to the \n     resolution of the substantive issues (e.g., modification of \n     the proposed Indications for Use may lead to revisions in \n     labeling and administrative items), or if they were still \n     unresolved following interactive review attempts. Both \n     interactive review and Substantive Interactions will occur on \n     the review clock except upon the issuance of an Additional \n     Information or Major Deficiency Letter which stops the review \n     clock.\n     G. Total Time to Decision\n       Total Time to Decision is the number of calendar days from \n     the date of receipt of an accepted or filed submission to a \n     MDUFA decision.\n       The average Total Time to Decision for 510(k) submissions \n     is calculated as the trimmed mean of Total Times to Decision \n     for 510(k) submissions within a closed cohort, excluding the \n     highest 2% and the lowest 2% of values. A cohort is closed \n     when 99% of the accepted submissions have reached a decision.\n       The average Total Time to Decision for PMA applications is \n     calculated as the three-year rolling average of the annual \n     Total Times to Decision for applications (for example, for \n     FY2015, the average Total Time to Decision for PMA \n     applications would be the average of FY2013 through FY2015) \n     within a closed cohort, excluding the highest 5% and the \n     lowest 5% of values. A cohort is closed when 95% of the \n     applications have reached a decision.\n     H. BLA-related Definitions\n       Review and act on--the issuance of a complete action letter \n     after the complete review of a filed complete application. \n     The action letter, if it is not an approval, will set forth \n     in detail the specific deficiencies and, where appropriate, \n     the actions necessary to place the application in condition \n     for approval.\n       Class 1 resubmitted applications--applications resubmitted \n     after a complete response letter that includes the following \n     items only (or combinations of these items):\n       (a) Final printed labeling\n       (b) Draft labeling\n       (c) Safety updates submitted in the same format, including \n     tabulations, as the original safety submission with new data \n     and changes highlighted (except when large amounts of new \n     information including important new adverse experiences not \n     previously reported with the product are presented in the \n     resubmission)\n       (d) Stability updates to support provisional or final \n     dating periods\n       (e) Commitments to perform Phase 4 studies, including \n     proposals for such studies\n       (f) Assay validation data\n       (g) Final release testing on the last 1-2 lots used to \n     support approval\n       (h) A minor reanalysis of data previously submitted to the \n     application (determined by the Agency as fitting the Class 1 \n     category)\n       (i) Other minor clarifying information (determined by the \n     Agency as fitting the Class 1 category)\n       (j) Other specific items may be added later as the Agency \n     gains experience with the scheme and will be communicated via \n     guidance documents to industry\n       Class 2 resubmitted applications--resubmissions that \n     include any other items, including any item that would \n     require presentation to an advisory committee\n\nPDUFA REAUTHORIZATION PERFORMANCE GOALS AND PROCEDURES FOR FISCAL YEARS \n                           2013 THROUGH 2017\n\n       The performance goals and procedures of the FDA Center for \n     Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for \n     Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), as agreed to under \n     the fifth authorization of the prescription drug user fee \n     program, are summarized below.\n       Unless otherwise stated, goals apply to cohorts of each \n     fiscal year (FY).\n\n\n                      I.

NEW MOLECULAR ENTITY NDA AND ORIGINAL BLA PERFORMANCE GOALS\n\n     A. Program for Enhanced Review Transparency and Communication \n         for NME NDAs and Original BLAs\n       To promote greater transparency and improve communication \n     between the FDA review team and the applicant, FDA will \n     establish a review model (hereafter referred to as ``the \n     Program'') that will apply to all New Molecular Entity New \n     Drug Applications (NME NDAs) and original Biologics License \n     Applications (BLAs), including applications that are \n     resubmitted following a Refuse-to-File action, received from \n     October 1, 2012, through September 30, 2017.\\2\\ The goal of \n     the Program is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of \n     the first cycle review process and decrease the number of \n     review cycles necessary for approval, ensuring that patients \n     have timely access to safe, effective, and high quality new \n     drugs and biologics. The Program shall be evaluated by an \n     independent contractor with expertise in assessing the \n     quality and efficiency of biopharmaceutical development and \n     regulatory review programs. The parameters of the Program are \n     as follows:\n       Note: \\2\\ The decision as to whether the application is \n     included or excluded from the Program is distinct from FDA's \n     determination as to whether the drug product contains a ``new \n     chemical entity,'' as defined under 21 CFR 314.108(a). \n     Determinations regarding\n\n[[Page S8282]]\n\n     new chemical entity exclusivity are made at the time of \n     approval of an application.\n       1. Pre-submission meeting: The applicant is strongly \n     encouraged to discuss the planned content of the application \n     with the appropriate FDA review division at a pre-NDA/BLA \n     meeting\n       a) The pre-NDA/BLA meeting should be held sufficiently in \n     advance of the planned submission of the application to allow \n     for meaningful response to FDA feedback and should generally \n     occur not less than 2 months prior to the planned submission \n     of the application.\n       b) At the pre-NDA/BLA meeting, the FDA and the applicant \n     will agree on the content of a complete application for the \n     proposed indication(s), including preliminary discussions on \n     the need for risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS) \n     or other risk management actions. This meeting will be \n     attended by the FDA review team including appropriate senior \n     FDA staff. The agreement and discussions will be summarized \n     at the conclusion of the meeting and reflected in the FDA \n     meeting minutes.\n       c) At the meeting, the FDA and the applicant may also reach \n     agreement on submission of a limited number of application \n     components not later than 30 calendar days after the \n     submission of the original application. These submissions \n     must be of a type that would not be expected to materially \n     impact the ability of the review team to begin its review. \n     Any such agreement that is reached on delayed submission of \n     application components will be summarized at the conclusion \n     of the meeting and reflected in the FDA meeting minutes.\n       (1) Examples of application components that may be \n     appropriate for delayed submission include updated stability \n     data (e.g., 15-month data to update 12-month data submitted \n     with the original submission) or the final audited report of \n     a preclinical study (e.g., carcinogenicity) where the final \n     draft report is submitted with the original application.\n       d) Major components of the application (e.g., the complete \n     study report of a Phase 3 clinical trial or the full study \n     report of required long-term safety data) are expected to be \n     submitted with the original application and are not subject \n     to agreement for late submission.\n       2. Original application submission: Applications are \n     expected to be complete, as agreed between the FDA review \n     team and the applicant at the pre-NDA/BLA meeting, at the \n     time of original submission of the application. If the \n     applicant does not have a pre-NDA/BLA meeting with FDA, and \n     no agreement exists between FDA and the applicant on the \n     contents of a complete application or delayed submission of \n     certain components of the application, the applicant's \n     submission is expected to be complete at the time of original \n     submission.\n       a) All applications are expected to include a comprehensive \n     and readily located list of all clinical sites and \n     manufacturing facilities included or referenced in the \n     application.\n       b) Any components of the application that FDA agreed at the \n     pre-submission meeting could be submitted after the original \n     application are expected to be received not later than 30 \n     calendar days after receipt of the original application.\n       c) Incomplete applications, including applications with \n     components that are not received within 30 calendar days \n     after receipt of the original submission, will be subject to \n     a Refuse-to-File decision.\n       (1) Applications that are subject to a Refuse-to-File \n     action, and are subsequently filed over protest, will not be \n     subject to the procedures of the Program, but will instead be \n     subject to the 6 and 10 month review performance goals for \n     priority and standard applications, respectively, as \n     described in Section I.\n       d) Since applications are expected to be complete at the \n     time of submission, unsolicited amendments are expected to be \n     rare and not to contain major new information or analyses.\n       (1) Review of unsolicited amendments, including those \n     submitted in response to an FDA communication of \n     deficiencies, will be handled in accordance with the guidance \n     ``Good Review Management Principles and Practices (GRMPs) for \n     PDUFA Products.'' This guidance includes the underlying \n     principle that FDA will consider the most efficient path \n     toward completion of a comprehensive review that addresses \n     application deficiencies and leads toward a first cycle \n     approval when possible.\n       3. Day 74 Letter: FDA will follow existing procedures and \n     performance goals (see Section III) regarding identification \n     and communication of filing review issues in the ``Day 74 \n     letter.'' For applications subject to the Program, the \n     timeline for this communication will be within 74 calendar \n     days from the date of FDA receipt of the original submission. \n     The planned review timeline included in the Day 74 letter for \n     applications in the Program will include the planned date for \n     the internal mid-cycle review meeting. The letter will also \n     include preliminary plans on whether to hold an Advisory \n     Committee (AC) meeting to discuss the application.\n       4. Review performance goals: For NME NDA and original BLA \n     submissions that are filed by FDA under the Program, the \n     PDUFA review clock will begin at the conclusion of the 60 \n     calendar day filing review period that begins on the date of \n     FDA receipt of the original submission. The review \n     performance goals for these applications are as follows:\n       a) Review and act on 90 percent of standard NME NDA and \n     original BLA submissions within 10 months of the 60 day \n     filing date.\n       b) Review and act on 90 percent of priority NME NDA and \n     original BLA submissions within 6 months of the 60 day filing \n     date.\n       5. Mid-Cycle communication: The FDA Regulatory Project \n     Manager (RPM), and other appropriate members of the FDA \n     review team (e.g., Cross Discipline Team Leader (CDTL)), will \n     call the applicant, generally within 2 weeks following the \n     Agency's internal mid-cycle review meeting, to provide the \n     applicant with an update on the status of the review of their \n     application. Scheduling of the internal mid-cycle review \n     meeting will be handled in accordance with the GRMP guidance. \n     The RPM will coordinate the specific date and time of the \n     telephone call with the applicant\n       a) The update should include any significant issues \n     identified by the review team to date, any information \n     requests, information regarding major safety concerns and \n     preliminary review team thinking regarding risk management, \n     proposed date(s) for the late-cycle meeting, updates \n     regarding plans for the AC meeting (if an AC meeting is \n     anticipated), and other projected milestones dates for the \n     remainder of the review cycle.\n       6. Discipline Review (DR) Letters: The FDA review team will \n     follow existing guidance on issuance of DR Letters.\n       a) Since the application is expected to be complete at time \n     of submission, FDA intends to complete primary and secondary \n     discipline reviews of the application and issue DR letters in \n     advance of the planned late-cycle meeting. In cases where a \n     DR letter is not issued in advance of the planned late-cycle \n     meeting, substantive issues identified to date from that \n     discipline will be communicated in the brief memorandum \n     described in 7(b)(1).\n       7. Late-Cycle meeting: For all applications included in the \n     review Program, a meeting will be held between the FDA review \n     team and the applicant to discuss the status of the review of \n     the application late in the review cycle.\n       a) FDA representatives at the late-cycle meeting are \n     expected to include the signatory authority for the \n     application, review team members from appropriate \n     disciplines, and appropriate team leaders and/or supervisors \n     from disciplines for which substantive issues have been \n     identified in the review to date.\n       b) For applications that will be discussed at an Advisory \n     Committee (AC) meeting, the late-cycle meeting will occur not \n     less than 12 calendar days before the date of the AC meeting. \n     FDA intends to convene AC meetings no later than 3 months \n     (standard review) or no later than 2 months (priority review) \n     prior to the PDUFA goal date.\n       (1) The Agency briefing package for the late-cycle meeting \n     will consist of the Agency's background package for the AC \n     meeting, which will be sent to the applicant not less than 20 \n     calendar days before the AC meeting, any discipline review \n     letters issued to date, current assessment of the need for \n     REMS or other risk management actions, and a brief memorandum \n     from the review team outlining substantive application issues \n     including potential questions and/or points for discussion \n     for the AC meeting. FDA intends to provide final questions \n     for the AC to the sponsor and the AC 2 calendar days in \n     advance of the AC meeting.\n       c) For applications that will not be discussed at an AC \n     meeting, the late-cycle meeting will generally occur not \n     later than 3 months (standard review) or two months (priority \n     review) prior to the PDUFA goal date.\n       (1) The Agency background package for the late-cycle \n     meeting, which will be sent to the applicant not less than 12 \n     calendar days before the meeting, will consist of any \n     discipline review letters issued to date, current assessment \n     of the need for REMS or other risk management actions, and a \n     brief memorandum from the review team outlining substantive \n     application issues.\n       d) Potential topics for discussion at the late-cycle \n     meeting include major deficiencies identified to date; issues \n     to be discussed at the AC meeting (if planned); current \n     assessment of the need for REMS or other risk management \n     actions; information requests from the review team to the \n     applicant; and additional data or analyses the applicant may \n     wish to submit.\n       (1) With regard to submission of additional data or \n     analyses, the FDA review team and the applicant will discuss \n     whether such data will be reviewed by the Agency in the \n     current review cycle and, if so, whether the submission will \n     be considered a major amendment and trigger an extension of \n     the PDUFA goal date.\n       8. Inspections: FDA's goal is to complete all GCP, GLP, and \n     GMP inspections for applications in the Program within 6 \n     months of the date of original receipt for priority \n     applications and within 10 months of the date of original \n     receipt for standard applications. This will allow 2 months \n     at the end of the review cycle to attempt to address any \n     deficiencies identified by the inspections.\n       9. Quality System: As part of a quality system approach to \n     managing review in the Program, FDA will implement a tracking \n     system that will document review team performance of the key \n     milestones for each of the applications reviewed under the \n     Program.\n       a) These milestones include: conduct of pre-NDA/BLA meeting \n     and agreement on content of complete application; submission\n\n[[Page S8283]]\n\n     of any components of the application within 30 calendar days \n     of original application submission (as per pre-NDA/BLA \n     meeting agreement); issuance of the 74-day letter; completion \n     of mid-cycle communication with sponsor; completion of \n     primary and secondary reviews; DR letters issued; exchange of \n     late cycle meeting package; and conduct of late-cycle \n     meeting.\n       b) The process tracking information will support review \n     management, and inform the subsequent analysis to be \n     conducted by an independent third party (see below). The \n     performance information generated by the tracking system will \n     also be summarized and reported in the PDUFA annual \n     performance report.\n     B. Assessment of the Program\n       The Program described in Section IIA shall be evaluated by \n     an independent contractor with expertise in assessing the \n     quality and efficiency of biopharmaceutical development and \n     regulatory review programs. The statement of work for this \n     effort will be published for public comment prior to \n     beginning the assessment. The assessments will occur \n     continuously throughout the course of the Program. Metrics \n     for the assessments will include adherence by the applicant \n     and FDA to the current GRMP guidance, submission of a \n     complete application at the time of original submission, \n     number of unsolicited amendments submitted by the applicant, \n     timing and adequacy of Day 74 letters, mid-cycle \n     communications, provision of late-cycle meeting memorandum \n     outlining potential issues and questions for AC meeting \n     consideration and discipline review letters; specific \n     milestones of the Program as described in Section IIA; time \n     to approval; percentage of applications approved on the first \n     review cycle; and the percentage of application reviews \n     extended due to major amendments. Following issuance of an \n     FDA regulatory action at the completion of the first review \n     cycle, the independent contractor will assess the \n     completeness and thoroughness of the submitted application, \n     Day 74 letter, mid-cycle communication, discipline review \n     letters and late-cycle meeting. This assessment will include \n     interviews of the sponsor and members of the review team, as \n     appropriate.\n       1. Interim Assessment: An interim assessment of the Program \n     will be published by March 31, 2015, for public comment. By \n     June 30, 2015, FDA will hold a public meeting during which \n     public stakeholders may present their views on the success of \n     the Program to date including: improving the efficiency and \n     effectiveness of the first cycle review process; decreasing \n     the number of review cycles ultimately necessary for new \n     drugs and biologics that are approved; and helping to ensure \n     that patients have timely access to safe, effective, and high \n     quality new drugs and biologics. During the public meeting, \n     FDA will discuss the findings of the interim assessment, \n     including anonymized aggregated feedback from sponsors and \n     FDA review teams resulting from independent contractor \n     interviews. FDA will also address any issues identified to \n     date including actions proposed to improve likelihood of \n     success for the program.\n       2. Final Assessment: A final assessment of the Program will \n     be published by December 31, 2016, for public comment. FDA \n     will hold a public meeting by no later than March 30, 2017, \n     during which public stakeholders may present their views on \n     the success of the Program, including improving the \n     efficiency and effectiveness of the first cycle review \n     process and decreasing the number of review cycles ultimately \n     necessary for new drugs and biologics that are approved. \n     During the public meeting, FDA will discuss the findings of \n     the final assessment, including anonymized aggregated \n     feedback from sponsors and FDA review teams resulting from \n     independent contractor interviews and discuss any issues \n     identified and plans for addressing these issues.\n\n\n                  III. FIRST CYCLE REVIEW PERFORMANCE\n\n     A. Notification of Issues Identified during the Filing Review\n       1. Performance Goal: For original NDA/BLA applications and \n     efficacy supplements, FDA will report substantive review \n     issues identified during the initial filing review to the \n     applicant by letter, teleconference, facsimile, secure e-\n     mail, or other expedient means.\n       2. The timeline for such communication will be within 74 \n     calendar days from the date of FDA receipt of the original \n     submission.\n       3. If no substantive review issues were identified during \n     the filing review, FDA will so notify the applicant.\n       4. FDA's filing review represents a preliminary review of \n     the application and is not indicative of deficiencies that \n     may be identified later in the review cycle.\n       5. FDA will notify the applicant of substantive review \n     issues prior to the goal date for 90% of applications.\n     B. Notification of Planned Review Timelines\n       1. Performance Goal: For original NDA/BLA applications and \n     efficacy supplements, FDA will inform the applicant of the \n     planned timeline for review of the application. The \n     information conveyed will include a target date for \n     communication of feedback from the review division to the \n     applicant regarding proposed labeling, postmarketing \n     requirements, and postmarketing commitments the Agency will \n     be requesting.\n       2. The planned review timeline will be included with the \n     notification of issues identified during the filing review, \n     within 74 calendar days from the date of FDA receipt of the \n     original submission.\n       3. The planned review timelines will be consistent with the \n     Guidance for Review Staff and Industry: Good Review \n     Management Principles and Practices for PDUFA Products \n     (GRMPs), taking into consideration the specific circumstances \n     surrounding the individual application.\n       4. The planned review timeline will be based on the \n     application as submitted.\n       5. FDA will inform the applicant of the planned review \n     timeline for 90% of all applications and efficacy \n     supplements.\n       6. In the event FDA determines that significant \n     deficiencies in the application preclude discussion of \n     labeling, postmarketing requirements, or postmarketing \n     commitments by the target date identified in the planned \n     review timeline (e.g., failure to demonstrate efficacy, \n     significant safety concern(s), need for a new study(ies) or \n     extensive re-analyses of existing data before approval), FDA \n     will communicate this determination to the applicant in \n     accordance with GRMPs and no later than the target date. In \n     such cases the planned review timeline will be considered to \n     have been met. Communication of FDA's determination may occur \n     by letter, teleconference, facsimile, secure e-mail, or other \n     expedient means.\n       7. To help expedite the development of drug and biologic \n     products, communication of the deficiencies identified in the \n     application will generally occur through issuance of a DR \n     letter(s) in advance of the planned target date for \n     initiation of discussions regarding labeling, postmarketing \n     requirements, and postmarketing commitments the Agency may \n     request.\n       8. If the applicant submits a major amendment(s) (refer to \n     Section XVI.B for additional information on major amendments) \n     and the review division chooses to review such amendment(s) \n     during that review cycle, the planned review timeline \n     initially communicated will generally no longer be \n     applicable. Consistent with the underlying principles \n     articulated in the GRMP guidance, FDA's decision to extend \n     the review clock should, except in rare circumstances, be \n     limited to occasions where review of the new information \n     could address outstanding deficiencies in the application and \n     lead to approval in the current review cycle.\n       If the review division determines that the major amendment \n     will result in an extension of the PDUFA review clock, the \n     review division will communicate to the applicant at the time \n     of the clock extension a new planned review timeline, \n     including a new review timeline for communication of feedback \n     on proposed labeling, postmarketing requirements, and any \n     postmarketing commitments the Agency may request.\n       In the rare case where the review division determines that \n     the major amendment will not result in an extension of the \n     PDUFA review clock, the review division may choose to retain \n     the previously communicated planned review timeline or may \n     communicate a new planned review timeline to the applicant.\n       The division will notify the applicant promptly of its \n     decision regarding review of the major amendment(s) and \n     whether the planned review timeline is still applicable.\n       For original NME NDA and original BLA applications, the new \n     planned review timeline will include a new planned date for \n     the internal mid-cycle review meeting if appropriate \n     depending on when during the course of review the major \n     amendment(s) is accepted for review.\n     C. Report on Review Timeline Performance\n       1. FDA will report its performance in meeting the goals for \n     inclusion of a planned review timeline with the notification \n     of issues identified during the filing review in the annual \n     PDUFA performance report.\n       2. FDA will report its performance in meeting the planned \n     review timeline for communication of labeling comments, \n     postmarketing requirements, and postmarketing commitment \n     requests in the annual PDUFA performance report. The report \n     will include the percentage of applications for which the \n     planned target dates for communication of labeling comments, \n     postmarketing requirements, and postmarketing commitment \n     requests were met. The report will also note how often the \n     planned review timeline was met based on communication of \n     labeling comments, postmarketing requirements, and \n     postmarketing commitment requests by the target date, and how \n     often such communication did not occur due to FDA's \n     determination that significant deficiencies in the \n     application precluded communication of labeling comments, \n     postmarketing requirements, and postmarketing commitment \n     requests at the time initially projected. Communication of \n     labeling comments, postmarketing requirements, and \n     postmarketing commitment requests, or communication of FDA's \n     determination that significant deficiencies preclude \n     initiation of such discussions that occurs within 7 calendar \n     days of the target date stated in the planned review timeline \n     will be considered to have met the target date. FDA will also \n     report the number of times that the review timelines were \n     inapplicable due to the Agency's decision to review an \n     unsolicited major amendment or a solicited major amendment \n     that did not result in an extension of the review clock \n     (unless the review division chose to retain the previously \n     communicated planned review timeline).\n\n\n      IV. REVIEW OF PROPRIETARY NAMES TO REDUCE MEDICATION ERRORS\n\n       To enhance patient safety, FDA will utilize user fees to \n     implement various measures to\n\n[[Page S8284]]\n\n     reduce medication errors related to look-alike and sound-\n     alike proprietary names and such factors as unclear label \n     abbreviations, acronyms, dose designations, and error prone \n     label and packaging design.\n     A. Review Performance Goals--Drug/Biological Product \n         Proprietary Names\n       1. Proprietary names submitted during IND phase (as early \n     as end-of-phase 2)\n       a) Review 90% of proprietary name submissions filed within \n     180 days of receipt. Notify sponsor of tentative acceptance \n     or non-acceptance.\n       b) If the proprietary name is found to be unacceptable, the \n     sponsor can request reconsideration by submitting a written \n     rebuttal with supporting data or request a meeting within 60 \n     days to discuss the initial decision (meeting package \n     required).\n       c) If the proprietary name is found to be unacceptable, the \n     above review performance goals also would apply to the \n     written request for reconsideration with supporting data or \n     the submission of a new proprietary name.\n       d) A complete submission is required to begin the review \n     clock.\n       2. Proprietary names submitted with NDA/BLA\n       a) Review 90% of NDA/BLA proprietary name submissions filed \n     within 90 days of receipt. Notify sponsor of tentative \n     acceptance/non-acceptance.\n       b) A supplemental review will be done meeting the above \n     review performance goals if the proprietary name has been \n     submitted previously (IND phase after end-of-phase 2) and has \n     received tentative acceptance.\n       c) If the proprietary name is found to be unacceptable, the \n     sponsor can request reconsideration by submitting a written \n     rebuttal with supporting data or request a meeting within 60 \n     days to discuss the initial decision (meeting package \n     required).\n       d) If the proprietary name is found to be unacceptable, the \n     above review performance goals apply to the written request \n     for reconsideration with supporting data or the submission of \n     a new proprietary name.\n       e) A complete submission is required to begin the review \n     clock.\n\n\n                      V. MAJOR DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n       A. Procedure: For procedural or scientific matters \n     involving the review of human drug applications and \n     supplements (as defined in PDUFA) that cannot be resolved at \n     the signatory authority level (including a request for \n     reconsideration by the signatory authority after reviewing \n     any materials that are planned to be forwarded with an appeal \n     to the next level), the response to appeals of decisions will \n     occur within 30 calendar days of the Center's receipt of the \n     written appeal.\n       B. Performance goal: 90% of such answers are provided \n     within 30 calendar days of the Center's receipt of the \n     written appeal.\n       C. Conditions:\n       1. Sponsors should first try to resolve the procedural or \n     scientific issue at the signatory authority level. If it \n     cannot be resolved at that level, it should be appealed to \n     the next higher organizational level (with a copy to the \n     signatory authority) and then, if necessary, to the next \n     higher organizational level.\n       2. Responses should be either verbal (followed by a written \n     confirmation within 14 calendar days of the verbal \n     notification) or written and should ordinarily be to either \n     grant or deny the appeal.\n       3. If the decision is to deny the appeal, the response \n     should include reasons for the denial and any actions the \n     sponsor might take to persuade the Agency to reverse its \n     decision.\n       4. In some cases, further data or further input from others \n     might be needed to reach a decision on the appeal. In these \n     cases, the ``response'' should be the plan for obtaining that \n     information (e.g., requesting further information from the \n     sponsor, scheduling a meeting with the sponsor, scheduling \n     the issue for discussion at the next scheduled available \n     advisory committee).\n       5. In these cases, once the required information is \n     received by the Agency (including any advice from an advisory \n     committee), the person to whom the appeal was made, again has \n     30 calendar days from the receipt of the required information \n     in which to either deny or grant the appeal.\n       6. Again, if the decision is to deny the appeal, the \n     response should include the reasons for the denial and any \n     actions the sponsor might take to persuade the Agency to \n     reverse its decision.\n       7. N.B. If the Agency decides to present the issue to an \n     advisory committee and there are not 30 days before the next \n     scheduled advisory committee, the issue will be presented at \n     the following scheduled committee meeting to allow \n     conformance with advisory committee administrative \n     procedures.\n\n\n                           VI. CLINICAL HOLDS\n\n       A. Procedure: The Center should respond to a sponsor's \n     complete response to a clinical hold within 30 days of the \n     Agency's receipt of the submission of such sponsor response.\n       B. Performance goal: 90% of such responses are provided \n     within 30 calendar days of the Agency's receipt of the \n     sponsor's response.\n\n\n        VII. SPECIAL PROTOCOL QUESTION ASSESSMENT AND AGREEMENT\n\n       A. Procedure: Upon specific request by a sponsor (including \n     specific questions that the sponsor desires to be answered), \n     the Agency will evaluate certain protocols and issues to \n     assess whether the design is adequate to meet scientific and \n     regulatory requirements identified by the sponsor.\n       1. The sponsor should submit a limited number of specific \n     questions about the protocol design and scientific and \n     regulatory requirements for which the sponsor seeks agreement \n     (e.g., is the dose range in the carcinogenicity study \n     adequate, considering the intended clinical dosage; are the \n     clinical endpoints adequate to support a specific efficacy \n     claim).\n       2. Within 45 days of Agency receipt of the protocol and \n     specific questions, the Agency will provide a written \n     response to the sponsor that includes a succinct assessment \n     of the protocol and answers to the questions posed by the \n     sponsor. If the Agency does not agree that the protocol \n     design, execution plans, and data analyses are adequate to \n     achieve the goals of the sponsor, the reasons for the \n     disagreement will be explained in the response.\n       3. Protocols that qualify for this program include: \n     carcinogenicity protocols, stability protocols, and Phase 3 \n     protocols for clinical trials that will form the primary \n     basis of an efficacy claim. For such Phase 3 protocols to \n     qualify for this comprehensive protocol assessment, the \n     sponsor must have had an end of Phase 2/pre-Phase 3 meeting \n     with the review division so that the division is aware of the \n     developmental context in which the protocol is being reviewed \n     and the questions being answered.\n       4. N.B. For products that will be using Subpart E or \n     Subpart H development schemes, the Phase 3 protocols \n     mentioned in this paragraph should be construed to mean those \n     protocols for trials that will form the primary basis of an \n     efficacy claim no matter what phase of drug development in \n     which they happen to be conducted.\n       5. If a protocol is reviewed under the process outlined \n     above and agreement with the Agency is reached on design, \n     execution, and analyses and if the results of the trial \n     conducted under the protocol substantiate the hypothesis of \n     the protocol, the Agency agrees that the data from the \n     protocol can be used as part of the primary basis for \n     approval of the product. The fundamental agreement here is \n     that having agreed to the design, execution, and analyses \n     proposed in protocols reviewed under this process, the Agency \n     will not later alter its perspective on the issues of design, \n     execution, or analyses unless public health concerns \n     unrecognized at the time of protocol assessment under this \n     process are evident.\n       B. Performance goal: 90% of special protocols assessments \n     and agreement requests completed and returned to sponsor \n     within timeframes.\n       C. Reporting: The Agency will track and report the number \n     of original special protocol assessments and resubmissions \n     per original special protocol assessment.\n\n\n                     VIII. MEETING MANAGEMENT GOALS\n\n     A. Responses to Meeting Requests\n       1. Procedure: Within 14 calendar days of the Agency's \n     receipt of a request from industry for a formal Type A \n     meeting, or within 21 calendar days of the Agency's receipt \n     of a request from industry for a formal Type B or Type C \n     meeting (i.e., a scheduled face-to-face, teleconference, \n     videoconference, or written response), CBER and CDER should \n     notify the requester in writing (letter or fax) of the date, \n     time, and place for the meeting, as well as expected Center \n     participants. In the case of pre-IND and Type C meeting \n     requests, the sponsor may request a written response to its \n     questions rather than a face-to-face meeting, videoconference \n     or teleconference. In some cases, while the sponsor may \n     request a face-to-face pre-IND or Type C meeting, the Agency \n     may determine that a written response to the sponsor's \n     questions would be the most appropriate means for responding \n     to the meeting request. When it is determined that the \n     meeting request can be appropriately addressed through a \n     written response to questions, FDA shall notify the requester \n     of the date it intends to send the response.\n       2. Performance Goal: FDA will provide this notification \n     within 14 days for 90% of Type A meeting requests and within \n     21 days for 90% of Type B and Type C meeting requests.\n     B. Scheduling Meetings\n       1. Procedure: The meeting date should reflect the next \n     available date on which all applicable Center personnel are \n     available to attend, consistent with the component's other \n     business; however, the meeting should be scheduled consistent \n     with the type of meeting requested. If the requested date for \n     any of these types of meetings is greater than 30, 60, or 75 \n     calendar days (as appropriate) from the date the request is \n     received by the Agency, the meeting date should be within 14 \n     calendar days of the requested date.\n       a) Type A Meetings should occur within 30 calendar days of \n     the Agency receipt of the meeting request.\n       b) Type B Meetings should occur within 60 calendar days of \n     the Agency receipt of the meeting request. In the case of a \n     written response for a pre-IND meeting, the response should \n     be transmitted by FDA within 60 calendar days of the Agency \n     receipt of the meeting request.\n       c) Type C Meetings should occur within 75 calendar days of \n     the Agency receipt of the meeting request. In the case of a \n     written response, the response should be transmitted by FDA \n     within 75 calendar days of the Agency receipt of the meeting \n     request.\n       2. Performance goal: 90% of meetings are held within the \n     timeframe, and 90% of written responses are sent within the \n     timeframe.\n     C. Meeting Minutes\n       1. Procedure: The Agency will prepare minutes which will be \n     available to the sponsor 30\n\n[[Page S8285]]\n\n     calendar days after the meeting. The minutes will clearly \n     outline the important agreements, disagreements, issues for \n     further discussion, and action items from the meeting in \n     bulleted form and need not be in great detail. Meeting \n     minutes are not required if the Agency transmits a written \n     response for pre-IND or Type C meetings.\n       2. Performance goal: 90% of minutes are issued within 30 \n     calendar days of date of meeting.\n     D. Conditions\n       For a meeting to qualify for these performance goals:\n       1. A written request (letter or fax) should be submitted to \n     the review division; and\n       2. The letter should provide:\n       a) A brief statement of the purpose of the meeting, and in \n     the case of pre-IND and Type C meetings, the sponsor's \n     proposal for either a face-to-face meeting or a written \n     response from the Agency;\n       b) A listing of the specific objectives/outcomes the \n     requester expects from the meeting;\n       c) A proposed agenda, including estimated times needed for \n     each agenda item;\n       d) A listing of planned external attendees;\n       e) A listing of requested participants/disciplines \n     representative(s) from the Center; and\n       f) The approximate time that supporting documentation \n     (i.e., the ``backgrounder'') for the meeting will be sent to \n     the Center (i.e., ``x'' weeks prior to the meeting), but \n     should be received by the Center at the time of the meeting \n     request for Type A meetings and at least 1 month in advance \n     of the scheduled meeting for Type B and Type C meetings \n     (including those for which a written response will be \n     provided)\n       3. The Agency concurs that the meeting will serve a useful \n     purpose (i.e., it is not premature or clearly unnecessary). \n     However, requests for a ``Type B'' meeting will be honored \n     except in the most unusual circumstances.\n       4. In general, meetings regarding REMS or postmarketing \n     requirements that occur outside the context of the review of \n     a marketing application shall be classified as Type B \n     meetings.\n       5. In general, a post-action meeting requested by the \n     sponsor within three months after an FDA regulatory action \n     other than an approval (i.e., issuance of a complete response \n     letter) shall be classified as a Type A meeting.\n       6. FDA shall publish revised draft guidance on formal \n     meetings between FDA and sponsors no later than the end of FY \n     2013.\n       Sponsors are encouraged to consult available FDA guidance \n     to obtain further information on recommended meeting \n     procedures.\n\n\n    ix. enhancing regulatory science and expediting drug development\n\n       To enhance communications between FDA and sponsors during \n     drug development and to meet the challenges of emerging \n     science in the areas of clinical trial endpoint assessment \n     tools, biomarkers and pharmacogenomics, meta-analysis, and \n     development of drugs for rare diseases, FDA will conduct the \n     following activities:\n     A. Promoting Innovation Through Enhanced Communication \n         Between FDA and Sponsors During Drug Development\n       1. FDA's philosophy is that timely interactive \n     communication with sponsors during drug development is a core \n     Agency activity to help achieve the Agency's mission to \n     facilitate the conduct of efficient and effective drug \n     development programs, which can enhance public health by \n     making new safe and effective drugs available to the American \n     public in a timely manner.\n       2. By the end of FY 2013, FDA will develop a dedicated drug \n     development communication and training staff within the \n     Office of New Drugs in CDER and augment the manufacturers \n     assistance staff in CBER, focused on enhancing communication \n     between FDA and sponsors during drug development.\n       3. Within CDER, the drug development communication and \n     training staff will include (1) a dedicated liaison staff to \n     facilitate general and, in some cases, specific interactions \n     with sponsors and (2) a training staff for CDER staff \n     training and for communication of best practices to the \n     sponsor community.\n       4. The liaison staff will be composed of individuals who \n     are experienced and knowledgeable about the drug review \n     process (and in some cases may be on detail from the review \n     divisions), interact regularly with the staff in review \n     divisions, and are skilled in facilitating communications \n     between applicants and FDA staff.\n       5. The liaison staff will conduct a range of tasks \n     associated with enhancing communication between the review \n     team and sponsors including identification and dissemination \n     of best practices for enhanced communication, and development \n     of training programs for review staff. In addition, they will \n     work in collaboration with sponsor stakeholders to develop \n     training for sponsors and receive feedback on FDA's programs \n     regarding best practices for communication during drug \n     development (e.g., participation in workshops and other \n     meetings to communicate CDER's policy and practice to the \n     sponsor community and to receive feedback on recommended \n     improvements).\n       6. The liaison staff will serve as a point of contact for \n     sponsors who have general questions about drug development or \n     who need clarification on which review division to contact \n     with their questions. The staff will also serve as a \n     secondary point of communication within CDER for sponsors who \n     are encountering problems in communication with the review \n     team for their IND (e.g., in instances when they have not \n     received a response from the review team to a simple or \n     clarifying question or referral to the formal meeting process \n     within 30 days of the sponsor's initial request). In such \n     cases the liaison staff will assist in evaluating the issues \n     and working with the review team and the sponsor to \n     facilitate resolution of the problem.\n       7. By the end of FY 2014, the OND drug development and \n     communication staff will provide training to all CDER staff \n     involved in review of INDs. The training will include:\n       a) CDER's philosophy that timely interactive communication \n     with sponsors during drug development is a core activity to \n     help achieve our mission to facilitate the conduct of \n     efficient and effective drug development programs, which can \n     enhance public health by making new safe and effective drugs \n     available to the American public in a timely manner.\n       b) Best practices for triage of sponsor requests for advice \n     from the review team and timely communication of responses to \n     simple and clarifying questions or referral of more complex \n     questions to the formal meeting process.\n       c) Best practices for communication between the review team \n     and the sponsor including establishing clear expectations and \n     agreement on appropriate mechanisms (e.g., when \n     teleconferencing or secure email may be the most appropriate \n     means of communication) and frequency of such communications.\n       d) The role of the OND liaison staff in facilitating \n     overall enhanced drug development communication between CDER \n     and the drug development sponsor community and the staff's \n     role in facilitating resolution of individual communication \n     requests that have not been handled successfully in a timely \n     manner by the review team, which is the primary interface \n     with the sponsor regarding the drug under development.\n       8. By the end of the second quarter of FY 2015, FDA will \n     publish draft guidance for review staff and industry \n     describing best practices for communication between FDA and \n     IND sponsors during drug development. The guidance will \n     describe FDA's philosophy regarding timely interactive \n     communication with sponsors as a core activity, the scope of \n     appropriate interactions between the review team and the \n     sponsor, outline the types of advice that are appropriate for \n     sponsors to seek from FDA in pursuing their drug development \n     program, describe the general expectations for the timing of \n     FDA response to sponsor inquiries of simple and clarifying \n     questions or referral of more complex questions to the formal \n     meeting process, and describe best practices and \n     communication methods (including the value of person-to-\n     person scientific dialogue) to facilitate interactions \n     between the FDA review team and the sponsor during drug \n     development. FDA will publish final guidance within 18 months \n     of the close of the comment period for the draft guidance.\n     B. Advancing the Science of Meta-Analysis Methodologies\n       1. Develop a dedicated review team with appropriate \n     expertise to evaluate different scientific methods and to \n     explore the practical application of scientific approaches \n     and best practices, including methodological limitations, for \n     the conduct of meta-analyses in the context of FDA's \n     regulatory review process.\n       2. By the end of FY 2013, hold a public meeting engaging \n     stakeholders in discussing current and emerging scientific \n     approaches and methods for the conduct of meta-analyses, and \n     to facilitate stakeholder feedback and input regarding the \n     use of meta-analyses in the FDA's regulatory review process.\n       3. Considering feedback and input received through the \n     public meeting, publish a draft guidance document for comment \n     describing FDA's intended approach to the use of meta-\n     analyses in the FDA's regulatory review process by the end of \n     FY 2015. This guidance will promote a better understanding \n     and more consistency among Agency, industry, and other \n     stakeholders regarding meta-analyses and their role in \n     regulatory decisionmaking.\n       4. Complete the final guidance describing FDA's intended \n     approach to the use of meta-analyses in the FDA's regulatory \n     review process (or revised draft guidance, if appropriate) \n     within 1.5 years of the close of the public comment period.\n     C. Advancing the Use of Biomarkers and Pharmacogenomics\n       1. Develop staff capacity to review submissions that \n     contain complex issues involving pharmacogenomics and \n     biomarkers. This additional staff capacity will be integrated \n     into the clinical review divisions and the clinical \n     pharmacology and statistical review disciplines to ensure \n     greater understanding of biomarker use in application review \n     and efficient incorporation of qualified biomarkers in the \n     review process.\n       2. Provide training for FDA staff on approaches to \n     conducting a pharmacogenomics review of a new product \n     application. This training will focus on the following: \n     facilitation of a greater understanding of the challenges \n     that arise when using pharmacogenomic markers and other \n     biomarkers in a development program (including programs \n     involving companion diagnostics), development of approaches \n     to\n\n[[Page S8286]]\n\n     address these challenges, and promotion of consistency in \n     regulatory review through an understanding of best practices \n     in assessment of applications that use biomarkers in the drug \n     development program.\n       3. By the end of FY 2013, hold a public meeting to discuss \n     the current status of biomarkers and pharmacogenomics and \n     potential strategies to facilitate scientific exchanges in \n     regulatory and non-regulatory contexts.\n     D. Advancing Development of Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) \n         and Other Endpoint Assessment Tools\n       1. Develop clinical and statistical staff capacity to more \n     efficiently and effectively respond to submissions that \n     involve PROs and other outcomes assessment tools. These staff \n     will advance the development of these tools by providing IND \n     and qualification consultations and through promoting best \n     practices for review and qualification of outcomes assessment \n     tools. The additional capacity includes staff who will focus \n     on review and qualification of endpoint assessment tools, \n     including IND consultations with sponsors, as well as staff \n     who will be integrated into the review divisions to \n     facilitate evaluation of these tools and improve familiarity \n     and understanding of assessment tools among review staff. \n     These activities will allow for greater understanding of \n     challenges that arise during development of outcomes \n     assessment tools, potential strategies to overcome these \n     challenges, and greater consistency in FDA's approach to \n     review, qualification, and usage of these tools as part of \n     the drug development process.\n       2. By the end of FY 2014, hold a public meeting to discuss \n     FDA's qualification standards for drug development tools, new \n     measurement theory, and implications for multi-national \n     trials.\n     E. Advancing Development of Drugs for Rare Diseases\n       1. By the end of FY 2013, FDA will complete a staffing and \n     implementation plan for the CDER Rare Disease Program within \n     the Office of New Drugs and a CBER Rare Disease liaison \n     within the Office of Center Director.\n       2. FDA will increase by five the staff of the CDER Rare \n     Disease Program and establish and fill the CBER Rare Disease \n     liaison position.\n       3. On an ongoing basis, the staff in the Rare Disease \n     Programs of the two Centers will develop and disseminate \n     guidance and policy related to advancing and facilitating the \n     development of drugs and biologics for rare diseases, \n     including improving understanding among FDA reviewers of \n     approaches to studying such drugs; considering non-\n     traditional clinical development programs, study design, \n     endpoints, and statistical analysis; recognizing particular \n     challenges with post-market studies; and encouraging \n     flexibility and scientific judgment, as appropriate, on the \n     part of reviewers when evaluating investigational studies and \n     marketing applications for drugs for rare diseases. Rare \n     Disease Program staff will also engage in increased outreach \n     to industry regarding development of such drugs and to \n     patient representatives and organizations.\n       4. By mid-FY 2014, FDA, through the Rare Disease Program, \n     will conduct a public meeting to discuss complex issues in \n     clinical trials for studying drugs for rare diseases, \n     including such questions as endpoint selection, use of \n     surrogate endpoints/Accelerated Approval, and clinical \n     significance of primary endpoints; reasonable safety \n     exposures; assessment of dose selection; and development of \n     patient-reported outcome instruments. Participants in the \n     discussion will include FDA staff, academic and clinical \n     experts, and industry experts. A summary from the meeting \n     will be made available publicly through the FDA website.\n       5. By the end of FY 2015, FDA will develop and implement \n     staff training related to development, review, and approval \n     of drugs for rare diseases. The training will be provided to \n     all CDER and CBER review staff, and will be part of the \n     reviewer training core curriculum. Among the key purposes of \n     this training are to familiarize review staff with the \n     challenges associated with rare disease applications and \n     strategies to address these challenges; to promote best \n     practices for review and regulation of rare disease \n     applications; and to encourage flexibility and scientific \n     judgment among reviewers in the review and regulation of rare \n     disease applications. The training will also emphasize the \n     role of the Rare Disease Program staff as members of the \n     review team to help ensure consistency of scientific and \n     regulatory approaches across applications and review teams.\n       6. By the end of FY 2016, FDA, through the Rare Disease \n     Program, will develop an evaluation tool to evaluate the \n     success of the activities of the Rare Disease Program, \n     including the reviewer training. Among potential measures of \n     success are the development of a system to track rare disease \n     applications from IND submission through the post-marketing \n     period, increased number of reviewers receiving rare disease-\n     specific training, increased number of activities \n     contributing to regulatory and biomedical science for rare \n     disease drug development, and meeting of PDUFA goals for rare \n     disease applications.\n\n\n   X. ENHANCING BENEFIT-RISK ASSESSMENT IN REGULATORY DECISIONMAKING\n\n       A. FDA will develop a five-year plan to further develop and \n     implement a structured benefit/risk assessment in the new \n     drug approval process. FDA will publish its draft plan for \n     public comment by the end of the first quarter of FY 2013. \n     FDA will begin execution of the plan to implement the \n     benefit-risk framework across review divisions in the pre-and \n     post-market human drug review process by the end of the \n     fourth quarter of FY 2013, and the Agency will update the \n     plan as needed and post all updates on the FDA website.\n       The plan will include:\n       1. A description of FDA's intended approach to build on the \n     Agency's current efforts to integrate a structured benefit/\n     risk framework throughout the lifecycle of human drug \n     development.\n       2. A plan to conduct two public workshops on benefit-risk \n     considerations from the regulator's perspective that will \n     begin by the first quarter of FY 2014. The first workshop \n     will be primarily informational by focusing discussion on the \n     various frameworks and methods available and their \n     application to regulatory decision-making. The second \n     workshop will focus on the results and lessons learned in \n     implementing frameworks at regulatory agencies in the pre- \n     and post-market drug review process.\n       3. An evaluation plan to ascertain the impact of the \n     benefit-risk framework in the human drug review process. The \n     evaluation will consider the utility of the framework in \n     facilitating decision-making and review team discussions \n     across disciplines, risk management plan decision-making, \n     training of new review staff, and communicating regulatory \n     decisions. In particular, the evaluation will consider the \n     degree to which the framework supports or facilitates \n     balanced consideration of benefits and risks, a more \n     consistent and systematic approach to discussion and \n     decision-making, and communication of benefits and risks.\n       B. As appropriate, FDA will revise the CDER Clinical Review \n     Template, Office and Division Director Summary Memo \n     Templates, and corresponding Manuals of Policies and \n     Procedures (MaPP) [and equivalent documents in CBER] to \n     incorporate a structured benefit/risk assessment into the \n     human drug review process on a timeframe outlined in the \n     five-year plan described in (A).\n       C. Over the period of PDUFA V, FDA will initiate a public \n     process to nominate a set of disease areas that could benefit \n     from a more systematic and expansive approach to obtaining \n     the patient perspective on disease severity or unmet medical \n     need. FDA will convene 4 meetings per year (CDER will host 17 \n     meetings and CBER will host 3 meetings throughout PDUFA V) \n     with each meeting focused on a different disease area. These \n     meetings will include participation of FDA review divisions, \n     the relevant patient advocacy community, and other interested \n     stakeholders. After each meeting, FDA will publish the \n     meeting proceedings and a summary analysis of the input \n     received by FDA that is relevant to FDA's consideration of \n     disease severity and unmet medical need. This knowledge will \n     be used to more fully develop an understanding of the disease \n     severity and an assessment of the current state of the \n     treatment armamentarium which are both critical components of \n     FDA's current benefit-risk framework in regulatory decision-\n     making and communication. After the first two meetings, FDA \n     will develop a proposal for how FDA will incorporate these \n     perspectives into the Agency's decision-making.\n       In addition, FDA will increase its utilization of FDA's \n     Patient Representatives as Special Government Employee \n     consultants to CDER and CBER to provide patients' views early \n     in the medical product development process and ensure those \n     perspectives are considered in regulatory discussions.\n       D. FDA will train review and management staff on the \n     revised templates and MaPPs described in (B) and fully \n     integrate structured benefit/risk assessment into the \n     regulatory review process by a date specified in the five-\n     year plan.\n\n\n    XI. ENHANCEMENT AND MODERNIZATION OF THE FDA DRUG SAFETY SYSTEM\n\n       FDA will continue to use user fees to enhance and modernize \n     the current U.S. drug safety system, including adoption of \n     new scientific approaches, improving the utility of existing \n     tools for the detection, evaluation, prevention, and \n     mitigation of adverse events, and enhancing communication and \n     coordination between post-market and pre-market review staff. \n     Enhancements to the drug safety system will improve public \n     health by increasing patient protection while continuing to \n     enable access to needed medical products. User fees will \n     provide support for 1) enhancing risk evaluation and \n     mitigation strategies (REMS) by measuring their effectiveness \n     and evaluating with stakeholder input appropriate ways to \n     better integrate them into the existing and evolving \n     healthcare system, and 2) continued development and \n     implementation of the Sentinel System.\n     A. Measure the Effectiveness of REMS and Standardize and \n         Better Integrate REMS into the Healthcare System\n       FDA will use user fee funds to continue to develop \n     techniques to standardize REMS and with stakeholder input \n     seek to integrate them into the existing and evolving (e.g., \n     increasingly electronic) healthcare system.\n       1. By the end of FY 2013, FDA will develop and issue \n     guidance on how to apply the statutory criteria to determine \n     whether a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a \n     drug outweigh the risks.\n       2. By the end of FY 2013, FDA will hold one or more public \n     meetings to include the pharmaceutical industry, other \n     government\n\n[[Page S8287]]\n\n     healthcare providers, patient groups, and partners from other \n     sectors of the healthcare delivery system to explore \n     strategies to standardize REMS, where appropriate, with the \n     goal of reducing the burden of implementing REMS on \n     practitioners, patients, and others in various healthcare \n     settings. To move towards increased integration of REMS into \n     the healthcare delivery system, FDA will issue a report of \n     its findings by the first quarter of FY 2014 that will \n     identify at least one priority project in each of the \n     following areas including a workplan for project completion: \n     pharmacy systems, prescriber education, providing benefit/\n     risk information to patients, and practice settings.\n       3. By the end of FY 2013, FDA will initiate one or more \n     public workshops on methodologies for assessing whether REMS \n     are mitigating the risks they purport to mitigate and for \n     assessing the effectiveness and impact of REMS, including \n     methods for assessing the effect on patient access, \n     individual practitioners, and the overall burden on the \n     healthcare delivery system. FDA will issue guidance by the \n     end of FY 2014 on methodologies for assessing REMS. This \n     guidance should specifically address methodologies for \n     determining whether a specific REMS with elements to assure \n     safe use (ETASU) is: (i) commensurate with the specific \n     serious risk listed in the labeling of the drug and (ii) \n     considering the observed risk, not unduly burdensome on \n     patient access to the drug.\n     B. Sentinel as a Tool for Evaluating Drug Safety Issues That \n         May Require Regulatory Action\n       FDA will use user fee funds to conduct a series of \n     activities to determine the feasibility of using Sentinel to \n     evaluate drug safety issues that may require regulatory \n     action, e.g., labeling changes, PMRs, or PMCs. The activities \n     will be selected and designed to focus on issues that affect \n     classes of drugs or multiple products.\n       1. By the end of FY 2013, FDA will hold or support public \n     meetings engaging stakeholders to discuss current and \n     emerging Sentinel projects and facilitate stakeholder \n     feedback and input regarding Sentinel projects that would be \n     appropriate to meet the goals stated above.\n       2. Informed by the feedback and input received through the \n     public meeting, in FY 2013 through FY 2017, FDA will fund 4-6 \n     activities, which will include multiple product or class-\n     specific studies or methodology development. These activities \n     will be specifically designed to further evaluate safety \n     signals that, in previous cases, have served as the basis for \n     regulatory action(s) or designed more broadly to help \n     determine the utility and validity of the Sentinel System to \n     evaluate other types of signals in population-based \n     databases. The following are examples of potential \n     activities:\n       a) Expanding the active surveillance mechanisms begun for \n     the H1N1 pandemic to substitute for the information gathered \n     in large ad hoc, manufacturer-conducted studies\n       b) Evaluating risk for class-wide adverse events (e.g., \n     cardiovascular events, suicidality)\n       3. By the end of FY 2015, FDA will conduct (or fund by \n     contract) an interim assessment to evaluate the strengths, \n     limitations and the appropriate use of Sentinel for informing \n     regulatory actions (e.g., labeling changes, PMRs and PMCs) to \n     manage safety issues.\n       4. By the end of FY 2017, FDA will conduct (or fund by \n     contract) an assessment to evaluate the strengths, \n     limitations, and the appropriate use of Sentinel for \n     informing regulatory actions (e.g., labeling changes, PMRs \n     and PMCs) to manage safety issues.\n     C. Conduct and support activities designed to modernize the \n         process of pharmacovigilance\n       1. Continued use of expanded database resources: A critical \n     part of the transformation of the drug safety program is \n     maximizing the usefulness of tools used for adverse event \n     signal detection and risk assessment. Use of data other than \n     passive spontaneous reports, including population-based \n     epidemiological data and other types of observational data \n     resources will continue to enhance FDA's capability to \n     conduct targeted post-marketing surveillance, evaluate class \n     effects of drugs, and potentially conduct signal detection \n     using data resources other than reports from the Adverse \n     Event Reporting System (AERS). FDA will continue training and \n     development of existing staff on the use of these resources, \n     and develop the information technology infrastructure needed \n     to support access and analysis of data from these resources.\n     D. Information Systems and Infrastructure\n       FDA will continue the Agency's efforts on the following \n     standards-based information systems to support how FDA \n     obtains and analyzes post-market drug safety data and manages \n     emerging drug safety information:\n       1. Enhanced adverse event reporting system and surveillance \n     tools;\n       2. IT infrastructure to support access and analyses of \n     externally-linked databases; and\n       3. Workflow tracking system.\n\n\n  XII. IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF HUMAN DRUG REVIEW THROUGH REQUIRED \n     ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS AND STANDARDIZATION OF ELECTRONIC DRUG \n                            APPLICATION DATA\n\n       A. To enhance the quality and efficiency of FDA's review of \n     NDAs, BLAs, and INDs, FDA shall consult with stakeholders, \n     including pharmaceutical manufacturers and other research \n     sponsors, to issue draft guidance on the standards and format \n     of electronic submission of applications by December 31, \n     2012.\n       B. FDA will issue final guidance no later than 12 months \n     from the close of the public comment period on the draft \n     guidance. Such final guidance and any subsequent revisions to \n     the final guidance shall be binding on sponsors, applicants, \n     and manufacturers no earlier than twenty-four months after \n     issuance of the final guidance.\n       C. Requirements for electronic submission shall be phased \n     in according to the following schedule:\n       1. Twenty-four (24) months after publication of the final \n     guidance: All new original NDA and BLA submissions, all new \n     NDA and BLA efficacy supplements and amendments, all new NDA \n     and BLA labeling supplements and amendments, all new \n     manufacturing supplements and amendments, and all other new \n     NDA submissions.\n       2. Thirty-six (36) months after publication of the final \n     guidance: All original commercial INDs and amendments, except \n     for submissions described in section 561 of the Federal Food, \n     Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n       D. Because of the significant investments required to \n     change regulatory submission and review software, initial FDA \n     guidance shall specify the format of electronic submission of \n     applications using eCTD version 3.2.2 unless, after notice \n     and an opportunity for stakeholder comment, FDA determines \n     that another version will provide for more efficient and \n     effective applicant submission or FDA review. In general, \n     when FDA revises final guidance requiring submission using a \n     new version of electronic standards or formats, FDA shall \n     also accept submissions using the previous version for no \n     less than twenty-four (24) months.\n       E. Clinical Terminology Standards: Using a public process \n     that allows for stakeholder input, FDA shall develop \n     standardized clinical data terminology through open standards \n     development organizations (i.e., the Clinical Data \n     Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC)) with the goal of \n     completing clinical data terminology and detailed \n     implementation guides by FY 2017.\n       1. FDA shall develop a project plan for distinct \n     therapeutic indications, prioritizing clinical terminology \n     standards development within and across review divisions. FDA \n     shall publish a proposed project plan for stakeholder review \n     and comment by June 30, 2013. FDA shall update and publish \n     its project plan annually.\n       F. Development of terminology standards for data other than \n     clinical data: To address FDA-identified nonclinical data \n     standards needs, FDA will request public input on the use of \n     relevant already-existing data standards and the involvement \n     of existing standards development organizations to develop \n     new standards or refine existing standards. FDA will obtain \n     this input via publication of a Federal Register notice that \n     specifies a 60-day comment period.\n       G. FDA shall periodically publish final guidance specifying \n     the completed data standards, formats, and terminologies that \n     sponsors must use to submit data in applications. In the case \n     of standards for study data, new data standards and \n     terminology shall be applicable prospectively and only \n     required for studies that begin 12 months after issuance of \n     FDA's final guidance on the applicable data standards and \n     terminology.\n\n\n     XIII. PROGRESS REPORTING FOR PDUFA V AND CONTINUING PDUFA IV \n                              INITIATIVES\n\n       On an annual basis, FDA will report on its website the \n     progress in each of the PDUFA V initiatives described in \n     Sections IX, X, XI, and XII. The annual reports will include: \n     (a) descriptions of the hiring and placement of new staff and \n     use of PDUFA resources to support the new initiatives in \n     Sections IX, X, XI.A, XI.B, and XII, and (b) progress reports \n     on achieving metrics described in each of the sections. Each \n     report will be posted on the FDA website no later than 120 \n     days after the end of the fiscal year. The staff resources \n     will support the new initiatives described in Sections IX, X, \n     XIA, XIB and XII and the related work associated with these \n     initiatives to ensure their success.\n\n\n                   XIV. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY GOALS\n\n     A. Objective\n       FDA is committed to achieve the long-term goal of improving \n     the exchange, review, and management of human drug and \n     biologic applications throughout the product life cycle \n     through strategic investments in automated, standards-based \n     information technology (IT).\n     B. Communications and Technical Interactions\n       1. FDA will periodically update and publish to the FDA \n     website a five-year plan for business process improvement \n     enabled by IT investments.\n       a) The plan will frame the strategy for prioritizing IT-\n     enabled business process change, enumerate the business \n     process improvements expected from each IT investment, and \n     convey a consistent series of milestones for each initiative \n     to track pace and progress.\n       b) FDA will conduct an annual assessment of progress \n     against the plan and publish on the FDA website a summary of \n     the assessment within 3 months after the close of each fiscal \n     year.\n       c) FDA will publish updates to the plan as FDA deems \n     appropriate. FDA will publish on the FDA web site draft \n     revisions to the plan; solicit comments from the public on \n     those draft revisions; and consider the public comments \n     before completing and publishing updates to the plan.\n       2. The FDA and industry stakeholders will meet on a \n     quarterly basis to discuss prospective implementation of the \n     plan, progress toward the long term goal, potential impacts \n     that future activities may have on FDA or stakeholders, and \n     potential revisions to the plan.\n\n[[Page S8288]]\n\n     C. Metrics and Measures\n       On an annual basis, FDA will measure and report progress \n     toward achievement of the objectives defined in Section \n     XIV.A. Measures will include but are not limited to:\n       1. The number and percentage of IND, NDA, and BLA \n     submissions received in valid electronic format in compliance \n     with FDA standards, categorized by types of submissions. \n     Increasing the number and percentage of IND, NDA, and BLA \n     submissions received in valid electronic format is a goal \n     that is supported by the FDA and industry stakeholders. \n     Achievement of this goal requires the cooperation of \n     regulated industry. To support the assessment of this goal, \n     the following information will be tracked and reported:\n       a) Total number of submissions categorized by type of \n     submission\n       b) Total number of submissions in valid electronic format \n     in compliance with FDA standards\n       c) Total number of submissions received through the secure \n     electronic single point of entry versus other methods\n       d) Total number of submissions received substantially on \n     paper or non-standardized electronic format\n       e) Total number of standards-based electronic submissions \n     that fail to comply with FDA electronic submission standards, \n     along with a distribution of these submission failures across \n     categories of failure or problem type\n       2. Number and significance of IT technical specifications \n     or e-submission guidance implemented requiring industry to \n     change submission content that are not forecasted accurately \n     in the five year plan or those whose content has not been \n     available to industry at least twelve months prior to \n     required implementation.\n       3. Spending on Center IT systems and IT systems that are \n     common across the organizational divisions participating in \n     the process for the review of human drug applications. This \n     includes systems development versus maintenance spending; \n     infrastructure support; a report of total PDUFA fee-funded \n     spending versus appropriations-funded spending; FDA \n     enterprise versus PDUFA-program specific support.\n\n\n                XV. IMPROVING FDA PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT\n\n     A. The studies conducted under this initiative are intended \n         to foster:\n       1. Development of programs to improve access to internal \n     and external expertise\n       2. Reviewer development programs, particularly as they \n     relate to drug review processes\n       3. Advancing science and use of information management \n     tools\n       4. Improving both inter- and intra-Center consistency, \n     efficiency, and effectiveness\n       5. Improved reporting of management objectives\n       6. Increased accountability for use of user fee revenues\n       7. Focused investments on improvements in the process of \n     drug review\n       8. Improved communication between the FDA and industry\n     B. Studies will include:\n       1. Assessment by an independent contractor of the Program \n     for NME NDAs and original BLAs as described in Section IIB.\n       2. Assessment of the impact of the benefit-risk framework \n     in the human drug review process as described in Section \n     X.A.3.\n       3. Development of a tool to evaluate the success of the \n     activities of the Rare Disease Program as described in \n     Section IX.D.6.\n       4. Assessment of the impact of electronic submissions and \n     data standards on the efficiency and other performance \n     attributes of the human drug review process beginning in FY \n     2015.\n       5. Assessments by an independent accounting firm of the \n     review activity adjustment methodology, as described in \n     section 736(c)(2), by the end of the second quarter of FY \n     2013 and by the end of the fourth quarter of FY 2015 with \n     recommendations for changes, if warranted.\n\n\n               XVI. DEFINITIONS AND EXPLANATION OF TERMS\n\n       A. The term ``review and act on'' means the issuance of a \n     complete action letter after the complete review of a filed \n     complete application. The action letter, if it is not an \n     approval, will set forth in detail the specific deficiencies \n     and, where appropriate, the actions necessary to place the \n     application in condition for approval.\n       B. Goal Date Extensions for Major Amendments\n       1. A major amendment to an original application, efficacy \n     supplement, or resubmission of any of these applications, \n     submitted at any time during the review cycle, may extend the \n     goal date by three months.\n       2. A major amendment may include, for example, a major new \n     clinical safety/efficacy study report; major re-analysis of \n     previously submitted study(ies); submission of a REMS with \n     ETASU not included in the original application; or \n     significant amendment to a previously submitted REMS with \n     ETASU. Generally, changes to REMS that do not include ETASU \n     and minor changes to REMS with ETASU will not be considered \n     major amendments.\n       3. A major amendment to a manufacturing supplement \n     submitted at any time during the review cycle may extend the \n     goal date by two months.\n       4. Only one extension can be given per review cycle.\n       5. Consistent with the underlying principles articulated in \n     the GRMP guidance, FDA's decision to extend the review clock \n     should, except in rare circumstances, be limited to occasions \n     where review of the new information could address outstanding \n     deficiencies in the application and lead to approval in the \n     current review cycle.\n       C. A resubmitted original application is a complete \n     response to an action letter addressing all identified \n     deficiencies.\n       D. Class 1 resubmitted applications are applications \n     resubmitted after a complete response letter (or a not \n     approvable or approvable letter) that include the following \n     items only (or combinations of these items):\n       1. Final printed labeling\n       2. Draft labeling\n       3. Safety updates submitted in the same format, including \n     tabulations, as the original safety submission with new data \n     and changes highlighted (except when large amounts of new \n     information including important new adverse experiences not \n     previously reported with the product are presented in the \n     resubmission)\n       4. Stability updates to support provisional or final dating \n     periods\n       5. Commitments to perform Phase 4 studies, including \n     proposals for such studies\n       6. Assay validation data\n       7. Final release testing on the last 1-2 lots used to \n     support approval\n       8. A minor reanalysis of data previously submitted to the \n     application\n       9. Other minor clarifying information (determined by the \n     Agency as fitting the Class 1 category)\n       10. Other specific items may be added later as the Agency \n     gains experience with the scheme and will be communicated via \n     guidance documents to industry\n       E. Class 2 resubmissions are resubmissions that include any \n     other items, including any items that would require \n     presentation to an advisory committee.\n       F. A Type A meeting is a meeting which is necessary for an \n     otherwise stalled drug development program to proceed (a \n     ``critical path'' meeting) or to address an important safety \n     issue.\n       G. A Type B Meeting is a 1) pre-IND, 2) end of Phase 1 (for \n     Subpart E or Subpart H or similar products) or end of Phase \n     2/pre-Phase 3, or 3) a pre-NDA/BLA meeting. Each requestor \n     should usually only request 1 each of these Type B meetings \n     for each potential application (NDA/BLA) (or combination of \n     closely related products, i.e., same active ingredient but \n     different dosage forms being developed concurrently).\n       H. A Type C meeting is any other type of meeting.\n       I. The performance goals and procedures also apply to \n     original applications and supplements for human drugs \n     initially marketed on an over-the-counter (OTC) basis through \n     an NDA or switched from prescription to OTC status through an \n     NDA or supplement.\n       J. IT-specific definitions (refer also to Section XIV)\n       1. ``Program'' refers to the organizational resources, \n     procedures, and activities assigned to conduct ``the process \n     for the review of human drug applications,'' as defined in \n     the Prescription Drug User Fee Act.\n       2. ``Standards-based'' means compliant with published \n     specifications that address terminology or information \n     exchange between the FDA and regulated parties or external \n     stakeholders, as adopted by the FDA or other agencies of the \n     federal government, and often based on the publications of \n     national or international Standards Development \n     Organizations.\n       3. ``FDA Standards'' means technical specifications that \n     have been adopted and published by the FDA through the \n     appropriate governance process. FDA standards may apply to \n     terminology, information exchange, engineering or technology \n     specifications, or other technical matters related to \n     information systems. FDA standards often are based on the \n     publications of other federal agencies, or the publications \n     of national or international Standards Development \n     Organizations.\n       4. ``Product life cycle'' means the sequential stages of \n     human drug development, regulatory review and approval, post-\n     market surveillance and risk management, and where \n     applicable, withdrawal of an approved drug from the market. \n     In the context of the process for the review of human drug \n     applications, the product life cycle begins with the earliest \n     regulatory submissions in the Investigational New Drug (IND) \n     phase, continues through the New Drug Application (NDA) or \n     Biological Licensing Application (BLA) review phase, and \n     includes post-market surveillance and risk management \n     activities as covered under the process for the review of \n     human drug applications.\n\n   Generic Drug User Fee Act Program Performance Goals and Procedures\n\n       The performance efficiencies, metric goals and procedures \n     to which FDA will agree upon commencement of a generic drug \n     user fee act (GDUFA) program (``the program''), as jointly \n     proposed by FDA and industry, are summarized below.\n\n\n          Overall Purpose of the Generic Drug User Fee Program\n\n       To help FDA ensure that participants in the U.S. generic \n     drug system comply with U.S. quality standards, and to \n     increase the likelihood that American consumers get timely \n     access to low cost, high quality generic drugs, FDA and \n     industry have jointly agreed to a comprehensive user fee \n     program,\n\n[[Page S8289]]\n\n     to be supplemental to traditional appropriated funding, that \n     is focused on three key aims:\n       Safety--Ensure that industry participants, foreign or \n     domestic, who participate in the U.S. generic drug system are \n     held to consistent high quality standards and are inspected \n     biennially, using a risk-based approach, with foreign and \n     domestic parity.\n       Access--Expedite the availability of low cost, high quality \n     generic drugs by bringing greater predictability to the \n     review times for abbreviated new drug applications, \n     amendments and supplements, increasing predictability and \n     timeliness in the review process.\n       Transparency--Enhance FDA's ability to protect Americans in \n     the complex global supply environment by requiring the \n     identification of facilities involved in the manufacture of \n     generic drugs and associated active pharmaceutical \n     ingredients, and improving FDA's communications and feedback \n     with industry in order to expedite product access.\n       Recognizing the critical role generic drugs play in \n     providing more affordable, therapeutically equivalent \n     medicine, the Generic Drug User Fee program is designed to \n     keep individual fee amounts as low as possible to supplement \n     appropriated funding to ensure that consumers continue to \n     receive the significant benefits offered by generic drugs \n     which provided more than $824 billion in savings to the \n     nation's health care system in the last decade alone. The \n     additional resources called for under the agreement, an \n     inflation adjusted $299 million annually for each of the five \n     years of the program, will provide FDA with the ability to \n     perform critical program functions that could not otherwise \n     occur. This program is not expected to add significantly to \n     the cost of generic drugs: given that a reported 3.99 billion \n     retail prescriptions per year were dispensed in the United \n     States in 2010, and assuming that 78% of these prescriptions \n     were filled by generic drugs, it equates to less than a dime \n     per prescription for the average cost of a prescription \n     filled by a generic drug in the United States. Moreover, with \n     the adoption of user fees and the associated savings in \n     development time, the overall expense of bringing a product \n     to market may decline and result in reduced costs.\n       In addition to the public health benefits outlined above, \n     the program described in this letter is expected to provide \n     significant value to small companies and first time entrants \n     in the generic market who will benefit significantly from the \n     certainty associated with performance review metrics that \n     offer the potential to dramatically reduce the time needed to \n     commercialize a generic drug when compared to pre-GDUFA \n     review times.\n       In addition, the variety of funding sources for the program \n     will assure that participants in the generic drug industry, \n     whether finished dosage form (FDF) manufacturers or Active \n     Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) manufacturers appropriately \n     share the financial expense and benefits of the program. \n     Given that the total amount of annual user fee funding is \n     expected to be derived from a broad funding source, including \n     an estimated 2000 FDF and API facilities supporting \n     Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs), as well as \n     approximately 750 ANDAs, 750 prior approval supplements \n     (PASs) and 350 Type II Active Pharmaceutical Drug Master \n     Files (DMFs) annually, user fees are expected to provide a \n     measurable return on investment related to predictability of \n     inspection, and review timelines. The program's goals of \n     ensuring FDA has necessary resources to conduct needed \n     inspections as part of the complete review framework and \n     achieve parity of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) \n     inspections for foreign and domestic facilities by the 5th \n     year of the user fee program will also provide significant \n     value to industry participants given that outstanding \n     inspections can result in delays of ANDA approvals.\n       Taken collectively, the user fee program and associated \n     performance metrics and fees are expected to provide \n     measurable public health benefits and are not expected to \n     competitively disadvantage any company or business sector \n     regardless of size or location.\n\n\n                               END NOTES\n\n     1.

OVERVIEW\n\n\n          Overall Program Scope, Assumptions, and Aspirations\n\n       The goals to which FDA is committing for generic drugs are \n     premised on the following assumptions:\n       I. Funding for the program from user fees will be at \n     agreed-upon levels of approximately $299 million annually \n     adjusted for inflation and will supplement appropriated \n     funding from Congress as described further below.\n       II. It is estimated that FDA will receive the funding \n     through approximately 750 abbreviated new drug applications \n     (ANDAs) per year submitted electronically, approximately 750 \n     prior approval supplements (PASs) approximately 350 newly \n     referenced drug master files (DMFs) per year and through \n     approximately 2000 facilities associated with ANDAs. While \n     the total revenue collected can be defined in advance and is \n     constant as the resourcing level must be constant, the \n     individual fee will be determined each year based on the \n     variability of the fee source.\n       III. Over the five year course of the program, there will \n     be no significant changes in the generic drug facility \n     inventory, either in terms of general number of facilities, \n     or the foreign and domestic facility split.\n       IV. FDA will have streamlined hiring authority for all \n     GDUFA-related positions prior to or concurrent with the \n     implementation date of the program.\n       V. FDA expects the program will be implemented starting on \n     the first day of Fiscal Year 2013, October 1, 2012 and \n     continue for five years, with the joint expectation that the \n     program will be continued at the end of five years under \n     terms to be negotiated before the end of FY 2017.\n       VI. Industry and FDA will populate and maintain databases \n     as necessary for facilities, fee assessments, efficiency and \n     other enhancements as described further below and as needed \n     to support the Generic Drug User Fee Act. Because certain \n     databases to implement this program will need to be built, \n     and existing systems need to be expanded or modified, \n     industry will submit necessary information in electronic \n     format to FDA using appropriate standards to be specified by \n     the agency or as specified in statute.\n       VII. FDA will aspire to the extent possible to maintain \n     levels of productivity at least similar to pre-GDUFA levels, \n     while hiring and training incremental staff necessary to \n     achieve the program performance goals, building necessary \n     systems and implementing outlined program changes in years 1 \n     and 2 of the program (see goals for years 3-5 metrics).\n       VIII. FDA will utilize a complete review standard (as \n     defined below), will aspire to hold first cycle deficiency \n     teleconferences with industry to discuss complete response \n     questions at a level at least similar to pre-GDUFA levels in \n     years 1 and 2 of the program (see goals for years 3-5 \n     metrics) and will utilize an approach similar to the NDA \n     review process whereby FDA uses telephone information \n     requests to address easily correctable deficiencies during \n     the review process before and after issuance of complete \n     response letters.\n       IX. FDA will aspire to complete reviews for applications \n     with only minor administrative amendments pending prior to \n     the expiration date of the controlling patent or applicable \n     exclusivity date regardless of the amendment(s) goal date.\n       X. FDA will work towards achieving performance goals to \n     reach parity of GMP inspections of foreign and domestic \n     establishments, will prioritize inspections using a risk-\n     based approach, and will prioritize inspections of \n     establishments associated with ANDAs that are otherwise \n     approvable or eligible for tentative approval except for an \n     outstanding inspection, as well as establishments associated \n     with ANDAs that have not been inspected previously. In \n     appropriate circumstances FDA can rely on a routine \n     surveillance inspection in lieu of an application-specific \n     inspection. Generally, among other considerations, FDA relies \n     on a previous inspection of a finished product site occurring \n     within 2 years of the current good manufacturing practice \n     (CGMP) evaluation for a pending application, 3 years for an \n     active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) site or a control \n     testing laboratory, and 4 years for a packaging-only site. \n     There are exceptions to this general practice, which are \n     usually related to the nature of the drug being processed or \n     the complexity of the associated processing operations. FDA \n     intends to continue the practice of using a risk-based \n     assessment in determining the length of time since the last \n     inspection, guided by a 2-year cycle for finished dosage \n     product sites and a 3-year cycle for API sites and \n     consideration of the type of finished product or API in the \n     application. Practically, this means that in making decisions \n     about pending applications for which FDA does not have \n     current inspection information within the time period \n     indicated, FDA may use previous FDA inspection information \n     and/or use inspection information from another regulatory \n     authority as appropriate.\n       XI. FDA will strive to review and act on all ANDAs that are \n     submitted on the first day that any valid Paragraph IV \n     application for the drug in question is submitted within 30 \n     months of submission to avoid causing first applicants to \n     inadvertently forfeit 180-day exclusivity eligibility under \n     21 U.S.C. Sec. 355(j)(5)(D)(i)(IV).\n       XII. Because the agreed generic drug user fee program is \n     intended to be additive to budget appropriations, agreed upon \n     legislative language will require that annual program \n     appropriations from Congress must be equal to or exceed the \n     FDA appropriation for FY 2009.\n       XIII. In order to generate the agreed upon levels of user \n     fee funding to achieve the enclosed performance goals, \n     metrics and efficicienies, legislative language will require \n     that approximately 70% of GDUFA fees shall be derived from \n     facility fees (for facilities producing or pending review to \n     produce active pharmaceutical ingredients or finished dosage \n     forms for a generic drug application), approximately 30% of \n     GDUFA fees shall be derived from application fees (DMF Fees \n     and ANDA and PAS (Prior Approval Supplement) Fees). As \n     discussed and agreed by the various industry business \n     segments, overall fees will be divided 80 percent to 20 \n     percent between the finished dosage form (FDF) and API and \n     manufacturers, respectively in industry. In the first year of \n     the\n\n[[Page S8290]]\n\n     program, $50 million of the total GDUFA user fee funding \n     shall be generated by a one time backlog fee for ANDAs \n     pending (except for ANDAs that are pending but have received \n     tentative approval) on October 1, 2012.\n       XIV. For appeals of decisions concerning procedural or \n     scientific matter involving review of pending ANDAs, ANDA \n     amendments and ANDA supplements FDA will aspire that the \n     response to appeals of decisions will occur within 30 \n     calendar days of OGD receipt of the written appeal when \n     possible, though no reportable performance goals are \n     required.\n       Note: If these assumptions differ significantly from \n     actuality, FDA may not be able to achieve the goals and \n     efficiency enhancements outlined in this goals letter, \n     despite the supplemental funding provided by the program.\n\n\n        Summary of Major Program Goals including Five Year Goals\n\n       Major Program (including 5 year) goals can be summarized as \n     follows:\n       Note that FDA agrees to additional 5 year goals, as set \n     forth later in this goals letter, such as goals on \n     amendments, controlled correspondence, and prior approval \n     supplements, as well as goals for years prior to year 5 of \n     the program. The goals summarized in this section are a \n     subset of the complete year 5 goals, and are intended simply \n     to illustrate the scope of the program.\n       Application metrics--For Abbreviated New Drug Applications \n     (ANDAs) in the year 5 cohort, FDA will review and act on 90 \n     percent of complete electronic ANDAs within 10 months after \n     the date of submission. Certain amended applications may have \n     differing metrics as discussed below.\n       Backlog metrics--FDA will review and act on 90 percent of \n     all ANDAs, ANDA amendments and ANDA prior approval \n     supplements regardless of current review status (whether \n     electronic, paper, or hybrid) pending on October 1, 2012 by \n     the end of FY 2017.\n       CGMP Inspection metrics--FDA will conduct risk-adjusted \n     biennial CGMP surveillance inspections of generic API and \n     generic finished dosage form (FDF) manufacturers, with the \n     goal of achieving parity of inspection frequency between \n     foreign and domestic firms in FY 2017.\n       Efficiency Enhancements--FDA will implement various \n     efficiency enhancements discussed below on October 1, 2012 or \n     upon enactment of the program, whichever is later.\n       Regulatory Science--FDA will continue, and for some topics \n     begin undertaking various regulatory science initiatives \n     discussed below on October 1, 2012 or upon enactment of the \n     program, whichever is later, focusing first on the \n     initiatives discussed below and with additional initiatives \n     to be identified with input from an industry working group.\n       Details follow.\n\n2. EFFICIENCY ENHANCEMENTS TO BE UNDERTAKEN ON OCTOBER 1, 2012, OR UPON \n              ENACTMENT OF THE PROGRAM, WHICHEVER IS LATER\n\n\n                 A. ANDA Review Efficiency Enhancements\n\n       Starting on October 1, 2012 or upon enactment of the \n     program, whichever is later, FDA will issue complete response \n     letters, rather than discipline specific letters, for all \n     ANDAs, including those pending on October 1, 2012.\n       Complete response letters will reflect full division-level \n     review of deficiencies from all relevant review disciplines, \n     including inspections, and address other matters relating to \n     the ANDA and associated DMFs as well as consults with other \n     agency components (these will be subsumed into the \n     application metrics).\n       FDA reviewers will make every reasonable effort to \n     communicate promptly to applicants easily correctable \n     deficiencies found in the ANDA and will utilize an approach \n     similar to the NDA review process whereby FDA uses telephone \n     information requests to address easily correctable \n     deficiencies during the review process before and after \n     issuance of complete response letters.\n       When requested by the ANDA sponsor within 10 business days \n     of FDA issuing a first cycle complete response letter, as \n     provided by the sponsor in a written request that outlines \n     specific written questions the applicant would like to \n     discuss (limited to the content of the letter), FDA will \n     schedule a 30 minute teleconference to clarify issues and \n     answer questions. Priority for such teleconferences will be \n     given to expedited and first major amendment applications. \n     Although FDA will begin to develop procedures and tracking \n     systems for such teleconferences coincident with the start of \n     the program, there will be no teleconference goals for the \n     first two years of the program although FDA will aspire to \n     conduct such teleconferences as requested when reportable \n     performance goals are not otherwise required. In the first \n     two years, FY 2013 and FY 2014, FDA would aspire to hold \n     teleconferences with industry to address complete response \n     questions at a level similar to pre-GDUFA levels. \n     Subsequently, the goals for number of reportable \n     teleconferences (although FDA may conduct more such \n     teleconferences) will be:\n       Closing out the teleconference request for 200 meetings in \n     FY 2015;\n       Closing out the teleconference request for 250 meetings in \n     FY 2016;\n       Closing out the teleconference request for 300 meetings in \n     FY 2017.\n       FDA will develop enhanced refusal to receive standards for \n     ANDAs and other related submissions by the end of year 1 of \n     the program and will publish such standards in advance of \n     implementation.\n       For ANDAs in the year 1 and 2 cohorts, FDA will expedite \n     review of Paragraph IV applications that are submitted on the \n     first day that any valid Paragraph IV application for the \n     drug in question is submitted. Expedited review will be \n     implemented consistent with existing procedure for expediting \n     applications as set forth in CDER's MAPP 5240.3, and will \n     also include those applications that become eligible for \n     approval during the review period as a result of no blocking \n     exclusivities, patent(s) and/or applicable stays based on \n     appropriate documentation submitted.\n       Review metric goals (described below) only apply to \n     submissions made electronically, following the eCTD format in \n     effect at the date of submission.\n       Backlog review metric goals (described below) apply to all \n     ANDA applications, amendments, and supplements regardless of \n     current review status in the queue as of October 1, 2012, \n     regardless of whether they were submitted in paper, \n     electronic, or hybrid format.\n\n\n        B. Drug Master File (DMF) Review Efficiency Enhancements\n\n       After the program's implementation date, upon payment of \n     the DMF fee by DMF holders anticipating reference by a \n     generic drug manufacturer, FDA will conduct a completeness \n     assessment of Type II API DMFs. Following a satisfactory \n     completeness assessment, FDA will deem the DMF available for \n     reference, placing the DMF number in a publicly available \n     list of Type II API DMFs available for reference.\n       Review metric goals (described below) will only apply to \n     Type II API DMFs submitted after the program's implementation \n     date, if they are submitted electronically. Electronic DMFs \n     will follow the eCTD format in effect at date of submission.\n       FDA will issue a letter detailing all identified \n     deficiencies, rather than discipline specific letters, for \n     all DMFs including those under review at the time of \n     enactment of the implementing legislation.\n       The DMF deficiency letters will reflect full division-level \n     deficiency review of deficiencies from all relevant review \n     disciplines, including inspections, and address other matters \n     relating to the DMF review such as consults with other agency \n     components (these will be subsumed into the DMF metrics).\n       FDA reviewers will make every reasonable effort to \n     communicate promptly to applicants easily correctable \n     deficiencies found in the DMF and will continue to utilize an \n     approach similar to the NDA review process whereby FDA uses \n     telephone information requests to address easily correctable \n     deficiencies during the review process before and after \n     issuance of complete response letters.\n       When requested by a DMF holder within 10 business days of \n     FDA issuing a first cycle DMF deficiency letter, as provided \n     by the DMF holder in a written request that outlines specific \n     written questions the DMF holder would like to discuss \n     (limited to the content of the letter), FDA will schedule a \n     30 minute teleconference with a limit of one teleconference \n     per DMF holder per month, with the total number of \n     teleconferences not to exceed the number of teleconferences \n     for ANDAs, a teleconference to clarify issues and answer \n     questions. Priority for such teleconferences will be given to \n     DMFs referenced in expedited and first major deficiency \n     applications. Although FDA will begin to develop procedures \n     and tracking systems for such teleconferences coincident with \n     the start of the program, there will be no teleconference \n     goals for the first two years of the program although FDA \n     will aspire to conduct such teleconferences as requested when \n     reportable performance goals are not otherwise required. In \n     the first two years, FY 2013 and FY 2014, FDA would aspire to \n     hold teleconferences with industry to address DMF deficiency \n     questions at a level similar to pre-GDUFA levels (although \n     FDA may conduct more such teleconferences).\n       Once a DMF has undergone a complete review and the ANDA \n     referencing same is either approved or tentatively approved--\n     at such time there being no further outstanding deficiencies \n     to the DMF--FDA will issue the DMF holder a letter to \n     indicate that the DMF does not have any further open matters \n     as part of the review associated with the referencing ANDA.\n\n\n                 C. Inspection Efficiency Enhancements\n\n       To maximize the number of applications that can be reviewed \n     within the metric goals and to assist in securing the \n     pharmaceutical supply chain, FDA will employ a risk-adjusted \n     biennial CGMP surveillance inspection model for inspection of \n     generic API and FDF manufacturers, with the goal of achieving \n     parity of inspection frequency between foreign and domestic \n     establishments in FY 2017 and will prioritize inspections of \n     establishments associated with ANDAs that are otherwise \n     approvable or eligible for tentative approval except for an \n     outstanding inspection, as well as establishments that have \n     not been inspected previously.\n       FDA will make inspection classification results and date of \n     the last facility inspection available to the public and \n     industry on FDA's website on timely basis.\n       During the five years of the program, FDA will undertake a \n     study of foreign government regulator inspections (CGMP and \n     bioequivalence), report findings publicly, and develop a \n     program to utilize foreign inspection classifications when \n     and where appropriate.\n\n[[Page S8291]]\n\n                    D. Other Efficiency Enhancements\n\n       FDA will develop new and/or enhance existing facility \n     databases (API and FDF manufacturing and clinical/ \n     bioequivalence site) to be populated by industry. These \n     databases will, at a minimum, contain information for \n     generics-related firms, including addresses and Data \n     Universal Numbering System (DUNS) numbers, and will link \n     facilities to DMFs and ANDAs and will contain other \n     information as necessary.\n       FDA will develop a current chemistry manufacturing and \n     controls (CMC) records database to aid in the efficiency of \n     review and inspection.\n       FDA will develop and issue electronic data submission \n     standards.\n       Because certain databases to implement this program will \n     need to be built, and existing systems need to be expanded or \n     modified, industry will submit necessary information in \n     electronic format to FDA using appropriate standards to be \n     specified by the agency or as specified in statute.\n\n                   3. REGULATORY SCIENCE INITIATIVES\n\n\n                            A. Working Group\n\n       FDA will convene a working group and consider suggestions \n     from industry and other stakeholders to develop an annual \n     list of regulatory science initiatives for review by CDER \n     Director.\n\n\n                            B. FY 2013 Plan\n\n       The FY 2013 plan is appended.\n\n                      4. METRIC GOALS/MEASUREMENTS\n\n\n                       A. Human Resources Metrics\n\n       FDA will hire and train at least 25 percent of incremental \n     staff in FY 2013, 50 percent in FY 2014 and will strive to \n     complete GDUFA-funded human resources hiring goals in FY 2015 \n     as necessary to achieve the program's performance metrics and \n     goals.\n\n\n  B. ANDA, ANDA Amendment, and ANDA Prior Approval Supplement Review \n              Metrics and DMF Reviews as Subsumed in Each\n\n       ANDAs will be categorized according to cohort year.\n       Once an ANDA is in a given year's cohort, dates of \n     submission of a subsequent amendment will not change the \n     cohort year. Regardless of the year in which an amendment is \n     submitted, any additional time periods to be added to the \n     base review period will be calculated using the time periods \n     corresponding to the original cohort year.\n       Original (complete) ANDA Review (Certain amended \n     applications may have differing metrics as discussed below.)\n       FDA will review and act on 60 percent of original ANDA \n     submissions within 15 months from the date of submission for \n     the year 3 cohort.\n       FDA will review and act on 75 percent of original ANDA \n     submissions within 15 months from the date of submission for \n     the year 4 cohort.\n       FDA will review and act on 90 percent of original ANDA \n     submissions within 10 months from the date of submission for \n     the year 5 cohort.\n       For ANDAs in the year 1 and 2 cohorts, FDA will expedite \n     review of Paragraph IV applications that are submitted on the \n     first day that any valid Paragraph IV application for the \n     drug in question is submitted.\n       Amendment Review\n       All amendment metric goals are incremental, and the time \n     periods specified are calculated from the date of submission. \n     They will be added to the original review goal, but in no \n     case shall they shorten the original goal date. (In other \n     words, an amendment with a 6 month metric which was submitted \n     4 months prior to original goal date would add 2 months to \n     the review clock).\n       An amendment pre Complete Response Letter adjusts the goal \n     date for the original application.\n       Subsequent amendments pre Complete Response Letter also \n     adjust the goal date for the application and are additive.\n       An amendment post Complete Response Letter sets a new goal \n     date for the application.\n       Subsequent amendments post Complete Response Letter also \n     adjust the goal date for the application and are additive.\n       Delaying amendments or amendments containing information \n     that FDA would otherwise ask for as a result of post ANDA \n     submission reference listed drug changes do not add to the \n     count of amendments.\n       If any amendment contains multiple elements, the longest \n     goal date shall apply.\n       Amendments shall be grouped as Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3. \n     FDA agrees that unsolicited amendments that are submitted to \n     a pending ANDA that are neither Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3 \n     amendments, but rather are routine or administrative in \n     nature and do not require scientific review (e.g., requests \n     for final ANDA approval, patent amendments, general \n     correspondence, and USP monograph updates), will not lengthen \n     or impact the original review goal date.\n       Tier 1 amendments include:\n       All solicited first major and the first five minor \n     amendments\n       All unsolicited amendments indicated by sponsor and agreed \n     by FDA to be a result of either delaying actions as \n     determined by FDA's Office of Generic Drugs taking into \n     account the facts and information supplied by the ANDA \n     applicant or that otherwise would eventually be solicited.\n       Tier 2 amendments include:\n       All unsolicited amendments not arising from delaying \n     actions as determined by FDA's Office of Generic Drugs taking \n     into account the facts and information supplied by the ANDA \n     applicant excepting those amendments which only remove \n     information for review.\n       Tier 3 amendments include:\n       Any solicited major amendment subsequent to the first major \n     amendment\n       Any solicited minor amendment subsequent to the fifth minor \n     amendment\n       Tier 1 amendment goals:\n       First major amendment\n       FDA will review and act on 60 percent of first major \n     amendment submissions within 10 months from the date of \n     submission for the year 3 cohort.\n       FDA will review and act on 75 percent of first major \n     amendment submissions within 10 months from the date of \n     submission for the year 4 cohort.\n       FDA will review and act on 90 percent of first major \n     amendment submissions within 10 months from the date of \n     submission for the year 5 cohort.\n       Minor amendments (first--third)\n       FDA will review and act on 60 percent of first through \n     third minor amendment submissions within 3 months from the \n     date of submission for the year 3 cohort.\n       FDA will review and act on 75 percent of first through \n     third minor amendment submissions within 3 months from the \n     date of submission for year 4 cohort.\n       FDA will review and act on 90 percent of first through \n     third minor amendment submissions within 3 months from the \n     date of submission for the year 5 cohort.\n       Minor amendments (fourth--fifth)\n       FDA will review and act on 60 percent of fourth through \n     fifth minor amendment submissions within 6 months from the \n     date of submission for the year 3 cohort.\n       FDA will review and act on 75 percent of fourth through \n     fifth minor amendment submissions within 6 months from the \n     date of submission for year 4 cohort.\n       FDA will review and act on 90 percent of fourth through \n     fifth minor amendment submissions within 6 months from the \n     date of submission for the year 5 cohort.\n       Except that if any Tier 1 amendment requires an inspection, \n     the goal shall be 10 months.\n       Tier 2 amendment goals:\n       FDA will review and act on 60 percent of amendment \n     submissions within 12 months from the date of submission for \n     the year 3 cohort.\n       FDA will review and act on 75 percent of amendment \n     submissions within 12 months from the date of submission for \n     year 4 cohort.\n       FDA will review and act on 90 percent of amendment \n     submissions within 12 months from the date of submission for \n     the year 5 cohort.\n       Tier 3 amendment goals:\n       There will be no GDUFA metrics for tier 3 amendments.\n       Review of Complete Prior Approval Supplements (PASs) \n     (Certain amended PASs may have differing metrics as discussed \n     above in the Amendment Review section).\n       FDA will review and act on 60 percent of PASs not requiring \n     inspection within 6 months from the date of submission for \n     receipts in FY 2015; FDA will review and act on 60 percent of \n     PASs requiring inspection within 10 months from the date of \n     submission for receipts in FY 2015.\n       FDA will review and act on 75 percent of PASs not requiring \n     inspection within 6 months from the date of submission for \n     receipts in FY 2016; FDA will review and act on 75 percent of \n     PASs requiring inspection within 10 months from the date of \n     submission for receipts in FY 2016.\n       FDA will review and act on 90 percent of PASs not requiring \n     inspection within 6 months from the date of submission for \n

The year 2 cohort refers to the dates of \n     submissions made electronically in FY 2014 (October 1, 2013 \n     to September 30, 2014). The year 3 cohort refers to the dates \n     of submissions made electronically in FY 2015 (October 1, \n     2014 to September 30, 2015). The year 4 cohort refers to \n     submissions made electronically in FY 2016 (October 1, 2015 \n     to September 30, 2016). The year 5 cohort refers to \n     submissions made electronically in FY 2017 (October 1, 2016 \n     to September 30, 2017).\n       Complete response letter--refers to a written communication \n     to an applicant or DMF holder from FDA usually describing all \n     of the deficiencies that the agency has identified in an \n     abbreviated application (including pending amendments) or a \n     DMF that must be satisfactorily addressed before the ANDA can \n     be approved. Complete response letters will reflect a \n     complete review and will require a complete response from \n     industry to restart the clock. Refer to 21 CFR 314.110 and \n     http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/\nGuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/LawsActsandRules/\nucm084138.htm for additional details. When a citizen petition \n     may impact the approvability of the ANDA, FDA will strive to \n     address, where possible, valid issues raised in a relevant \n     citizen petition in the complete response letter. If a \n     citizen petition raises an issue that would delay only part \n     of a complete response, a response that addresses all other \n     issues will be considered a complete response.\n       Complete review--refers to a full division-level review \n     from all relevant review disciplines, including inspections, \n     and includes other matters relating to the ANDA and \n     associated DMFs as well as consults with other agency \n     components.\n       Controlled correspondence--FDA'S Office of Generic Drugs \n     provides assistance to pharmaceutical firms and related \n     industry regarding a variety of questions posed as \n     ``controlled documents.'' See http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/\n CentersOffices/CDER/ucm 120610.htm. Controlled correspondence \n     does not include citizen petitions, petitions for \n     reconsideration or requests for stay.\n       DMF or Type II Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient Drug Master \n     File--means a submission of information to the Secretary by a \n     person that intends to authorize the Food and Drug \n     Administration to reference the information to support \n     approval of a generic drug submission without the submitter \n     having to disclose the information to the generic drug \n     submission applicant.\n       Electronic--refers to submissions in an all electronic eCTD \n     format in effect at the date of submission.\n       Expedited review of application--While generally, review of \n     original ANDAs, ANDA amendments and ANDA supplements are \n     reviewed in the order received, (first-in, first-reviewed), \n     certain applications may be identified at the date of \n     submission for expedited review, as described in CDER's MAPP \n     5240.3. (See http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/\nCentersOffices/CDER/ManualofPoliciesProcedures/ucm079787.pdf) \n     which includes expedited review of the original submission \n     and amendment(s) associated with the expedited review \n     qualifying application. Products to respond to current and \n     anticipated public health emergencies, products under special \n     review programs, such as the President's Emergency Plan for \n     AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), products for which a nationwide \n     shortage has been identified, and first generic products for \n     which there are no blocking patents or exclusivities on the \n     reference listed drug currently may qualify for expedited \n     review. For ANDAs in the year 1 and 2 cohorts, FDA will \n     expedite review of Paragraph IV applications that are \n     submitted on the first day that any valid Paragraph IV \n     application for the drug in question is submitted.\n       Facility--means business or other entity under one \n     management either direct or indirect and at one geographic \n     location or address engaged in manufacturing or processing an \n     active pharmaceutical ingredient or a finished dosage form, \n     but does not include a business or other entity whose only \n     manufacturing or processing activities are one or more of the \n     following: repackaging, relabeling, or testing. For purposes \n     of this definition, separate buildings within close proximity \n     are considered to be at one geographic location or address if \n     the activities in them are closely related to the same \n     business enterprise, under the supervision of the same local \n     management, and are capable of being inspected by the Food \n     and Drug Administration during a single inspection.\n       Finished Dosage Form--means (A) a drug product in the form \n     in which it will be administered to a patient, such as a \n     tablet, capsule, solution, or topical application; (B) a drug \n     product in a form in which reconstitution is necessary prior \n     to administration to a patient, such as oral suspensions or \n     lyophilized powders; or (C) any combination of an active \n     pharmaceutical ingredient, as defined in paragraph (m)(2), \n     with another component of a drug product for purposes of \n     production of such a drug product.\n       First major deficiency application--means an ANDA which has \n     been issued its first complete response letter classified as \n     having major deficiency(ies).\n       Generic Drug Program--refers to all agency activities \n     related to the determination of approvability of an ANDA.\n       Major and minor amendments--All references to ``major'' and \n     ``minor'' amendments in this goals letter are intended to \n     refer to the distinctions that FDA described in its Guidance \n     for Industry: Major, Minor, Telephone Amendments to \n     Abbreviated New Drug Applications. See http://www.fda.gov/\ndownloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/\nGuidances/ucm072888.pdf\n       Parity--in reference to inspections, as between foreign and \n     domestic facilities, means inspection at an equal frequency \n     plus or minus 20 percent with comparable depth and rigor of \n     inspection.\n       Refuse to receive--means refusal to file an application. \n     See 21 CFR 314.101 and http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/\nGuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/\nUCM080561.pdf1993\n       Solicited amendment--an amendment submitted in response to \n     a Complete Response letter.\n       Submission date--is the date an ANDA, ANDA amendment, ANDA \n     supplement, or Type II active pharmaceutical drug master file \n     arrives in the appropriate electronic portal of the FDA.\n       Prior Approval Supplements--A prior approval supplement is \n     a submission to allow a company to make a change in a product \n     that already has an approved ANDA. CDER must approve all \n     important ANDA changes (in packaging or ingredients, for \n     instance) to ensure the conditions originally set for the \n     product are still met. (Source: http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/\nInformationOnDrugs/ucm079436.htm#S)\n       Unsolicited amendment--an amendment with information not \n     requested by the FDA except for those unsolicited amendments \n     considered routine or administrative in nature and that do \n     not require scientific review (e.g., requests for final ANDA \n     approval, patent amendments, general correspondence, and USP \n     monograph updates).\n\n\n                    FY 2013 Regulatory Science Plan\n\n       Topic 1: Bioequivalence of local acting orally inhaled drug \n     products\n       Impact: Continue to develop new and improved PD endpoints \n     and study designs or establishment of alternative approaches \n     to ensure equivalent local delivery of orally inhaled drug \n     product to the lung would lead to more efficient development \n     of generic products in a sector that lacks any generic \n     competition\n       Topic 2: Bioequivalence of local acting topical \n     dermatological drug products\n       Impact: Continue developing new bioequivalence methods in \n     order to reduce the need for relatively insensitive clinical \n     endpoint bioequivalence studies. Development of in vitro \n     release tests or other product characterization to ensure \n     consistent drug release or product performance\n       Topic 3: Bioequivalence of local acting gastro-intestinal \n     drug products\n       Impact: Developing new bioequivalence methods for direct \n     measurement of drug concentrations in the GI tract and \n     establishing better correlations between pharmacokinetic \n     measurements and GI concentration would allow more efficient \n     demonstration of bioequivalence than by clinical endpoint \n     studies.\n       Topic 4: Quality by design of generic drug products\n       Impact: Continue developing science-based recommendations \n     for product development, raw material, APIs and process \n     controls, and life-cycle management of complex dosage forms \n     (e.g. orally inhaled drug products and modified-release \n     dosage forms)\n       Topic 5: Modeling and simulation\n       Impact: Modeling and simulation (including in-vitro and in-\n     vivo correlations) is essential to efficient implementation \n     of quality by design and can help to identify and eliminate \n     unneeded in-vitro and/or in-vivo studies. Models (PK/PD, \n     exposure-response, clinical use simulation) support generic \n     drug evaluation policies especially for NTI drugs and complex \n     products.\n\n[[Page S8293]]\n\n       Topic 6: Pharmacokinetic studies and evaluation of anti-\n     epileptic drugs\n       Impact: Improving public confidence in bioequivalent \n     generic epilepsy drugs.\n       Topic 7: Excipient effects on permeability and absorption \n     of BCS Class 3 Drugs\n       Impact: Extension of biowaivers to BCS Class 3 Drugs and \n     eliminating the need for unnecessary in vivo bioequivalence \n     studies\n       Topic 8: Product- and patient-related factors affecting \n     switchability of drug-device combination products (e.g., \n     orally inhaled and nasal drug products and injection drug \n     products)\n       Impact: Establishing a systematic, science- and risk-based \n     approach to ensure device switchability, and improving the \n     patient's compliance and acceptability of generic devices\n       Topic 9: Postmarketing surveillance of generic drug usage \n     patterns and adverse events.\n       Impact: Improved data collection about usage patterns \n     (which strengths are used in which populations, extent of \n     switchability, back switches to RLD products, medication \n     errors) will be fed back into regulatory policy development \n     including those for excipients and impurities. Baseline data \n     collection on adverse event reports on switching to an \n     authorized generic would improve the ability to investigate \n     reports.\n       Topic 10: Evaluation of drug product physical attributes on \n     patient acceptability\n       Impact: Laboratory and human studies on physical attributes \n     such as tablet size, shape, coating, odor perception \n     (residual solvents), score configuration, taste masking or \n     color on the ability of patient to use (for example swallow) \n     or perceive quality (for example smell) will allow OGD to \n     provide better guidance to applicants on how these physical \n     attributes should be controlled and compared to the RLD.\n       Topic 11: Postmarking assessment of generic drugs and their \n     brand-name counterparts\n       Impact: Stronger public confidence in generic drugs because \n     of pro-active responses to product concerns. An integrated \n     response to product concerns involving laboratory \n     investigations and post-marketing data collection.\n       Topic 12: Physicochemical characterization of complex drug \n     substances\n       Impact: Developing analytical methods for demonstrating \n     pharmaceutical equivalence for complex drug substances (non-\n     small molecules) characterized by natural source origin, \n     polydisperse mixture, and/or supramolecular structure, and \n     therefore expanding the boundary of the generic drug program \n     for these complex drug products\n       Topic 13: Develop a risk-based understanding of potential \n     adverse impacts to drug product quality resulting from \n     changes in API manufacturing and controls.\n       Impact: The ability to predict the potential impacts of \n     manufacturing changes on product quality will allow \n     manufacturers to target assessments and controls on high-risk \n     areas for regulators to focus their reviews on these areas \n     too.\n\n    FY 2014 Regulatory Science Preliminary Topics for Consideration\n\n       In addition to those topics to be identified by the Working \n     Group described in section 3.A of this letter, topics will \n     include recommendations for draft guidances to clarify FDA \n     recommendations with regard to complex product development \n     and to help limit deficiencies in applications.\n\n   BIOSIMILAR BIOLOGICAL PRODUCT AUTHORIZATION PERFORMANCE GOALS AND \n             PROCEDURES FOR FISCAL YEARS 2013 THROUGH 2017\n\n       FDA proposes the following goals contingent on the \n     allocation of resources for each of the fiscal years 2013-\n     2017 of at least the inflation-adjusted value of $20 million \n     in non-user fee funds, plus collections of biosimilar user \n     fees, to support the process for the review of biosimilar \n     biological applications.\n\n\n                      I.

FIRST CYCLE REVIEW PERFORMANCE\n\n     A. Notification of Issues Identified during the Filing Review\n       1. Performance Goal: For original biosimilar biological \n     product applications and supplements with clinical data, FDA \n     will report substantive review issues identified during the \n     initial filing review to the applicant by letter, \n     teleconference, facsimile, secure e-mail, or other expedient \n     means.\n       2. The timeline for such communication will be within 74 \n     calendar days from the date of FDA receipt of the original \n     submission.\n       3. If no substantive review issues were identified during \n     the filing review, FDA will so notify the applicant.\n       4. FDA's filing review represents a preliminary review of \n     the application and is not indicative of deficiencies that \n     may be identified later in the review cycle.\n       5. FDA will notify the applicant of substantive review \n     issues prior to the goal date for 90% of applications.\n     B. Notification of Planned Review Timelines\n       1. Performance Goal: For original biosimilar biological \n     product applications and supplements with clinical data, FDA \n     will inform the applicant of the planned timeline for review \n     of the application. The information conveyed will include a \n     target date for communication of feedback from the review \n     division to the applicant regarding proposed labeling, \n     postmarketing requirements, and postmarketing commitments the \n     Agency will be requesting.\n       2. The planned review timeline will be included with the \n     notification of issues identified during the filing review, \n     within 74 calendar days from the date of FDA receipt of the \n     original submission.\n       3. The planned review timelines will be consistent with the \n     Guidance for Review Staff and Industry: Good Review \n     Management Principles and Practices for PDUFA Products \n     (GRMPs), taking into consideration the specific circumstances \n     surrounding the individual biosimilar biological product \n     application.\n       4. The planned review timeline will be based on the \n     application as submitted.\n       5. FDA will inform the applicant of the planned review \n     timeline for 90% of all applications and supplements with \n     clinical data.\n       6. In the event FDA determines that significant \n     deficiencies in the application preclude discussion of \n     labeling, postmarketing requirements, or postmarketing \n     commitments by the target date identified in the planned \n     review timeline (e.g., failure to demonstrate a biosimilar \n     biological product is highly similar to the reference \n     product, significant safety concern(s), need for a new \n     study(ies) or extensive re-analyses of existing data before \n     approval), FDA will communicate this determination to the \n     applicant in accordance with GRMPs and no later than the \n     target date. In such cases the planned review timeline will \n     be considered to have been met. Communication of FDA's \n     determination may occur by letter, teleconference, facsimile, \n     secure e-mail, or other expedient means.\n       7. To help expedite the development of biosimilar \n     biological products, communication\n\n[[Page S8294]]\n\n     of the deficiencies identified in the application will \n     generally occur through issuance of a discipline review (DR) \n     letter(s) in advance of the planned target date for \n     initiation of discussions regarding labeling, postmarketing \n     requirements, and postmarketing commitments the Agency may \n     request.\n       8. If the applicant submits a major amendment(s) (refer to \n     Section VIII.B for additional information on major \n     amendments) and the review division chooses to review such \n     amendment(s) during that review cycle, the planned review \n     timeline initially communicated (under Section II.B.1 and 2) \n     will generally no longer be applicable. Consistent with the \n     underlying principles articulated in the GRMP guidance, FDA's \n     decision to extend the review clock should, except in rare \n     circumstances, be limited to occasions where review of the \n     new information could address outstanding deficiencies in the \n     application and lead to approval in the current review cycle.\n       If the review division determines that the major amendment \n     will result in an extension of the biosimilar biological \n     product review clock, the review division will communicate to \n     the applicant at the time of the clock extension a new \n     planned review timeline, including a new review timeline for \n     communication of feedback on proposed labeling, postmarketing \n     requirements, and any postmarketing commitments the Agency \n     may request.\n       In the rare case where the review division determines that \n     the major amendment will not result in an extension of the \n     biosimilar biological product review clock, the review \n     division may choose to retain the previously communicated \n     planned review timeline or may communicate a new planned \n     review timeline to the applicant.\n       The division will notify the applicant promptly of its \n     decision regarding review of the major amendment(s) and \n     whether the planned review timeline is still applicable.\n\n\n      III. REVIEW OF PROPRIETARY NAMES TO REDUCE MEDICATION ERRORS\n\n       To enhance patient safety, FDA will utilize user fees to \n     implement various measures to reduce medication errors \n     related to look-alike and sound-alike proprietary names and \n     such factors as unclear label abbreviations, acronyms, dose \n     designations, and error prone label and packaging design.\n     A. Review Performance Goals--Biosimilar Biological Product \n         Proprietary Names\n       1. Proprietary names submitted during the biosimilar \n     biological product development (BPD) phase\n       a) Review 90% of proprietary name submissions filed within \n     180 days of receipt. Notify sponsor of tentative acceptance \n     or non-acceptance.\n       b) If the proprietary name is found to be unacceptable, the \n     sponsor can request reconsideration by submitting a written \n     rebuttal with supporting data or request a meeting within 60 \n     days to discuss the initial decision (meeting package \n     required).\n       c) If the proprietary name is found to be unacceptable, the \n     above review performance goals also would apply to the \n     written request for reconsideration with supporting data or \n     the submission of a new proprietary name.\n       d) A complete submission is required to begin the review \n     clock.\n       2. Proprietary names submitted with biosimilar biological \n     product application\n       a) Review 90% of biosimilar biological product application \n     proprietary name submissions filed within 90 days of receipt. \n     Notify sponsor of tentative acceptance/non-acceptance.\n       b) A supplemental review will be done meeting the above \n     review performance goals if the proprietary name has been \n     submitted previously (during the BPD phase) and has received \n     tentative acceptance.\n       c) If the proprietary name is found to be unacceptable, the \n     sponsor can request reconsideration by submitting a written \n     rebuttal with supporting data or request a meeting within 60 \n     days to discuss the initial decision (meeting package \n     required).\n       d) If the proprietary name is found to be unacceptable, the \n     above review performance goals apply to the written request \n     for reconsideration with supporting data or the submission of \n     a new proprietary name.\n       e) A complete submission is required to begin the review \n     clock.\n\n\n                      iv. major dispute resolution\n\n       A. Procedure: For procedural or scientific matters \n     involving the review of biosimilar biological product \n     applications and supplements (as defined in BsUFA) that \n     cannot be resolved at the signatory authority level \n     (including a request for reconsideration by the signatory \n     authority after reviewing any materials that are planned to \n     be forwarded with an appeal to the next level), the response \n     to appeals of decisions will occur within 30 calendar days of \n     the Center's receipt of the written appeal.\n       B. Performance goal: 90% of such answers are provided \n     within 30 calendar days of the Center's receipt of the \n     written appeal.\n       C. Conditions:\n       1. Sponsors should first try to resolve the procedural or \n     scientific issue at the signatory authority level. If it \n     cannot be resolved at that level, it should be appealed to \n     the next higher organizational level (with a copy to the \n     signatory authority) and then, if necessary, to the next \n     higher organizational level.\n       2. Responses should be either verbal (followed by a written \n     confirmation within 14 calendar days of the verbal \n     notification) or written and should ordinarily be to either \n     grant or deny the appeal.\n       3. If the decision is to deny the appeal, the response \n     should include reasons for the denial and any actions the \n     sponsor might take to persuade the Agency to reverse its \n     decision.\n       4. In some cases, further data or further input from others \n     might be needed to reach a decision on the appeal. In these \n     cases, the ``response'' should be the plan for obtaining that \n     information (e.g., requesting further information from the \n     sponsor, scheduling a meeting with the sponsor, scheduling \n     the issue for discussion at the next scheduled available \n     advisory committee).\n       5. In these cases, once the required information is \n     received by the Agency (including any advice from an advisory \n     committee), the person to whom the appeal was made, again has \n     30 calendar days from the receipt of the required information \n     in which to either deny or grant the appeal.\n       6. Again, if the decision is to deny the appeal, the \n     response should include the reasons for the denial and any \n     actions the sponsor might take to persuade the Agency to \n     reverse its decision.\n       7. Note: If the Agency decides to present the issue to an \n     advisory committee and there are not 30 days before the next \n     scheduled advisory committee, the issue will be presented at \n     the following scheduled committee meeting to allow \n     conformance with advisory committee administrative \n     procedures.\n\n\n                           v. clinical holds\n\n       A. Procedure: The Center should respond to a sponsor's \n     complete response to a clinical hold within 30 days of the \n     Agency's receipt of the submission of such sponsor response.\n       B. Performance goal: 90% of such responses are provided \n     within 30 calendar days of the Agency's receipt of the \n     sponsor's response.\n\n\n         VI. SPECIAL PROTOCOL QUESTION ASSESSMENT AND AGREEMENT\n\n       A. Procedure: Upon specific request by a sponsor (including \n     specific questions that the sponsor desires to be answered), \n     the Agency will evaluate certain protocols and related issues \n     to assess whether the design is adequate to meet scientific \n     and regulatory requirements identified by the sponsor.\n       1. The sponsor should submit a limited number of specific \n     questions about the protocol design and scientific and \n     regulatory requirements for which the sponsor seeks agreement \n     (e.g., are the clinical endpoints adequate to assess whether \n     there are clinically meaningful differences between the \n     proposed biosimilar biological product and the reference \n     product).\n       2. Within 45 days of Agency receipt of the protocol and \n     specific questions, the Agency will provide a written \n     response to the sponsor that includes a succinct assessment \n     of the protocol and answers to the questions posed by the \n     sponsor. If the Agency does not agree that the protocol \n     design, execution plans, and data analyses are adequate to \n     achieve the goals of the sponsor, the reasons for the \n     disagreement will be explained in the response.\n       3. Protocols that qualify for this program include any \n     necessary clinical study or studies to prove biosimilarity \n     and/or interchangeability (e.g., protocols for comparative \n     clinical trials that will form the primary basis for \n     demonstrating that there are no clinically meaningful \n     differences between the proposed biosimilar biological \n     product and the reference product, and protocols for clinical \n     trials intended to support a demonstration of \n     interchangeability). For such protocols to qualify for this \n     comprehensive protocol assessment, the sponsor must have had \n     a BPD Type 2 or 3 Meeting, as defined in section VIII (F and \n     G), below, with the review division so that the division is \n     aware of the developmental context in which the protocol is \n     being reviewed and the questions being answered.\n       4. If a protocol is reviewed under the process outlined \n     above, and agreement with the Agency is reached on design, \n     execution, and analyses, and if the results of the trial \n     conducted under the protocol substantiate the hypothesis of \n     the protocol, the Agency agrees that the data from the \n     protocol can be used as part of the primary basis for \n     approval of the product. The fundamental agreement here is \n     that having agreed to the design, execution, and analyses \n     proposed in protocols reviewed under this process, the Agency \n     will not later alter its perspective on the issues of design, \n     execution, or analyses unless public health concerns \n     unrecognized at the time of protocol assessment under this \n     process are evident.\n       B. Performance goal:\n       For FY 2013, 70% of special protocols assessments and \n     agreement requests completed and returned to sponsor within \n     timeframes.\n       For FY 2014, 70% of special protocols assessments and \n     agreement requests completed and returned to sponsor within \n     timeframes.\n       For FY 2015, 80% of special protocols assessments and \n     agreement requests completed and returned to sponsor within \n     timeframes.\n       For FY 2016, 85% of special protocols assessments and \n     agreement requests completed and returned to sponsor within \n     timeframes.\n       For FY 2017, 90% of special protocols assessments and \n     agreement requests completed and returned to sponsor within \n     timeframes.\n       C. Reporting: The Agency will track and report the number \n     of original special protocol assessments and resubmissions \n     per original special protocol assessment.\n\n[[Page S8295]]\n\n                     VII. MEETING MANAGEMENT GOALS\n\n     A. Responses to Meeting Requests\n       1. Procedure: Within 14 calendar days of the Agency's \n     receipt of a request and meeting package from industry for a \n     BPD Type 1 Meeting, or within 21 calendar days of the \n     Agency's receipt of a request and meeting package from \n     industry for a Biosimilar Initial Advisory Meeting or a BPD \n     Type 2, 3, or 4 Meeting, as defined in section VIII(D-H), \n     below, CBER and CDER should notify the requester in writing \n     of the date, time, place, and format (i.e., a scheduled face-\n     to-face, teleconference, or videoconference) for the meeting, \n     as well as expected Center participants.\n       2. Performance Goal: FDA will provide this notification \n     within 14 days for 90 percent of BPD Type 1 Meeting requests \n     and within 21 days for 90 percent of Biosimilar Initial \n     Advisory Meeting and BPD Type 2, 3 and 4 Meeting requests.\n     B. Scheduling Meetings\n       1. Procedure: The meeting date should reflect the next \n     available date on which all applicable Center personnel are \n     available to attend, consistent with the component's other \n     business; however, the meeting should be scheduled consistent \n     with the type of meeting requested.\n       a) Biosimilar Initial Advisory Meeting should occur within \n     90 calendar days of the Agency receipt of the sponsor-\n     submitted meeting request and meeting package.\n       b) BPD Type 1 Meetings should occur within 30 calendar days \n     of the Agency receipt of the sponsor-submitted meeting \n     request and meeting package.\n       c) BPD Type 2 Meetings should occur within 75 calendar days \n     of the Agency receipt of the sponsor-submitted meeting \n     request and meeting package.\n       d) BPD Type 3 Meetings should occur within 120 calendar \n     days of the Agency receipt of the sponsor-submitted meeting \n     request and meeting package.\n       e) BPD Type 4 Meetings should occur within 60 calendar days \n     of the Agency receipt of the sponsor-submitted meeting \n     request and meeting package.\n       2. Performance goal:\n       For FY 2013, 70% of Biosimilar Initial Advisory Meetings \n     and BPD Type 1-4 Meetings are held within the timeframe.\n       For FY 2014, 70% of Biosimilar Initial Advisory Meetings \n     and BPD Type 1-4 Meetings are held within the timeframe.\n       For FY 2015, 80% of Biosimilar Initial Advisory Meetings \n     and BPD Type 1-4 Meetings are held within the timeframe.\n       For FY 2016, 85% of Biosimilar Initial Advisory Meetings \n     and BPD Type 1-4 Meetings are held within the timeframe.\n       For FY 2017, 90% of Biosimilar Initial Advisory Meetings \n     and BPD Type 1-4 Meetings are held within the timeframe.\n     C. Meeting Minutes\n       1. Procedure: The Agency will prepare minutes which will be \n     available to the sponsor 30 calendar days after the meeting. \n     The minutes will clearly outline the important agreements, \n     disagreements, issues for further discussion, and action \n     items from the meeting in bulleted form and need not be in \n     great detail.\n       2. Performance Goal: FDA will provide meeting minutes \n     within 30 days of the date of the meeting for 90 percent of \n     Biosimilar Initial Advisory Meetings and BPD Type 1-4 \n     Meetings.\n     D. Conditions\n       For a meeting to qualify for these performance goals:\n       1. A written request (letter or fax) and supporting \n     documentation (i.e., the meeting package) should be submitted \n     to the appropriate review division or office. The request \n     should provide:\n       a) A brief statement of the purpose of the meeting, the \n     sponsor's proposal for the type of meeting, and the sponsor's \n     proposal for a face-to-face meeting or a teleconference;\n       b) A listing of the specific objectives/outcomes the \n     requester expects from the meeting;\n       c) A proposed agenda, including estimated times needed for \n     each agenda item;\n       d) A list of questions, grouped by discipline. For each \n     question there should be a brief explanation of the context \n     and purpose of the question.\n       e) A listing of planned external attendees; and\n       f) A listing of requested participants/disciplines \n     representative(s) from the Center.\n       g) Suggested dates and times (e.g., morning or afternoon) \n     for the meeting that are within or beyond the appropriate \n     time frame of the meeting type being requested.\n       2. The Agency concurs that the meeting will serve a useful \n     purpose (i.e., it is not premature or clearly unnecessary). \n     However, requests for BPD Type 2, 3 and 4 Meetings will be \n     honored except in the most unusual circumstances.\n       The Center may determine that a different type of meeting \n     is more appropriate and it may grant a meeting of a different \n     type than requested, which may require the payment of a \n     biosimilar biological product development fee as described in \n     section 744B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \n     before the meeting will be provided. If a biosimilar \n     biological product development fee is required under section \n     744B, and the sponsor does not pay the fee within the time \n     frame required under section 744B, the meeting will be \n     cancelled. If the sponsor pays the biosimilar biological \n     product development fee after the meeting has been cancelled \n     due to non-payment, the time frame described in section \n     VII.A.1 will be calculated from the date on which FDA \n     received the payment, not the date on which the sponsor \n     originally submitted the meeting request.\n       Sponsors are encouraged to consult FDA to obtain further \n     information on recommended meeting procedures.\n       3. FDA will develop and publish for comment draft guidance \n     on Biosimilar Initial Advisory Meetings and BPD Type 1-4 \n     Meetings by end of second quarter of FY 2014.\n\n\n               VIII. DEFINITIONS AND EXPLANATION OF TERMS\n\n       A. The term ``review and act on'' means the issuance of a \n     complete action letter after the complete review of a filed \n     complete application. The action letter, if it is not an \n     approval, will set forth in detail the specific deficiencies \n     and, where appropriate, the actions necessary to place the \n     application in condition for approval.\n       B. Goal Date Extensions for Major Amendments\n       1. A major amendment to an original application, supplement \n     with clinical data, or resubmission of any of these \n     applications, submitted at any time during the review cycle, \n     may extend the goal date by three months.\n       2. A major amendment may include, for example, a major new \n     clinical safety/efficacy study report; major re-analysis of \n     previously submitted study(ies); submission of a risk \n     evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) with elements to \n     assure safe use (ETASU) not included in the original \n     application; or significant amendment to a previously \n     submitted REMS with ETASU. Generally, changes to REMS that do \n     not include ETASU and minor changes to REMS with ETASU will \n     not be considered major amendments.\n       3. A major amendment to a manufacturing supplement \n     submitted at any time during the review cycle may extend the \n     goal date by two months.\n       4. Only one extension can be given per review cycle.\n       5. Consistent with the underlying principles articulated in \n     the GRMP guidance, FDA's decision to extend the review clock \n     should, except in rare circumstances, be limited to occasions \n     where review of the new information could address outstanding \n     deficiencies in the application and lead to approval in the \n     current review cycle.\n       C. A resubmitted original application is a complete \n     response to an action letter addressing all identified \n     deficiencies.\n       D. A Biosimilar Initial Advisory Meeting is an initial \n     assessment limited to a general discussion regarding whether \n     licensure under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service \n     Act may be feasible for a particular product, and, if so, \n     general advice on the expected content of the development \n     program. Such term does not include any meeting that involves \n     substantive review of summary data or full study reports.\n       E. A BPD Type 1 Meeting is a meeting which is necessary for \n     an otherwise stalled drug development program to proceed \n     (e.g. meeting to discuss clinical holds, dispute resolution \n     meeting), a special protocol assessment meeting, or a meeting \n     to address an important safety issue.\n       F. A BPD Type 2 Meeting is a meeting to discuss a specific \n     issue (e.g., proposed study design or endpoints) or questions \n     where FDA will provide targeted advice regarding an ongoing \n     biosimilar biological product development program. Such term \n     includes substantive review of summary data, but does not \n     include review of full study reports.\n       G. A BPD Type 3 Meeting is an in depth data review and \n     advice meeting regarding an ongoing biosimilar biological \n     product development program. Such term includes substantive \n     review of full study reports, FDA advice regarding the \n     similarity between the proposed biosimilar biological product \n     and the reference product, and FDA advice regarding \n     additional studies, including design and analysis.\n       H. A BPD Type 4 Meeting is a meeting to discuss the format \n     and content of a biosimilar biological product application or \n     supplement submitted under 351(k) of the PHS Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/20/senate-section/article/S8295-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8295-S8296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have been saying for weeks and months \nthat we are overdue to pass into law the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against \nWomen Reauthorization Act, which the Senate approved in April with 68 \nbipartisan votes. I am disappointed that the House still has not picked \nup this bipartisan effort and that we are not getting the job done this \nyear. I want everyone to know that I will be back next year, and we \nwill get it done.\n  Just yesterday we were reminded again why this legislation is so \nimportant. In Colorado, a man just released from jail on domestic \nviolence charges shot his way into a house, murdering his ex-\ngirlfriend, and her sister, and her sister's husband, before killing \nhimself. We have seen enough horrific violence. It is past time to act.\n  The Leahy-Crapo bill would support the use of techniques proven to \nhelp identify high-risk cases and prevent domestic violence homicides. \nIt will help\n\n[[Page S8296]]\n\nus go further to prevent domestic and sexual violence and to provide \nservices and support to all victims.\n  For several weeks, I have been advocating a compromise on a key \nprovision aimed at addressing the epidemic of domestic violence against \nnative women. I want to compliment my partner on this bill, Senator \nCrapo, who has been working hard to try to bridge the divide and \naddress concerns with the provision in our bill that gives limited \njurisdiction to tribal courts to make sure that no perpetrators of \ndomestic violence are immune from prosecution. Senator Crapo has pushed \nhard and has indicated a willingness to compromise significantly, as \nhave I. Sadly, others have continued to draw lines which would \nultimately deny assistance to some of the most vulnerable victims. That \nis unacceptable.\n  I appreciate that there have at last been some renewed discussions \nabout this bill in the House of Representatives but that is not enough. \nThe only way to reauthorize VAWA this year is for the House to take up \nand pass the Senate-passed bill. If the House Republican leadership \nrefuses to do that in the final days of this Congress, it is a shame.\n  I remain steadfast in my resolve to get this done and pass a good \nVAWA bill that protects all victims. I know Senator Crapo shares my \nresolve. I know every woman in the Senate and many other Senators and \nHouse members share our resolve. I know President Obama and Vice \nPresident Biden share our resolve.\n  We will be back next year. We will introduce a good bill, and we will \npass it through the Senate. We will continue our discussions, and we \nwill work tirelessly to have a good bill enacted into law. This is not \nthe end of our efforts to renew and improve VAWA to more effectively \nhelp all victims of domestic and sexual violence.\n  We know that the epidemic of violence against native women is \nappalling, with a recent study finding that almost three in five native \nwomen have been assaulted by their spouses or intimate partners. We \nknow that immigrant women are particularly vulnerable, with their \nimmigration status another weapon that abusers can use to keep power \nand prevent reporting. We know that some victims cannot access needed \nservices because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. We \nknow that women and girls on college campuses are too much at risk, and \nmore must be done to protect them. The list goes on.\n  We have shown a willingness to compromise but we must make progress \non all of these issues. We must make things better, and never make \nthings worse, for the most vulnerable of victims.\n  The community of advocates and service providers who work every day \nwith victims of these terrible crimes is inspiring. It was their advice \non the real needs of real victims that shaped this legislation, and \nthey have fought with us every day to get this bill enacted. I want \nthem to know how much I value the work they do and that I will not \nabandon their cause. We will continue working together, and we will \nreauthorize VAWA.\n  We have seen enough violence. If we cannot get the Leahy-Crapo bill \nover the finish line this year, we will come back next year, and we \nwill get it done.

Mr. President, as Congress continues its work \naddressing our Nation's looming fiscal crisis, we must also remember \nthat we have a responsibility to our taxpayers to improve outcomes for \nyoung people and their families by driving Federal funds more \nefficiently toward evidence-based, results-oriented solutions.\n  In August, I shared promising news from my home State, where \nevidence-based Federal programs, including the Social Innovation Fund, \nthe Investing in Innovation Fund, and the High Quality Charter Schools \nReplication and Expansion Program, are improving education and other \nimportant outcomes for thousands of young people throughout Louisiana.\n  Bipartisan support for investing in what works has been growing for \ndecades.\n  Under the George W. Bush administration, the Office of Management and \nBudget put a priority on improving the performance of Federal programs \nand encouraged more rigorous evaluations to assess their effectiveness.\n  In 2010, the Simpson-Bowles Commission Report, the ``National \nCommission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform,'' specifically \nrecommended urging all Federal agency heads to ``identify ways to shift \nfrom inefficient, unproductive spending to productive, results-based \ninvestment.''\n  And in May of this year, the Office of Management and Budget, OMB, \ninstructed all Federal departments and agencies to demonstrate the use \nof evidence throughout their fiscal year 2014 budget submissions.\n  At a time when America is facing enormous social and economic shifts, \nbudget constraints at all levels of government, significant demographic \nchanges, and an increasingly globally competitive, changing workforce, \nour Federal Government must continue to drive public resources toward \nevidence-based, results-driven solutions that work.\n  I believe the following principles can serve as the foundation of an \n``invest in what works'' agenda: develop and use a common evidence \nframework to inform program design and management; use evidence, data \nand information about performance to inform policy and drive continuous \nimprovement in Federal programs and grantee interventions; promote \ninnovation and flexibility and focus on outcomes rather than simply on \ncompliance; increasingly target investments in interventions with the \nstrongest evidence of effectiveness, as well as support the development \nand rigorous evaluation of promising, innovative interventions; and, \nseek opportunities to promote and invest in systems and communities \nthat are collaborating to achieve significant community-wide impact or \nchange at scale.\n  I would encourage the administration to incorporate these principles \nin its fiscal year 2014 budget request, and to consider reserving 1 \npercent of Federal program funds for independent, third-party \nevaluations. These recommendations, which are consistent with the 2010 \nSimpson-Bowles report and the 2012 OMB memo on evidence and evaluation, \nwould provide Members of Congress with reliable information to gauge \nprogram effectiveness and drive continuous improvement.\n  In pursuing this approach, we should remain steadfastly focused on \nequity and serving children and families in greatest need. Done right, \nan ``invest in what works'' framework can advance an equity agenda. \nCompetitive grants can augment and help maximize the impact of \nimportant formula funding. When designing such policies, we must \nprioritize grantees serving children and families most in need and \nleverage lessons learned to improve the impact of larger scale \nprograms. Moreover, the Federal Government should make technical \nassistance a priority to potentially high-impact grantees--including \nrural grantees--that have less expertise in preparing Federal grant \napplications.\n  I am fully committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to help improve outcomes for young people and their families \nthrough the development and implementation of an agenda that invests in \nwhat works.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/20/senate-section/article/S8296-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8296-S8297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT TRAGEDY\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to \nexpress my deepest sympathy to the families of the 28 people who were \nmurdered last week at Sandy Hook Elementary. These last few days have \nbeen immensely painful as our nation has mourned the loss of life and \ndesperately searched for answers that might somehow explain such a \nsenseless act of violence.\n  Like all Americans, my thoughts and prayers have been and continue to \nbe with the students, teachers, and families. But my heart especially \ngoes out to those mothers and fathers who lost their children. As a \nmother, I cannot even begin to fathom the depth of their anguish.\n  The murder of a child is the most heinous of crimes. But the mass \nmurder of 20 children trapped in an elementary school is an act of \nunspeakable\n\n[[Page S8297]]\n\nevil. There are simply no words to describe the shock, horror, and \ngrief. There is nothing we can say to undo the horrific events of that \nday or to numb the wounds of the families who are grieving. The best we \ncan hope for is that our words and prayers might somehow bring them \ncomfort and to show them they are not alone in their sorrow.\n  At moments like these, the weight of despair falls heavy upon us. But \nwe cannot forget that, even amidst the horror and sadness, there have \nbeen remarkable acts of decency. And for that, we have hope.\n  I think of the brave law enforcement officers and first responders \nwho answered the call to serve and protect that day, just as they do \nevery day. I think of the incredible outpouring of support we have seen \nfrom people across the country, most of whom have never met the victims \nor their families but have come forward anyway with checks, with \nflowers, with stuffed animals, and messages of sympathy. And of course, \nI think of those heroic teachers who risked, and in some cases gave \ntheir lives to save their students.\n  We will always remember the names and faces of people like Dawn \nHochsprung and Mary Sherlach, the principal and school psychologist who \ndied trying to disarm and dissuade gunman. They didn't think twice. \nThey did what they knew was right.\n  And we will always remember 27-year-old Victoria Soto, the teacher \nwho hid her students in closets and cabinets before bravely approaching \nthe gunman and pointing him in the other direction. She had her whole \nlife ahead of her, but she laid it down to save those kids.\n  These are the stories that keep us going. They remind us that, even \nin the wake of senseless violence, no individual act of evil can match \nthe overwhelming goodness of our people. We are a resilient and \nfundamentally decent country, and my hope is that in the coming weeks \nand months we will find a way to come together to ease the pain of the \nfamilies and to make some sense out of this tragedy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/20/senate-section/article/S8297-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8297-S8298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL ALEXANDER\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the nearly \nquarter of a century of public service of my friend and the staff \ndirector of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, \nMichael L. Alexander.\n  Mike will be leaving his position when this Congress adjourns. And he \nwill leave quite a legacy.\n  Thomas Jefferson once asked the question: ``What duty does a citizen \nowe to the government that secures the society in which he lives?'' \nAnswering his own question, Jefferson said: ``A nation that rests on \nthe will of the people must also depend on individuals to support its \ninstitutions if it is to flourish. Persons qualified for public service \nshould feel an obligation to make that contribution.''\n  Mike answered that call in a way that would have made Jefferson \nproud.\n  Mike joined what was then the Governmental Affairs Committee as a \nstaff member for the minority side in April 2001 and was a leader in \nnegotiating and drafting the legislation that created the Department of \nHomeland Security and later the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \nPrevention Act.\n  In recognition of his hard work and proven leadership abilities, I \npromoted Mike to the position of staff director in May 2006. Under his \ndirection, the committee, through legislation and investigation, took \non some of the great challenges of our time.\n  After Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast in August 2005, \nclaiming more than 1,800 lives, the committee launched a major \ninvestigation into how American government at all levels failed so \ndramatically to safeguard its citizens from a predicted storm. Over the \ncourse of the investigation, the committee held 22 hearings, \ninterviewed, 345 witnesses, and reviewed over 800,000 documents. The, \n``Hurricane Katrina: A Nation Still Unprepared,'' was the most \ncomprehensive evaluation of the Katrina catastrophe.\n  In 2007, the committee began a series of 14 hearings examining the \nroot causes of violent domestic radicalization, the tactics and \nmeasures used by U.S. law enforcement at every level to prevent and \ndeter homegrown terrorism, the role of the Internet in self \nradicalization, and the threat of homegrown terrorism to military \npersonnel.\n  In May 2008, the committee issued a bipartisan staff report detailing \nthe results of its investigation entitled, ``Violent Islamist \nExtremism, The Internet, and the Homegrown Terrorist Threat.'' The \nreport concluded that: ``No longer is the threat just from abroad, as \nwas the case with the attacks of September 11, 2001; the threat is now \nincreasingly from within, from homegrown terrorists who are inspired by \nviolent Islamist ideology to plan and execute attacks where they live. \nOne of the primary drivers of this new threat is the use of the \nInternet to enlist individuals or groups of individuals to join the \ncause without ever affiliating with a terrorist organization.''\n  Following the murders at Fort Hood on Nov. 5, 2009, when Maj. Nidal \nHasan--a psychiatrist trained by the U.S. Army at taxpayer expense \nentered the Soldier Readiness Processing Center with two loaded pistols \nand opened fire, killing 13 and wounding 32, the committee launched a \n14-month investigation into what happened and why.\n  The report that followed the investigation--``A Ticking Time Bomb: \nCounterterrorism Lessons from the U.S. Government's Failure to Prevent \nthe Fort Hood Attack''--detailed flawed practices and communications, \nboth within and between the FBI and Department of Defense, that allowed \nHasan to remain in the military--and even be promoted--despite many \nwarning signs that he was becoming dangerous.\n  Besides the investigations, here are just a few of the successful \npieces of legislation that were passed out of the committee and enacted \ninto law on Mike's watch: The ``Post-Katrina Emergency Management \nReform Act of 2006,'' which remade and strengthened the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency after the failures in responding to \nHurricane Katrina; the ``Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of \n2007,'' which made sweeping ethics and lobbying reforms; the \n``Implementing the Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of \n2007,'' which strengthened the Nation's security against terrorism by \nproviding first responders with the resources they need to protect \ntheir communities from disaster, promoting interoperable emergency \ncommunications, requiring screening of cargo placed on passenger \naircraft, securing mass transit, rail and buses; and improving the \nsecurity of maritime cargo; ``The Inspector General Reform Act,'' \npassed in 2008, which sought to improve government accountability by \nguaranteeing that qualified individuals are appointed as IGs and that \nIGs remain independent; ``The Presidential Appointment Efficiency and \nStreamlining Act of 2011'' that addresses the increasingly slow and \nburdensome appointments process by, among other things, removing about \n170 non-policymaking positions from the list of Presidential \nappointments requiring Senate confirmation, thereby allowing the Senate \nto focus on the most important positions; and the Stop Trading on \nCongressional Knowledge, STOCK Act, that ensures that Members of \nCongress are subject to the same insider information prohibitions as \nother Americans.\n  It is quite a record of accomplishment. And he did it all with a \nwonderful sense of humor, patience and civility.\n  Mr. President, I want to return to Thomas Jefferson for a moment, \nbecause he had another thought on public service that sums up one of \nMike's greatest assets--spotting talent in young people and convincing \nthem to use those talents in public service.\n  Jefferson once wrote to a friend: ``It will remain . . . to those now \ncoming on the stage of public affairs to perfect what has been so well \nbegun by those going off it.''\n  Mike may be leaving the Senate, but he leaves behind a cadre of \ntalented and diverse individuals he recruited to join the committee and \nthen gave increased responsibilities as their talents began to flower.\n  Many of these people who started out as interns or junior support \nstaffers, have moved up the committee ranks, working on important \nlegislation and investigations, while others have gone\n\n[[Page S8298]]\n\non to other Congressional or executive branch offices thanks to the \nskills Mike helped them develop.\n  Prior to joining the committee, Mike served as an Executive Assistant \nto former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy and had also been Espy's \nLegislative Director when Espy was a Congressman.\n  One of the joys of my Senate career was the chance to work with \ntalented and dedicated public servants like Michael Alexander and I \nwant to thank him for all his hard work and wish him the best of luck \nin whatever his next endeavor may be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/20/senate-section/article/S8298-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  MARYLAND LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I want to congratulate Maryland \nLegal Services Corporation on their 30th anniversary. Established in \n1982 by the Maryland General Assembly, Maryland Legal Services \nCorporation raises and distributes funds to nonprofit organizations \nthat provide civil legal assistance to low-income persons.\n  As chairman of Maryland Legal Services Corporation from 1988-1995, I \nknow firsthand the extraordinary service they provide to Marylanders. \nMaryland Legal Services Corporation's grants have enabled 35 Maryland-\narea nonprofits to assist individuals in matters such as eviction, \nforeclosure, domestic violence, child custody, veteran's benefits, and \nhealth care. To date, Maryland Legal Services Corporation has awarded \nmore than $164 million in grants, assisting Marylanders in 2 million \ndifferent legal matters.\n  In recent years Maryland Legal Services Corporation's mission has \nbecome even more critical, as more and more people have turned to our \nnonprofit community for civil legal services. Studies have shown that \npoor households will on average face from 1 to 3 legal problems a year, \nand Maryland is fortunate that Maryland Legal Services Corporation has \nworked tirelessly to ensure that our nonprofit civil legal service \nproviders can assist its clients.\n  In the Western part of our State, a couple who were 2 months behind \non their mortgage and close to foreclosure was provided a volunteer \nattorney from Allegany Law Foundation who helped them save their home.\n  In Harford County, Legal Aid successfully advocated for a woman who \nwas being sued by her credit card company after she had paid thousands \nof dollars to a debt settlement company believing that the company \nwould pay off her credit card debt. Legal Aid helped her cancel her \ncontract, get a refund and have the lawsuit dismissed.\n  A man on the Eastern Shore contacted his local Maryland Legal Aid \nBureau with concerns about black mold that was growing in his rental \nunit. The landlord refused to remedy the mold situation, so Legal Aid \nstaff investigated the situation and helped the man escrow his rent.\n  Had these Marylanders not had access to civil legal assistance, what \nwould have happened? I submit that inevitably justice suffers. Judges \nare put in the position of trying to provide some assistance and \nadvice--while remaining impartial--to one or two unrepresented parties \nbefore them. Social service agencies absorb additional costs from those \nthat are unfairly denied health care or social services benefits. \nNeighborhoods and communities are damaged due to unjust evictions. \nFamilies are torn apart, and domestic violence and abuse continues \nunabated. Public health and law enforcement costs rise. The rule of law \nis undermined, and Americans come to believe that justice is only for \nthe rich, not the poor.\n  According to one study, each Legal Aid attorney serves over 6,800 \npeople, while there is one private attorney for every 525 people in the \nnation. This is not ``Equal Justice Under Law'', as promised by the \netching at the entrance to the United States Supreme Court. I am \ncommitted to help close the justice gap by giving the Federal Legal \nServices Corporation the resources it needs from Congress. This must \ninclude increasing its authorized level of funding and removing harmful \nfunding restrictions regarding class action lawsuits and attorneys \nfees.\n  Maryland Legal Services Corporation's successes over the last 30 \nyears are impressive, and while we celebrate all they have been able to \ndo, we also recommit ourselves to ensuring that all people have access \nto quality legal representation, regardless of income.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/20/senate-section/article/S8298-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8298-S8299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL CHAMPIONS\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I \npay tribute to my alma mater, the University of Texas at Austin, and, \nin particular, the Texas Longhorns Volleyball team, the 2012 National \nCollegiate Athletic Association Division I Women's Volleyball Champion.\n  On Saturday, December 15, 2012, the Texas Longhorns won their third \nnational championship for women's volleyball, and first NCAA Volleyball \ntitle since 1988. After reaching their fourth NCAA Final Four in five \nseasons, the Longhorns outlasted the Michigan Wolverines in five sets \nin the semifinal to advance to Saturday's championship match. The \nLonghorns then proceeded to post a .438 hitting percentage in the \nfinal--breaking an NCAA record--and swept the Oregon Ducks in three \nsets to earn the 2012 title.\n  Longhorn outside hitter Bailey Webster led the way with 14 kills and \na .500 hitting percentage in the championship match. After recording 96 \nkills and a .458 hitting percentage during the NCAA postseason, Webster \nwas voted as the Most Outstanding Player of the 2012 NCAA Division I \nWomen's Volleyball Tournament. She was joined on the All-Tournament \nteam by three Longhorn teammates: Hannah Allison, Haley Eckerman, and \nSha'dare McNeal.\n  This was the first national championship for Jerritt Elliott, the \ncoach of the Longhorns since 2001. Coach Elliott also guided the \nLonghorns to their fifth Big 12 Conference championship in six seasons \nand was named the 2012 American Volleyball Coaches Association AVCA \nDivision I National Coach of the Year.\n  The Longhorns finished the season with a 29-4 record, and were 15-1 \nin conference action to claim their second straight conference title. \nFour Longhorn student athletes earned All-America honors. Bailey \nWebster and Big 12 Player of the Year Haley Eckerman were selected to \nthe first team, and Sha'Dare McNeal and Khat Bell received honorable \nmention recognition.\n  Winning the national championship is an achievement which will long \nbe cherished by each of these Longhorns: senior Sha'Dare McNeal; \njuniors Hannah Allison, Megan Futch, Sarah Palmer, and Bailey Webster; \nsophomores Khat Bell, Haley Eckerman, and Madelyn Hutson; freshmen Kat \nBrooks, Nicole Dalton, Sara Hattis, Molly McCage, and Amy Neal; coaches \nJerritt Elliott, Salima Rockwell, Erik Sullivan, and special assistant \nNathan Mendoza; women's athletics director Christine Plonsky; and \nUniversity of Texas at Austin president Bill Powers.\n  One of my favorite scenes in all of Texas is found on the original \nForty Acres of my alma mater. There rising 307 feet at the center of \ncampus is the University of Texas Tower. The tower is a beacon for all \nLonghorns day and night, when it is flooded with light and set aglow \nagainst the nighttime sky. It is a particularly spectacular sight when \nLonghorn student athletes win a national championship, and the tower is \nbathed in burnt orange with a number ``1'' displayed on all sides to \nmark the achievement.\n  With the 2012 Women's Volleyball National Championship, the U.T. \nTower has now been illuminated to celebrate 50 athletic national \nchampionships. Congratulations to the National Champion Texas Longhorns \nWomen's Volleyball team, and Hook 'em Horns!\n Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I congratulate the University of \nTexas women's volleyball team for their national-championship victory \nover the University of Oregon. The Lady Longhorns swept the Ducks 3-0 \nto secure their first NCAA title since 1988.\n  It was a fitting capstone for a remarkable season, in which the \nLonghorns finished 29-4 and rallied from a 2-1 deficit against Michigan \nin the national semifinals. Their championship game against Oregon drew \nthe second-largest crowd in tournament history.\n\n[[Page S8299]]\n\n  I salute 12 veteran Head Coach Jerritt Elliot for coaching the \nLonghorn volleyball squad to its third national title. I also salute \nAssociate Head Coach Salima Rockwell, Assistant Coach Erik Sullivan, \nand Special Assistant Nathan Mendoza, all of whom mentored these young \nwomen and helped them reach their full potential. And, of course, I \nsalute the players themselves, such as junior outside hitter Bailey \nWebster, who was named Tournament MVP; All Tournament team members \nHaley Eckerman, Hannah Allison, and Sha'Dare McNeal; and all the rest \nof the Longhorns: Ashley Bannister, Khat Bell, Kat Brooks, Nicole \nDalton, Megan Futch, Sara Hattis, Madelyn Hutson, Molly McCage, Amy \nNeal, and Sarah Palmer.\n  It is my honor to join with the entire University of Texas family, as \nwell as Longhorn fans across our great State, to celebrate their \nachievement. In its long and proud athletic history, the University of \nTexas has now won 50 national titles overall.\n  The Longhorn volleyball team has learned what it takes to become \nnational champions, and the experience that each of these athletes has \ngained will prove invaluable in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/20/senate-section/article/S8299-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO VICTORIA ARLEN\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and \nhonor the success of Victoria Arlen of Exeter, NH. This summer, \nVictoria represented the United States in a number of swimming events \nat the 2012 Paralympic Games in London.\n  Victoria Arlen is an 18-year-old young woman who 7 years ago was \ndiagnosed with transverse myelitis, a neurological disorder that causes \ninflammation of a section of the spinal cord. Victoria's resulting \nparalysis from the waist down has not damaged her determination or her \ncompetitive spirit, and her achievements this year have been truly \nremarkable.\n  Victoria was a very active child prior to her diagnosis, and was \ninvolved in dancing, swimming, playing field hockey, lacrosse, and \nsoccer. For more than 2 years, Victoria lived in a coma and only began \nswimming competitively again at the age of 16, and it came as no \nsurprise to Victoria's family when the honors student earned a place on \nthe U.S. Paralympic Team. In London, she competed in the 100-meter, 50-\nmeter, 400-meter and 4x100-meter relay freestyle events and the 100-\nmeter breaststroke event. Victoria set a world record and won a gold \nmedal in the 100-meter freestyle, in her final competition, and earned \nsilver medals in three of her other races.\n  Victoria's determination in the face of adversity and ability to \naccomplish her goals demonstrate her strength of spirit and her quality \nof character. Citizens of New Hampshire are incredibly proud of her \nachievements; she is a role model and an inspiration. I am confident \nthat her success at the 2012 Paralympic Games is one great \naccomplishment in what is certain to be a lifetime of impressive feats.\n  Since 1960, the Paralympic Games have provided athletes who have \ncertain physical disabilities the chance to compete in a broad range of \nsports and athletic events on the international level, providing them \nwith an opportunity similar to that of their able-bodied counterparts. \nVictoria's inspiring performance throughout the 2012 Paralympic Games \nshould serve as a reminder of the hard work and dedication required to \nsucceed.\n  I applaud and congratulate Victoria for her devotion and \ndetermination. I also commend her family, including her parents, \nJacqueline and Larry, and her three brothers, Cameron, LJ, and William, \nfor their role in her success. I know that her victories give her \nfamily, her friends, the Exeter community, and the State of New \nHampshire great pride.\n  I wish to recognize Victoria Arlen for her accomplishments and her \nvictory in the 2012 Paralympic Games in London, and I commend her \ndedication, maturity, and hard work. She is truly an inspiring young \nwoman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/20/senate-section/article/S8299-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO AMANDA RENTERIA\n\n Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a \ntruly remarkable member of my staff who is leaving the Senate.\n  Amanda Renteria came to my office as a Legislative Assistant in 2006, \nand has been an integral member of my staff for the last 7 years, \nincluding serving as my legislative director and then my chief of staff \nfor the last 4\\1/2\\ years.\n  A proud graduate of Stanford University and Harvard Business School, \nAmanda brought a wide range of experience with her to the Senate.\n  After graduating from Harvard, she worked in the private sector for a \nwhile before going back to California and working as a high school \nteacher and coach. She then worked for the city of San Jose before \ncoming to Washington.\n  And I am so glad she did. She has been my right hand through some \nvery challenging times.\n  When I asked her to become my chief of staff in 2008, she agreed and \npromised to stay through the 2012 election. But neither of us knew what \nwe would face between then and now.\n  Amanda was with me through the Wall Street collapse and our work to \nreform our financial system, and her business background was an \ninvaluable resource to me during that difficult time.\n  In the fall of 2008, the American auto industry nearly collapsed, and \nas I fought to save our automakers and the more than 1 million workers \nwho depend on it, Amanda was right there by my side, working to make \nsure we kept manufacturing things in this country.\n  She was there as we worked with partners in the State and here in \nWashington to make sure the people of Michigan had a fair shot at \nturning things around and getting back on their feet.\n  During the debate on health care reform, she was a critical part of \nmy effort to make sure we kept health care affordable, that we \nprotected coverage for mental health care, that we closed the donut \nhole for seniors, and she worked with her counterparts in other offices \nand with industry leaders to get the best possible policies to help \nevery family get the health insurance they need.\n  And in the middle of all of that, she found time to have her first \nson, Diego, and prove how important it was that women have access to \nmaternity care, something I was very proud to fight for in the health \ncare law.\n  And when I became Chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, she \nled the effort to put together an amazing team of policy experts that \naccomplished a legislative achievement that is rare these days--a \nbipartisan deficit reduction bill that passed the Senate with strong \nsupport from both parties.\n  And as we worked so hard all year long to pass a Farm Bill, she and \nher husband Pat found time to have their second son, T.J., who we were \nso happy to welcome this fall.\n  I know the people of Michigan--and this country--join me in thanking \nher for everything she has done during her time in public service. She \nmay not have been born in Michigan, but after all she's done for the \npeople back home, she's earned herself a ``Pure Michigan'' reputation \nof hard work and dedication.\n  Amanda will be missed in the Senate, but I am honored to have had her \nserve as my chief of staff.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/20/senate-section/article/S8299-3", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8299-S8300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNOTIFICATION OF THE PRESIDENT'S INTENT TO TERMINATE THE DESIGNATION OF \n  THE FEDERATION OF SAINT KITTS AND NEVIS AS A BENEFICIARY DEVELOPING \n COUNTRY UNDER THE GENERALIZED SYSTEM OF PREFERENCES (GSP) PROGRAM--PM \n                                   64\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with section 502(f)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974, as \namended (the ``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2462(f)(2)), I am providing \nnotification of my intent to terminate the designation of the \nFederation of Saint Kitts and Nevis (St. Kitts and Nevis) as a \nbeneficiary developing country under the Generalized System of \nPreferences (GSP) program.

A bill to improve the ability of consumers to control their \ndigital data usage, promote Internet use, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation which \npromotes innovation and the expansion of the digital economy.\n  Every day, each and every American grows increasingly reliant on the \nInternet. We use it at work, at home at school, and on the go. The \nInternet has changed the way we communicate, the way we share and \nspeak, and it is transforming our economy.\n  As the Internet becomes increasingly important to American consumers, \nbusinesses and innovators, Internet Service Providers, or ISPs, are \nincreasingly imposing caps on the amount of data that consumers may \nmove over the Net. Unfortunately, because of a lack of competition in \nInternet broadband services, the imposition of data caps raises a \npublic policy concern. Data caps are appropriate if they are carefully \nconstructed to manage network congestion but as the New York Times has \neditorialized, they ``should not just be a way for Internet providers \nto extract monopoly rents.'' The imposition of data caps also risks \nundermining online competition and innovation as the market for digital \ngoods and services expands.\n  In order to empower consumers to better manage their data usage and \npromote online innovation, I am sponsoring the Data Cap Integrity Act. \nThis bill will give consumers the tools they need to manage their own \ndata usage, institute industry-wide data measurement accuracy standards \nfor ISPs, and impose disciplines to ensure that ISPs' data caps are \ntruly designed to manage network congestion.\n  The Data Measurement Integrity Act requires the Federal \nCommunications Commission, or FCC, to establish standards for how ISPs \nmeasure data and make certain that data caps are designed to manage \nnetwork congestion rather than monetize data in ways that undermine \nonline innovation. Furthermore, this bill ensures that consumers are \nprovided tools to manage their data consumption and that ISPs cannot \nfor purposes of measuring data, discriminate against any content.\n  Internet use is central to our lives and to our economy. Future \ninnovation will undoubtedly require consumers to use more and more \ndata, data caps should not impede this innovation and the jobs it \ncreates.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and stakeholders to \ndiscuss this legislation, consider improvements to it, and work toward \nits adoption into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 3704. A bill to clarify the authorized uses of funds in the Crime \nVictims Fund; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to clarify the use \nof funds in the Crime Victims Fund. I am pleased to be joined by \nSenator Feinstein.\n  Federal law makes money from the Crime Victims Fund available to the \nDepartment of Justice ``for the United States Attorneys Offices and the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation to improve services for the benefit of \ncrime victims in the Federal criminal justice system, and for a Victim \nNotification System.'' 42 U.S.C. 10601(d)(3).\n  This money is used, among other purposes, to fund positions for \nVictim Advocates in the United States Attorneys' Offices throughout the \nFederal jurisdiction. These Advocates are crucial to the system.\n  We must make sure that DOJ uses Victim Advocates for services ``for \nthe benefit of crime victims.''\n  Advocates should not be providing travel services. Advocates should \nnot be forced to wear two hats: fact witness management and victim \nservices. Often these hats conflict with one another at the expense of \nvictims.\n  According to a letter from John W. Gillis, the former Director of the \nOffice for Victims of Crime, U.S. Department of Justice, ``Travel \nservices required of Advocates have included approving fact witness \ntravel, making or authorizing travel arrangements or cancellations, \nchanges to travel and lodging arrangements for witnesses, reconciling \nerrors, handling with hotels, and seeking approval for government \nemployee witnesses. This runs counter to the law and is a matter of \nserious concern.''\n  Here is a sample of U.S. Attorney websites, which shows that \nAdvocates make witness travel arrangements.\n\n       FLORIDA\n       Services provided to crime victims and witnesses by the \n     U.S. Attorney's Office include: notice of case events; \n     information concerning their rights; information about case \n     proceedings and the criminal justice system in general; \n     referrals to medical and/or social service providers; \n     assistance with travel arrangements; and logistical \n     information concerning transportation, parking, child care, \n     etc.\n       http://www.justice.gov/usao/fln/programs/VW/vwa.html\n       VERMONT\n       The The U.S. Attorney's Office Victim and Witness \n     Assistance Program can assist eligible Federal crime victims \n     and witnesses with the following:\n       Provide logistical information and assistance to witnesses \n     with respect to directions, transportation, parking, witness \n     fees and travel reimbursement; assistance with airline and \n     lodging arrangements is provided for out-of-state witnesses;\n       http://www.justice.gov/usao/vt/victim_witness/\nvw_uaservices.html\n       NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA\n       If you have been subpoenaed to testify on behalf of the \n     federal government and you are not a federal government \n     employee, you are entitled to certain fees for coming to \n     court. These are the types of fees that federal fact \n     witnesses are entitled to:\n       $40.00 for each day that you have to be available to \n     testify, plus travel days.\n       Reimbursement for round-trip mileage to and from the \n     courthouse at the current government mileage reimbursement \n     rate if you drove your privately-owned vehicle.\n       Reimbursement for parking, taxis, and excess baggage fees. \n     All of these claims must be supported by receipts. If you \n     choose to mail your receipts to the USAO at a later time, \n     please advise the USAO staff member assisting you that you \n     will do so in order for us to include these amounts in your \n     reimbursement.\n       A daily meal allowance based on the current government meal \n     allowance rate if you are away from home overnight. You are \n     not required to provide receipts for your meals.\n       To receive these entitlements, you are required to complete \n     a form referred to as an OBD-3, Fact Witness Voucher. Our \n     Victim-Witness staff will assist you in completing the form. \n     If you have not completed your form prior to being dismissed \n     from court, please contact them at the numbers set out \n     earlier.\n       If you are away from home overnight, we will make travel, \n     air, train, or bus fare, and lodging arrangements for you. If \n     you need to make changes in these arrangements, we must make \n     the changes for you.\n       http://www.justice.gov/usao/aln/federalwitness.html\n       WESTERN DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE\n       As a victim or witness, you may have questions about \n     transportation, the location of the courthouse, food service, \n     or where to go and what time to appear. You should feel free \n     to ask either the case agent, the Assistant United States \n     Attorney, or the Victim-Witness Coordinator about them. If \n     you are an out-of-town witness, you must contact the Victim-\n     Witness Coordinator to make all your travel arrangements, the \n     federal government is very specific on when it can and cannot \n     reimburse witnesses.\n       http://www.justice.gov/usao/tnw/brochures/vwhandbook.html\n\n[[Page S8304]]\n\n       NEW HAMPSHIRE\n       Fact Witness: ``a person whose testimony consists of the \n     recitation of facts or events.'' The Victim Witness \n     Specialist provides information and education about the \n     judicial process and assists witnesses who are subpoenaed to \n     testify in a federal court proceeding with travel \n     arrangements and other needs and may come up relating to \n     their appearance in court. The Victim Witness Specialist \n     often accompanies the witness to the courtroom to ensure the \n     witness's safety and to address any concerns the witness may \n     have while waiting to testify.\n       http://www.justice.gov/usao/nh/aboutus/divisions/\nvicwitdiv.html\n\n  The interests of victims of serious federal crimes, including crimes \nof violence, such as rape, child molestation, and horrific homicides, \nwhose needs are immediate and complex, should not be subordinated to \nthe demands of administrative duties unrelated to Congress' purposes \nfor the Crime Victims Fund.\n  Fact Witness travel responsibilities directly hinder victim services \nby prolonging crisis response or intervention techniques to help \ntraumatized and grieving victims, delaying coordination with other \nsocial service agencies to help victims of violence, decreasing time \nfor Advocates to meet with victims to assess their immediate safety \nneeds and address them, and delaying or denying time to develop rapport \nand help victims understand their rights and the criminal justice \nprocess.\n  Victims often find the system overwhelming and it is critical for the \nAdvocates to be able to meet with them to explain their rights and \nspeak personally to them to develop trust. Advocates must have time to \naddress specific victim centered issues.\n  Many problems arise if Advocates do not have such time: delaying or \ndenying time to implement effective strategies for reducing on-going \ntrauma and stress; delaying or denying time to improve support systems \nand help victims overcome the community pressures they may experience \ndue to aiding the prosecution; delaying or denying time to seek \nresources to meet the needs of victims; delaying or denying time to \nassist victims with impact statements; delaying or denying time to help \nvictims collect restitution information and associated receipts; \ndelaying or denying time to effect safety assessment and planning which \ncan change with time; interrupting court accompaniment, leaving victims \nto deal with a process that is intimidating and confusing, often \nforcing victims, including child victims, to face the defendant alone \nwithout the emotional support, guidance, and advocacy to which they are \nentitled; preventing the Advocate's ability to assess the victim's on-\ngoing safety needs, which can change with time; preventing timely \nfollow up and forcing delay finding additional resources or referrals \nto meet the needs of the victims; and preventing proper trial \npreparation and court room orientation. Trial preparation is a \nvulnerable time for victims who often feel exposed, scared, and \nvulnerable. It can trigger a variety of emotions and reactions as they \nprepare to testify about the specific events related to the crime.\n  There are other harmful effects of the travel work. Advocates are \nunable to regularly participate in victim-centered meetings with state, \nlocal, and federal agencies. This limits the Advocates' ability to \nlearn about new resources, work together in adapting new strategies to \nhelp victims, share in information that is necessary to assist victims \nin the process, develop best practices, planning to reduce stress and \ntrauma, learning about specific victim issues and current research to \naddress some of the issues, provide community outreach, and develop \ntraining tools to educate the community to increase awareness on victim \nrights issues.\n  It is the intent of Congress by this amendment to make it clear that \nthe funds authorized for victims services under section 42 U.S.C. \n10601(d)(3) be clearly limited to those purposes including the work of \nvictim advocates, victim advocate supervisors, and their direct support \nstaff so that none of the money available is used for purposes that do \nnot benefit crime victims.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support and \nthe text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                December 14, 2012.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Senator Jon Kyl,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Feinstein and Kyl, I served as the Director, \n     Office for Victims of Crime, U. S. Department of Justice from \n     September, 2001 to January, 2009. During that period it was \n     our ongoing struggle with EOUSA to restrict spending VOCA \n     funds to victims of crime and not to use funds for witnesses \n     who were not victims of crime.\n       Travel services required of Advocates have included \n     approving fact witness travel, making or authorizing travel \n     arrangements or cancellations, making changes to travel and \n     lodging arrangements for witnesses, reconciling errors, \n     handling issues with hotels, and seeking approval for \n     government employee witnesses. This runs counter to the law \n     and is a matter of serious concern.\n           Respectfully,\n\n                                             John W. Gillis,  \n\n                                     Former Director, Office for  \n                                                 Victims of Crime,\n     U.S. Department of Justice.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 3704\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CRIME VICTIMS FUND.\n\n       Section 1402(d)(3) of the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (42 \n     U.S.C.10601(d)(3)) is amended by--\n       (1) inserting ``(A)'' before ``Of the sums''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(B) Amounts made available under subparagraph (A) may not \n     be used for any purpose that is not specified in subparagraph \n     (A).''.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Kyl, in introducing legislation that will ensure \nthat monies in the Crime Victims Fund are used for their intended \npurpose, to help victims of crime.\n  Senator Kyl and I have long worked together to improve the treatment \nof victims in our criminal justice system. In 2004, we passed the Crime \nVictims' Rights Act. Because of that legislation, for the first time, \nvictims were given the right to be heard in what is really their own \ncase, and to participate in the proceedings against the accused.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will strengthen another area \nof federal law that has a profound impact on the ability of victims to \nnavigate the criminal justice system. In 1984, Congress established the \nCrime Victims Fund to provide support for victim compensation and \nassistance programs. This past year, $37 million from the Crime Victims \nFund was used to support over 300 victim-witness coordinators and \nspecialists within the Department of Justice's 93 U.S. Attorney's \nOffices and the FBI's 56 field offices. These personnel advise victims \nof their rights, update victims on the status of criminal proceedings \nagainst the accused, and otherwise assist victims with understanding \nthe operation of the judicial system.\n  However, it was recently brought to the attention of Senator Kyl and \nmyself that these victim-witness coordinators and specialists are being \nasked to perform duties unrelated to the provision of services for \nvictims. The diversion of funds from victim services prompted the \nNational Organization for Victim Assistance to send a letter this past \nJune, which I am submitting for the record, calling on Congress to \nclarify the purposes for which monies in the Crime Victims Fund may be \nused. Senator Kyl's and my legislation would do just that. It will make \nclear that resources available under the Crime Victims Fund may be used \nonly to support services for victims.\n  A person who is a victim of a crime may have never stepped foot \ninside a courtroom or had any other interaction with our legal system \nprior to the commission of the crime. Yet, so much is at stake for that \nvictim when the accused is prosecuted. Congress established the Crime \nVictims Fund to ensure that victims are able to fully participate in \ntheir case. We must make certain that 100 percent of these funds are \nused to support victims during their time of great need.\n  The legislation Senator Kyl and I are introducing today has already \npassed out of the Judiciary Committee as part of the Justice For All \nReauthorization Act of 2011. While that broader legislation has \nunfortunately stalled, it is my hope that the Senate and House can \nquickly pass this one specific, uncontroversial piece, to ensure that \nvictims of crime have all the support that they need and deserve.\n\n[[Page S8305]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/20/senate-section/article/S8305-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 626--DESIGNATING APRIL 24, 2014, AS ``JAN KARSKI \n                                 DAY''\n\n  Mr. LUGAR submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, we often hear and read about stories \nof young boys and girls in foreign countries forced into sexual \nslavery. Helpless children as young as 11 and 12 years old are \nthreatened, abused, raped, and sold for sex. But we rarely hear about \nthe child sex trafficking that happens here at home in Chicago, New \nYork, Atlanta, Miami, and most major metropolitan cities in the United \nStates. Experts estimate that each year as many as 300,000 children are \nat risk of commercial sexual exploitation in the U.S. An alarming 40 \npercent of incidents investigated by federally funded task forces on \nhuman trafficking between 2008 and 2010 involved the sexual \nexploitation of a child, according to a Bureau of Justice Statistics \nreport.\n  The numbers are rising, in part because it has become frighteningly \nsimple to order a child prostitute on the Internet. One merely needs to \nlook at the classified ads on Backpage.com, the leading Web site for \nprostitution advertising in the United States according to the Advanced \nInteractive Media, AIM, Group. The website's ``adult entertainment'' \nsection generates more than 80 percent of total prostitution \nadvertising revenue on the web. This section includes services such as \n``escorts'' and ``body rubs,'' a thinly veiled code for prostitution. \nJust a few clicks on this site easily enables ``johns'' to purchase \nchildren for sex. Law enforcement believes that the existence of \nBackpage encourages the recruitment of victims for sexual exploitation \nbecause it allows traffickers to operate out of sight from police \npatrols.\n  Backpage.com is owned and operated by Village Voice Media Holdings, \nthe former parent company of the alternative weekly Village Voice \npublications. The company, which makes an estimated $26 million per \nyear from these ads, claims it polices the ads on its site, but the \nstatistics and devastating reports say otherwise. According to the \nNational Association of Attorneys General, 23 States have cumulatively \nfiled more than 50 charges against suspects trafficking minors on \nBackpage.com.\n  In August 2011, nine members of the Vice Lords and other south and \nwest side of Chicago gangs were charged with operating a major sex \ntrafficking ring. Some of the girls forced into sexual slavery were as \nyoung as 12 years old. Victims suffered immense abuse, including \nbeatings, branding, tattooing, death threats, being locked in car \ntrunk, and forced to sleep outside even in cold Chicago winters. The \ngang members used Backpage.com to facilitate their operation.\n  In August 2012, Marques Williams was arrested and charged with a \nFederal sex trafficking complaint for trafficking a 15-year-old girl in \nRochester, NY. Advertising the young girls services on Backpage.com, \nWilliams forced her to take up to 15 customers a day.\n  In December 2012, Fernando Gonzales was sentenced to 20 years in \nprison for child sex trafficking. Fernando raped and impregnated a 16-\nyear-old girl, then forced her into prostitution and advertised her \nservices on Backpage.com. When the victim tried to escape, Fernando \nthreatened to kill her and her child and then carved his initial into \nher arm.\n  Unfortunately, there are too many stories like these. As news reports \nof\n\n[[Page S8319]]\n\npimps and traffickers using Backpage.com to advertise sexual services \nby minors continue to increase, we cannot leave our children \ndefenseless. The profit-first mentality at Village Voice Media, which \nprioritizes the rights of pimps, not children, must end.\n  Fifty-one attorneys general, 36 clergymen, dozens of anti-trafficking \norganizations, columnists and editorial boards across the country, and \n240,000 individuals through change.org have called on Village Voice \nMedia to shutdown the ``adult entertainment'' section on Backpage.com. \nEven John Buffalo Mailer, son of Village Voice's co-founder, publicly \nurged Backpage.com to eliminate the section.\n  Over the past year, I joined with several of my colleagues in a \nbipartisan fashion to work to prevent children from being exploited and \ntrafficked on Backpage.com. In March 2012, 18 Senators joined me in a \nletter to the Chairman and CEO of Village Voice Media Holdings, \ndemanding the elimination of the adult entertainment section on the \nclassified advertising Web site. I then led an effort to bring to the \nattention of those advertising on Village Voice publications the kinds \nof activities supported by the company. As a result, eight companies \nand organizations responded to our letter announcing the end of their \nadvertising relationship with the publications. This had a clear \neffect, as a number of then-executives at Village Voice Media Holdings \nspun off the weekly publications as a new company in an apparent effort \nto circumvent the public relations disaster Backpage.com rightly caused \nVillage Voice Media. But children continue to be bought and sold on \nBackpage.com.\n  Senator Blumenthal and I introduced S. Res. 439 as part of this \neffort to curb online child sexual exploitation. The legislation calls \non Village Voice Media Holdings to eliminate the ``adult \nentertainment'' section of Backpage.com. By passing S. Res. 439, the \nU.S. Senate will present a united front in the fight against online \nchild sex trafficking. We will be making it clear that the American \npublic strongly condemns the facilitation and perpetuation of human \ntrafficking by website operators. I want to especially thank Senators \nBlumenthal, Rubio, and Cornyn for their great partnership and \nleadership on this effort, hope the rest of our colleagues will join us \nand pass S. Res. 439.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and any statements related to the measure be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

But children continue to be bought and sold on \nBackpage.com.\n  Senator Blumenthal and I introduced S. Res. 439 as part of this \neffort to curb online child sexual exploitation. The legislation calls \non Village Voice Media Holdings to eliminate the ``adult \nentertainment'' section of Backpage.com. By passing S. Res. 439, the \nU.S. Senate will present a united front in the fight against online \nchild sex trafficking. We will be making it clear that the American \npublic strongly condemns the facilitation and perpetuation of human \ntrafficking by website operators. I want to especially thank Senators \nBlumenthal, Rubio, and Cornyn for their great partnership and \nleadership on this effort, hope the rest of our colleagues will join us \nand pass S. Res. 439.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of H.R. 6671 which was received from the House and is at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6671) to amend section 2710 of title 18, \n     United States Code, to clarify that a video tape service \n     provider may obtain a consumer's informed, written consent on \n     an ongoing basis and that consent may be obtained through the \n     Internet.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are enacting legislation to update the \nVideo Privacy Protection Act, VPPA, in order to permit the ongoing \nsharing of video viewing information via the Internet. This bill \ncontains important digital privacy provisions that I authored in the \nSenate to ensure consumer control over video viewing information.\n  During my more than three decades in the Senate, I have worked to \nprotect the privacy rights of American consumers. In doing so, I have \njoined with Democrats and Republicans alike to help guarantee the right \nto privacy for every citizen. Last month, the Judiciary Committee \nfavorably reported legislation that included these video privacy \nupdates with strong bipartisan support. I commend Senator Franken for \nhis exceptional work on this measure as the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Technology, Privacy and the Law. He held\n\n[[Page S8321]]\n\nthe hearings and helped the committee to develop the proposal contained \nin this bill.\n  I congratulate Representative Goodlatte for his work on this bill. He \nbegan the effort in the House to update the VPPA and has worked with me \nto reach this final product. I look forward to working with him to \nupdate another critical digital privacy law, the Electronic \nCommunications Privacy Act, ECPA, in the new year. The Senate Judiciary \nCommittee reported a good proposal to ensure a warrant requirement for \ne-mails and we should move forward quickly to enact it.\n  The bill we enact today takes several important steps to accommodate \nnew technologies, like video streaming and social networking, while \nalso helping to protect digital privacy rights in cyberspace. First, \nthe bill updates the Video Privacy Protection Act to keep pace with how \nmost Americans view and share videos today--on the Internet. This bill \nwill allow American consumers, if they wish, to share their movie and \ntelevision watching experiences through social media, while also \nensuring that the important privacy protections in this law are not \ndiminished.\n  Second, to protect the privacy of American consumers, the bill \nretains key privacy protections already in the VPPA which require that \nconsumers ``opt-in'' to the sharing of their video viewing information. \nThe bill similarly retains the requirement in current law that \nconsumers provide informed written consent to share video viewing \ninformation. Moreover, to ensure that consumers have control over their \nown video viewing data, the bill provides that consumers may ``opt-in'' \nto the information sharing on an ongoing basis for a period of up to 2 \nyears at a time. Consumers may ``opt-out'' of the information sharing \nat any time.\n  Lastly, the bill requires that the opportunity for a consumer to \nwithdraw consent to the disclosure of video viewing information must be \npresented in a clear and conspicuous manner. This provision requires a \nvideo tape service provider to provide one of two opportunities for the \nconsumer to withdraw consent: on a case-by-case--i.e., per title--\nbasis, or to withdraw consent for ongoing disclosures. The bill does \nnot, however, specify where on a Web site, or in what form, the \nopportunity to withdraw consent should be provided.\n  Like many Americans, I am concerned about the growing and unwelcome \ngovernment intrusions into our private lives in cyber space. Last \nmonth, the Judiciary Committee overwhelmingly passed my legislative \nproposal to update the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, ECPA, to \nrequire a search warrant in order for the government to obtain our e-\nmail and other electronic communications stored with third-party \nservice providers. When we worked to enact ECPA in 1986, no one could \nhave imagined the way the Internet and mobile technologies would \ntransform how we communicate and exchange information today. But, after \nthree decades, this critical privacy law has been outpaced by the \nexplosion of new technologies and the expansion of the government's \nsurveillance powers.\n  My Electronic Communications Privacy Act updates would revive and \nenhance the privacy protections afforded to Americans' e-mails and \nother electronic communications by establishing a warrant requirement \nfor all e-mail content when stored with a third-party service provider \nor ``in the cloud.'' There are limited exceptions to this requirement \nunder current law. I have worked to make certain that these updates \ncarefully balance privacy interests, the needs of law enforcement, and \nthe interest of our thriving American tech sector.\n  When the Congress enacted the Electronic Communications Privacy Act \nin 1986, we did so with strong, bipartisan support. Today, we continue \nthat long and proud tradition of coming together across Chamber and \nparty affiliation by enacting this update to the VPPA. My legislative \nreforms to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act are likewise \ndeserving of such broad and bipartisan support. I urge us to join \ntogether in the Congress to enact these important privacy updates \nwithout delay.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read three times \nand passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate, and any statements related to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 6671) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/20/senate-section/article/S8321-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, DECEMBER 21, 2012\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
