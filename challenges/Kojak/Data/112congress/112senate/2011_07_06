Madam President, yesterday my distinguished Republican \ncounterpart said the debate over how to avert the looming default \ncrisis is really a debate over what kind of a country we are going to \nbe. I agree. That is certainly true. So will we be the kind of country \nthat protects tax breaks and giveaways for the richest people and \ncorporations while sacrificing seniors and the middle class? That is \nthe America my Republican colleagues have proposed, and those \npriorities are simply backwards.\n  Democrats, on the other hand, believe that in a nation where half the \ncountry's wealth is controlled by probably less than 1 percent of its \npeople, perhaps that 1 percent should not be exempt from the sacrifices \nasked of everyone else. If these negotiations will determine what kind \nof nation we are going to be, they will also determine the character of \nthe Republican Party as well.\n  Will they be the party who came to Washington to help govern, to \ncraft solutions to the difficult issues facing this Nation in \ncooperation with patriots on both sides of the aisle or will they be \nthe kind of single-issue, ideological party that walks away from \nreasonable compromise for the sake of politics? That is the question.\n  David Brooks, a conservative columnist for the New York Times, was\n\n[[Page S4334]]\n\nhired for that reason, that usually liberal editorial page. They wanted \nsomeone who wrote well and was a certified conservative. David Brooks \nis who they chose. David Brooks believes it has obviously turned into \nan ideological party that walks away from reasonable compromise for the \nsake of politics. This is what he said yesterday--not me. Conservative \ncolumnist David Brooks said it yesterday, about the illogical and \nideological Republican Party that has emerged.\n  Here is what he said:\n\n       If the debt ceiling talks fail, independent voters will see \n     that Democrats were willing to compromise but Republicans \n     were not.\n\n  He said: If we default, it will be the fault of the ``Republican \nfanaticism.'' That fanaticism is making compromise impossible no matter \nhow much Democrats are willing to give. Independent voters, Brooks \nsays, ``will conclude that Republicans are not fit to govern. And they \nwill be right.'' David Brooks, conservative columnist, said this. The \nRepublican Party has been taken over by ideologues devoted to or \nterrified by Grover Norquist and his no-tax pledge. These Republicans \nrefuse to believe countless respected voices that have said over and \nover how serious a crisis we face if we fail to avoid default.\n  They have refused a deal that Brooks called the ``mother of all no-\nbrainers'' because it violates an arbitrary pledge. Never mind that the \ndeal is in the best interest of the country and gives the Republicans \nmuch of what they say they want. They walked away from the table.\n  The statesman, Dean Acheson--and he was one of our great diplomats \nand, certainly, a statesman--said negotiating ``assumes parties more \nanxious to agree than to disagree.'' It is no wonder, then, that \nRepublicans have refused to negotiate. They will not even admit to \nsupporting their own long-held positions if Democrats also support \nthose positions.\n  We should all be able to agree we need to reduce the deficit and get \nthe fiscal house in order. Democrats and Republicans alike have said \nthat. We should all be able to agree we need to avert the global \neconomic disaster the American default would cause. Business leaders \nand economists alike have said that exact same thing.\n  We should all be able to agree millionaires and billionaires, oil \ncompanies and the owners of yachts and jets don't need special tax \nbreaks the rest of Americans don't get. Yet Republicans have defended \nthose tax breaks again and again. They claim Democrats want to raise \ntaxes on shipbuilders and airplane manufacturers. That couldn't be \nfurther from the truth.\n  In fact, Democrats want to end special tax breaks for the \nmillionaires and billionaires who are lucky enough to be able to afford \nprivate jets and yachts. We are happy that we stand in that way \npolitically. These tax breaks aren't available to middle-class \nAmericans. They can't write off the family station wagon or the rowboat \nthey take fishing with the grandkids or the motor boat they go out with \nevery week to see if they can catch a bass or trout. These breaks are \navailable for multimillion-dollar toys that only a handful of Americans \ncan afford.\n  I repeat: I am proud that Democrats are standing up for America's \nmiddle-class families instead of the richest of the rich. As my \nRepublican colleagues defend tax breaks for special interests and the \nwealthiest 1 percent of Americans, I ask them again what kind of \npolitical party they want to be. They must ask themselves whether they \nwant to be the kind of party that David Brooks, a conservative, \ndescribed--a party of unreasonable fanatics who don't want to \ncompromise, no matter how sweet the deal for their side might be and no \nmatter how grave the consequences for our Nation if they don't agree.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/06/senate-section/article/S4334-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, yesterday afternoon we learned that \nover the weekend a Somali terrorist who had been held and interrogated \non a U.S. Navy ship for the past 2\\1/2\\ months has been flown to New \nYork to face criminal charges in a civilian court--a Somali terrorist \nflown to New York to be tried in a civilian court.\n  I strongly disagree with this decision. Mr. Warsame is a foreign \nenemy combatant, and he should be treated as one. He should be sitting \nin a cell in Guantanamo Bay and eventually tried before a military \ncommission.\n  Warsame is an admitted terrorist. In 2009, Warsame trained and fought \nwith the militant Islamic group al-Shabaab in Somalia. Over the last 2 \nyears, Warsame has provided support and training to al-Qaida in Yemen.\n  Since the day President Obama signed the Executive order to direct \nthe closure of the military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay and \nend the Central Intelligence Agency's enhanced interrogation program, \nSenate Republicans have been asking the administration what would be \ndone with an unlawful enemy combatant captured overseas in a place \nother than Iraq or Afghanistan. At one point, CIA Director Leon Panetta \nspeculated that if Osama bin Laden had been captured alive, he would \nhave been sent to Guantanamo. Over time, it became clear that the \nadministration did not have a policy in place that could address this \ncircumstance. So without a straight answer, we were left in the dark on \nhow this administration would handle an enemy combatant captured \noverseas.\n  Finally, after waiting 18 months, I think we have our answer. As was \ndisclosed yesterday, Warsame has been in military custody for months, \nduring which time he has been interrogated by various law enforcement \nagencies. However, now he has been read his Miranda rights. This is a \nSomalian terrorist captured overseas who has now been read his Miranda \nrights. Why? Why? Why is a man who is a known terrorist and enemy of \nthe United States being afforded the protections of an American \ncitizen? Now he is in the hands of civilian authorities and will be \ngiven all the rights accorded to a U.S. citizen in a civilian court. It \nis truly astonishing that this administration is determined--\ndetermined--to give foreign fighters all the rights and privileges of \nU.S. citizens regardless of where they are captured.\n  In the case of Alwan and Hammadi, two enemy combatants who fought and \nkilled U.S. soldiers in Iraq, they were captured in Bowling Green, KY, \nmy State, and are now awaiting trial in a Bowling Green courtroom--a \ndecision being summarily condemned by Kentuckians and most of their \nelected leaders from both parties at the State and Federal levels. And \nnow Warsame, an enemy combatant with ties to al-Qaida who was captured \noverseas and detained by the military for months, is now inside the \nUnited States awaiting trial as a civilian criminal suspect. It is not \nnecessary to bring or continue to harbor these terrorists within the \nUnited States. The infrastructure is already in place to handle these \ndangerous individuals at Guantanamo. However, it has become abundantly \nclear that the administration has no intention of utilizing Guantanamo \nunless an enemy combatant is already being held there. Instead, the \nadministration has purposely imported a terrorist into the United \nStates and is providing him all the rights of a U.S. citizen in court. \nThis ideological rigidity being displayed by the administration is \nharming the national security of the United States of America.\n  Alwan, Hammadi, Warsame, and all future enemy combatants belong in \nGuantanamo. They do not deserve the same rights and privileges as \nAmerican citizens. The administration's actions are inexplicable, \ncreate unnecessary risks here at home, and do nothing at all to \nincrease the security of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/06/senate-section/article/S4334-3", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4334-S4335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, yesterday I accepted the President's \ninvitation to the White House to discuss what the two parties can do \ntogether to reduce our Nation's out-of-control deficit and debt, to \ncreate jobs, and to put the American economy back on solid footing.\n  As I have said for many months, the upcoming vote on the debt limit \nshould be viewed as an opportunity to do something big that would send \na clear\n\n[[Page S4335]]\n\nmessage to the American people and the world that we could come \ntogether and put our fiscal house in order.\n  It is notable that the President, who not that long ago preferred we \nraise the debt ceiling without any corresponding plan to do any of \nthese things, now wants to discuss the need to do something about our \ncrushing debt burden. Thursday's meeting will give us a chance to see \nif the President means what he says. It is an opportunity to see if the \nPresident is finally willing to agree on a serious plan to pay our \nbills without killing jobs in the process.\n  Until now, the President's proposals have been inadequate and, \nfrankly, indefensible. It is ludicrous for the administration to \npropose raising hundreds of billions in taxes at a time when 14 million \nAmericans are looking for work and job creators are struggling. Just \nlast December, the President acknowledged that preventing a tax hike \nmeant more resources were available for job creators to add employees. \nThat was the President just last December in describing why he decided \nto extend the current tax rates for 2 more years--because, he said, it \nwould be bad for job creators. That was just 6 months ago, and I do not \nthink anybody thinks the economy is in better shape now than it was 6 \nmonths ago. Does the President now think the economy is doing so well, \nthat unemployment is so low, and economic growth so rapid that we can \ntake billions of dollars away from these very same job creators? That \nseems to be what he is saying now. It is equally ludicrous to propose \nmore stimulus spending as part of a deficit reduction package. \nRepublicans and, yes, some Democrats oppose these ideas because they \nwill not solve the debt crisis and they certainly will not create any \njobs.\n  Americans expect that in a negotiation about a debt crisis we would \nactually do something to significantly reduce the debt. And with so \nmany still out of work, we expect the President to not insist on \nproposals his own administration says will put even more people in the \nunemployment line.\n  We are eager to meet with the President to see if he is really \nwilling to do something big for the country. We do not think it is \nabsolutist to oppose more stimulus spending. We do not think it is \nmaximalist to oppose hundreds of billions of dollars in tax hikes in \nthe middle of a job crisis. We have a better term for it: common sense.\n  We are ready to meet with the President on Thursday. Maybe he will \nhave changed his mind and returned to his commonsense approach just \nback in December when he said that preventing tax hikes means ``freeing \nup other money to hire new workers.'' Hopefully, we can finally do \nsomething big to reduce the deficit, put people back to work, and \nprevent Medicare's bankruptcy. That should be our goal.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/06/senate-section/article/S4335-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 12:30 p.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees, with Senators permitted to speak therein \nfor up to 10 minutes each.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I rise this morning to talk about the \nmeeting tomorrow the President has called at the White House--a summit, \nI think it has been referred to, one for which I have great hope. I \nhope it will be a summit where both sides leave their weapons at the \ndoor, sit across the table from one another, and begin talking about a \ncomprehensive solution to a comprehensive problem. The solution to that \nproblem, though, does not lie in creating villains and enemies. In the \nlast 2 weeks, we have heard a lot of rhetoric coming from the White \nHouse demonizing people who have corporate jets or demonizing people \nwho make over $1 million.\n\n  I was reminded in this debate about millionaires in the debate in \n1969 in America. It was one of the first debates I ever watched. I had \nreturned home from the service, I had begun my business, and a report \ncame out in the newspaper that 155 Americans who made over $1 million \npaid zero taxes. I personally was astounded. Everybody else was \nastounded. Congress went to work to close the loophole, and they did it \nby creating something known as the alternative minimum tax--something \nto make sure someone who paid no tax at least paid ``their fair \nshare,'' and I put that in quotes.\n  Today, it is not 155 millionaires who are paying the alternative \nminimum tax; 34,200,000 Americans are, because oftentimes when Congress \ngoes to target one person, they catch everybody in a bigger loop.\n  I do not think we need to demonize those who employ Americans, those \nwho create the jobs, those who make our economy run, any more than we \nshould villainize people who want to try to save Social Security or \nMedicare.\n  The President in his two speeches last week targeted millionaires, he \ntargeted job creators, he created villains, and he created enemies. \nNone of that will help us to solve a problem.\n  Now, the President is not the only one playing that game. A little \nbit of criticism can go to both sides.\n  As we look at this chart that has been on the floor in the last 2 \nweeks about what has happened in the last 30 months since the President \nwas elected as to critical things, unemployment is up by 1.9 million \npeople--17 percent in terms of the rate--gas prices are almost double, \nand the Federal debt is up 35 percent. But, remember, it was $10 \ntrillion when the President was elected, so it is not just the \nPresident's fault, but he is making it worse. Debt per person is now up \nby $11,258, and health insurance premiums are up by almost 20 percent. \nIn fact, the only thing that is down in the last 30 months is the \nexpectations of the American people--expectations of what our future is \ngoing to be like.\n  So for a moment I would like to offer some historical suggestions as \nto what both sides can do tomorrow at the White House, when they leave \nthe weapons at the door, sit at the table, and really begin to \nnegotiate.\n  One is to look back in history when we have had big problems and we \ncame up with big solutions. The 1980s is a particular time. I was in \nthe State legislature then. I followed what was happening in \nWashington. In fact, when I was 39 years old in 1983, Ronald Reagan and \nTip O'Neill had a meeting at the White House. I was not there, but \nallegedly it went something like this:\n  The President said: Well, Social Security is going broke in about 20 \nyears. We just got that report. We need to fix it.\n  O'Neill said: I agree.\n  The President said: I am willing to work on it, but I am not willing \nto raise the tax.\n  O'Neill said: Well, I am willing to work on it, but I don't want to \ncut the benefit.\n  They looked at the Actuary and said: What do we do?\n  The Actuary said: Well, you push the eligibility out, and you get the \nsystem back in actuarial soundness.\n  I was 39 in 1983. I would have been collecting Social Security at the \nage of 65 in 2010. But because Reagan and O'Neill got together, they \npushed my eligibility out by 1 year to age 66, not age 65, and now \nincrementally it goes up 2 months a year to age 67 in a few years. That \nput the system in actuarial soundness for 67 years. The reason it is \nnow all of a sudden in trouble again is the protracted economy, and \nthese difficulties have caused people--baby boomers--to now go to the \nbank of Social Security and collect early Social Security at age 62. So \nwe have had a rush to Social Security because of the unemployment and \nthe uncertainty in our economy. But Reagan and O'Neill fixed Social \nSecurity by pushing the eligibility out. They did not raise the tax, \nbut they did raise the ceiling upon which it was levied.\n  I think it is interesting politically--I note the President should \nunderstand\n\n[[Page S4336]]\n\nand all of us should recognize--the next year was 1984, and President \nReagan won 49 of 50 States, a year after he fixed Social Security.\n  So I do not think we ought to demonize people for trying to solve the \nbigger problems of our debt and deficit. Everybody in this room knows \nyou could cut every discretionary dollar out and you would still owe \n$300 billion in the deficit. The only way we are going to fix Social \nSecurity and Medicare is if we are going to fix the debt and deficit.\n  On Medicare, I was disappointed that when Paul Ryan in the House came \nup with a forthright plan, he was immediately demonized. In fact, he \nwas invited to the White House and criticized face to face at a \nconference the President had. That was just for trying.\n  It is about time all of us start trying, we start trying to find \ncommon ground, we start to look at our solutions in a comprehensive \nway. It is a time where we stop calling names and instead we start \ncalling numbers, we start looking at what it is we can do within our \ncontrol to put our spending back in line, amortize our debt over time \nto a reasonable amount, and reduce our deficit over time. It is not \ngoing to be fixed with one stroke of a pen or one single piece of \nlegislation, but it is going to begin to be fixed when both sides sit \ndown at the table and understand that this is the fourth quarter of the \n``major super bowl'' of the future of the United States of America. \nContinuing to shoot each other and throw bricks and bats and create \nvictims and create enemies and not talk about the real problems is just \nmaking it worse for all of us. It is time we made it better for the \nAmerican people.\n  I spent the weekend with the American people who live in the State of \nGeorgia celebrating our independence on the Fourth of July and spending \nsome time with five of my nine grandchildren. I remember Saturday night \nwatching my grandchildren play in the den, looking down at them. They \nwere not looking at me. I was just watching them play, and I thought \nabout their future. I thought about what their future was going to be \nlike in a country that ran unlimited debt and deficits, that inflated \nits dollar, lowered its expectations, and was not the America I had \nbeen fortunate enough to live, work, and be born in.\n  Recognizing my age and my time, I know my future--the years I have \nleft--is all about those children and those grandchildren. I want to be \na part of the solution for the problem today but a part of their \nexpectations for the future. I do not want them to look back and say: \nGranddad made it worse. I want them to look back and say: Granddad made \nit better.\n  Tomorrow is an opportunity for the President of the United States to \nlead. He has templates with which he can lead. He can either choose to \ntake isolated enemies and isolated arrows and shoot them at people or \nhe can, instead, look back at his deficit commission. His deficit \ncommission, which I voted for, by the way--I was one of the Republicans \nwho voted for the creation of the deficit commission--came back in \nDecember with a comprehensive recommendation that should have come to \nthe floor for debate. It dealt with Social Security. It did not deal \nwith Medicare. It dealt with the Tax Code. It dealt with spending. It \ndealt with expenditures. It lowered tax rates and raised opportunity. \nThe President did not even let it come to the floor of the Congress of \nthe United States. He looked the other way.\n  It is time we look straight in each other's eyes and say there are \nsolutions out there that good people of good will can find a way to do, \njust as Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill did. But I do not want to be a \npart of making it worse. I want to be a part of making it better.\n  I hope those at the conference tomorrow sit down with that type of \nattitude--we do not create enemies and villains, we do not make it \nworse, but we begin a platform and a template where in the next 3 to 4 \nweeks we can begin to amortize our debt over time, reduce our deficit \nover time, raise the expectations of the American people, and cause a \nbrighter future for our children and for our grandchildren.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I am going to speak to another issue \nfirst. But I want to thank my colleague from Georgia for his comments. \nWe are in different political parties, but I listened to him and I know \nhe is sincere. I think it is that spirit that can lead us to a \nsolution. I hope we can find it. I will address the specifics of it \nlater in my remarks.\n\n\n                             Trying Warsame\n\n  But first I wish to address the comments made by the Republican \nSenate Minority Leader McConnell. It relates to a front-page story \nacross the United States this morning, where we have apprehended the \nman Ahmed Abduikadir Warsame, a Somali individual who is now being \ncharged with terrorist crimes and going to be tried in the State of New \nYork.\n  This man apparently was apprehended and held for several months on a \nnaval vessel of the United States where he was interrogated about his \ninvolvement in terrorism and then they brought in prosecutors, criminal \nprosecutors from the United States, who interrogated him about what \nthey thought would be actionable crimes that could be prosecuted in the \nUnited States.\n  He is now being brought to New York for a trial. The statement made \nby Senator McConnell this morning on the floor of the Senate suggests \nthat this was a bad decision on the part of our President and the \nDepartment of Justice to try this man in the criminal courts of the \nUnited States.\n  Senator McConnell has made this speech many times before. He believes \nthat trying terrorists in the courts of the United States makes America \nless safe, and it less likely that we could convict them. He argues \nthey should be held at Guantanamo and tried in military tribunals. His \nargument has some surface appeal unless you know the facts.\n  The facts are that under President Bush after 9/11 and under \nPresident Obama, more than 400 suspected terrorists have been tried in \nthe criminal courts of America, article III constitutional courts, and \nconvicted. They have been tried in our courts and convicted. They are \nserving time in the prisons of the United States of America. That is \nright: convicted terrorists, convicted in criminal courts, now serving \ntime in prisons across America, including in my home State of Illinois \nat the Marion Federal Penitentiary.\n  So to argue that we cannot successfully convict a terrorist in the \nUnited States, as Senator McConnell did this morning, is to ignore \nreality. The reality is that President Bush used his Department of \nJustice and our courts to successfully prosecute terrorists. During the \nperiod of time since 9/11, only around 5 accused terrorists were tried \nin military tribunals--400 in article III criminal courts, 5 in \nmilitary tribunals.\n  Senator McConnell makes the argument--and others have joined him--\nthat the only place to try them is in military tribunals. The fact of \nthe matter is, we do not have a very good record in military tribunals \ntrying would-be terrorists. There is a variety of reasons for it. The \nSupreme Court did not agree with our procedures. Some of the cases were \nnot very good. The bottom line, though, is to say to any President, \nwhether it is Republican George Bush or Democrat Barack Obama, Congress \nis going to tell you the best place to try a terrorist--do we have that \nexpertise? I do not. I am not sure Senator McConnell does. I think it \nis up to the President, the Secretary of Defense, the Central \nIntelligence Agency, and the Attorney General to make that call.\n  Take the would-be terrorist to the court where we are most likely to \nconvict. Take him to a tribunal where they are going to get a fair \nhearing in the eyes of the world, and conviction is most likely. That \nis what I think the American people want.\n  To come here and second guess the President because he has held a man \nfor 2 months in military interrogation and now is being prosecuted in \nour criminal courts is totally unfair, unfair because the same standard \nwas not applied to the Republican President who tried hundreds of \nwould-be terrorists--accused terrorists--in our criminal courts \nsuccessfully. That is a fact. That should be on the record.\n  I meant what I said about Senator Isakson of Georgia. He is a \nRepublican, I am a Democrat. He is my friend. I\n\n[[Page S4337]]\n\nlike him. We do not agree on everything. Our voting records are much \ndifferent. But what he had to say this morning was the right thing. And \nwhat he had to say this morning, I think, should open the eyes of \nAmerica about where we need to go.\n  Yesterday, the President sat down and said, we need to be serious \nabout deficit reduction. We do not need a mini deal, we need something \nthat speaks authoritatively to the world that the United States \nunderstands its deficit challenge and is prepared to make the hard \nchoices to address it. I think the President is right.\n  I was interviewed this morning by a Quincy, IL, radio station. They \nsaid: Well, why would not you take a mini deal and get it over with? \nWell, if you think you will take a mini deal, you will probably be \noffered a mini, mini deal. At the end of the day, little or nothing \nwill happen. Here is the problem we face. It is a real problem. For \nevery dollar we spend in Washington, we borrow 40 cents. We borrow it \nfrom countries all around the world. The No. 1 creditor of the United \nStates is China. China loans us money so that we can spend for \ngovernment purposes.\n  How do we spend the money? Well, if you look at Federal employees, \nmore than half of the Federal employees in the United States of America \nwork for one department, the Department of Defense. If you look at \nexpenditures, some of the fastest growing sections of our budget have \nbeen on the military side as we wage wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and \nparticipate in the NATO exercise in Libya.\n  That is a pretty expensive undertaking. We know that that has gone up \n84 percent--military spending in the last 10 years, gone up 84 percent. \nWe know at the same period of time that spending on mandatory programs, \nsuch as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, agriculture payments, \nveterans payments, spending for those payments over the last 10 years \nhas gone up 32 percent.\n  We know that the rest of the budget, the so-called domestic \ndiscretionary spending, which would include things such as building \nhighways, keeping Federal prisons open, providing Pell grants to \ncollege students, giving children from poor families early childhood \neducation, putting money at the National Institutes of Health for \nmedical research, that is one section of the budget--it comprises 12 \npercent of our budget--and in the last 10 years, that part of our \nbudget has gone up zero percent; no increase in spending in that \nsection.\n  Most of our spending goes into the military--84 percent increase over \n10 years--and mandatory programs--32 percent over 10 years. The biggest \ndriver, in terms of Federal spending, the thing we cannot seem to get \nhold of, is health care costs. And you know that as an individual, \nwhether you are trying to buy health insurance for your family, run a \nsmall business and trying to cover the owners and workers, or look at \nit from a State and local viewpoint when it comes to public employees.\n  I could analyze the health care system, I do know about it. But I \nwill tell you that it is a model that is unsustainable. You cannot \nwatch the cost of health care go up beyond inflation every single year \nand expect to control deficits, whether it is your family deficit, your \ncity deficit, or your national deficit. But that is the reality of \nwhere we are today as we face the current situation.\n  I listened as the Senator from Georgia, whom I respect very much, \ntalk about what President Obama inherited. I wish to add a little \nperspective to it. The last time the Federal Government balanced the \nbudget, ran a surplus, was in the final 2 years of the Clinton \nadministration, William Jefferson Clinton, Democratic President of the \nUnited States.\n  We generated a surplus in those years; that is, we collected more \nmoney in taxes and revenue than we paid out. That had not happened for \ndecades. At that point, as William Jefferson Clinton left office as \nPresident, the national debt of America, the accumulated net national \ndebt of America from George Washington through William Jefferson \nClinton was $5 trillion--$5 trillion, and we had a surplus in our \nannual budget. When President George W. Bush took over and President \nClinton handed him the keys to the White House, he said: Next year, if \nyou follow my budget, you will have a $120 billion surplus.\n  That is what President George W. Bush inherited: $5 trillion national \ndebt, a government running a surplus of $120 billion in the next year.\n  Fast forward 8 years later. At the end of President George W. Bush's \n8 years in office, let's take a snapshot. What did it look like then? \nThe national debt was no longer $5 trillion 8 years later, it was \nalmost $11 trillion. It more than doubled in an 8-year period of time. \nAnd, when President Obama took office, instead of being handed a budget \nfor the next year with a $120 billion surplus, as President Bush was \nhanded by President Clinton, President Obama was given a budget and he \nsaid: Next year, if you follow our budget you will have a $1.2 trillion \ndeficit, 10 times the amount that President Bush had in surplus. \nPresident Obama was told: You will have that in deficit. You will owe \nthat much. The books do not balance.\n  What happened in 8 years? Well, several things happened. First, we \nwaged two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and we did not pay for them. I \nthink back in my history, and I can remember as a kid that every \nbirthday I would receive a savings bond, U.S. savings bond. I used to \nthink it was interesting. They would hand me these $25 U.S. savings \nbonds, and I knew they cost $18.75. But if I did not do anything with \nthem and held onto them for almost 10 years, they would be worth $25. \nSo Grandma and Grandpa would give me the $25 savings bond--I would \nthink it is only $18.75, and I stuck it away. You know. The reason I \nbring it up is those savings bonds were the way we financed wars. \nAmericans sacrificed and loaned money to their government, and they \nbought savings bonds.\n  It was my family tradition. It was a tradition of America. But when \nit came to the two most recent wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan, that did \nnot happen. We borrowed the money from other countries. So during that \n8-year period of time, under President Bush, we waged two wars and \nborrowed the money and added it to the national debt.\n  We did something else. No President in the history of the United \nStates of America ever has cut taxes in the midst of a war. You know \nwhy? Because you have your ordinary budget of government. You have got \nto pay for it. Now you have got a new expenditure, with hundreds of \nthousands of troops in the field, and families saying, keep them safe \nand bring them home, and you are spending billions of dollars there. \nHow could you cut taxes?\n  That is what happened. During the Bush administration, they cut \ntaxes. Two wars unpaid for, cut taxes, and then President Bush signed \ninto law programs--dramatically expensive programs that were not paid \nfor. Medicare prescription Part D was one of them. So you had these \nprograms signed into law, wars not paid for, taxes cut, and, at the end \nof an 8-year period of time, the national debt rose from $5 trillion to \nover $10 trillion, almost $11 trillion.\n  The Republican Party has a philosophy, the Democratic Party has a \nphilosophy. There are those of us who think that sometimes we should \nlisten to one another and try to learn from one another. I think this \nis one of those occasions. But I will say to my friends on the \nRepublican side of the aisle in the Senate and the Republican leaders \nin the House, those who are arguing that the best way to get the \nAmerican economy moving forward at this point is to give tax cuts to \nthe wealthiest people in America, they have forgotten their history. \nThat is exactly what we did under President George W. Bush, and look \nwhat happened--the biggest deficits in the history of the United \nStates. When Barack Obama raised his hand off of that Lincoln Bible, \ntaking the oath of office, that month we lost 700,000 jobs in America. \nUnemployment was running rampant and kept going.\n  Using the Republican economic theory of tax cuts for the wealthiest \npeople in America--it did not work then. It will not work now. It is a \ntired old idea. It may give them points in opinion polls. It does not \ngive America points and credibility around the world. It is a position \nthey are taking.\n  Having said that, I guess I could stop here and they would say: \nDurbin, that was a heck of a Democratic speech.\n\n[[Page S4338]]\n\n  Let me go a little further. I was on the deficit commission. I sat \nthere for 10 months and listened to everything. It was split, Democrats \nand Republicans, and the President appointed the commission. There were \nDemocratic and Republican Senators, and the same thing with House \nMembers. I came to the conclusion that there were some positions the \nRepublicans had taken that were wrong, and there were positions that \nDemocrats had taken that were also wrong. It was time for us to try to \ndo something smart and do it bipartisanly. I voted for the deficit \ncommission; 11 out of 18 of us did. I think I surprised more people \nthan I ever imagined. But I think it was the right thing to do.\n  The morning I voted for it, my son, who happens to live in Brooklyn, \nin the Presiding Officer's State, sent me an e-mail saying: Thanks, \nDad, you are doing the right thing. Well, every dad wants to hear that \nonce in a while. I said that at this commission meeting. It meant a lot \nto me that my son, whom I greatly love, would have that kind of respect \nfor that kind of decision.\n  Here is what we did and what we need to do now. Here is what we need \nto say to the American people: We can get out of this mess. America is \na good, strong nation. We are good people, smart, hard working, and we \nhave a great tradition when it comes to dealing with challenges, \nwhether it is waging wars, or fighting recessions, or putting a man on \nthe Moon. We can do it. We have done it, and we will do it again. Start \nwith that premise. Don't bad-mouth this country, because we are blessed \nto be living here. This country and its history have proven over and \nover again that it can tackle the biggest challenges and meet them head \non. Do you know who wins this battle? It is average Americans--those \nwho have waged our wars, who were the soldiers and went off to war, my \nbrothers in the Korean war, and others, regular old families who said \nit is our patriotic duty and we will serve. They continue to do it time \nand again.\n  When it comes to sacrifice, Americans know that spirit as well--not \nonly the can-do spirit, but the spirit of, sure, my brothers each gave \n4 years of their lives to the U.S. Navy, and so many others did. It \nsays that Americans are willing to step up and participate in a \nnational effort. When they think we are all together as a nation moving \nin the right direction, they want to be part of it, I want to be part \nof it, America wants to be part of it. When we talk about solutions to \nproblems, we talk about everybody rolling up their sleeves and getting \ninvolved.\n  I know the poorest of the poor can't. They don't have the resources, \nor they may not have the physical or mental ability, whatever their \ncircumstance, and I am ready to help the most vulnerable people. Asking \nthem to sacrifice and pitch in is maybe too much in some circumstances. \nThe rest of us should pitch in.\n  Here is what we ought to do. First, we should not say that anybody in \nAmerica who is wealthy and comfortable in life is going to be spared in \nsacrifice. Everybody has to give. Those who are better off than some \nshould give more. I don't think that is unfair. Life has been good to \nthem; America has been good to them. When we need them, they should be \nasked to help. So the notion of raising taxes on the wealthiest people \nshould not be something we automatically reject. It should be part of \nthe conversation.\n  Second, we have a Tax Code that you could not carry with two arms \nbecause it is so big, loaded with laws and regulations and, frankly, \nmost people don't know what is in it. I will tell you the people who do \nknow: the special-interest lobbyists in Washington, the tax lawyers, \nand some people in congressional committees. In there, you will find \nthat we spend almost $1.2 trillion in tax expenditures. Most people \ndon't understand that. I learned a little about it in the deficit \ncommission; $1.2 trillion in tax expenditures in the Tax Code equals \nall the credits, all the deductions, all the exclusions, and everything \nthat you can take to reduce your tax burden. And $1.2 trillion also \nrepresents the entire amount of discretionary spending each year in the \nUnited States. It is a big sum of money. So we spend it in our \nexpenditure levels, from the Defense Department all the way through the \nAgriculture Department, and everything in between; and we forgive, or \ndon't collect, the same amount in the Tax Code.\n  Who benefits from that? Let's look at the basics. Seventy percent of \nthe American taxpayers do not itemize on their tax returns. They file a \nstandard return. So the Tax Code doesn't mean anything to them. If \nthere is a special deduction, unless it is a refundable tax credit--a \nrare category--it doesn't help them. Seventy percent of Americans don't \ntouch it. What are the biggest deductions under the U.S. Tax Code \ntoday? In all my wisdom and education and experience on Capitol Hill, I \nsaid it is the mortgage interest deduction, right? Wrong. The biggest \nsingle deduction is the employers' exclusion for health care premiums. \nEmployers are able to exclude from income the amount of money they \nspend for health insurance for their employees. No. 2 is the mortgage \ninterest deduction. I use it. My wife and I bought our home and thought \nabout it ahead of time. OK, we have mortgage interest deduction, maybe \nwe can buy a little more home. A lot of families do. When you look at \nthe mortgage interest deduction and realize that 70 percent of \nAmericans don't itemize, look at the 30 percent who do, it turns out \nthat mortgage interest deduction--the lion's share of that money goes \nto the very highest income categories in America. So that comes as a \nsurprise. Do you think it is a middle class tax cut? It is not. It is, \nby and large, a tax cut for wealthy people.\n  I want to preserve that part that protects middle-income families. \nBut, again, shouldn't those in the highest income categories be willing \nto see a change in that deduction if it means America's deficit is \ngoing to be finally brought under control?\n  When we look at the Tax Code, we need to be honest about it. There \nare things in there we cannot afford to do any longer--things that \nmaybe we never should have done. We can clean up that Tax Code. What we \nfound in the deficit commission is that by cleaning it up, we could \nactually produce enough revenue to lower marginal tax rates. I hope my \nRepublican friends tune in at this point. They applaud this, and I do \ntoo. If we can lower marginal tax rates for families--even businesses \nin America--that is a good thing; I am for it. But it means being \nhonest and tackling the Tax Code.\n  The other thing we have to look at is entitlements. This is where it \ngets dicey on my side. I like Paul Ryan. Congressman Paul Ryan is from \nthe Midwest, and maybe I am partial as a result. He is from Janesville, \nWI. He studied this issue and knows it well. We come to different \nconclusions, but he did tackle the entitlements. I think he went too \nfar with Medicare. Doubling the out-of-pocket expenses for people under \nMedicare is a nonstarter. Eliminating Medicare as we know it and \nputting these folks in the ``loving arms'' of health insurance \ncompanies in their sixties and seventies is not any kind of favor for \nthe elderly in America. So I disagreed with his conclusions. I would \nnot vote for that. In fact, I voted against him.\n  I don't disagree with Paul Ryan saying that we have to look honestly \nat Medicare. If we don't do that, in 10 or 12 years it will go broke. \nWe cannot let that happen. So we have to look at Medicare in a sensible \nway to reduce the costs of Medicare.\n  Let me give one example. In the Medicare prescription Part D Program, \nprescription drugs for seniors, I think Medicare ought to offer an \noption. The government ought to have an option that people can choose \nvoluntarily, one way or the other, to try to buy pharmaceutical drugs \nin bulk, reducing their costs, so that seniors pay less. Is that a \nradical concept? No. It is exactly what we do in the Veterans' \nAdministration. We can do it under Medicare prescription Part D, \nreducing that program and the costs to seniors, and create as part of \nthe spectrum of competition a Medicare prescription program--one people \ncan opt into if they want to. So there are ways to save money in \nMedicare without endangering basic benefits.\n  Here is the last thing I will say. I see my colleague from Louisiana \nhere. I don't want to keep him waiting. Tomorrow, I will be honored to \nbe invited to the White House with Senator Reid to meet with the \nPresident and the leadership in the House and Senate--Democrats and \nRepublicans. The President said: Leave your ultimatums at\n\n[[Page S4339]]\n\nthe door. That is good advice. He understands that if we don't extend \nthe debt ceiling by August 2, it will have a dramatic negative impact \non the American economy. It is as if you would default on your \nmortgage--same result. Our creditors around the world will say: Oh, \nAmerica is not going to pay its bills on time, so maybe we won't loan \nthem money. Maybe if we loan them money, we will raise the interest \nrate. If they raise the interest rate on our government, they will \nraise the interest rates across our economy, whether you are borrowing \nfor a home, a car, or whatever it is. It would be the height of \nirresponsibility for us to default on America's debt. That debt ceiling \nneeds to be extended so that interest rates don't go up, because if \nthey do, it will hurt our economic recovery and put more Americans out \nof work.\n  The template for our meeting tomorrow should be the President's \ndeficit commission. I will only take exception to one thing Senator \nIsakson said earlier. He said that the President did not let it come to \nthe floor for a vote--his deficit commission. In fairness to Senator \nIsakson, that wasn't the President's responsibility. It is our \nresponsibility to bring it to the floor for a vote. I have been trying \nfor 6 months now, with a handful of other colleagues--Democrats and \nRepublicans--to bring this to the floor so that we would have a vote on \nit. I will keep on trying, as we should. I think it remains the best \nway to approach the deficit challenge. Let's put everything on the \ntable. Look to the deficit commission, the Simpson-Bowles commission, \nwhich gave us guidance as to how to get out of this. If we do get it \ndone--and we can do this--I think it is going to inspire people around \nthe world to believe again in America's future as an economy, to invest \nin America, and we will create jobs. It is going to be like the \nturnaround that occurred when Bill Clinton came to office and said, ``I \nam taking the deficit seriously,'' and he passed the deficit reduction \nplan by one vote in the House--I was there--and by one vote in the \nSenate when Vice President Al Gore cast the deciding vote. Look what \nhappened to the economy. There was a dramatic increase in business \nownership, business creation, and home ownership.\n  That, to me, can happen again if we come up with a bipartisan, \nsensible, inclusive budget deficit plan of the magnitude the President \ncalled for yesterday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, will the Chair inform me when I have \nconsumed 12 minutes?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, first, I rise to celebrate that we are \nfinally, after months and months of doing everything under the Sun but \nfacing our gravest challenge, which is spending and debt, focused on \nthat on the floor of the Senate. That is progress. We have a long way \nto go, but at least that is progress.\n  For months, I have been urging us as a body, urging the majority \nleader, who controls the floor, please, let's focus on our gravest \nchallenge, Federal spending and debt, and not wait until the eleventh \nhour, not wait for a crisis atmosphere. Let's put on the floor \nmeaningful legislation about spending and debt.\n  For months and months, unfortunately, we did everything but that on \nthe floor of the Senate. The majority leader looked for every bill and \nevery topic but that, and it was all sorts of cats and dogs--many of \nthem, quite frankly, trivial, unnecessary legislation, particularly \ncompared to this grave challenge of spending and debt.\n  Finally, last week, a group of conservatives here said enough is \nenough. We should not go out on our planned July 4 recess, which was \nscheduled to be all of this week. We said we are going to block that. \nIt takes unanimous consent for that to happen. We said we would block \nit and, sure enough, we did. We said, wait a minute, we are not \nblocking that just to be here. We are not blocking that to be here and \ncontinue to move on to every other issue under the Sun but spending and \ndebt. We did that to finally focus on the floor of the Senate on the \ngravest of all of our current challenges--Federal spending and debt.\n  We said we are going to vote against the motion to proceed to the \nLibya debate. Libya is an important matter. In fact, that debate is \nlong overdue in Congress. Those votes are long overdue. But that \nchallenge does not rise to the level of our greatest fundamental \nchallenge right now as a nation, which is spending and debt. We said we \nare going to block that motion to proceed to yet another unrelated \nmatter, and we did. We rounded up the votes in the last half week and \ngot those necessary votes to block that motion to proceed. As a result, \nthe distinguished majority leader pulled that vote, he vitiated that \ncloture vote yesterday.\n  Finally, we have an instrument on the Senate floor--a motion--about \nthis central challenge we face, spending and debt. So that is progress. \nI urge all of my colleagues to come down and join this most important \ndebate. I continue to urge the majority leader to put meaningful, \nsubstantive legislation on the floor about this topic. We have motions \non sense-of-the-Senate resolutions. It focuses us on the proper topic, \nspending and debt. That is progress.\n  But, of course, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution does not do anything \nor change anything. We still have further to go in terms of bringing \nmeaningful legislation to the floor, our gravest challenge, Federal \nspending and debt.\n  Why do I insist this is our top challenge at hand? The facts speak \nfor themselves. Of every $1 the Federal Government spends--of every \n$1--over 40 cents is borrowed money--over 40 cents of every $1. Imagine \nif we ran our household that way. It wouldn't take long for one to hit \na financial dead end and virtual bankruptcy--if out of every $1 our \nfamily was spending, 40 cents of it was borrowed money.\n  What does that mean? It means we are collecting, as a nation--as a \nFederal Government--about $2.2 trillion a year. That is a lot of money, \n$2.2 trillion. The problem is we are spending $3.7 trillion--way, way, \nway more than we are collecting.\n  The distinguished majority whip mentioned entitlement spending, and I \nagree with him that is a big part of the issue which we must face in a \ncareful, substantive way because Medicare is one of those big \nentitlement programs. It, too, is on an unsustainable path. The average \nAmerican pays about $110,000 into Medicare over his or her lifetime--a \nlot of money--but, on average, that average American receives in \nbenefits over $430,000 under Medicare. There again, it is not tough to \ndo the math. That is unsustainable, when the average American pays in \n$110,000 and receives in benefits over $300,000.\n  Social Security is another huge entitlement program. This year, it is \ntaking in less than it is spending on current retirees. That day of \nreckoning was going to be several years down the road, but it has been \naccelerated. It is here now--right now. Social Security is taking in, \nin tax revenue, less than it is paying out in benefits to retirees.\n  What does this mean? This adds up and up and up. So we have more new \ndebt under this administration--more new debt under President Obama--\nthan the debt compiled under all the previous Presidents combined, from \nthe first George Bush to the latest George, George W. Bush. We have \nmore new debt under this President than the debt accumulated from all \nthose previous Presidents combined. We must do something, and we must \ndo something about the real problem, spending and debt.\n  Washington, in a bipartisan way, has a spending problem. The \nfundamental problem isn't that we are undertaxed. We all know that, no \nmatter what station in life we come from. The fundamental problem is, \nWashington doesn't live within its means, such as we as families do as \nwe sit around our kitchen tables and look at our budgets. Washington \nhas a fundamental spending and debt problem, and we need real \nsolutions--rigorous, disciplined solutions--to get that under control.\n  How do we go about that? To me, it comes down to three important \nthings: cut, cap, and balance--cut, cap, and balance. Cut: We need to \ncut the budget now. We need to cut the budget this year and next year. \nWe need immediate meaningful cuts. That is why I support those \nimmediate meaningful cuts in the Federal budget. We can't put off \nmeaningful cuts for 1 year or 5 years or 10 years. We need them right \nnow.\n  A few weeks ago, we had some budget proposals on the floor. We had \nseveral\n\n[[Page S4340]]\n\nRepublican proposals and we had President Obama's proposed budget. The \nObama budget didn't cut in a meaningful way. In fact, it doubled the \ndebt in 5 years and tripled the debt in 10. On the Republican side, we \nhad three different alternatives, all of which cut the budget in a \nmeaningful way, and I voted for all three. We need to start now, today, \nwith cuts.\n  But that is not enough. That is short term. We need immediate cuts, \nwe need medium-term caps, and we need balance. So let's discuss caps. \nWhat do I mean by a cap? I mean we need established spending caps in \neach major category of the budget that takes some sort of extraordinary \nsupermajority in the Congress to supercede. We need a glidepath to \nactually get through those caps to a balanced budget in a reasonable \nperiod of time.\n  There are several proposals in this body. There are several proposals \nin the House, mostly from the Republican, conservative side--virtually \nall of them--to establish those caps, to get us on that disciplined \nmandatory path so we reach that balanced budget.\n  Third, and finally, balance: The goal needs to be a balanced budget, \nand it can't be a goal generations off. It can't be a goal decades off. \nIt needs to be a goal within our sight. The only way, ultimately, I \nbelieve, we can absolutely ensure that is through a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget.\n  I am very proud to be a coauthor, along with all my Republican \ncolleagues--every single one of us--of a strong, meaningful, \nsubstantive balanced budget constitutional amendment. This has been \ndebated in this body and the House for some time. The last time it was \nvoted on, on the floor of the Senate, it came within one vote of \npassing. We need to have this ultimate protection and straitjacket and \nenforced discipline to say we are getting to a balanced budget, we are \ngoing to stay there, and we are not going to get in this state again.\n  Virtually every State in the country has such a balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment under their State constitution, and that \nenforced discipline works. That straitjacket at the State level works. \nIt works in my State of Louisiana. We have such a provision in our \nState constitution which says we can't have a State budget which is out \nof balance. That mandate, that requirement for a balanced budget works. \nEvery year, the legislature, working with the Governor, produces a \nbalanced budget. If they go out of session and 1 month later revenues \nfall and the budget goes out of balance, they have to come back in \nwithin a set period of time and they have to rebalance that budget. It \nis not fun. It is not easy. It has been particularly difficult in this \nhorrible economy for the last several years, but because of that \nmandate, because of that constitutional provision, it gets done. That \nis what we need at the Federal level. We need a balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment.\n  So I repeat: cut, cap, and balance. It is an important formula. It is \nsimple but substantive and it will get us where we need to be.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed 12 \nminutes.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the Chair.\n  I urge all my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to come together \nand continue this debate and move it to the next level.\n  As I said when I began, the first thing I wish to do is recognize and \ncelebrate progress because, after months of resistance from the \ndistinguished majority leader, we are finally on the Senate floor \nactually talking about our most pressing challenge, spending and debt. \nBut it is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It is a procedural motion.\n  Let's get to the real substance by having meaningful legislation--\ncut, cap, and balance legislation--on the floor of the Senate, open to \namendments and open to wide-ranging debate. That is the history and \ntradition of the Senate. Unfortunately, it hasn't been the practice of \nthe Senate all that much in recent years, but we are trying to get back \nto that. So let's put that meaningful, substantive legislation about \nspending and debt on the floor of the Senate, have that debate, have \namendments, and have a free flow of ideas.\n  Cut, cap, and balance--we can get there. We can do the work of the \nAmerican people. We can rein in this runaway Federal spending and debt, \nand we must. We must do it now. Because if we fail to meet this \nchallenge this year--if we fail to meet this challenge this year--I \nbelieve there are going to be dire consequences for our economy and for \nall American families as a result.\n  Having this topic on the floor of the Senate is a start, but it is \nonly a start. Let's build on this, put substantive legislation on the \nfloor about spending and debt, and act on that meaningful, substantive \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, before I begin on my time, I would like \nto ask my colleague from Louisiana if he would answer a question.\n  Mr. VITTER. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague.\n  My colleague is right. We should move on this, this year. We \ncertainly agree with that. Of course, the balanced budget amendment \nwouldn't take effect for years to come. But my colleague just voted for \nthe Ryan budget, which actually increased the deficit. Not only did it \nnot move deficit numbers down, but it increased the deficit. So how can \nhe reconcile all this nice, grandiose talk about a balanced budget \namendment with voting for a budget that actually increased the deficit?\n  Mr. VITTER. Well, first of all, I voted for that budget as well as \nthe Toomey budget. The Toomey budget, which was my first choice and \npreference, balances the budget in 10 years. That would be my first \nchoice.\n  The Ryan budget gets us way down the path compared to anything else \nproposed on the Democratic side, such as the President's budget, which \non the Senate floor actually got 0 votes out of 100. So while the Ryan \nbudget is not my first choice, it is a dramatic improvement on the path \nwe are currently on.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would note, for my colleague--reclaiming my time--the \nRyan budget is not a dramatic step in that direction. The Ryan budget, \nas I understand it, does not do a thing in the first decade to reduce \nthe deficit. It cuts a lot of spending, but it also cuts taxes and it \nraises defense spending.\n  Mr. VITTER. If I may respond, through the Chair.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Please.\n  Mr. VITTER. That is not true. It reduces the deficit. It doesn't \nbalance the budget within the 10-year window, which is my strong \npreference--the Toomey budget does do that--but it gets us going in the \nright direction. It reduces the deficit, and it is a particularly \ndramatic improvement over anything proposed by this administration.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague.\n  I would say it is time to walk the walk, not talk the talk. Whenever \nfolks refuse to step to the plate to actually balance the budget--the \nlast President to do so being Bill Clinton--they start talking about a \nway distant, future balanced budget amendment. This balanced budget \namendment they talk about is not going to solve our problem in the next \n5 years. We have to get to work right now, and that is what we are \ntrying to do on this side, with a fair and balanced approach.\n  The balanced budget amendment my colleague speaks about would, if we \nlook at the amounts--18 percent GDP--cut deeper than the Ryan budget. \nIt would end Medicare as we know it. It would mean things we take for \ngranted, such as food safety inspectors and flight inspectors, would \nhave to be cut, and then it makes it impossible to close tax loopholes \nfor millionaires and billionaires. It is not a balanced budget \namendment; it is an unbalanced budget amendment because it simply \nreflects an ideological view that my good colleague and friend from \nLouisiana has but does not reflect the views of either a majority of \nthis Chamber or certainly the American people.\n  So let's walk the walk. Let's not just talk the talk. I think that is \nvery important to note. Cutting spending, which is done in the Ryan \nbudget, is not going to work in terms of balancing the budget. It just \ncan't, unless we decimate programs, such as Medicare, without revenues.\n  That is what I am here to talk about today. I rise today in support \nof the sense of the Senate on shared sacrifice.\n\n[[Page S4341]]\n\nThe clock is ticking. Time is running short to reach a deal on reducing \nthe deficit and raising the debt ceiling. We are walking the walk and \nnot simply talking the talk about some ephemeral balanced budget \namendment that is unbalanced and will not pass.\n  Yesterday, the President said we needed to reach a deal within 2 \nweeks in order to avoid roiling the financial markets. Democrats are \nworking in good faith, identifying spending cuts and tax loopholes to \nclose. And what are our Republican colleagues doing?\n  Well, since stalking out of the negotiations 2 weeks ago, they are \nnow sticking to their blind ideology and playing political games, such \nas inviting the President to come to the Capitol, when they know he \ncan't, to deliver a message he has already heard. The Republican leader \nhas continued to insist that we can't raise a single dollar in revenue, \nno matter how wasteful the tax break or how generous the substance.\n  Madam President, here is what it is coming down to. In the home \nstretch of negotiations, our Republican colleagues seem to be willing \nto tank the economy rather than end a single tax subsidy. Democrats are \ncommitted to reducing the deficit and getting our Nation back on a \nsensible fiscal track, but we know everyone must pay their fair share. \nWe know there has to be compromise to get things done. We can't just \ndraw a line in the sand and say: My way or no way; it will lead to \nfiscal Armageddon.\n  So over the past several weeks, we have offered a number of wasteful \ntax breaks that should be ended as part of the debt ceiling deal: \nending subsidies for the oil and gas industry making record profits; \nthe ethanol industry, which 36 Members on the floor, including the \nmajority leader, supported, to their credit, and corporate jet owners, \nwill save us tens of billions of dollars.\n  Now, paradoxically, our Republican colleagues are now arguing that \ntax breaks for oil companies and corporate jet owners are too small to \nconsider ending. They have argued that because they will only save \ntaxpayers tens of billions of dollars. They say that is not enough and \nso we shouldn't be discussing them now.\n  Well, I disagree. Tens of billions of dollars that we can save on \nwasteful subsidies are certainly worth pursuing.\n  But let's turn our attention to the matter at hand, one of the \nbiggest of all taxpayer giveaways that Democrats are trying to end: tax \nbreaks for millionaires and billionaires.\n  I rise today in strong support of the Senate resolution that says, \nsimply, instead of ending Medicare as we know it, instead of cutting \ncollege scholarships and cancer research, instead of balancing the \nbudget solely on the backs of the middle class, let's end some breaks. \nLet's end tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires.\n  Let me repeat that because that is the essence of our dispute, of our \ndisagreement. You can't varnish it any other way. I know the other side \ntries to say we are raising taxes, trying to imply that we want to do \nit on middle-class people. We don't. We are not going to touch a person \nwhose income is below $250,000. Some of us would even go higher, \n$500,000, $1 million. But every one of us on this side says: If you are \na millionaire, you should share some of the sacrifice. The other side \nresists, and then they try to hide by saying it is raising taxes. It is \nnot raising taxes on average folks. It is not raising taxes at all. It \nis simply going back to the level under Bill Clinton where we had \nrecord prosperity, record jobs, and record income growth for the \nhighest end people as well as for middle-class people who got income \ngrowth as well.\n  So let me repeat the nub of this and why we have this resolution on \nthe Senate floor. Here is what it says: Instead of ending Medicare as \nwe know it, instead of cutting college scholarships and cancer \nresearch, instead of balancing the budget on the backs of the middle \nclass, let's end tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires. This \nwould save over $100 billion a year and hundreds and hundreds of \nbillions in the long run. It is not just a small amount.\n  I ask my Republican colleagues, is that savings significant enough to \nat least merit discussion and not just take it off the table?\n  The GOP budget would end Medicare as we know it to give hundreds of \nbillions of dollars in tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans. The \nresolution says, simply: Don't let that happen.\n  Let me say this: I respect people who have made a lot of money. There \nare many of them in my State. They work hard. God bless them. But many \nof them, when you talk to them, are the first to say they should share \nin the sacrifice. There are some who would say no, but I don't think \nthey represent mainstream America or mainstream American opinion.\n  In normal times this would be a consensus opinion, the fact that we \nshouldn't end Medicare as we know it to give hundreds of billions of \ndollars in tax breaks to the richest Americans. In normal times that \nwould be a consensus position.\n  Republican Presidents and political leaders have long supported \nraising revenue combined with cutting spending to reduce deficits. \nRonald Reagan, for instance, because he wanted to shrink government, \nbut he was fiscally responsible. But the Republican Party has been \ndragged so far to the right by an ideological fringe that they now see \nthis balanced approach as an extreme position.\n  What it comes down to is this: Would Republicans rather end Medicare \nthan end tax breaks for billionaires? It is a simple choice, and this \nresolution will make the answer to that question clear.\n  Again, will Republicans do anything, even risk default, to protect \ntax breaks on the highest income people, millionaires and billionaires? \nAnd would they rather end Medicare and solely rely on cuts that hurt \nthe middle class than admit that some tax subsidies, such as those for \nbig oil companies and corporate jet owners, are a waste of taxpayer \ndollars? Well, Madam President, we will soon find out.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak to the \nChamber for not to exceed 20 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COATS. I don't anticipate taking 20 minutes of time. I hope to be \nback on the Senate floor this afternoon talking about a related \nsubject, but I do want to take the opportunity essentially to bring us \nback to the central problem we are facing in this Chamber and in this \ncountry; that is, dealing with an out-of-control spending program in \nWashington, DC, that has occurred over many years.\n  In fact, the accumulation of debt not only is at the federal level, \nbut it has been at the State level. It has been at the local level. It \nhas been at the personal and the private level. We have been in a cycle \nof debt accumulation that simply is coming to an end, and it is coming \nto an end because we can no longer afford to pay the interest and can \nno longer afford to fulfill the promises that have been made on a \npolitical basis to people over a whole series of years, both by \nDemocrats and Republicans, and only accelerated in a dramatic fashion \nin the last 3 years where we have seen an explosion of spending at the \nFederal level. This simply cannot continue and be paid for under any \nsystem of taxation at all.\n  So what we have seen is a nice deflection away from the central \nissue, a deflection into--well, the whole thing comes down to whether \nwe tax millionaires and billionaires. The President's speech last week, \nwhich set the stage for all this discussion, is a nice deflection away \nfrom what we all know we need to do. And what we need to do is address \nthis out-of-control deficit, out-of-control accumulation of debt that \nis simply unsustainable.\n  Now, it is pure arithmetic and it is easy arithmetic. When we spend \n$3.7 trillion a year, and revenues coming in are only $2.2 trillion a \nyear, we are racking up, on a year-by-year basis, a deficit of $1.5 \ntrillion or greater a year. And that deficit has to be paid. How is it \npaid? Well, 40 cents of every dollar that is spent has to be borrowed \nin order to pay for the promises that have been made.\n\n  So until we as a body put aside this ``gotcha'' stuff that may allow \npolitical positioning for the 2012 election but doesn't address the \nreal problem, we are not going to solve this problem. There has been a \nlot of posturing going on, and I am not here to address that in\n\n[[Page S4342]]\n\nspecific detail at this particular point in time except to say that we \nneed to refocus on the real task before us. The real task before us is \nunderstood by the American people. They understand that we cannot \ncontinue spending money at the rates that we are spending it.\n  Our debt has skyrocketed 35 percent to a limit of $14.3 trillion in \njust the last 2 years. Our annual deficit, our yearly deficit, is now \nthree times greater than the highest deficit of the previous \nadministration. Today, as a result of a stagnant economy and as a \nresult of uncertainty imposed on our economic system, we have 14 \nmillion Americans out of work, and that number is conservative because \nthose are the ones who are looking for work. Those who have given up \nlooking for work amount to a significant number, and those who may \nnever have an opportunity to get back into the workforce ought to be of \ngreat concern to us.\n  These facts, combined with the warnings that have been given to us by \nthe financial markets, should make it clear to all of us, from the \nPresident to Members of Congress and both parties and to the American \npeople, that this current plan we are operating under, the President's \neconomic plan, is not working; that the plan of spending more and \nborrowing more is not getting our economy back to where it ought to be \nand not getting people back to work.\n  Over the weekend, I was privileged to be able to give the Republican \naddress following the President's weekly address to the Nation. In that \naddress I suggested that instead of the current plan that we are \nfollowing under, we ought to look at models that are functioning much \nbetter and working to see what we can learn.\n  Representing the State of Indiana, I am proud to be able to say that \nthe model that our State has used has taken us from a deficit position \nto a surplus position without raising taxes. By reducing spending and \nactually cutting taxes and balancing our budget, we have now seen a \nsignificant change in the financial fortune of the State of Indiana and \nHoosiers who occupy that State.\n  This administration has increased spending, increased borrowing, \nraised taxes, and expanded the growth of government. Now the credit \nagencies are looking at our Federal Government and warning of dire \nconsequences and downgrading of our debt, at the same time the model \nused in Indiana, which cut taxes, cut spending, and balanced our \nbudget, resulted in a AAA credit rating, the best rating you can get.\n  Now, the President's plan during this time, the only one that we can \nwork off of, is his $4 trillion budget, which would have increased \ndeficit spending not decreased it. Interestingly enough, the only plan \nthat we have in front of us--a comprehensive plan at this point in time \nfrom the President or his party--is the plan the President introduced. \nWe have had some nice speeches, and we have had some nice rhetoric. We \nhave heard about the dire consequences of not coming up with a sensible \nplan before we hit the debt limit ceiling now scheduled for August 2. \nBut the only concrete plan proposed to us in this Chamber and in the \nHouse of Representatives from Democrats is a $4 trillion budget which \nwas voted on in the Senate and was defeated by unanimous vote. Not one \nDemocrat voted for the President's budget plan. Yet no alternate plan \nhas been proposed. There may be one in the works. We would like to see \nit. We would like to work off of it.\n  I don't understand how you can negotiate any kind of a final proposal \nif you don't have something to work with and the only thing we now have \nbefore us is simply a resolution on the matter of whether we ought to \ntax millionaires and billionaires.\n  Even if we went forward and did that, even if we took 100 percent of \nall of the income earned by all of those who are in the millionaire and \nbillionaire category, it would be a drop in the bucket compared to what \nwe need to do. It would do nothing to adjust and reform spending \nprograms and duplication of spending and bureaucratic overlap in \nWashington that has been accumulating year after year after year. So it \nis a nice diversion. It is a nice way of playing class warfare. It is a \nnice way to set yourself up for some good talking points back home, \npositioning yourself for some good rhetoric if you are running for \nreelection. But it doesn't address the problem we have.\n  Here we are, having canceled our July 4 recess in order to discuss \nthe budget and the plight we are in and try to come together and \nfashion a plan. We need a plan that we can assure the American people \nwill put us on a much sounder fiscal path; calm the financial markets \nand the credit rating agencies; and reassure those from all over the \nworld who invest their money in America that we finally have our hands \naround the problem, we are coming up with sensible solutions, America \nwill continue to be a safe place to invest your money and the dollar \nwill continue to be a sound currency in which the world can put their \nconfidence.\n  I was encouraged by the President's statement recently that we ought \nto move forward. I hope the President's remarks on the budget last week \nwere perhaps to satisfy his base or to politically position himself for \nmore serious negotiations. I hope that is the case. The President has \nindicated, I believe, that we must take bold steps and take them now in \nanticipation of what needs to be done by August 2; and therefore he has \ncalled for a summit tomorrow. It is time we put aside the political \nrhetoric and the gamesmanship. It is time we get down to some serious \nbargaining and negotiating and come up with what I think most of us \nbelieve is necessary in order to accomplish what we need to in \naddressing this very critical problem that has steep consequences.\n  There is agreement, I trust, that we need serious spending \nreductions--some have estimated that in the $2 trillion range over a \n10-year period of time. Others say to really get at the problem, it \nneeds to be double that or more, in the $4 trillion to $5 trillion \nrange.\n  There also needs to be a commitment to restructure entitlement \nprograms. We all understand and know the three major entitlement \nprograms--Medicaid, Social Security, and especially Medicare--are \nrunning out of money, are not sustainable under the current program, \nand need to be restructured.\n  Once again, this is something that is ripe for political positioning \nand posturing. The fact is that unless we address structural changes in \nthe entitlement programs, those programs will have to be drastically \nreduced, if not eliminated, in the future because they simply are not \nsustainable, given the current number of recipients drawing benefits as \nopposed to the money that is going into most programs. Anyone who says \nwe are doing this on the backs of senior citizens, on low-income \npeople, is not realistically acknowledging the facts. These programs \nare going broke. There are those, on both sides of the aisle, who are \nstanding and saying this has to be part of our solution to our spending \nand deficit problem. Those who are saying this is not part of the \nsolution simply are telling seniors we are going to allow your program \nto go broke or there are going to be severe consequences.\n  Those who are advocating this, to the contrary, are saying we are \ntrying to save those programs. We are trying to ensure that the needed \nhealth care benefits under Medicare and needed benefits under Medicaid \nand needed income under Social Security that people are depending on \nwill be preserved in the future. We are trying to save those programs \nand keep those programs solvent so that a few years from now, as the \ntrustees have indicated in their latest report on Medicare--a few years \nfrom now we will not run into a much more serious problem, which will \nrequire much more drastic action.\n  Also, what we need to do is ensure that we have enforcement programs \nin place so whatever program cuts and changes and reforms that are made \nare not overturned by a future Congress. We need enforcement programs \nto do what we are obligated to do on this floor but often do not seem \nto have the political will to address effectively, programs that will \nautomatically kick in to ensure the goals we established are reached, \nwhether or not we have the political will to go forward and do it \nourselves.\n  I support a balanced budget. If we had had that balanced budget \npassed in the mid-1990s, when we came close, but failed by one vote \neach time, we would not find ourselves in this position now.\n\n[[Page S4343]]\n\nWe would have done what States across America had to do; that is, be \nstraight out with their constituents and simply say: Yes, you can have \nthis new program; yes, we can expand spending, but constitutionally we \nare mandated to balance our budget so we have two options of getting \nthere. We can either reduce spending in other areas, if this is more \nimportant and has a higher priority, and use that money to pay for it \nor we can raise your taxes. Let's decide which you want to do. Is this \nprogram of such necessity and does it have the majority support in the \nState or the locality and is the public willing to support it with \nincreased taxes? That is not unlike the school referendums, where the \nschool puts forward a plan to improve the facilities or hire new \nteachers and puts a referendum before the people of the school district \nand says: If you are willing to raise your property taxes, we add this \nprogram or do this with the education system. Sometimes they pass. \nSometimes they fail. But it gives the public the opportunity to \ndetermine whether to pay for it. It leaves the ultimate financial \nposition at a level of balance.\n  We should address that. If there is a dispute or difference of \nopinion as to what the components of a balanced budget should be, we \nshould have that debate. We should go forward on that and work toward \nsome sensible solution. But the only way we are going to guarantee to \nthe American people we are not going to return to our profligate ways \nis to establish and enact and give to the States the opportunity to \nenact a constitutional amendment to balance the budget for future \nspending.\n  Finally, I wish to include the need for comprehensive tax reform. As \nmany in this Chamber know, Senator Wyden and I, on a bipartisan basis, \nhave introduced comprehensive tax reform. We are going to talk about \nthat a little bit later this afternoon. We have essentially said that \nthe Tax Code is dysfunctional. It does not promote growth and \nefficiency. It needs to be reformed. There is a general consensus on \nthat.\n  We have proposed a way to do it. We are open to suggestions of better \nways if someone else has some better ideas. We do believe a lot of the \nsubsidies and tax exclusions and expenditures in the Tax Code are \nunfair. They are put in for the benefit of a few and not the many. That \npart needs to be reformed.\n  There is a very interesting editorial this morning in the Wall Street \nJournal, talking about the ability to broaden the tax base by \neliminating many of these exclusions but, in return, lowering the \nrates--whether they be individual or corporate rates. That would give \nus the opportunity to promote growth, which is an essential part of our \nreaching fiscal balance and fiscal sanity.\n  The time is now. The time is not after the 2012 election. The dire \nsituation in which we find ourselves is being watched worldwide by \nfinancial markets, by all those who lend us money. They want to know \nwhat the financial future of the United States is going to be. They \nwant to know whether we have the will and the commitment to address our \nvery serious financial situation and the political situation that goes \nalong with it. Are we willing to rise above the politics and do what is \nappropriate and necessary for this country?\n  The President said: ``Right now, we've got a unique opportunity to do \nsomething big.'' I could not agree more with that statement. I am glad \nthe President finally has come on board and said let's get engaged \ntogether and negotiate something big, something that will solve the \nproblem. Now is the time for us and the unique opportunity for the \nPresident to lead.\n  But, frankly, we need more than rhetoric. We need specifics. We need \nto put it on the table. We need more than some kind of a rant against \nthose who fly on corporate jets, as if that subsidy--which is the \ndepreciation issue in the Tax Code, is going to solve the problem or \nwhether we are going to impose a higher tax on billionaires and \nmillionaires, which didn't even pass a Democratic Congress in December. \nEven if those taxes on the wealthy went up to 100 percent, it is a drop \nin the bucket. This is not a responsible way to go forward and \nnegotiate what we need to negotiate.\n  The American people understand it. They voted at the polls in \nNovember of 2010 in a way that should send a signal that we understand \nwhat is going on and we want to send people to Washington who will \naddress this very problem. As this thing has cascaded into 2011 and we \nhave dithered and pushed off and rethought through what the schedule \nis, the American people are getting increasingly frustrated over our \ninability to come to terms with this current situation we face.\n  Now is the time. Now is the time to put politics secondary to what is \nright for America and what is right for Americans. We have that \nopportunity, a unique opportunity. In one sense, it is good we are \nrunning up against this debt limit crisis because it is forcing us to \nstop pushing this problem down the road, to stop delaying and waiting \nuntil after the next election. It is forcing us to take action now.\n  We have about 4 weeks to do what is right for the American people \nbut, more important, what is right for the future of America, our \nchildren and grandchildren and generations to come. If we are going to \nbe that generation which saddles them with debt they cannot climb out \nof and they are unable to live the simple American dream of raising a \nfamily, owning a home or a place to live, providing for the education \nof their children and participating in the wonderful experience this \ncountry has had through sacrifice and commitment and dedication over \nall these years--if we are turning that over to our children with that \nbroken dream and broken promise, we have not done our job.\n  We are here to do it now. The time is now. Let's have the political \nwill to do it. Let's subordinate our political considerations for 2012, \ndo what is right, and then we will have left a legacy--win, lose or \ndraw politically--a legacy that is important for this country.\n  I yield any time left, the remainder of that time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed his 20 \nminutes.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, first, I stand in total agreement with \neverything my good friend from Indiana has said, particularly the \nemphasis on the time is right; it is now. We have been talking about a \nbalanced budget amendment. We have been talking about this problem for \nmany years. To me, I feel great frustration that I am even in the \nChamber right now.\n  Quite often what I do--I have a very regular schedule. If I am not on \na weekend in Iraq, Afghanistan or Africa, someplace having to do with \nthe duties I have as the second ranking member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, I am back in Oklahoma. I have been a pilot for 50 years and \nI get in a little plane and I go out and talk to real people. People \nshake their heads and say: Why are we still talking about this? Why \naren't we doing it? Why is it we are so wrapped up in this thing?\n  There is not an easy answer. We are supposed to be back here, I \nguess, talking about a Libya resolution. We all realize that is \nsomething that kind of diverts the attention of the American people \nfrom the real problem. The real problem of course is the deficit. As I \nsee where we are and look at some of the alternatives they have--the \nSenator from Indiana said the Democrats want to, I guess tomorrow \nmorning, vote on some kind of a bill that is going to be a tax increase \non the millionaires. We are right back again with our class warfare. If \nwe are to rephrase that statement from an economic perspective we would \nsay something like this: It is the sense of the Senate that we should \nraise taxes on America's job creators and entrepreneurs to prevent the \neconomy from recovering from this recession.\n  That is exactly what we would be doing. Yesterday, I searched through \na database of the IRS, their historical tax data. If we were to tax all \nthe income of those individuals making $1 million or more at a 100-\npercent tax rate--in other words, take every cent they have, tax them \nall--the total amount of revenue that would be generated would be $700 \nbillion.\n  Stop and think about that, $700 billion is way less than half the \ndeficit President Obama gave us just this year, a $1.65 trillion \ndeficit. It is clearly a deceptive thing. The American people, I think \nthey assume they are so dumb they can tax millionaires and get\n\n[[Page S4344]]\n\nus out of this mess. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the \n750,000 Americans in the highest tax bracket report less than half of \nthe total net business income earned in this country. This is income \nthat comes from flow-through entities such as the LLCs and \npartnerships. In other words, it comes from small businesses. If we \nwere to tax the small businesses as they are going to attempt to do by \nsaying they are taxing the millionaires, who is going to be able to \ngrow their small businesses? I don't know. No one, I guess, has the \nanswer. There is no answer.\n\n  There is no question we have a serious problem in Washington. Our \ndebt is at the legal limit of $14.3 trillion, and what caused this \nproblem is spending. In the short 2\\1/2\\ years since coming to office, \nPresident Obama has managed to increase spending by 30 percent. Thirty \npercent. He incurred a trillion dollar deficit each year and pushed our \nnational debt up by 35 percent. The statistic that no one seems to care \nabout, and we say it over and over, is this President has increased the \ndebt of America more in his 2\\1/2\\ years than all Presidents throughout \nthe history of America from George Washington to George W. Bush. Let me \nsay this is not the first time this is coming up. Every time you turn \naround in this administration: Well, we are going to have to increase \nthe debt limit. If not, some great crisis will take place. We did this \non February 17, 2009. I voted against it. They increased the debt limit \nat that time. If you remember, that was the $800 billion stimulus bill. \nIn December of 2009, a stand-alone bill to increase the debt limit of \n$290 billion passed. We remember so well Tim Geithner saying if we \ndon't do this, it will ruin our credit nationwide. Then again in \nFebruary of 2010, $1.9 trillion. They increased it again. The same \nthing. You have to draw the line someplace. There is going to be some \npoint at which you are going to say, no, we are not going to do it \nunless we get some reductions and some fiscal sanity that is built into \nit. Right now, since reaching the legal limit, the Treasury has been \nshuffling money around to pay bills and they will run out of ways to do \nthis on August 2. If an agreement to raise the debt limit has not been \nreached by then, Treasury will have to decide which bills to pay and \nwhich bills not to pay, and nobody wants that.\n  In order to raise the debt ceiling, we have to lock in the reforms \nnecessary to permanently prevent this income debt crisis. We all know \nthe scary statistics, but, to me, solving the problem is easy. We spent \nour way into this problem so we need to stop spending to get out of it. \nTax revenue has not been our problem. Tax hikes should not be a part of \nthe solution. Regardless, President Obama has made very clear he wants \ntax increases to be included in any kind of a debt limit deal. Sure, he \nmay say he wants to raise taxes on millionaires and billionaires. You \nare going to hear it over and over. All these people out here are \nsupposed to believe this. It is not true.\n  I said earlier the folks he is targeting are those who own small \nbusinesses and ones that are creating jobs. When you target tax hikes \non folks such as these, you hurt everybody. This is not what we need to \ndo. Our economy is stalling and our unemployment rate is still above 9 \npercent. We need to cut spending in the short term. This is a program \nthat many people adhere to now. I don't know how many we have. I think \nthe pledge includes about 30 Members who say we need to cut spending in \nthe short term, cap spending in the medium term, and balance the budget \nin the long term to put the Nation on a sustainable, limited government \npath. This is the only way out of this mess.\n  I have been a leader here. I can remember back when I introduced the \nHELP Act. That was when this President first came in and he wanted to \ntake the discretionary nondefense spending and freeze it at the new \nlevel after he increased it by 20 percent. I said, no, let's go back to \n2008 levels. If we had done that, we would not be facing the problems \nwe have.\n  Decades ago when I was in the State legislature, there was a great \nSenator from Nebraska named Carl Curtis. He came to me one day and he \nsaid, I have been trying to pass a balanced budget amendment here in \nthe Senate for decades. The argument they use against it is the States \nwill never ratify it. So he came up with the idea, let's preratify a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Well, that sounded great \nto me so I introduced a resolution in the Oklahoma State Senate \npreratifying, which we did, a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. That was kind of fun. We came within two or three States \nof doing this. Had it passed, we wouldn't be here today with the \nproblems we are facing. When you look and you say it is going to be \ndifficult, it is not difficult. But I believe the only way to be able \nto pull this off and to resolve the problem is to do something about a \nbalanced budget amendment. We have proposed one. It is out there. \nSenator Hatch is active in this. We are all looking at it. During \npeacetime the amendment would require a two-thirds majority in both \nChambers of Congress to authorize the specific deficit funding level \nfor a fiscal year. We all understand emergencies can come up. We have \nwars in which case we need to do something about it. This allows an \nescape, but it means two-thirds of the majority of the House and the \nSenate would have to agree to it.\n  Importantly, the balanced budget amendment would require a two-thirds \nmajority in both Chambers to pass any kind of a tax increase. Our \nproblem is our tax increases. That is what the President wants more of. \nThe balanced budget amendment is the only reform that will put our \nNation on a true path to permanent fiscal stability. This is what we \nneed to do. This balanced budget amendment is the reform we need, and I \npledge to oppose any deal to increase the debt limit that does not \nimmediately cut the spending in the short term, cap the spending in the \nmedium term, and include a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  I urge the Members to seize upon this opportunity. We have not had a \nserious opportunity at a balanced budget amendment now for decades. The \ntime is here because we have never faced this before. We have never had \na President who has proposed and passed $5 trillion of deficit in 2\\1/\n2\\ years. The people of America are not dumb. They know we cannot \nsustain that. They are going to say, all right, we all have to bite the \nbullet and do this thing. We need to do it. The time is right. I agree \nwith the Senator from Indiana who said, there hasn't been a time before \nthat is right, but this time is right. Now that this legislative agenda \nis dead that we have been talking about, the President has pursued \naggressive regulations, especially through the EPA, that seriously harm \nthe economy. I think a lot of people are confined in their thinking \nabout the fact that we are spending too much money. They don't realize \nthere is also a cost to overregulation. Right now almost everything the \nliberals have tried to pass through here, such as cap and trade, the \nPresident and his colleagues in the House and the Senate are trying to \ndo through regulation through the EPA, and that is as expensive as \nspending money.\n  I don't think this is rocket science. It is something we can pass, \nthe balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, and put Americans \nback to work and these are the only things that will resolve our debt \nproblems.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have been listening to the debate this \nmorning. It is concerning to me because as a physician, I am trained to \ndiagnose disease. Disease, if you break that word up, is ``dis'' and \n``ease.'' We are not at ease, and I hear us talking all around. I \nlistened to the senior Senator from New York very carefully and what he \nhad to say, and I wanted to spend a few minutes actually disputing what \nhe had to say. Because the premise he said was if we don't raise taxes, \nthe vital things that are legitimate roles for the Federal Government \nwould have to be eliminated, and I find that very curious because what \nis lacking in the Senate body today is an actual knowledge of all that \nwe are doing.\n\n[[Page S4345]]\n\n  I go back to March when the GAO report came out on the levels of \nduplication within the Federal Government, and that report was eye \nopening to many Senators. The fact is that report only covered the \nfirst third of the Federal Government. I have long said during the past \n7 years in the Senate one of our problems is the government is so big, \nwe don't know everything it does. What came out of the report was a \ntremendous list of duplication, programs that do exactly the same thing \nin multiple different agencies. For example, we have 124 different \nprograms to encourage students in math, science, engineering, and \ntechnology. Why would we do that? Why would we pay for 124 sets of \nadministration? Why would we have the first program for science, \ntechnology, engineering, and math that doesn't have a metric on it to \nsee if it works? Well, you know what the report said. None of them have \na metric on it to measure whether they are effective.\n  We have 47 different job training programs. The report said all but \nthree of them overlapped one another and none of those have any metric \nto see if they are effective or work. They cost $18 billion a year.\n  We have 42 different programs to teach Americans how to be \ncreditworthy and financially sound. Mr. President, 42 across 6 \ndifferent agencies? The fact is the Senate doesn't know what it is \ntalking about. When we make statements that say if, in fact, we make \nmajor cuts in the discretionary portion of our budget, the things we \ncount on will have to be sacrificed, it is not true, for there is at a \nminimum $350 billion a year spent on duplication within the Federal \nGovernment, and waste. It doesn't count fraud, which is at least $100 \nbillion a year in Medicare. It doesn't count the Pentagon, where we \nhave the Pentagon having duplicate weapons systems, noncompetitive \ncontracts, cost-plus contracts where we have requirement creep so they \nend up costing much more than they ever should because we don't have \nthe responsible person over there saying, no, you can't have everything \nyou want. What you want is to have the things you need.\n  This whole idea that the sacrifices that need to be made are going to \nbe highly paid for is not true because that is how much waste there is \nin the Federal Government--at least $350 billion a year, and that \ndoesn't count the $100 billion in Medicare that is defrauded and wasted \nand wrongly paid. Their improper payment rate, which is 97 percent \noverpayments, is in excess of $10 billion a year. So if you have $100 \nbillion worth of fraud, and then an improper payment rate that is \naround 10 percent, we could easily solve our budget problems by \neliminating duplication and eliminating fraud, but it requires a lot of \nhard work to do the oversight. It requires a lot of legislative work to \neliminate duplication. It requires us to stand and do what is necessary \nfor our country. We don't have a problem, in general, with revenues. \nWhat we have a problem with is the Federal Government is taking 26 \npercent of our GDP to operate itself and 40 percent of that is \nborrowed.\n  As a physician, what my training would tell me to do is go directly \nto the disease. Don't treat the symptoms of the disease, go directly to \nwhere the disease is, and the disease is we have a magnitude, orders of \nmagnitude, of duplication, all well meaning, all well intentioned, that \nwe won't sit down and work on eliminating.\n  I thought I would spend a few minutes going through by department. \nThe Department of Agriculture has 130 duplicative programs--130. I will \nsubmit for the record a few of these because I don't want the record to \nhave too many. For example, biomass programs at the Department of \nAgriculture. We have the Biomass Crop Assistance Program, the \nBiorefinery Program for Advanced Fuels Program, the Biobased Products \nand Bioenergy Program, the Biorefinery Repowering Assistance Program, \nthe New Era Rural Technology Competitive Grants Program for biomass.\n  Those could all be combined into one at one-third the cost with \nexactly the same results. But we do not have the energy, the time or \nthe motivation to go solve these problems. So the problem is not the \ndebt and deficit, the problem is the Congress, the lack of a work ethic \nto roll up our sleeves and dig into it.\n  We have 16 export assistance programs just for the Department of \nAgriculture; the Department of Commerce, 18 different duplicative \nprograms; the Department of Education, 230 identical, duplicative \nprograms in different branches. The only reason we know that is because \nthe Department of Education is the only Department in the Federal \nGovernment that actually knows all their programs. There is not one \nother agency that actually knows all their programs. That is why it was \nimportant to get the GAO report, and we have just seen the first third \nof it. When we get the other two-thirds--the next third will come in \nFebruary of next year, and we will have two-thirds of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Do you know what it is going to show? Over $400 billion worth of \nduplication. The problem is not that we do not have enough revenue, the \nproblem is we are wasteful in almost everything we do because Congress \nwill not do the appropriate oversight for the things that are \nlegitimate roles for the Federal Government--the first person who does \nnot have to have any risk of no food safety, the first person who does \nnot have to have any risk of not having Medicare or not having their \nSocial Security, the first person who does not have to have any risk if \nthe Congress will actually do its job. Yet we refuse to do our job \nbecause each one of these little programs has a little political body \nin itself that is taking and sucking off the Federal Government, many \ntimes not a legitimate role under the enumerated powers of the \nConstitution that is a role for the Federal Government.\n  I get letters all the time in my office: Please fund this. Please \nfund this. My answer back is: Show me in the enumerated powers where it \nis the role of the Federal Government to do that. If it is truly our \nrole, I am for us doing it. But if, in fact, the enumerated powers--as \noriginally written and as evidenced by the Federalist Papers--say it is \nnot a role for the Federal Government, then the States ought to be \ndoing it. Better yet, we as citizens ought to be helping other citizens \nwho have a need.\n  But the fact is, we have created this monster, an out-of-control \nFederal Government. I am talking out of control because nobody is in \ncontrol of it. Nobody has the information, which is the power to do it, \nwhich is why knowing all this stuff is so frustrating. We will not \neliminate the easy things that will have no impact on 99 percent of \nAmericans. The only people impacted are the people who are benefiting \ndirectly from administering or gaming the programs.\n  The Department of Energy. When the Department of Energy was created, \nit was to eliminate our dependence on foreign energy. Our dependence at \nthat time was 30 percent. It reached a peak of 67 percent. Thankfully, \ndue to horizontal drilling and environmentally sound fracking, we now \nare at 47 percent. We have gone down 16 points since the technology was \ndeveloped to go after resources that are here.\n  The Congressional Research Service says--and this is a report \npublished this year--that America has energy resources greater than the \ncombined energy resources of China, Canada, and Saudi Arabia. We are \nthe only country in the world where the citizens own the resources and \ntheir own government will not let them have it. We deny our own \nresources to our own people. Consequently, we see $4 gasoline, not \nbecause it has to be there--and we blame speculators and we blame the \nlarge oil companies. The reason gas is $4 is because the Federal \nGovernment will not let us utilize the very resources we have.\n  Mr. President, 92 percent of the 650 million acres the Federal \nGovernment owns is unavailable for resource production that can be done \nin a clean, environmentally friendly way, with no impact whatsoever. \nYet supply us with valuable energy that does not make us dependent on \ncountries that are not supportive of our liberties and our freedom.\n  So you are going to hear a lot of speeches today talking about those \nwho have actually lived the American dream, people who have made it. I \nam not saying there is not excesses. I am one of the very few people on \nmy side who thinks we ought to change the Tax Code, we ought to \neliminate all the\n\n[[Page S4346]]\n\nbrackets, we ought to flatten the Tax Code, that it will be clearer, it \nwill create confidence, it will create certainty, and we will see the \nmoney--the $2 trillion that is sitting on the sidelines that could be \ncreating jobs in this country--actually come in and create jobs.\n  But our problem is not the people who have been successful. Our \nproblem is we, the Members of Congress, are not successful in \naccomplishing the task we were sent to do.\n  The Department of Homeland Security. More unregulated grants, 32 \nduplicative programs, no followup on the grants, no checking to see if \na grant that was given actually performed the purpose. There is a \nsignificant amount of fraud, a significant amount of improper payments, \nsignificant layers of duplication. Not even the Department of Homeland \nSecurity knows what is going on, let alone Congress, because we will \nnot do oversight.\n  There are 40 duplicative programs inside the Department of the \nInterior. Then we have all the duplicative programs across agencies. I \ndid not list all of them here. There are 35 duplicative programs in the \nDepartment of Labor, 53 in the Department of Justice, 6 in the \nDepartment of State, 19 at the Department of Transportation. Who knows \nhow many there are at the Defense Department because the Defense \nDepartment does not even know.\n  The problem we need to address is our lack of aggressiveness in \nreviewing and oversighting the Federal Government and eliminating the \nduplication.\n  It is frustrating to me as a physician to see us continue to treat \nthe symptoms and never go after the disease. This disease will \neventually kill us. It is bleeding us now, like it is bleeding us as we \nborrow $5 billion a day--$5 billion. That is the entire budget of the \nState of Oklahoma every day we are borrowing. Now we have political \ngames being played, finger-pointing, putting our finger in the eyes of \nthose across political lines rather than getting down to work and \nsolving the real problems America faces.\n  We do not have one problem in front of us that we cannot solve as a \nnation. We can balance our budget. We can accomplish what we are called \nupon to accomplish if, in fact, we will. But the one little thing that \ncreeps in, that is nauseating, is the vast majority of the Members of \nCongress are not thinking about the problems that are in front of us \nright now. They are thinking about the next election: How do I \nadvantage?\n  When you see that happen, what you see and what you should question \nis, what is the motivation of the Members of Congress? Is it just to \nget reelected or is it to fix the very real and urgent problems in \nfront of us? I think too often it is about us and not our country, it \nis about us secure in the next election rather than our children and \ngrandchildren secure in the next generation.\n  I would put forward, as you hear the debate over the class warfare \nand the unfairness that is propagated--that somebody has become \nsuccessful and that 20 percent of Americans now pay 74 percent of all \nthe taxes paid, that we want to tax those people more--I believe \neverybody in this country ought to pay taxes. I do not care who you \nare. I do not care what program you are on, if you get a benefit from \nthe Federal Government that is rightly under the enumerated powers, \nsomething the Federal Government should be doing, you ought to pay a \ntax on it. Then you are participating. Then we would not have 55 \npercent of the eligible population voting; we would have 75 or 85 \npercent because they would have an involvement.\n  We have an earned-income tax credit program which we pay people who \nare working. We actually pay them every year. But fully 25 percent of \nthat is fraud. That is $17 billion a year paid out to people who are \nnot working who are defrauding the IRS. We have not done anything about \nit. Mr. President, $17 billion over 10 years is $170 billion. That goes \na long way toward reducing our structural deficit and debt. But we will \nnot do that. The same thing on the child tax credit. That is a \nfraudulent program. Fully 20 percent of it is fraud. Yet we have not \ndone anything about it.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used more than his 10 minutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to continue, since \nnobody is on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. I am sorry. I will finish in just a short period of time.\n  The question then comes over why we would not allow the States to \ndecide whether they think we ought to have a balanced budget. It is \ntrue, it will take 5 to 7 years for it to be fully effectuated. But the \nsooner we start down that road and give the States the option of \nsaying: We think you ought to live under the same rules we live under--\nwe have all sorts of reasons why we should not have a balanced budget \namendment but not one of them makes sense, not one of them fits with \ncommon sense, not one of them does anything except continue down the \nroad we are on today.\n  Again I would say, as you hear the debate, think about the real \ndisease we have rather than listening to the symptoms. The disease is \nwe are outside the enumerated powers of the Congress. We have $350 \nbillion worth of waste and duplication every year that Congress will \nnot address. We have a Tax Code that costs one-quarter of a trillion \ndollars a year just to comply with and then still is not fair. Yet we \nwill not address the real disease.\n  The way you address the real disease is identify the real disease and \nthen give it the treatment it needs. The treatment it needs is \ndiscipline forced on Congress by a balanced budget amendment. I \nguarantee you, if we were to pass it out of here, the States would pass \nit and send it back to us and our children and grandchildren would be \nmuch better off with it.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, on August 2, the United States will face the \ndebt ceiling. I am one who thinks we should be debating it every day, \nevery week until we find a solution. But in order to find a solution, \nwe have to first admit we have a problem. We have a significant \nproblem. Raising the debt ceiling is sort of like not paying your \ncredit card bill and then saying to the credit card company: I want to \nincrease my limit. We have been doing that year after year, decade \nafter decade. Both parties have done it. This is not just one party's \nproblem. It is both parties' problem, and it is the country's problem.\n  How big is the problem? We are spending $10 billion a day. Of that \n$10 billion, we are borrowing $4 billion a day. We are spending \n$100,000 a second, and we are borrowing $45,000 a second.\n  Senator DeMint, the other day, said it was akin to a drug addiction. \nYou know that to get better from a drug addiction, the first thing you \nhave to admit is: I am addicted. You have to admit you have a problem. \nThat is what is going on. We have to admit as a country we have a \nproblem. But then we get into this debate, and each side seems to have \na different position. Is the problem that we are spending too much or \nis the problem that we are taxing too little?\n  You can look at the numbers and you can actually come up with an \nobjective answer. The answer is we are spending too much. You can look \nat it in terms of what is spending as a percentage of our gross \ndomestic product? What is spending as a percentage of our economy?\n  Spending under Clinton and under Bush, for about 16 years, was \nbetween 19 and 20 percent of our GDP. What is it now? It is about 25 \npercent of our GDP. So under any objective standard, we are spending \nmore than we were previously.\n  Some would argue--they say: Well, the Bush tax cuts caused this. If \nwe could just get rid of the Bush tax cuts. We are not taxing people \nenough. But if you look at the numbers, the numbers do not bear out. \nThe numbers are that basically, in 1987, revenue was about 18 percent \nof GDP.\n  In 1995, revenue was about 18 percent of GDP. In 2003, Bush passed \nthe tax cuts--Congress passed these tax cuts. In 2006, revenue was \nstill at about 18 percent of GDP. Right now, revenue is under 15 \npercent. So revenue has gone down in 2008, 2009, and 2010.\n  But what happened in 2008? A severe recession, the worst recession \nsince the Great Depression. When we have fewer people working, we have \nfewer people paying taxes. It has absolutely nothing to do with the \nBush tax cuts. They happened in 2003. Revenue stayed steady at\n\n[[Page S4347]]\n\n18 percent, which it has historically for 60 years until 2007, 2008. \nThe recession hits, revenue goes down. So we have a lack of revenue. \nBut if you raise rates, you will not get more revenue. If you want more \nrevenue to try to balance our books, you need an economy that employs \nmore people, you need a growing economy. It is all about getting out of \nthe recession. But that is why some of us fear raising rates now, \nbecause we think that will harm us and make it more difficult to come \nout of a recession.\n  Many on the other side say: Well, the rich just need to pay more. \nThey think the rich are not paying enough. They want to somehow say: If \nthe rich would pay more, we could get out of this. But you have to once \nagain look at the facts.\n  There is a resolution on the floor now that the Democrats are \npromoting. It says that the rich--the people who make more than $1 \nmillion a year--that they earn or bring in 20 percent of the Nation's \neconomy. Well, that is true, but they pay 38 percent of the income tax. \nSo the question is, Are the rich paying enough? Well, they bring in 20 \npercent of the income, and they are paying 38 percent of the revenue. I \ndo not know.\n  The other question is, If you just stick it to the rich and say, \nwell, let's make the rich pay more, what will that do to the rest of \nus? Do you think we will have more jobs or less jobs if we tax people \nmore?\n  The question also is, Will you get more or less revenue if you do \nthis? Historically, no matter what the rates have been, we bring in \nabout 18 percent of GDP. For example, back in the 1950s, we had tax \nrates as high as 70 percent on the wealthy. When we did, we brought in \n18 percent of GDP. When Reagan came in, he lowered tax rates to 28 \npercent for the upper limit. We still brought in 18 percent of GDP. The \ndifference was when we brought in lower rates, we brought in a booming \neconomy, more jobs, and we expanded the number of people paying taxes. \nYou expand the tax base.\n  Now we get back to the impasse. There is an impasse up here. The \nother side says: The rich must share more of the burden. There is a way \nto do it without raising taxes. There is ultimately a compromise that I \nthink brings both sides together, gets beyond the debt ceiling. If they \nwould talk about it, if we would have a debate down here or an informal \ndiscussion, we could fix this tomorrow.\n  If you want the rich to share more of the burden, ask them to pay for \ntheir Medicare. I see no reason why the wealthy should not pay the full \ncost of Medicare. Ask the rich to take less in Social Security \nbenefits. If you means test Social Security benefits--if you say: If \nyou are a wealthy person, guess what, we don't have enough money to \ngive you what we said we were going to give you and you will have to \ntake less--I am perfectly willing to accept that. So there are ways you \ncan do it without damaging the economy.\n  I think raising taxes damages the economy and damages jobs for the \nworking class. We tried this before. About 10 years ago we said let's \nget those rich people. They put a special tax on yachts. Guess who it \nhurt. The guy making $40,000 a year building the yachts lost his job; \nthe rich went to the Caribbean and bought their yachts somewhere else. \nIt does not work. It is not good for the economy. It hurts the working \nclass to raise taxes.\n  But if you want to say the rich need to absorb more of the burden, \nsimply have the rich pay more for their benefits or get fewer benefits. \nI am willing to accept that. Many Republicans are. It is the \ncompromise. Republicans aren't willing to raise taxes. Democrats want \nto raise taxes. Where do we compromise? Come together and say that the \nrich can absorb more of the burden by paying more for their benefits or \ngetting fewer benefits. This is a compromise that would work. We could \nactually get together and raise the debt ceiling.\n  I have said I will vote to raise the debt ceiling if and only if we \ndecide to do something different in this Congress. Congress really has \ndone a poor job. Do you wonder why Congress has a 14-percent approval \nrating? Because they have been a poor steward with your money--a poor \nsteward. The Congress has not done a good job watching over your money. \nThey have been profligate spenders.\n  So I think that in order for the American people to believe we are \ngoing to do a better job, we need a new rule. We need a balanced budget \namendment. So I will propose, along with other Senators, to raise the \ndebt ceiling contingent upon a balanced budget amendment so that we \nbalance our budget by law.\n  Some have said: Well, let's just promise to cut spending over the \nnext 10 years. Let's raise the debt ceiling $2 trillion, and then we \nwill promise to cut spending $2 trillion.\n  The problem is that we are not very believable because we have not \nkept our word in the past and we cannot bind the next Congress. The \nnext Congress will be elected by a new set of people. They will come up \nhere, and they do not have to go by what we are promising. If we amend \nthe Constitution, though, the next Congress will be bound by this, and \nthe next Congress would have to live within its means.\n  I believe this is very important. There is becoming a consensus in \nour country that says the debt is a real problem. I think the two sides \ncould come together--Republican and Democrat--and say: This is how we \nwould work it out. But I think it means significant cuts in Federal \nspending. It means statutory caps, meaning government should have to \nlive within its means each year. And I believe we need to amend the \nConstitution. But if the Democrats say they have to have it that the \nrich pay more somehow, let's have the rich pay more for their benefits. \nThat is ultimately the compromise. I think you can get the vast \nmajority of Republicans to agree to that, Democrats could agree to \nthat, and we could fix the problem. The American people would be amazed \nthat we got together and we fixed the problem and we moved on. That is \nwhat needs to happen. It is not happening in this body.\n  This body needs to debate the debt ceiling, we need to come up with a \nsolution, and we need to move on. We have not had one committee hearing \nabout the debt ceiling. We have not passed a budget in 2 years. We have \nnot passed an appropriations bill in 2 years. We are not doing what we \nare supposed to be doing. The American people say they want results. \nThey want us to at least have a debate. We do not have to agree on \neverything, but let's debate and admit what the problem is and move \nforward. But instead we get obfuscation, and we talk about something \nthat is not really pertinent to what our problems are. We have to, like \nthe drug addict, admit we have a problem. Our problem is spending. It \nis not a taxation problem. It is not a revenue problem. We have less \nrevenue because we are in a recession. We have a spending problem. The \nnumbers are clear as day.\n  I would say to this body and to the American people, let's balance \nour budget. Raise the debt ceiling, but let's go ahead and have a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  I hope we will recognize those problems and move forward.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, like many of my colleagues, I was back in \nmy State for the Fourth of July celebrations, and what struck me about \nthose visits I made and visiting and interacting with people--and I \nremember riding my bike around my neighborhood on the Fourth, and there \nwere lots of families, lots of lawn parties and pit fires and get-\ntogethers, family get-togethers, people shooting off fireworks, and all \nof that sort of thing. It occurred to me as I was riding around that a \nlot of the people who live in those neighborhoods probably are not \nthinking about what is going to happen if we do not do something to \naddress this spending and debt problem we have in this country. And we \nare very near a debt crisis.\n  We have seen what has happened in other countries around the world. \nWhen you start looking at the increase in interest rates that occurs \nwhen you get into a debt crisis--and Greece is\n\n[[Page S4348]]\n\nperhaps a good example of that because now they are facing, on 2-year \ndebt, 24-percent interest rates.\n  As we all know, Treasury interest rates, Federal borrowing, Treasury \nnotes, bonds, bills--those sorts of things are sort of what drive \ninterest rates in other areas of our economy. So if you are one of \nthose homeowners in South Dakota and you are looking at perhaps \nrefinancing your home or buying a new home or being a first-time home \nbuyer, if you are looking at an auto loan, if you are looking at a loan \nfor your child's education, you could very well, if we do not get \nthings turned around here, be looking at much higher interest rates. \nThat would put an even bigger crimp on the budgets of most families \nacross this country.\n  It was interesting because last week there was an op-ed in the Wall \nStreet Journal in which Larry Lindsey, who was a former Federal Reserve \nBoard Governor and also served in the Bush administration as an \neconomic adviser, pointed out that if you had interest rates return to \ntheir 20-year average--in other words, if you went back to a more \nnormalized type interest rate environment--it would actually increase \nthe borrowing costs of the Federal Government over the next 10 years by \n$4.9 trillion. So think about how much money, how much we are spending \nevery single year now to pay for our borrowing, and compound that by \nincreased interest rates. It would make the fiscal situation we are \nfacing much worse and even more dramatic than it already is.\n  So the point I am making is that we have to get the spending and the \ndebt issue addressed here in Congress. Why? Well, because we are \nsaddling future generations with an enormous burden of debt. We are \nputting the country on a path to a debt crisis, which would be a huge \nmistake for this country for so many reasons, but probably most \nfundamentally is because it has a profound impact on the economy.\n  I think most Americans are concerned right now about jobs and the \neconomy. That is the No. 1 issue in front of most Americans. And it \nstrikes me that if you look at what we can do to get people in this \ncountry back to work, obviously creating conditions for economic growth \nmeans keeping taxes low, balancing the Federal budget, having an energy \npolicy that promotes American production, improving market access \nthrough moving some of these free-trade agreements, and clamping down \non the overreaching regulations we are seeing coming out of a lot of \nthe agencies in Washington, DC.\n  There are a whole series of things that can and should be done if we \nare serious about getting people back to work. But it means we can't be \nraising taxes on the job creators. There is a big debate right now \nabout how do we get ourselves out of this fiscal mess. I submit to my \ncolleagues that the real issue here is spending. If you go back to the \nfoundation of our country, in the year 1800, we were only spending 2 \npercent of our economic output on the Federal Government. This year, we \nwill spend 24 to 25 percent. The historical average over the past 40 \nyears is about 20.6 percent. We are now dramatically higher in terms of \nwhat we spend on the Federal Government as a percentage of our entire \neconomy.\n\n  To me, clearly, we have a spending issue, not a revenue issue. That \nsuggests we ought to get after Federal spending--particularly spending \nthat is duplicative, redundant. There is so much in the Federal \nGovernment we spend money on that is wasteful, and we need to cut that \ntype of wasteful spending out of Washington, DC.\n  We have to also focus on long-term programs, such as Social Security, \nMedicare, Medicaid, entitlement programs that drive much of Federal \nspending--around 60 percent of the money that is spent by the Federal \nGovernment. So far there is no appetite among our Democratic colleagues \nto do that. We have now gone 798 days without a Federal budget. The \nonly votes we have had on the budget in the Senate were on the Ryan \nplan and the Obama budget. The President's budget--the Obama budget--\nthat was voted on in the Senate, prescribed more taxes and spending and \nmore debt. It failed by a vote of 97 to 0. Again, the budget presented \nby the President failed 97 to 0 in the Senate.\n  We don't have a budget in the Budget Committee that has been shown to \nus yet. This week, we are voting on a nonbinding sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution that doesn't even say how we should contribute to deficit \nreduction. Is it going to put higher tax on people? Are people going to \nhave fewer deductions? Are people going to be ineligible for farm \nincome payment programs? Should they have to contribute more to \nMedicare or receive less Social Security benefits than those who are \nless fortunate? We don't know. We don't have a budget presented to the \nSenate for consideration. All we have in front of us this week is a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution, which is very vague and could be \ninterpreted lots of different ways.\n  The White House meeting is tomorrow, with leaders of both parties. I \nhope it will lead to substantive cuts and an agreement about how we are \ngoing to reduce spending and get this debt and year-over-year deficits \nunder control. It should not lead to more taxes. The reason is that \nhigher taxes only hurt job creation and make our economic situation \nmuch worse.\n  We were reminded of the need to do this this week when Moody's \ndowngraded the status of the Portuguese debt to junk. This is despite \nthe fact that their government is pushing through an austerity plan \nthat cuts spending and hikes taxes. We have seen that in lots of \nEuropean countries that are dealing with sovereign debt crises.\n  That is our future if we don't get this issue under control. It has \nbeen 798 days since this Senate has passed a budget. That is where it \nstarts--determining how we are going to set priorities, and how we are \ngoing to spend taxpayer dollars, and rein in runaway Federal spending \nand make a dent in this $14 trillion debt that we are saddling on \nfuture generations.\n  I hope we can get a budget before the Senate. This sham of a \nresolution this week--the sense-of-the-Senate resolution--is certainly \nnot the way to do that. I hope we can get to a meaningful discussion of \nwhat we are going to do about spending and debt and jobs in this \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/06/senate-section/article/S4348-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 6 \np.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or \ntheir designees, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 \nminutes each.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to make note of the fact that this \nis the first time since the Watergate scandal the Senate has canceled \nits Fourth of July recess, and the reason is so that we can continue \nworking on this issue of reducing our deficit and our debt, and--from \nmy point of view, and I know I speak for many--doing it in a way that \ndoesn't savage our senior citizens, our children, our families, our \nenvironment, and our economic growth, but doing it in a way that is \nfair, doing it in a way that is fair so that we don't wind up with \npeople such as Warren Buffett or Donald Trump paying less of an \neffective tax rate than their secretaries or a nurse or a firefighter. \nThat is why we are here. That is why I am here.\n  I want to apologize to my constituents in California. I had to cancel \nseveral events that were scheduled, but we will do those things \ncertainly at another time. It is critical to end the current standoff, \nand that, it seems to me, means sticking to three principles: First, we \nmust agree great nations do not default on their debt. Both sides need \nto compromise so that doesn't happen. Nobody gets everything they want \nin a compromise. I speak as a Senator, a former House Member, a former \ncounty supervisor, a mother, a grandmother, and a daughter. The fact is \nyou don't get everything you want if\n\n[[Page S4349]]\n\nyou truly are negotiating and compromising. You don't take your marbles \nand go home, and you don't take your little teddy bear and leave. You \nstick with it and understand that in true compromise everyone gives \njust a little bit.\n  Now, let's look at the government as it is today--as the people \nwanted it. The people decided they wanted a Democratic President, and \nwe have one in President Obama. They decided they wanted a Republican \nHouse of Representatives, and they have that. They decided they wanted \na Democratic Senate, and they have that. So we have the three arms, and \ntwo-thirds of them are controlled by Democrats and one by Republicans.\n  If I then said, because of this, I want two-thirds of what Democrats \nwant, I might have a leg to stand on. But I am not even saying that. I \nam saying let's meet each other halfway. That is fair. That is very \nfair. And I think most Americans of independent mind would think so.\n  This is not a parliamentary system. In the parliamentary systems we \nsee around the world, the ruling party gets everything they want and \nthe others get to talk and maybe somehow work themselves into the \nequation. So first and foremost, we need to compromise.\n  Second, we need to take a lesson from history and follow what worked \nthe last time we balanced the budget in the mid-1990s--the early to \nmid-1990s. Believe me, we did it. With President Clinton, we did it. We \npassed a budget that some of my friends on the Republican side said \nwould be a disaster; that it would never balance. It did. As a matter \nof fact, it produced surpluses. We passed a budget without one \nRepublican vote, and it laid out the plan that some of my Republican \nfriends said would put us into a depression. We went into the longest \nperiod of sustained economic growth and 23 to 24 million jobs were \ncreated.\n  So we know how to do this because, guess what. We did it before. We \nhad a plan that cut unnecessary spending, and it asked the upper income \npeople--the very wealthiest among us--to pay a fair share, and it \ncreated all those jobs and we had surpluses.\n  Our friends on the other side say: Don't talk to us about that. We \ndon't want to talk about it. But we have to talk about it because \notherwise we are going to do what the Republicans did to the seniors in \ntheir House budget, which is to end Medicare as we know it and to put \nthe burden of all this on their backs and on the backs of the middle \nclass.\n  So, first, we need to compromise; second, we need to do what works--\ncut the things you don't need, invest in the things that will create \nthe jobs, and ask the wealthy to pay their fair share.\n  Third, we have to put our country ahead of politics. Let me read from \na couple of very interesting recent editorial comments. Actually, they \nwere yesterday. This is from USA Today.\n\n       GOP rigidity on taxes threatens debt deal.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       GOP rigidity on taxes threatens debt deal. . . . if the GOP \n     walkout is anything more than a negotiating tactic, it is \n     breathtakingly irresponsible, considering the risks of \n     default. . . . the Nation has used trillions of dollars in \n     borrowed money to finance two wars, Medicare's prescription \n     drug program and President George W. Bush's broad tax cuts--\n     all initiated with the GOP controlling both the White House \n     and the Congress. Now Republicans have belatedly decided that \n     borrowing is bad, too, but they dogmatically resist even the \n     most sensible and painless tax hikes.\n\n  This says it all. This, again, is from USA Today.\n  Then there is a David Brooks article--a leading Republican \ncolumnist--which says:\n\n       If the debt ceiling talks fail, independent voters will see \n     that Democrats were willing to compromise but Republicans \n     were not. If responsible Republicans don't take control, \n     independents will conclude that Republican fanaticism caused \n     this default. They will conclude that Republicans are not fit \n     to govern. And they will be right.\n\n  Again, this is written by a leading Republican--well, actually, I \nwould call him a leading intellect in the Republican Party.\n  So we see that people on the outside are noticing what is happening. \nYou cannot take your marbles and go home when the full faith and credit \nof the United States of America is at stake.\n  A lot of people think raising the debt ceiling is so we can do more \nspending in the future. No, no. Raising the debt ceiling is to take \ncare of the debts that were incurred in the past--two wars, unpaid for; \na huge tax cut to the millionaires and billionaires, unpaid for; a \nprescription drug benefit, unpaid for. While my Republican friends \nsaid, no; Medicare could not negotiate for lower prescription drug \nprices. So the cost of it is just going through the roof.\n  So if we don't put revenues on the table, if we don't talk about \nclosing those tax loopholes that benefit millionaires and billionaires, \nall the cuts go to the middle class. All we have to do is look at the \nRyan budget that passed the House to understand what is going to happen \nif we don't do this.\n  Now, the Republicans had this budget, and they gave it a name over in \nthe House: ``The Path to Prosperity: Restoring America's Promise.'' \nWell, I took some liberty and wrote my own title. I think their budget \nis ``The Path to Poverty: Breaking America's Promise'' because that is \nwhat that budget does.\n  The Republican budget would end Medicare as we know it. A 65-year-old \nwho becomes eligible for Medicare would pay more than $12,000 in health \ncare costs the first year the plan goes into effect--twice as much as \nwhat they pay under current law. Imagine a senior citizen--a grandma or \ngreat-grandma--who maybe lives off Social Security, who is paying \n$6,000 for health care, is suddenly paying $12,000. We might as well \ntell her to forget it. She is going to have to get down on her knees \nand pray she doesn't get sick.\n  But that wasn't enough to pay for the tax cuts for their rich \nfriends, so their budget cuts Medicaid by 49 percent by 2030. By the \nway, a lot of that is paying for nursing homes for the poorest of the \npoor.\n  The Republican budget would cut education grant awards by one-half, \nso that 1.4 million students would lose access to financial aid. That \nis what this country has been about--giving hope to our young people, \nand hope means an education. So Pell grants, cut in half.\n  They say over and over: Washington doesn't have a tax problem, we \nhave a spending problem. Well, let's take a look at that. If we look at \nnondefense discretionary over the years, what we find when we add in \ninflation is that it hasn't grown at all, while the military spending \nhas gone up 74 percent. So, clearly, we have a roadmap just in terms of \nfairness that shows we can get to where we have to get.\n  Let's not keep cutting what we have already cut. Let's cut the waste, \nlet's cut the fraud, let's cut the abuse, and let's cut these tax \nexpenditures.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes, \nand then I will yield to my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  So defense spending, they may look at it, but they are not happy \nabout it even though it has gone up 74 percent over the last 10 years.\n  Now, again, we should look at Warren Buffett. Warren Buffett made the \npoint that he paid only a 17.7 percent tax on his $46 million in \nearnings while his receptionist paid 30 percent on her wages. Imagine, \nin 2008, the 400 richest income-tax filers paid an effective rate of \nabout 18 percent.\n  Take ExxonMobil: They paid an effective rate of 18 percent on $7 \nbillion, whereas the average family making a combined $100,000 had a \nhigher effective rate. Let's give tax breaks to the middle class, not \nto the wealthiest who have everything and more and whose children's \nchildren's children's children will be fine. This is America. This \nisn't prerevolutionary France, where the King had everything. If there \nwas a family supported by two teachers, and they made $106,000, they \nhad a higher tax rate than ExxonMobil. But, still, if we look around \nthe country at Republican legislators and governors, they are going \nafter the teachers--who are so wealthy--while the people who are making \nthe millions and the billions they give more and more to. I don't \nunderstand it. It is trickle down, I guess. Somehow somebody will spend \nsomething at the very top, and it will trickle down. That is all fine, \nbut they have enough to trickle down already, so we don't have to add \nto it.\n  A family supported by a truckdriver and a dental hygienist who made a \ncombined income of $107,000 had a higher tax rate than ExxonMobil.\n\n[[Page S4350]]\n\n  The tax break for corporate jets is $3 billion over 10 years. \nSubsidies to the biggest five oil companies are costing us $21 billion \nover 10 years.\n  So what I am saying is, we don't have to balance the budget on the \nbacks of the senior citizens who need their Medicare or on the students \nwho need their Pell grants. We don't need to do that.\n  I am the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. The \nHouse budget, which I say breaks America's promise, is so bad on \ntransportation, it cuts 36 percent across the board. Thousands and \nthousands of construction workers, whether they are in Utah or \nCalifornia or Maryland--or you name your town, your city--will be cut. \nThis is an area where there has been so much unemployment because of \nthe housing crisis that we could fill 20 Super Bowl stadiums with \nunemployed construction workers--2 million. That is how many there are.\n  So look at what President Clinton did. He increased taxes on the \nwealthiest and created tax incentives for small businesses. He invested \nin education, retirement savings, research and development, and the \nRepublicans fought us tooth and nail. As a matter of fact, Senator \nGrassley said at the time:\n\n       I really do not think it takes a rocket scientist to know \n     this will cost jobs.\n\n  That is what he said created 24 million jobs--23 million on the low \nside--and surpluses of $236 billion.\n  Let me conclude by saying this is a tough time in our history. We are \nat the precipice for the first time in my lifetime of hearing threats \nof defaulting on the full faith and credit of America. When we lift the \ndebt ceiling, we do it in order to pay for the debts that were \nincurred. Sadly for us, after having a surplus under Bill Clinton, the \npolicies of George W. Bush caused us to go into deep holes and deficit \nand debt. We were on the way to a great place, but never forget when \nGeorge W. Bush came out and said these surpluses we are running belong \nto the American people. What he meant was the rich people because that \nis who got the lion's share of that. So we can keep the tax rates low \nfor the middle class, we can make sure the wealthy pay their fair \nshare, we can come to the table and negotiate with an open heart and an \nopen mind and knowing well that we will not get everything each of us \nwants.\n  I will close by reading a quote from Ronald Reagan. President Reagan \nwrote the following:\n\n       The full consequences of a default--or even the serious \n     prospect of default--are impossible to predict and awesome to \n     contemplate. Denigration of the full faith and credit of the \n     United States would have substantial effects on the domestic \n     financial markets and on the value of the dollar in exchange \n     markets. The Nation can ill afford to allow such a result.\n\n  President Reagan was right. It is time to stop playing politics with \nthis, the greatest country that gave us everything we have ever hoped \nfor.\n  I say to Americans, call the Senate. Ask for a fair budget plan, with \nthe parties meeting each other halfway.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is nice to hear asking for a fair budget \nplan. We haven't had a budget from this administration now in almost \n800 days. They have control of the Senate. Yet we haven't seen a budget \nfrom this administration.\n  I get a little tired of the Obama approach toward shared sacrifice. \nShared sacrifice is something. It sounds good. But I would prefer the \nRepublican approach to shared prosperity, and that is what I think we \nare all about.\n  When we talk about what shared sacrifice is, think about this. It is \npretty irrefutable that the bottom 51 percent of all wage earners of \nall households do not pay income taxes. The top 1 percent of the so-\ncalled wealthy pay 38 percent of all income taxes; the top 10 percent \nare paying 70 percent of all income tax; the top 50 percent pay \nsomewhere near 90 percent of all income taxes; 51 percent don't pay \nanything.\n  But Democrats say, well, they pay payroll taxes. Everybody does that \nbecause that is Social Security, and they pay about one-third of what \nthey are going to take out over the years in Social Security. On \nObamaCare, a family of four earning over $80,000 a year gets subsidies. \nThink about that. And that is what we call the poor? We wonder why the \nmoney doesn't go far enough? When are we going to wake up and realize \nthat the other side just spends and spends and spends. They want to tax \nand tax and tax so they can spend some more. My gosh. When are we going \nto wake up in this country and realize they are spending us into \noblivion?\n  I hear how they are so caring for the poor and so forth. The poor \nneed jobs, and they also need to share some of the responsibility. We \ndon't want the very poor people who are in poverty to pay income \ntaxes--but 51 percent of all households? That is going up, by the way, \nbecause of our friend down in the White House and his allies.\n  I wish I didn't like him so much. I would like to be able to let go \nhere. I like him personally, and I want him to be successful, but he is \nnot going to be successful by just taxing the daylights out of \neverybody around here.\n  This Congress is currently engaged in as consequential a political \ndebate as this Nation has seen in decades. Whether and what we raise \nthe Nation's debt ceiling is a question that has consumed the markets \nin the Nation.\n  I serve the people of Utah and I hear about this issue every day and \nthe sustainability of a government that has grown far beyond any \nreasonable or constitutional limit and the cost of paying for all this \ngovernment is foremost on the minds of tax-paying citizens who will be \nleft holding the bag, even when President Obama is back in Hyde Park \nand Members of Congress no longer serve. The decision to spend less is \nonly for a moment, but the debt incurred to pay for these government \nprograms lasts forever. Fifty-one percent of all households don't pay \nincome taxes.\n  The Democrats say: Well, they pay payroll taxes. Yes, they do--\neverybody does because that is Social Security--and 23 million of them \nget refundable tax credits that are more than they pay in payroll \ntaxes.\n  I wish I could report to my constituents that Washington is serious \nabout addressing this spending problem. Unfortunately, in the last \nweek, we seem to have hit a new low. President Obama's contribution \nlast week was a press conference temper tantrum, where he offered \npolicy proposals that might appeal to his leftwing base but will do \nnothing to avoid our coming national bankruptcy.\n  Not to be outdone, Democratic leadership in the Senate has offered a \nnonbinding resolution designed solely to score some cheap political \npoints that will jazz up the activist left through demagogic class \nwarfare against individuals with high incomes. He is going to raise $3 \nbillion over 10 years by taxing jet planes. It would take 1,000 years \nto reach what we have as a deficit for this year just from that one tax \nto jack up enough money to pay for just the deficit this year.\n  Facing a full-blown debt crisis, this is how the Senate Democrats, \nfollowing the President's lead, have chosen to spend this week, \ndebating a nonbinding resolution. Episodes such as this leave me \nconvinced the only real solution to our Nation's spending problem is a \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment. Only a specific \nconstitutional restraint will force Congress to make the tough \ndecisions necessary to restrain the size of government, restore the \nintegrity of the States, and protect the liberties of the American \ncitizens and taxpayers.\n  To demonstrate my commitment to restoring constitutional limits on \nthe Federal Government, I have signed the cut, cap, and balance pledge. \nAlong with a growing number of my colleagues in the Senate, Members of \nthe House, grassroots groups, and Presidential candidates, I have \ncommitted myself to cutting spending, capping spending, and passing a \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment as a condition for any debt \nlimit increase.\n  As this debate over how best to address our growing debt and annual \ndeficits continues, I wish to address a technical but critical matter \nin these negotiations. I am talking about tax expenditures. I am \nranking member on the Senate Finance Committee and I know a little bit \nabout these. Over the next few days I am going to discuss\n\n[[Page S4351]]\n\nthis matter of tax expenditures and debt. Today, I am going to talk in \ngeneral about what a tax expenditure is and what a tax expenditure is \nnot. I will next turn to the tax policy areas implicated by current tax \nexpenditures.\n  For instance, home ownership is favored in our tax base with a tax \nexpenditure. There is a deduction for home mortgage interest, a \ndeduction for real property taxes, and an exclusion for income from \nhome sales. These are tax expenditures.\n  The Tax Code also encourages charitable contributions. Charitable \ndeductions are available to citizens when they give to a nonprofit \ncrisis pregnancy center, when they put money in the basket at church or \nwhen they give to their alma mater, just to mention a few charitable \ndonations.\n  In a third speech, I will attempt to shed some light on a widespread \nmisconception about tax expenditures. That misconception is that tax \nexpenditures disproportionately benefit high income taxpayers. But \nlet's not get ahead of ourselves.\n  My remarks are remarks about what a tax expenditure \nis. Unfortunately, my remarks are also largely about Democrats' plans \nto increase taxes. President Obama and his liberal allies are calling \nfor a balanced approach on a revenue piece to deficit reduction. They \nwant shared sacrifice. I want shared prosperity.\n\n  We hear this from the press all the time. New revenues need to be a \npart of any deal to reduce the deficit. These are simply code words for \na tax hike. I guarantee this. If we raise taxes, my friends on the \nother side will spend every dime of it. That is how they have kept \nthemselves in power. Yet claiming they are helping the poor. Are 51 \npercent of our households so poor they can't participate in saving this \ncountry?\n  It is clear the professional left is insisting that President Obama \ninclude tax increases in any negotiated agreement to raise the debt \nceiling. Threading this tax hike needle through an electorate resistant \nto giving the government more money to spend is no easy task. Although \nhis campaign team talks a big game about the popularity of tax \nincreases, the President's own words suggest otherwise.\n  Last week, in a shameful display of class warfare, the President did \nspecifically call for some tax increases on the rich. That includes \n800,000 small businesses, by the way, where 70 percent of the jobs come \nfrom. But that is the exception that proves the rule. By and large, the \nPresident avoids the effectual truth of his mission to get rid of tax \nexpenditures--massive tax increases on the middle-class American \nfamilies, to whom he promised immunity from tax increases when he was \nrunning for President. Instead, he and other members of the party of \ntax increases refer to tax expenditures as spending through the Tax \nCode. How seriously should we take his rhetoric?\n  When the President said he wanted to address the Nation's debt by \nreducing spending through the Tax Code, it proved too much for even Jon \nStewart. This is Stewart's analysis of the President's contention that \nwe could reduce the deficit by attacking spending through the Tax Code:\n\n       You manage to talk about a tax hike as a spending \n     reduction. Can we afford that and the royalty checks you are \n     going to have to send to George Orwell? That's the weirdest \n     way of ``just say tax hike.'' That's like saying, I am not \n     going on a diet. I'm going to add the calories to my excluded \n     food intake.\n\n  That was Jon Stewart. He hit the nail on the head. For sure it is \neasy to make fun. But what the President is trying to do with tax \nexpenditures is no laughing matter.\n  Liberals talk about tax expenditures as though they were just getting \nrid of wasteful spending. First, as a legal matter, tax expenditures \nare not expended. Outlays are checks cut from the Treasury Department \nand are defined as spending under the Congressional Budget Act. Yet \nmost tax expenditures only lose revenue and do not include an outlay \nportion. Tax expenditures that only lose revenue contain no spending as \ndefined by the Congressional Budget Act and as scored by the official \nscorekeepers for Congress, the Joint Committee on Taxation and the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  Second, as a policy matter, when it comes to tax expenditures, one \nperson's loophole is another person's opportunity to save for college \nand retirement, finance a home, and tithe to your church.\n  Here is the bottom line. Taking away or reducing tax expenditures is \na tax increase, unless a tax cut of an equal or greater amount is \nenacted.\n  One crucial myth I would like to dispel is that tax expenditures are \nspending. This chart, ``Revenue Loss Does Not Equal Spending,'' the \nFederal Government cannot spend money it never touched and never \npossessed.\n  What tax expenditures do is let taxpayers keep more of their own \nmoney. The American people are the ones who earn their money through \ntheir ideas, their risks, and their labor. Whether we are talking about \na successful business owner or a part-time worker just starting out, \nthe money they earn is theirs. It is their money, and only by their \nconsent is the government permitted to take some of it in taxation to \npay for certain public goods.\n  But Democrats have a different view. It is this view--one that is \nfundamentally at odds with our classical liberal Constitution and our \nFounders' respect for property rights--that contributes to the \nconfusion over tax expenditures.\n  Liberals think that all of the money that you earn belongs to the \ngovernment. You have no independent right to the fruit of your own \nlabors, because only by dint of big government are you ever able to \nmake something of yourself. This view is foreign to most Americans--\nRepublicans or Democrats. It is a view that Alexander Hamilton and \nBenjamin Franklin and Abraham Lincoln would take issue with. But this \nis the political philosophy of the modern left.\n  So when you hear tax hike proponents come to the Senate floor and say \nwe are giving these businesses and individuals all this money in tax \nexpenditures, they are incorrectly assuming that the government has \nthat money to give in the first place. The government does not have \nthis money to give. That money belongs first to the people that earn \nit--those businesses and individuals who are the American taxpayers.\n  There are critical differences between spending and tax expenditures. \nFor one thing, the government never touches the money that a taxpayer \nkeeps due to benefitting from a tax expenditure; whereas, with spending \nthe government actually collects money from taxpayers and then spends \nit.\n  Here is a more telling difference. Reducing or eliminating a tax \nexpenditure without lowering rates enough to reach a revenue neutral \nlevel will cause the size of the Federal Government to grow, while \nreducing or eliminating spending causes the size of the Federal \nGovernment to shrink.\n  I am open to looking at eliminating or reducing some tax expenditures \nas part of comprehensive tax reform but only if tax rates are lowered \nenough to reach a revenue neutral level. Alternatively, reduction or \nelimination of tax expenditures could be balanced with new tax cuts \nthat are of equal or greater value to the revenue generated by the \neliminated expenditures. But if tax expenditures are reduced or \neliminated without tax rates being lowered enough to reach a revenue \nneutral level, that is a tax increase, plain and simple.\n  We have made clear that as a matter of law and political theory, tax \nexpenditures are not spending.\n  Now let's turn to an examination of what they are.\n  Fortunately, we have definitions available.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation generally defines tax expenditures as \ndeliberate departures from generally accepted concepts of net income, \nusually by way of special exemptions, deductions, credits or \nexclusions. Therefore, tax expenditures generally arise for individual \nincome taxes and corporate income taxes.\n  The Treasury Department differs from the Joint Committee on Taxation \nslightly in how it defines a tax expenditure. For example, the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation labels deferral as a tax expenditure but Treasury \ndoes not. But whichever definition one uses, it is clear that the \nPresident and the liberal proponents of tax increases are using their \nown politically motivated dictionary.\n  Tax expenditures have been erroneously described by many as \nloopholes. This is deliberately inaccurate.\n\n[[Page S4352]]\n\nA loophole is something that Congress did not intend and would \ngenerally shut down, at least going forward, once it learned of the \nloophole. Tax expenditures, by contrast, were generally placed by \nCongress into the tax code deliberately. For example, the largest tax \nexpenditure is the exclusion for employer-provided health insurance and \nbenefits. The second-largest tax expenditure is the home mortgage \ninterest deduction. We all know why they are there, and they are there \nfor good reason.\n  Tax expenditures are not loopholes. We are not talking here about \nsome fancy tax scheme that a lawyer or accountant has discovered and \nnow promotes to his clients as a way to game the system. These are \nbroad-based tax incentives that benefit many Americans. The deduction \nfor charitable contributions is not some loophole. It was a deliberate \ninclusion in the code that acknowledges the need for religious citizens \nto contribute to their churches.\n  Even some of the smaller dollar tax expenditures were designed by \nCongress to go to particular industries or types of taxpayers--for \nexample, the tax expenditure to encourage the purchase of corporate \njets that Democrats included in the stimulus and that the President is \nnow criticizing.\n  Whether you agree with these particular tax expenditures or not, an \nhonest debate requires recognition that they were designed by Congress \nwith economic or social goals in mind and are not inadvertent \nloopholes.\n  As a matter of law, policy and constitutional government, I \nfundamentally disagree with those who are pushing these tax increases \nas part of a deal to raise the debt ceiling.\n  Our problem is spending that has grown out of control, not a lack of \nrevenue.\n  According to CBO's June 2011 long term budget outlook, taxes are \nalready heading higher than they have historically been. From 1971 to \n2010, revenues as a percentage of GDP have averaged 18 percent. Since \nthe post-World War II era, from 1946 to 2010, revenues have averaged \n17.7 percent of GDP.\n  Yet CBO also projects that revenues as a percentage of GDP will \nexceed 20 percent by 2021. Even if all the bipartisan tax relief \ncontained in the 2001 and 2003 tax acts is extended, revenues as a \npercent of GDP will increase to 18.4 percent.\n  So I ask the question: With taxes already going higher than where \nthey have historically been, should we raise them even more?\n  For me, the answer is no.\n  I know that most Utahns would agree, I believe most people in this \ncountry would agree, and I suspect that even most Democrats would as \nwell. They certainly would if President Obama and the liberals who pose \nas advocates for the middle class came clean about just how high taxes \non working families would have to go to pay for the hard core left's \npreferred level of government. The numbers do not lie.\n  The deficit is a symptom of out-of-control spending that has grown \ndramatically in recent years and is reaching crisis levels.\n  It is not a result of too little in taxes. Democrats can close all \nthe loopholes they want, and it still won't balance the books.\n  And the Democrats who are talking about the need to close loopholes \nand eliminate spending through the Tax Code need to be asked which \nmiddle class tax relief they want to get rid of as part of their \ndeficit reduction plan.\n  Do they want to get rid of the charitable deduction or maybe the \nmortgage interest deduction?\n  Maybe they want to go after people's 401(k)s or IRAs or 529s.\n  What is it going to be?\n  Let me say something here. I am very concerned about where we are \ngoing. We have risen this year to 25.3 percent of GDP in spending. The \nlast time we hit that figure was in 1945 at the height of the Second \nWorld War, when the government was taking over almost everything to \nkeep us from losing that war. It is certainly over 23 percent right \nnow. What is it going to be?\n  At a press event tantrum last week, the President answered absolutely \nnone of these questions. He needs to. He needs to get serious about \ncutting spending.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the division \nof time under the quorum call be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, it has been almost 800 days since the \nSenate Democratic majority produced a budget. I do not expect one to \nappear from the majority today, but at least the Democratic majority \ncanceled the Fourth of July recess to work toward an agreement to deal \nwith our budgetary crisis. With the possibility of default looming, our \ncaucus, led by Senator Sessions, has been pushing the Democratic \nmajority to keep the Chamber working over the recent recesses. After \nrefusing past calls to remain in session, the Democratic majority \nfinally recognized that we cannot sort this out if we are not here to \nfocus on it. I, for one, am glad the Democratic majority listened.\n  The American people deserve an honest and open conversation about the \nvery difficult situation we are in. More importantly, they deserve a \ncommitment that we will work in good faith to end this impasse. \nUnfortunately, I am not sure we will get that from the Democratic \nmajority or the President. We are in session this week specifically to \ndeal with the budget ceiling crisis, and the only vote the majority \nleader had scheduled from the outset was a resolution on the Libya \nconflict. I say ``had'' because the Democratic majority rightly \ncanceled that vote after intense pressure from our side to keep the \nSenate focused on the debt ceiling issue.\n  President Obama has been absent from this debate for months. Only \nrecently he started showing up to tell Americans that his solution to \nthe crisis is raising taxes instead of cutting spending. Meanwhile, we \nhave inched closer and closer toward defaulting on our obligations.\n  It is interesting that we are here today specifically to work out a \nsolution to our financial crisis 1 week after scenes of Athens on fire \nas a result of rioting over Greece's own debt crisis dominated the \nairwaves. One week after passing tough austerity measures to secure \nfurther financial aid--the very same measures that sparked the \nrioting--the Greek Government is far from out of the woods. Standard & \nPoor's says the proposals for restructuring Greek debt would \neffectively constitute a default instead of helping the country avoid \none.\n  I mention all of this not to generate fear but, rather, to shed light \non the gravity of our situation. We could very well end up like Greece \nif we do not handle this crisis properly. This is the last thing we \nwant to experience in our great country, and that is why we need to \nreform our fiscal policy in the way that we have done business in the \npast. There is too much at stake not to take action now. We are at the \npoint where our Nation can no longer borrow money. The IMF has harsh \nwords for our soaring budget deficits, and credit rating agencies such \nas Moody's and S have threatened to downgrade our government's AAA \nrating.\n  President Obama likes to blame our economic mess on the previous \nadministration, but the reality is that over the past 2 years, our debt \nhas increased 35 percent under his watch. That is not the previous \nadministration's fault, nor is it their fault that the annual deficit \nis now three times greater than the highest deficit during the Bush \nyears. If American families ran their households like Washington runs \nits budget, the utilities would be shut off and the collection agencies \nwould be knocking on their doors. If they maxed\n\n[[Page S4353]]\n\nout a credit card, they wouldn't have the luxury of telling someone \nelse to pay their bills. Yet this is what the President is demanding by \nsticking to tax increase proposals.\n\n  I said this last week, but since the President continues to push tax \nincreases as the answer, I will say it again: President Obama, take tax \nhikes off the table. We got into this mess by excessively spending. We \ncan't fix the problem unless we stop excessively spending.\n  The White House remains focused on tax hikes. If we look at their \nagenda, we can see why. The big-ticket items they have already passed, \nspecifically the President's stimulus and health care bills, have put \nour country on the path of unprecedented levels of spending that will \nkeep us in the red for my lifetime, my children's lives, and well \nbeyond. The administration's refusal to cut excessive spending, much of \nwhich the Nation never asked for, will put us on the course for a \nGreek-like catastrophe. Without action, annual interest payments on the \nnational debt alone will exceed 40 percent of GDP by 2080.\n  So with that in mind, the President is working behind closed doors \nwith his allies in Congress to figure out ways to raise revenue. As we \nall know, revenue is a Washington euphemism for taxes. Instead of \nfurther exasperating our economy by raising taxes and putting us in a \nposition that will affect our recovery and our Nation's future, the \nsolution must be tailored to the problem. Washington does not have a \nrevenue problem; we have a spending problem. Any proposal that does not \nstart in that truth should be taken off the table.\n  If the White House-engineered agreement for raising the debt ceiling \ndoes not include significant cuts and a spending cap mechanism, such as \na balanced budget amendment, to prevent us from having to raise it \nagain, then I can assure you they will not get my vote. Anything short \nof that is irresponsible. I know I am not alone in these demands. Many \nof my colleagues feel just as strongly and will not back down either. \nThe President and the Senate Democratic majority need to understand we \nare committed to these principles because millions of Americans feel \nexactly the same as we do. We are here to do the people's work. Let's \nlisten to them instead of trying to tell the people what is best for \nthem.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n\n                         Collective Bargaining\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, we just went through the July 4 \nweekend celebrating our independence on July 4, 1776. On July 5, 76 \nyears ago, something else happened that was very important in our \ncountry and very symbolic of what we stand for as a nation. I heard the \nPresiding Officer from Maryland talk a moment ago about the values we \nhold as a nation and how important it is to convey those values in \neverything we do in this body.\n  What happened on July 5, 1935, was President Roosevelt signed \nsomething called the National Labor Relations Act, and we know what \ncame out of the National Labor Relations Act and the other reforms of \nthat era, in addition to Social Security and the CCC and some other \nthings, was the concept and the implementation of collective \nbargaining. Collective bargaining is a right the American people have \nto join voluntarily in a collective bargaining unit--generally a labor \nunion--and negotiate on behalf of hundreds or thousands of fellow \nworkers for wages, health care, pensions, vacation days, and other \nthings.\n  I mentioned that because just late last week something remarkable \nhappened in my State of Ohio. In Columbus, in response to the State \nlegislature taking away those collective bargaining rights and a \nradical departure from 75 years of collective bargaining, national \nprivate sector success, and 30 years of Ohio collective bargaining for \npublic employees' success, the legislature passed a radical act earlier \nthis year to take away those collective bargaining rights for public \nemployees. We know it is a direct assault on the middle class. We know \nit will mean a declining and shrinking middle class. We know the \nbiggest threat to this country today, to our economy, to our country, \nand to our country's families is that the middle class is shrinking and \nthe middle class is declining. I call them radicals because it is a \ndirect hit, a direct violation of what we stand for as a nation: the \nright to organize and bargain collectively and voluntarily.\n  We have seen these public employees--and who knows what is next--have \nthose rights taken away. We know what will be next: prevailing wage, \nthe right to work--all the kinds of things that procorporate \nconservative politicians have tried to do for some years. We basically \nhad a consensus in this country. We had a consensus on Medicare, a \nconsensus around minimum wage, a consensus about safe drinking water \nand clean air, a consensus about collective bargaining rights on which \n80 percent, 90 percent of the country agreed. We had disagreements \naround the edges on the environment or safe drinking water, Medicare, \nbut by and large there was a consensus on what we did here. What we saw \nearlier this year in Ohio was an assault directly on those values. They \nare going after collective bargaining rights.\n  In another piece of legislation they are going after voter rights. In \nanother piece of legislation they are going after women's rights. In \nWashington they are going after Medicare.\n  Let me go back to collective bargaining. What happened last week is \nsomething remarkable. In Ohio, unlike many States, after a bill passes \nand becomes law and is signed by the Governor, there are 90 days to \ngather signatures. I believe in Ohio's case 250,000 signatures are \nneeded to place on the ballot a referendum. In other words, if this \ngoes on the ballot, the voters have a chance to repeal that bill.\n  When the radicals in the legislature took away collective bargaining \nrights and the Republican Governor signed it, a group of Ohio citizens \nput on the ballot a repeal of taking away collective bargaining rights. \nThey needed about 250,000 signatures. You know how many they had? They \nsubmitted last week 1.3 million signatures. Mr. President, 1.3 million \npeople signed saying: We want this to go on the ballot to repeal this \nradical measure of the State legislature Republicans. No Democrats in \neither House voted for this to repeal what they were doing. That's 1.3 \nmillion signatures.\n  In fact, they brought a truckload of boxes of signatures. In the \nOffice of the Secretary of State they had to send in a structural \nengineer, literally, to make sure the floor--I think it is on the 14th \nfloor--could support the weight of these 1.3 million signatures.\n  I note Senator Cardin and Senator Whitehouse, when they come to the \nfloor, oftentimes talk about the overreach, the radical nature of what \nconservative far-right politicians are doing in this country right now. \nThe overreach, going after bargaining rights, going after Medicare, \ngoing after minimum wage, putting tax breaks--tax breaks are really \nearmarks for the rich in the Tax Code--all of these kinds of things \nthey are trying to do are unravelling so much of what we fought for as \na nation for so many years.\n  The good news in Ohio this week: 1.3 million people said they have \nhad enough. We are not going to stand for this. We are not going to \ntolerate this radical overreach that Governor Kasich and legislators \nare doing in Columbus and House Republicans and far too many Members of \nthe Senate are doing in this body. That is good news. I think we move \nforward from there.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me thank the senior Senator from Ohio, \nMr. Brown, for his leadership for working families. We were colleagues \nin the House of Representatives and there was no more effective voice \non behalf of working families than Congressman Brown, now Senator \nBrown. I just want to thank him for bringing these issues to our \nattention.\n  He is absolutely right, there has been an all-out assault on the \ndignity of\n\n[[Page S4354]]\n\nworking families in this country at all levels. I will talk a little \nbit about the budget deliberations because I believe here, also, we \nfind an assault on the middle-income families. As President Kennedy \nsaid, ``to govern is to choose.'' We have never had a clearer choice of \ntwo different visions of America.\n  I wish to talk a little bit about that because I know we are all \nworking hard to reach a fair compromise, and I am one of those who \nbelieve the final agreement will not be what the Democrats want or what \nthe Republicans want. We will have to do a compromise. But I think the \npeople of this Nation need to know the types of choices we are making \nhere in Washington.\n  I see the Republicans--and I have heard some of the speeches that \nwere recently given on the floor--are really trying to protect the very \nwealthy, the millionaires. In the Republican budget, millionaires would \nget another $200,000 of tax cuts, where at the same time that budget \nwould cost our seniors, who live on fixed incomes, an extra $6,000 a \nyear in health care costs if their plan on Medicare were to become law.\n  Those are the types of choices we are being asked to make here, being \nasked to continue the gas subsidies--the tax subsidies for the five \nbiggest oil companies in this country. That is what the Republican \nbudget would protect. They would protect those tax breaks. Let me \nremind you that those five companies in the last decade made $1 \ntrillion in profits, that during the time we saw escalating gas prices \nhere and our economy being hurt by it, people could not afford to fill \nup their gas tanks. Yet at the same time those five oil companies had \nrecord profits. So we say: Let's take away the government subsidies. \nYet the choice for our Republican friends is to say: No, we can't do \nthat. Instead, they look at cutting nutrition programs and Pell grants \nto make it more expensive for children to be able to go to college or \nnutrition programs to try to have a healthier America.\n  Well, what we are pushing for is a balanced approach in how we deal \nwith this budget deficit. We could talk a long time about how we got \nhere, the policies of the previous administration. Just 10 years ago, \nwe had these large surpluses. The previous administration cut taxes not \nonce but twice, the second time using the credit card in order to pay \nfor those tax cuts, went to war not in one country but in two countries \nand used the credit card in order to pay for those wars, and are \nwondering why we have all this debt today.\n  Well, it is our responsibility to take care of this deficit because \nthis deficit is affecting the strength of America. We know we need to \nhave a balanced approach in order to do it. I, along with the Presiding \nOfficer, am a member of the Budget Committee. We are working hard on \nthe Budget Committee to come up with a way we can deal with it.The \nDemocrats on that committee are united that there is a better way than \nthe Republican budget that came over from the House of Representatives.\n  Let me talk a little bit about whether this is class warfare. I have \nheard that mentioned many times. This might surprise you. I might agree \nwith my Republican friends. I think the Republican budget is an attack \non class. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said the \nRepublican budget ``would produce the largest redistribution of income \nfrom the bottom to the top in modern U.S. history.'' We are asking the \npoor and working families to contribute so the wealthy can get more tax \nbreaks. That is just wrong.\n  What we want to see is a balanced approach, an approach that says: \nLook, this deficit is very serious. We have to ask and save money \nwherever we can to balance the Federal budget. It starts by looking at \nour domestic spending. We have been willing to say: Look, for programs \nthat are not high-priority programs, we have to cut back on them. \nPrograms that are not working we are going to have to eliminate. Let's \nget rid of duplicate programs.\n  We say we are prepared to do that. But you also have to look at the \nnondomestic programs--our military programs and security programs. We \nknow we are in the process now of bringing our combat troops home from \nAfghanistan. That can produce savings. Let's use that to reduce the \nbudget deficit. There are ways we can get this deficit down.\n  I was listening to one of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle talk about the so-called tax expenditures. Let me put this in \ncontext for one moment. Our Tax Code spends about $1.4 trillion a year \nin special provisions to give special breaks to different taxpayers. I \nthink none of us are saying all of those should be eliminated. What we \nare saying is, when you find tax loopholes, when you find shelters, \nwhen you find tax havens, let's get rid of them.\n  I have taken to the floor to talk about two areas where I think there \nis broad consensus. The ethanol subsidy--we do not need it any longer. \nIt is questionable whether we ever needed it. The industry will do just \nfine without the subsidy. But let me tell you what the subsidy causes. \nIt causes my poultry farmers in Maryland to pay a lot more for their \ncorn, costing jobs in Maryland. So there is a tax subsidy we can get \nrid of. We had a vote on the floor, and it was quite obvious that the \noverwhelming majority agrees with that. Why can't we use that for \ndeficit reduction?\n  We talked about the gas industry. Why are we giving them subsidies? \nThere is no need for them. So we can take those tax shelters, we can \ntake those tax havens, and we can take those loopholes and use that.\n  And, yes, I think there is a question as to why millionaires are \ngoing to continue to get a tax cut that was meant to be temporary in \nnature when we need as much revenue as we can get to pay off our bills. \nI think there is an issue here as to whether that is fair. How do we \ntell students they have to pay more for college, how do we tell \nfamilies that fewer will be able to go to Head Start, how do we tell \nour seniors they have to pay more and yet we tell the millionaires they \nare going to get additional tax cuts? That is not fair, and it does not \nmake good sense for our economy.\n  There is a better way. I know my colleague from Rhode Island will \nspeak next. He also serves on the Budget Committee. We Democrats have a \nbetter way of doing this. We know how we can reduce the budget deficit \nby even more than the Simpson-Bowles deficit commission proposed, where \nwe can bring in the deficit and bring it under control to make it a \nreasonable amount of our economy rather than uncontrolled, as it is \ntoday. We can do that by bringing in not just domestic spending but \nalso our defense spending in order to reduce spending more in this \ncountry.\n  We can do that, and we can do it in a way that protects the integrity \nof Medicare. We do not want our seniors at the risk of private \ninsurance companies. We do not want private insurance companies telling \nour seniors when they can get care and when they cannot. We tried that \nbefore we created Medicare, and we know the problems that were created \nby that. So in our budget, we want to protect the integrity of Social \nSecurity and Medicare and the programs that are critically important to \nour seniors.\n  We will close the tax loopholes. We will eliminate shelters. We will \nmake sure everybody is part of the solution. We can do it in a way that \nwill help build this great Nation.\n  Let me tell you what our objectives are, quite frankly. Our \nobjectives are to manage our deficit, bring it down, bring it under \ncontrol in a real way, to protect those who are most vulnerable in our \ncountry, and to invest in America's future so we can create more jobs, \nso we can continue to build our roads and our bridges, our water \nsystems, so we can continue to invest in education, and, yes, so we can \nprotect our Federal workforce and pay them decent salaries and \ncompensation benefits. We can do all that. But if we are going to get \nthe job done, Democrats and Republicans have to be honest in their \ndebate and their compromise. It will not be what one side wants. We are \ngoing to have to compromise for the good of the American people.\n  I took the time today to share with the people of Maryland and the \nNation where I believe our vision should be in regard to the budget of \nthis Nation. I hope we are able to achieve those objectives because I \nreally do believe our children's and grandchildren's future depends on \nus getting this right. If we work together, we can pass a budget that \nis in the best interests of the American people and will allow our \neconomy to grow to create jobs, which\n\n[[Page S4355]]\n\nis the best answer to deal with our deficit.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am honored to follow my \ndistinguished colleague from Maryland in this discussion about our \npriorities as we address the debt limit we are approaching. I think \nLeader Reid was wise to choose to cancel the scheduled Fourth of July \nrecess so we could continue to work toward an agreement to prevent \ndefaulting by the United States on our government debt and the \nfinancial consequences that would ensue here in America and around the \nworld.\n  As we negotiate an end to this debt limit standoff, we also, \nobviously, have to address our looming budget deficits and our looming \ndebt, which threaten to cripple our potential for economic growth in \nyears to come. Where we are on this, of course, is that President \nClinton put our budget on course to permanent surpluses. We would be a \ndebt-free nation right now if the predictions the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office had put in place when President Clinton \nleft office had been kept. In fact, there were changes. President Bush \nand a Republican Congress squandered away those surpluses with \nunnecessary tax cuts and unwise spending increases. Our multitrillion-\ndollar deficits have resulted. We must now fix the budget and bring it \nback into balance.\n  So where are we in this standoff? Well, we need to cut spending. \nDemocrats and Republicans agree on that. We need to protect ordinary \nfamilies who enjoy ordinary levels of income from tax increases. \nDemocrats and Republicans agree on that. The disagreement is whether we \nalso need to raise some revenues in other areas to help balance the \nbudget, areas such as oil and gas and ethanol subsidies, closing \ncorporate tax loopholes, and putting an end to high-income tax-dodge \nschemes.\n  On that front, I rise in support of Leader Reid's resolution calling \nfor a deficit reduction package that includes a ``more meaningful \ncontribution'' from millionaires and billionaires.\n  The Republicans are threatening that they would rather let this \ngovernment default on its obligations than to what they call ``raise \nrevenues'' by requiring the wealthy to pay their fair share. Just last \nweek, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell called on President \nObama to take any raised revenues ``off the table'' and to balance the \nbudget solely on spending cuts that affect the middle class and lower \nincome families. In an opinion piece on cnn.com, Senator McConnell \nproclaimed that ``tax hikes can't pass the Congress.''\n  Well, let's pull the curtain back and take a little glimpse behind it \nas to whom the Republicans are fighting so hard to protect.\n  As shown in this picture I have in the Chamber, here is a building in \nNew York City on Park Avenue, the Helmsley Building. Because this \nbuilding is large enough to have its very own ZIP Code, we know from \nactual IRS information--not projections, not guesses, not conclusions \ndrawn from rates; from actual paid-in IRS information--that the wealthy \nand successful individuals and corporations that call this building \nhome paid a 14.7-percent total Federal tax rate in the last year they \nhave done the calculation, 2007. That is lower than the actual tax \nrate, on average, of the New York City janitor or doorman or security \nguard who would work in this building. It is upside down. The people \nwho serve the occupants of this building pay a higher tax rate than the \noccupants of this majestic building. The tax gimmicks that let those \noccupants pay a lower rate than the people who take care of the doors \nand the cleaning and the security for them--that is what the \nRepublicans are fighting to protect.\n  This problem is not just a fluke in the Helmsley Building. Each year, \nthe Internal Revenue Service publishes a report that adds up all the \ntaxes paid by the 400 highest income earning Americans. I spoke earlier \nthis year--several times, actually--on last year's report, which \nincluded data from 2007, like the same year as for the Helmsley \nBuilding. In that year, these super-high-income earners, making, on \naverage, $\\1/3\\ billion, approximately--billion with a ``b''--paid a \nlower tax rate in 2007--the 400 of them did, on average--than an \naverage hospital orderly who is a single payer pushing a cart down the \nhalls of a Rhode Island hospital at night.\n  In May, the IRS published updated data on the top 400 income earners \nfor 2008. Let's take a look at the status of the top 400 earners in \nthat more recent year. Well, they are down from $\\1/3\\ billion, on \naverage, to over $\\1/4\\ billion each. Certainly we can applaud that \nkind of success in America. That is definitely the American dream come \ntrue. But, on average, they paid an average tax rate of 18.2 percent. \nThat is what they actually paid. That is what they put into the IRS. \nOnce you get through all the tax dodges, all the different schemes, all \nthe different deductions, all the different rates, when you actually \nput the pen to the paper at the bottom line, it is 18.2 percent.\n  We spent a lot of time around here debating whether the top income \ntax rate should be 35 percent or 39.6 percent. Folks, that is not what \nthey are paying. The Tax Code is so filled with special provisions that \ntend to exclusively or disproportionately benefit the wealthy that the \nhighest 400 income earners, earning more than $\\1/4\\ billion in 1 year, \npaid an average tax rate of 18.2 percent.\n  This means that the 400 highest earning individuals in the Nation, in \n2008, paid the same effective tax rate as a truckdriver in Rhode \nIsland. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, on average, an \nordinary truckdriver earns $40,200, which is about the place in the Tax \nCode, on the way up, where you first hit paying 18.2 percent of your \nincome in taxes.\n  So what the Republicans are asking as part of the debt limit \ncompromise is that we cut employment and job training support now, at a \ntime of record joblessness, while they continue to fight to make sure \nthat people making a quarter of a billion dollars a year pay lower \nFederal tax rates than average middle-class families.\n  Here is another building that has a little story to tell. This is a \nbuilding called Ugland House. It is over in the Cayman Islands. This \nbuilding does not look like much. It is pretty nondescript. But over \n18,000 corporations claim to be doing business out of this building--\n18,000 out of that little building. Clearly what is going on is that \nthose corporations are hiding through shell companies, phony corporate \nidentities that they and wealthy taxpayers use to hide assets and play \ntax games with the IRS.\n  This kind of mischief down in the Cayman Islands and elsewhere \nthrough these tax dodges is estimated to cost us as much as $100 \nbillion every year. As part of a debt limit compromise, the Republicans \nare asking us to cut America's investments in science, cut America's \ninvestments in technology at the same time they are fighting to protect \ncorporations that hide in offshore tax havens so that the honest \nAmerican taxpayer has to pick up the burden for them. That is what they \nare fighting for when you pull back the curtain.\n  When all is said and done, everyone, Democrat and Republican, agrees \nthat there needs to be cuts. And everyone, Republican and Democrat, \nagrees there should be no tax increases on ordinary middle-class \nfamilies. Those concerns are not at issue. Where is the dispute? What \nis the blockade? Again, pull back the curtain and you will see that the \nRepublicans are willing to let us as a nation default for the first \ntime in our history on our debt, which would devastate our economy, all \nto defend tax rates for millionaires and billionaires that are lower \nthan those paid by regular hardworking Americans; all to defend \noffshore tax havens that are used to evade taxes while ordinary \nfamilies are expected to pay their taxes; all to defend corporate and \nspecial interest tax loopholes, earmarks for the wealthy and well-\nconnected. That is where they have chosen to stand their ground. That \nis where they have chosen to pick a fight.\n  As our Nation rushes toward the August 2 deadline and the agreement \ndeadline before August 2 when we must have something in place in order \nto get the President's signature on a bill by August 2--as we rush \ntoward that, as the world's economy and America's economy are imperiled \nby the threat of our debt limit not being lifted, what are they \nfighting for? That is what they are fighting for, for the \nsuperprivileged, for the super well-connected, for the tax dodges they \ntake\n\n[[Page S4356]]\n\nadvantage of, and for the lower rates the superrich pay compared to the \nrest of all of us. Those are the interests that Republicans are \nprotecting when they reject any revenue increases to bring down our \nunsustainable deficit. They say it is tax increases they are against. \nWell, the answer to that should be Americans asking the question back: \nTax increases for who? Because if it is tax increases for the guy who \nis making a quarter of a billion dollars, and is paying a lower tax \nrate than a truckdriver, that is okay with me. That is a tax dodge we \ncan get rid of. If it is a tax increase for a company that is going to \nhide in this building in the Cayman Islands to shelter its incomes so \nthat Rhode Island corporations and Oregon corporations, American \ncorporations have to make up the difference--American taxpayers have to \nmake up the difference, and they cannot hide their income down there \nany longer, that is a tax increase I can live with. I do not think that \nis what ordinary Americans have in mind when they say we do not want \ntax increases. They mean we do not want our rates to go up. But \nordinary Americans know that our Tax Code is filled, riddled with \ngimmicks and tricks and loopholes and deductions that have been put in \nit over the years by lobbyists. They are earmarks, they just happen to \nbe earmarks in the Tax Code. They spend America's money through the Tax \nCode just as much as if it were an appropriation.\n  But what is the big difference? The big difference is it takes being \na very wealthy individual or a very big corporation to be able to take \nadvantage of those tricks, to be able to hire a lobbyist who can build \nthat trick into the Tax Code, and to have the revenues and the \nresources to be able to maneuver through the Tax Code in that way. \nOrdinary Americans do not do that.\n  You can ask pretty much anybody in Rhode Island, show them the \nthousands of pages of the Internal Revenue Code and ask them: Who has a \nspecial provision in it for you? Nobody does. They are regular \nAmericans. They pay regular taxes. They do things the way they are \nsupposed to be done. The gimmicks and the tricks are all at the upper \nend, and it is time to clean house, particularly now when we so badly \nneed the revenues to balance our budget.\n  It is simply inexcusable that our tax system permits billionaires to \npay lower tax rates than truckdrivers, that it allows the wealthy to \navoid taxes by hiding assets in phony offshore corporations. Even if we \nhad no budget deficit, just being fair, honoring the principle of \nequality would demand that we address these inexcusable discrepancies \nthat favor the wealthy and the well-connected. Our budget crisis, \nhowever, brings real urgency to the problem. So as we continue to work \nto avoid a debt default by the United States of America and to bring \ndown our budget deficits and to reduce our crippling national debt, I \nhope Senator McConnell and the Republican Conference will revisit the \npotential to significantly cut the deficit by addressing tax loopholes, \ntax gimmicks and, frankly, outright injustice to the ordinary American \ntaxpayer that they are now defending here in the Senate.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Alabama arriving.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I understand that President Obama has \nsummoned certain congressional leaders to the White House tomorrow to \ndiscuss spending, debt and deficits, and the debt limit we now operate \nunder. The President has summoned congressional leaders to the White \nHouse on at least eight different occasions in recent weeks to discuss \nbudget and debt issues, not including the private talks involving Vice \nPresident Biden.\n  Yet with only weeks to go before the debt limit deadline--we are told \nAugust 2--secret discussions have failed to produce any grand bargain. \nTalk is not an action. I do think that is a problem the President has. \nHe thinks making a speech or having an announcement is something that \nactually involves changing course in America and it has some effect, \nwhen it is pretty clear it does not.\n  We have had lots of talks and we have heard lots of speeches, so I \nthink we should stop paying attention to these private talks, from \nwhich no details emerge and no public discussion is heard. We are \ngetting much too close to the point at which it will be too late to \ninvolve the public and allow Congress to fulfill its constitutional \nduty on spending and taxes.\n  In remarks yesterday, the President said, ``To truly solve our debt \nproblem, we need to take on spending and domestic programs and defense \nprograms and entitlement programs.'' Well, I agree. Yet the only plan \nhe has put forward proposed increases in his spending for next year in \nthe budget he submitted. He submitted a budget earlier this year. He \nmade a speech backing away from it a little bit but not a lot, because \nhis speech, when we carefully tried to study it, did not do much to \nchange what the trajectory is in his budget.\n  But this is what the budget calls for next year that we are supposed \nto be working on now and are not. This budget proposes to increase \nspending in 2012, beginning October 1, 2012--well, the inflation rate \nis projected to be 1.3 percent. It may be a little higher than that. \nDefense called for a 4.3-percent increase in spending. The Energy \nDepartment called for an 8.9-percent increase in spending, that big \nbureaucracy that is trying to make sure we block production of American \nenergy. It proposes for the State Department a 9.3-percent increase in \nspending, and the Education Department a 13-percent increase in \nspending, at a time this country is in incredibly difficult straits. We \nare having double-digit increases.\n  Then in the Transportation Department, he proposes a 62.4-percent \nincrease. Do we really need to have high-speed rail within walking \ndistance of 80 percent of all Americans? We do not have the money to do \nthat. Most of the high-speed rails are not working--are not paying for \nthemselves around the world. They can work in certain highly congested \nareas in good locations, perhaps. This idea that we are going to have a \nmassive national interlocking system of maybe $700 billion of high-\nspeed rail is not realistic in the short term. But his budget called \nfor a 62-percent increase.\n  We asked where the money would come from. They said it is a tax.\n  What kind of tax?\n  Well, it is not a gas tax.\n  So I called it the ``not gas tax tax.'' What tax then do you propose, \nMr. Secretary, before the Budget Committee?\n  Well, we will talk with Congress about that.\n  Well, the Congressional Budget Office, which is required to analyze \nexpenditures against revenues, said that is not a proposal of revenue, \nand they scored that as all expenditures without any revenue, because \nwe are not going to pass a big tax to increase this kind of spending. \nGive me a break. If we do, we ought to use some of the money to pay \ndown the debt, not continue to surge spending in this fashion.\n  I wish again to point out that President Bush in his last year in \noffice had the largest deficit I believe the country had had in recent \nmodern times. The largest he had was $450 billion. That was large. It \nwas roundly criticized. It included a lot of the TARP money that they \nthrew in at the last minute.\n  But what about President Obama's first year? That was $1.2 trillion \nin deficit. The second year: $1.3 billion. And this year, it is \nprojected around $1.5 trillion, going into 2011, ending September 30. \nThen September 12, he has got these kinds of increases. What kind of \nresponsible behavior is that? For the President of the United States to \nsay that we need to truly solve our deficit problems, we need to take \non spending in domestic programs and defense programs and entitlement \nprograms, and this is what we get as a proposal, to increase spending \nat double-digit rates, basically. I mean what is this? There is no \nproposal whatsoever to deal with entitlements. Those long-term \nunsustainable programs threaten the future of our country economically. \nIndeed, we are in more trouble right now than a lot of people realize \nfrom our debt situation.\n  So the only plan the President put forward, as I said, is increasing \nthese expenditures and not confronting entitlement programs at all. And \nwhen the House Members passed a far-reaching, historic, honest, fact-\nbased budget that would have actually changed the debt trajectory of \nour country over a period\n\n[[Page S4357]]\n\nof years, it was considered to be tough, but even it did not balance \nwithin 10 years.\n  We are in a deep hole. It is hard to balance this budget. The House \nproposed that and they laid out a plan, after 10 years, altering \nMedicare so that it would help put Medicare back on a sound basis. All \nof it was slammed by the President of the United States. He even had a \nspeech at the White House and invited Congressman Ryan, who is the \nbrilliant chairman of the House Budget Committee, and had him sit right \nin front of him, and then he slammed his bill. Congressman Ryan had \ncourage and integrity and he produced an honest budget that would have \nmade a difference for America. Would we have agreed with everything in \nit? Of course not. But he didn't deserve to be hammered by the \nPresident of the United States.\n  To begin to change the debt trajectory we are on, we need to cut at \nleast $6 trillion of spending over 10 years. That is not enough, but we \nneed to do that. If we do that, it will make a huge difference. Just \n$1.5 trillion or $2 trillion in cuts will not be enough. It will not be \nenough. The President's budget, which he submitted in December--the \nonly budget we have gotten from the Democratic side--would increase the \ndebt by $13 trillion, and $2 trillion in spending cuts is not enough.\n  We are long past the point when the President needs to share his \nvision with the country and admit that he cannot keep up this spending \nrate. His budget was a failure to confront the reality that we don't \nhave the money to keep up unsustainable spending.\n  According to Bloomberg News, Democratic officials claim that a deal \nwill have to be reached between July 15 and July 22 ``in order to write \na bill and comply with congressional rules requiring advance \npublication before consideration.'' In other words, we have as little \nas 3 days to see the legislation.\n  I have proposed legislation that says we ought to have 7 days to \nconsider this historic piece of legislation that would raise the debt \nceiling. We want to see how much change in spending the bill would \nmandate. In other words, if we are going to raise the debt ceiling, \nbecause we have limited how much debt America can approve--Congress \nhas--and to keep borrowing--we are borrowing 40 cents of every dollar \nwe spend--if we keep borrowing, we have to raise it. What we, and the \nAmerican people, are saying is we don't like raising it, but if we do, \nyou better show us that you have changed your ways and you are not \ncontinuing this reckless spending, when we don't have the money.\n  Every bit of that increase is borrowed. We can't continue that. I \ntruly believe that Congress needs to assert its role, step up and \naccept responsibility for the crisis we are in and begin to develop the \nprocedures openly and publicly and get us out of this fix.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \ndaunting fiscal challenges our country faces and the urgent need for \ncomprehensive bipartisan action to address our Nation's debt.\n  As we debate the path to securing our country's fiscal future, Greece \nis battling to keep from defaulting on its bonds. It is in the news. \nThere are legitimate concerns that a default in Greece would send shock \nwaves through the world financial markets, with an impact potentially \nas devastating as the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers.\n  To avert bankruptcy, Greece has enacted austerity measures so drastic \nthat violent rioting has broken out in its streets. Despite these \nmeasures, and despite the aid of other European countries, many \neconomists believe Greece will eventually succumb to its rising debt \nburden and default. Standard & Poors warned Monday that even with the \nplanned bailout by European banks, Greece's credit rating could be \nstill downgraded to ``selective default.'' While better than a full-\nblown default, this will almost certainly roil the markets and cut off \nGreece's access to credit.\n  Alarmingly, Standard & Poor's gave a similar warning to the United \nStates last week. In a statement to Reuters, Standard & Poors said it \nwould drop the United States triple A rating to ``selective default'' \nif the Treasury Department misses its repayment on $30 billion in \nmaturing bills on August 4.\n  Although our long-term fiscal challenges are serious, they are not \nwhat caused Standard & Poor's to issue this warning at this very \nmoment. Instead, what caused the warning was a growing concern that the \nCongress would fail to come together to pass a bipartisan deal on the \ndebt ceiling--something Congress has done without incident almost 100 \ntimes since the limit was established.\n  We must get serious about tackling the deficit and putting our \ncountry back on sound fiscal ground. But the problem we are facing now \nis not only a crisis of the dollars and the cents, it is also a crisis \nof the divide and the deadlock.\n  We know what we need to do in order to avoid default and bring down \nthe deficit. We have all the tools and information necessary to do it \nand avoid a situation such as we are seeing in Greece. Yet instead of \nworking together to craft a fair and responsible path forward, some \nhave chosen to draw lines in the sand and take the debt limit--and our \nNation's economy--hostage.\n  Addressing our country's fiscal challenges is something I have taken \nseriously. Since coming to the Senate, I have worked to reform the way \nCongress conducts its own business--reducing the budget of Congress, \nfighting for appropriations project reform, and working to restore the \npay-as-you-go rule. I was one of a handful of Senators who fought for \nthe creation of the fiscal commission, and I have supported efforts \nfrom both Republicans and Democrats to responsibly reduce the deficit.\n  While I believe we have reached a defining moment as a country which \nshould not be wasted, I also know we can't afford to play Russian \nroulette with our economy.\n  What our country needs is for Congress to come together and build \nconsensus around a comprehensive long-term deficit reduction package \nthat will put us on the track to prosperity.\n  Ever since the economic downturn, families across the country have \nhuddled around the kitchen table, making tough choices about what they \nhold most dear and what they can learn to live without. They expect and \ndeserve their leaders to do the same. The American people are counting \non us to put politics aside, pull together, not pull apart, and agree \non a plan to live within our means and make America strong for the long \nhaul.\n  If we are going to succeed in this challenge, we will ultimately have \nto accept things that we don't necessarily agree with. It is the only \nway to develop a plan that is both balanced and comprehensive.\n  We already know much of what will need to be done. Our failure to act \nhas not been because we lack solutions, but because too often Congress \nhas lacked the political will to get behind a consensus proposal. After \nmonths of debate, it is clear what sort of plan is needed to garner the \nsupport necessary to get us across the finish line.\n  First, a solution should match the scale of the problem. I want to \nsee one that produces around $4 trillion in deficit reduction over the \nnext decade.\n  Second, it should include a mix of revenue with realistic spending \ncuts. One example we are seeing right now is biofuels. The biofuels \nindustry has been willing to put a big chunk of change on the table, \nright in the middle of the year, as we are working with Senators Thune \nand Feinstein on an agreement in which it would be a template, where \none industry says, OK, we understand that we have a big problem, and we \nare willing to put money upfront for the debt. We are willing to look \nat what we need to do in the long term to have a secure energy policy, \nbut also help with the debt and end this subsidy. We want to see oil do \nthe same thing. We want to see a lot of these loopholes closed, a lot \nof these subsidies end, and do it in a smart way. The budget Senator \nConrad has been working on with the Budget Committee is an example of a \nmix of those revenues and spending cuts. That is what we have to look \nat.\n\n  Third, we must be able to achieve bipartisan support with a proposal, \nwhich is why I continue to support the work that has been done by the \nGang of 6.\n  It is time we get serious about advancing a plan that is both fair \nand\n\n[[Page S4358]]\n\nachievable. On August 2, the borrowing authority of the United States \nwill be exhausted. No one benefits if we are unable to reach an \nagreement by this deadline. Every day that passes without a deal only \nincreases uncertainty in the markets and puts the brakes on economic \nactivity. Failure to bring the national debt under control threatens \nAmerica's future, but the danger of default threatens our economy \ntoday.\n  The way I see it, we have two options. We can either set a precedent \nof holding our debt hostage to political maneuvering, raising the cost \nof borrowing and increasing the deficit, or we can show the world that \nwe are serious about addressing our fiscal challenges, reducing the \ncost of borrowing and strengthening our financial outlook. I believe \nthe choice is clear.\n  The sooner we can agree on a long-term package, the better for our \neconomy and our country. I hope we can put partisan differences aside \nto work on an agenda that strengthens our economy, promotes fiscal \nresponsibility, and increases global competitiveness, because if we \nrefuse to have an honest conversation about this, if we insist on using \nthe debate as a vehicle for rhetoric only, we will not just be doing \nourselves a disservice, we will be cheating our children and \ngrandchildren out of knowing the America we grew up in. The deficit \nisn't going to fix itself. We all know that. We all know we can't close \nour eyes, click our heels, and wish the debt would go away.\n  In their report, the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility \nwrote that ``every modest sacrifice we refuse to make today only forces \nfar greater sacrifices of hope and opportunity upon the next \ngeneration.'' They are right. The longer we wait, the more wrenching \nthe choices become. Look at Greece. Who will be making those painful \nchoices? Our children and our children's children.\n  None of us wants to see interest rates soar by playing Russian \nroulette with our economy. Democrats don't want it, Republicans don't \nwant it. So what are we waiting for? It is time for Congress to step \nforward and show some leadership. It is time for us to work together to \nshow the American people that Washington isn't broken, and that instead \nwe are willing to put aside politics to do what we were elected to do--\nto do what is right for America.\n  This is our challenge, and it will be a hard challenge to meet. But I \nam confident we can come together to make these tough choices, to do \nwhat is right for our economy, and to renew the American promise of \nprogress and opportunity for generations to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the debt crisis our \nNation is facing and how we can come together to fix it. We do talk \nabout how we are putting this debt on our children and grandchildren. \nThe time is on us right now. The bill is coming due.\n  We are facing the most predictable crisis in our Nation's history \nwith our current financial situation. It is a problem we can all see \nand that we can all acknowledge must be fixed. Of course, acting is not \nas easy as talking. If it were that easy, we would not be so far in \ndebt.\n  For some time, we have been talking about reining in spending and \nmaking sure that our grandchildren aren't saddled with the enormous \ndebt our country is facing. Now we are facing the reality of reaching \nthe debt ceiling--a cap that has increased to $14 trillion--that is \ntrillion, with 12 zeros--more than $2 trillion over the previous debt \nlimit of $12 trillion--a little over a year ago, in February of 2010.\n  We have raised the debt ceiling 74 times since 1962, and we have \nraised the limit 10 times since 2001. Listen to this. In the last 4 \nyears, we have raised the debt ceiling five times. It is accelerating.\n  What does this tell us about our spending habits? The numbers don't \nlie. It tells us we have had to raise the debt ceiling to keep up with \nincreased Federal spending. It tells us we have forgotten entirely how \nto live within our means, and that we need to make serious decisions \nabout cutting Federal spending. We need to make those decisions now.\n  We have all been talking about it. Republicans have come to the \nSenate floor and talked about the country's financial future. They have \ntalked about our debt, projections for the future, and agreed that this \npath is unsustainable.\n  Republican and Democratic administrations and Congresses for decades \nhave continually increased Federal spending. No one party holds all the \nblame for the situation we are in, but clearly the road we are \ntraveling on is leading to a crisis.\n  Last week, the President held a press conference where he lectured \nRepublican Members of Congress. He told us we need to stay in \nWashington to get things done. After listening to his press conference, \nwe invited the President to meet with Senate Republicans. We hoped to \nexplain to the President that the political reality makes it so that a \nbill containing tax increases cannot pass the House or the Senate. \nAfter lecturing us about the need to be in Washington and the need to \nget our work done, one would assume the President would take us up on \nour offer to meet. Instead, his spokesperson said meeting with Senate \nRepublicans was ``not a conversation worth having.'' Rather than \nstaying in Washington to work on the debt and deficit, the President \nchose to fly to a fundraiser in Philadelphia.\n  Republicans have been engaged in efforts to fix the debt and deficit \nsince the election last fall. House Republicans passed a serious budget \nthat would cut $6.2 trillion over the next decade--not enough but \nsubstantial. After demagoging the Ryan budget as an effort to kill \nMedicare and push grandma off the cliff, Senate Democrats have yet to \nbring any budget to the floor.\n  I heard just a few minutes ago that one is being considered, but it \nis being considered in a very partisan way, and I don't know if we will \nget to see it before it comes to the floor. But we have gone 800 days \nwithout passing any sort of budget. Even though the media reported that \nSenate Democrats have reached a budget agreement, they still haven't \nbrought the budget to the floor or shared it with Republicans. Why? I \ncan only assume it is because it includes trillions of dollars in tax \nincreases that would be unpalatable to the majority of Americans.\n  The President presented a budget and we voted on that budget. In \nfact, it was voted on 0 to 97. The President couldn't get a single vote \nfor his budget. I didn't see that in many headlines, but it happened. \nCheck on it.\n  While Democrats continue to ignore the problem, Republicans look for \nsolutions. All 47 Senate Republicans have signed on as cosponsors of a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. Senator Toomey and \nSenator Paul put forward their own budget efforts that would balance \nthe budget. I have introduced legislation that creates 2-year budgeting \nand other legislation that would reduce spending by 1 percent each year \nfor 7 years until we balance the budget. If Congress can't reduce \nspending by a single percentage point each year, it basically has given \nup and decided to leave this huge and growing pile of debt to tower \nover our children and our grandchildren and us, casting a grand shadow \nover their future and ours.\n  I remember a hearing we had in the Finance Committee and pretty much \nwhat everybody said was: Quit digging. You are in a big hole, quit \ndigging. Phil Gramm talked on taxes and said: Don't penalize America \nwith a tax every time Congress fails to do its job, which is to balance \nthe budget, to spend reasonably. Failure on Congress's part doesn't \nwarrant taxing Americans.\n  So where do we go from here? Republicans are ready to work, but we \nneed Democrats to work with us. We need the President to take a \nrealistic look at the situation and realize that tax increases are not \nthe answer because the votes aren't there to pass a tax increase. We \nneed to come up with a solution to the budget crisis we face and we \nneed to do it now.\n  If we are serious about fixing the problem--and I believe many of us \nare--we have to come to the table willing to work. We have to stop \npointing fingers. We have to stop playing political games. We have to \nstop demagoging ideas that are proposed. We need the President to step \nto the plate and explain to the American people the problem we face if \nwe don't get our debt and deficit under control and\n\n[[Page S4359]]\n\nthen give the solutions, not just tax raises.\n  The President is the only person in the Nation who has the bully \npulpit necessary to teach the American people what happens if we don't \nget a budget and don't get timely appropriations. The President talked \nabout some of the taxes he would increase. The deficit commission \nsuggested those taxes could be used, but they suggested they should be \nused to lower company rates so we can compete internationally, which \nwould increase revenues. They didn't suggest they should be used to pay \nfor new programs, and they are not even being suggested to reduce the \ndeficit.\n  Rather than taking the lead in selling the plan, the President has \ntried to stay above the fray and instead spent his time criticizing \nRepublicans who have come up with a variety of plans. That isn't \nproductive, it isn't helpful, and it will not lead to a deal. We need \nto end the finger-pointing and show the plan. Show us the plan. \nBipartisanship is not about compromise, it is about what we leave out \nor finding an alternate way to accomplish a mutually agreeable way.\n  I know it works. I have seen it happen. The late Senator Ted Kennedy \nand I were able to put this theory into practice when we worked \ntogether on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. He \nand I came from opposite sides on most issues, but we chose to focus \nour time and energy on what we knew we could get done. It amazed \npeople, but we sure got results. All in all, when Senator Kennedy and I \nled the HELP Committee, we got 35 bills reported out of committee and \n27 signed into law.\n  These kinds of results are possible today, but we have to get to \nwork. We can't keep raising the debt ceiling. We can't tax more every \ntime we have a good idea. We have to address the spending problem in \nWashington, and we have to figure out some solutions to correct our \nlong-term budget outlook. These aren't easy issues to address, but we \nhave been sent to do a job, and that job includes rolling up our \nsleeves and finding a way out of the mess.\n  We are here through this July recess, but we are still not doing \nanything that is proactive or productive. The Democrats are in the \nSenate majority. They control the floor. Yesterday, we did a nothing \nvote to see if everybody was back. We will not vote until tomorrow now, \nand it is just a political ploy put up by the leader. It is messaging, \nand messaging will not pay the bills. Let's get something done in this \nsession.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, what is the order at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is on the motion to proceed to S. \n1323 until 6 o'clock, with Senators permitted to speak for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nproceed for 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I listened to my colleague just now and I have \nlistened to colleagues over the last weeks and there are a lot of \ncrocodile tears being shed on the floor of the Senate about why we are \nnot doing something, all of which completely ignores the fact that \neverything we try to do, the folks on that side of the aisle make us \ntake longer and longer and longer than we have ever taken before \nbecause they push every single procedural objection possible. Even the \nmost routine thing we try to do on the floor of the Senate requires 60 \nvotes or requires a motion to proceed. The most perfunctory, simple \nthing requires us to go through every procedural hoop and parliamentary \nprocess because they have persistently pursued a strategy aimed at \ngridlock.\n  The idea is to make Americans see the dysfunction and then blame it \non the party in power and run against them. It is the most cynical, \ncraven, and dangerous policy I have ever seen in the 27 years I have \nbeen in the Senate, and I regret it for our country.\n  There is a reason Democrats are standing, as a matter of principle, \nagainst the Ryan budget and against the proposals our Republican \nfriends keep proposing. That is because they are the only party who \nhave consistently stood and said: We are not going to consider \neverything. We are just going to give you a tiny, little menu, and you \nhave to balance the budget out of spending cuts only. That is all that \nis in their budget. The only thing in their budget is spending cuts. \nTwelve percent of the entire budget is all they have put on the table \nin order to try to do something responsible about the deficit of our \ncountry.\n\n  We, on the other hand, have consistently said: We will put everything \non the table--everything--Medicare, Medicaid, reforms--not benefits. We \nare not going to cut the benefits on people because we don't have to in \norder to deal with this problem, but we can reform them. We can \ncertainly be more effective and efficient, and we are prepared to do \nthat. There are a lot of other things we are prepared to do--defense \nspending, wars, and a whole series of things.\n  Last week, one of our newest colleagues made a very interesting and I \nthought revealing observation. The Senator from Delaware, Chris Coons, \nwho balanced budgets in county government, who took cases all the way \nto the Supreme Court, who has seen decisions made in the business world \nas well as in the nonprofit world and who is an enormously capable \nperson but new to the Senate, made the observation that some people are \nactually looking into the language of the 14th amendment and the debt \nlimit in order to learn whether ``there might be some way to save us \nfrom ourselves.''\n  That observation brought home to me how absurd this place must look \nright now, not just to a new Senator who came here with hopes of \ngetting the business of our Nation done but to the average American, to \npeople who invest in the extraordinary mythology that surrounds this \ngreat institution we are all a part of--the greatest deliberative body \nin the world. We can laugh at that one today. There is an absence of \ndeliberation--a great absence of deliberation--and I think a lot of \npeople are alarmed by the dysfunction they see with respect to this \ngreat institution.\n  It is extraordinary when we have to look at the language of the \nConstitution to find possible ways to do what Congress and the Senate \nare supposed to do on their own--take tough votes, look at the tough \nissues, make tough decisions but, most importantly, do it in the \ninterest of the United States, not in the interest of either party or \nof some ideology.\n  Here we are, less than 5 weeks from August 2, the day the U.S. \nGovernment will default on its obligations for the first time in its \nhistory, and Washington is still playing the same old political game--a \ndangerous game of chicken--with enormous consequences for our economy \nand our future in every respect--economic, social, and national \nsecurity.\n  I hear this in my travels. Senator McCain and I were in Egypt \nrecently, and we had people turning to us and saying: Hey, how about \nyou guys? Can you get your act together before you are telling \neverybody else what they ought to be doing with respect to their \nfuture?\n  You are promoting democracy. How is your democracy doing back there \nin the United States? Working out all right, right now?\n  Washington is stuck, and it is stuck because we have a few ideologues \nand some people outside of the U.S. Senate who cower our fellow \ncolleagues with threats of primaries. People are going to run against \nthem if they move off of the orthodoxy of extremism. The result is that \nnothing is happening. Fear has gripped the Senators who raised their \nright hand and said: I swear to uphold the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  Well, everyone here I think acknowledges that defaulting on our \nobligations would be disastrous for our country. Everyone here \nsimultaneously says they don't want the default to happen. But here we \nare with a small minority holding the debt limit hostage to an \nideological agenda, saying they will not consider an approach that most \nobservers consider indispensable and reasonable in reaching an \nequitable solution to our crisis.\n  Frankly, the consequences of not doing something are not far off in \nthe future. Every day that we are here not getting this decision made, \nwe are\n\n[[Page S4360]]\n\nweakening our economy and we are making our government and, through it, \nour country look helpless and adrift. The fact is that it is already \nhaving consequences with respect to business decisions. Capital is \nholding back. Businesspeople are reluctant to invest, uncertain of what \nthe budget of the United States is going to look like, uncertain of \nwhat kinds of signals we are going to send to the marketplace. \nCertainty. I keep hearing colleagues say we have to send certainty. But \nwhen they look at this chaotic debate, what kind of certainty could any \nbusinessperson possibly take from what is not happening in Washington \ntoday?\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle say they want to create \njobs, but Moody's chief economist, Mark Zandi, has said that hiring is \nonly going to resume if we can get our act together and settle this \ndebate, and the sooner, the better. At the beginning of the month, \nMoody's announced that it might downgrade our country's credit rating \nif Congress isn't able to come to an agreement by the middle of July. \nThat is a week away. If that happens, I promise you our economic \nrecovery is going to halt in its tracks. Maybe some people want that. I \nhope not. But today investors are looking at the scene here in \nCongress, and they are wondering if we are ever going to get it \ntogether. And the longer we wait to get serious, the higher the \ninterest rates are going to move. That hurts everyone in America. \nEveryone who owns a home or runs a small business is going to be \nsqueezed while Congress is in this ideological standoff.\n  I read David Brooks' column this morning in the New York Times, a \nbrilliant column talking about the unreasonableness of taking things \noff the table in this discussion.\n  Recently, 235 economists, including 6 Nobel Prize winners, sent a \nletter to congressional leadership urging them to raise the debt limit \nimmediately. Not doing so, they said, could have a substantial, \nnegative impact on economic growth at a time when the economy looks a \nbit shaky, and, at worst case, it could push the United States back \ninto recession. So are we going to listen to 235 economists, including \n6 Nobel Prize winners, or are we going to be driven by this extremist \nposition that does not allow for reasonable discussion about what ought \nto be on the table?\n  I think this is a dangerous and irresponsible moment in our country. \nNot raising the debt limit would result in a crisis potentially far \nmore severe than the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. The \nconsequences would include any number of things, from increases in \nState and local government borrowing costs, increases in corporate \nborrowing costs, including mortgage interest, declines in equity prices \nand home values, declines in 401(k)s and other retirement savings, \nreductions in the willingness of investors here and around the world to \ninvest in the United States, and job losses on a significant scale.\n  Now, as I have said, I don't believe that is going to happen. But the \nquestion is, Are we going to get a deal that hurts America or helps \nAmerica? If we eat America's seed corn in this deal--by that, I mean \ndon't invest in America's infrastructure, don't invest in education, \ndon't invest in the research and development that is so critical to the \ncreation of new jobs--if all we do is what the other folks in the House \nsaid we ought to do by just looking at 12 percent of the budget and \ncutting spending, if that is all we do, we will eat America's seed \ncorn, and the next generation will pay the price. Without investing in \nour future, we could face an economic downslide unlike anything we have \nseen in recent memory.\n  In 1983, President Reagan wrote:\n\n       Denigration of the full faith and credit of the United \n     States would have substantial effects on the domestic \n     financial markets and on the value of the dollar in exchange \n     markets. The Nation can ill afford such a result.\n\n  Nearly 30 years later, we are facing that kind of incalculable \ndamage.\n  The fact is, Chairman Bernanke and Secretary Geithner have already \nused extraordinary measures to try to keep the Nation from default and \nkeep the economy moving.\n  Already, Treasury Secretary Geithner has used extraordinary measures \nto keep our Nation from default. And, these measures have bought us \nsome time to deal with congressional negotiations, but it happens that \nsome Republicans have proven themselves willing to sacrifice our \nNation's economy in a misguided attempt to score political points. I \nknow they will protest and say ``we're just trying to solve our debt \ncrisis,'' but the truth is there is more than one way to do that not \njust their way and particularly not when that way can have disastrous \nconsequences on the economy.\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke says failing to raise the debt \nceiling on time could cause ``severe disruptions'' in the markets. He \nsaid:\n\n       We should avoid unnecessary actions or threats that risk \n     shaking the confidence of investors in the ability and \n     willingness of the U.S. government to pay its bills.\n\n  As of this moment, no one knows for sure how much time our financial \nmarkets will give Congress to come up with a solution before severe \ndisruptions could occur. According to a J.P. Morgan analysis, the delay \nin raising the debt ceiling is likely to negatively impact markets, as \ninvestors undertake risk management actions in preparation for a \npotential Treasury default.\n  These effects could include immediate liquidity shortages as \nborrowers attempt to raise additional cash and increase the tenor of \ntheir borrowings, large auction concessions especially if Treasury were \nto postpone an auction, increases in open volatility that cover the \nJune/July period, and general weaker demand for Treasury securities. As \ntime goes on, failure to raise the debt ceiling could touch off a mini-\nfinancial panic, perhaps throwing the fragile economy back into \nrecession.\n  If you don't believe me about moments like this, just look at our \nhistory and you don't have to look far. Just look back 3 years to \nSeptember 2008, when Congress initially voted down Treasury Secretary \nPaulson's $700 billion plan to provide assistance to financial \ninstitutions. Investor confidence was brutally shaken and the Standard \n& Poor's 500-stock index plunged 8.8 percent that day.\n  If we do not act and act very soon indeed those who lend us resources \nwill eventually demand higher interest rates. Government borrowing will \ncrowd out private investment. A larger share of our Federal budget will \nbe devoted to interest payments instead of productive investments like \neducation, national security, and programs for our elderly and most \nvulnerable. Higher borrowing costs for American households and \nbusinesses will discourage future private investment, lowering our \ncapital stock, reducing our economic growth and depressing our standard \nof living.\n  Mr. President, this isn't half as complicated as some have chosen to \nmake it. We are not as far apart as this debate would imply. We can all \nagree that deficits are too high. We can all agree that we shouldn't be \nborrowing 40 cents on every dollar that we spend. We even agree that we \nneed $4 trillion in deficit reduction to put us on a sustainable path.\n\n  But in the end, this budget debate can't just be about just cutting \nspending which is all the Republicans have offered. Our future is at \nstake--literally. Everyone says that job creation and investments in \ninfrastructure, clean energy, and medical research are essential. We \nneed to give the economy the tools to recover. As Ben Bernanke affirmed \njust the other day, we can't just cut our way to jobs and recovery. The \nAmericans who sent us here understand that and want investment in our \nfuture.\n  I believe there are better choices that we face. This is not half as \ncomplicated as some have chosen to make it. In fact, I don't think we \nare as far apart in this debate, when you talk to a lot of our \nreasonable colleagues on the other side of the aisle, as some want to \nimply. Everybody can agree deficits are too high. We can all agree we \nshouldn't be borrowing 40 cents on every dollar we spend. We can all \nagree we need about $4 trillion in deficit reduction to put us on a \nsustainable path. But in the end, this budget debate cannot be just \nabout cutting spending, even though it must include cutting spending.\n  Everyone has said that job creation and investments in clean energy, \ninfrastructure, and medical research are essential, and I think we need \nto do the things that would make our economy move. Let me give an \nexample of this. In America today, we are living off of the investments \nour parents and our\n\n[[Page S4361]]\n\ngrandparents made. The Interstate Highway System didn't just sprout up \none day; it was a government program investing taxpayer dollars in \nbuilding a nationwide road system that helped America to grow and be \nunparalleled in its strength compared to any other nation in the world. \nThat was a President Eisenhower program.\n  The truth is that today we are falling further and further behind \nother nations in terms of our investment in the infrastructure of the \nfuture. The United States is spending less than 2 percent of its GDP on \ninfrastructure. Compare that. China is spending 9 percent of GDP on \ninfrastructure. Europe is spending 5 percent of GDP on infrastructure. \nThey have trains and airports and other things that work and get people \nwhere they want to go faster than our trains.\n  We are looking at a country now that has about a $2.2 trillion \ndeficit in the infrastructure of our Nation. We have 69,000-plus \nbridges that are structurally deficient. We need to invest in them so \nthey don't fall down like the bridge in Minnesota. We need to invest in \nour airport structures so we don't have airport delays or potential of \ncollisions in our aircraft.\n  According to one study, $1 billion in investment in infrastructure \nresults in 18,000 jobs. So at a time when America is begging for more \njobs, why would we not be investing in infrastructure in this country? \nYou go to Germany or Brazil, and they are investing huge amounts in \ntheir future, and right now both countries are threatening to leave the \nUnited States behind with respect to alternative and clean energy \ninvestments of the future.\n  Millions of Americans know we can do a lot better. Frankly, in the \n1980s you couldn't find three more ideologically different people than \nTip O'Neill, Bob Dole, and Ronald Reagan, but they put politics aside \nand they saved Social Security. And they didn't capitulate. They \ncompromised. They found common ground. They did it because they knew \nAmerica's future was more important than either party.\n  I often hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle only \ntalking about the spending problems of the country.\n  Madam President, may I ask how much time I have used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 14 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  I often hear my colleagues talking about the spending problem. What \nthey forget about is we had a surplus we created in the 1990s by making \nthe tough decisions. We invested in the future of our country, and we \ncreated 23 million new jobs. And in the 1990s, when we balanced the \nbudget--let's not forget that. Some of us were here and made those \ntough votes, and we balanced the budget, and we created 23 million \njobs. Every income level in America went up--every single income \nlevel--and we did it at a time when the total relationship of spending-\nto-GDP was exactly where many of us believe we ought to take it today, \nsomewhere around 21 or 22 percent.\n  The fact is that it was President Bush's tax cuts for the wealthiest \nAmericans that we couldn't afford and a war that he refused to pay for \nin Afghanistan and then Iraq--both wars totaling approximately $2 \ntrillion. The tax cuts and the wars account for approximately $7 \ntrillion in deficits in 2009 and going forward.\n  The facts are clear. The tax cuts President Bush put in place \ncontributed to the deficit, and the revenues have to be addressed if we \nare going to go forward and deal with this. Federal revenues today--the \nmoney the government takes in--is at its lowest level since 1950. We \nhave had a 60-percent reduction in revenue and a 60-percent increase in \nexpenditures, and right now we are at the lowest level of revenue taken \nin that we have been at since the 1950s, and they are only about 14 \npercent of the total GDP. The fact is that the last five times we \nbalanced the budget, those revenues were about 19 or 20 percent of GDP. \nSo here we are at 14 percent, we have balanced the budget five times \npreviously, and the revenues were at about 19.5 to 20 percent of GDP. \nDoesn't that tell us something?\n  There is another problem we have. It is right here on my desk. We \nhave a Tax Code. The Tax Code has 8 volumes, over 72,500 pages. This is \nthe Internal Revenue Code, 4,052 pages. I would ask any American, do \nyou have your own page in this Tax Code? How many Americans have their \nown page in this Tax Code? Well, I have got news for you: 72,500 \nentities--a lot of businesses--have found a way to get their little \nbreak in the Tax Code.\n  Last month, the Senate, by a vote of 73 to 27, sent a clear signal \nthat we ought to start looking at some of these subsidies. This entire \nTax Code is riddled with special deals which lobbyists have worked \nagainst the interests of average Americans in most cases. Let me give \nyou a couple of examples.\n  Section 168 in this Code has a special rule for racehorse \ndepreciation. How many folks in America are worried about their \nracehorse today and the depreciation on it? But they have a provision \nin here that allows the depreciation of racehorses to go from 7 years \nto 3 years, and the difference of 7 years to 3 years costs the average \nAmerican money. The average American is supporting that because it is a \nforegone revenue. We are giving away the revenue, and we are giving it \nback to somebody who doesn't fundamentally need it.\n  The Tax Code includes a definition of 3-year property. Get this: any \nhorse other than a racehorse which is more than 12 years old at the \ntime it is placed in service. I mean, who writes this stuff? Where does \nthis come from? Not only is that a waste of taxpayer money, it makes \nthe Tax Code more complex, and it requires more regulations and more \nconfusion.\n  A lot of tax lawyers love these eight volumes, but the average \nAmerican ought to be furious at these volumes because these volumes are \nstealing America's opportunities in a host of other choices we could be \nmaking, such as education, investment in energy, energy independence, \ntaking care of our veterans--doing a whole bunch of things that are \nsubstitutes for some of the choices that are made.\n  Let me give a couple of other examples. Here is a provision. It is \nincluded in one of the regulations.\n\n       On April 2000, E acquires a horse to be used in E \n     thoroughbred racing. On October 1, 2003, F buys the horse \n     from E and will use the horse in F's horse breeding business. \n     The use of the horse by E in its racing business prevents the \n     original use of the horse from commencing with F. Thus F's \n     purchase price of the horse does not qualify for the \n     additional first year depreciation deduction.\n\n  How ridiculous can it get that we are getting into specific cases \nlike that which run contrary to the common sense of average Americans? \nOne has to be able to afford a lobbyist to be on one of these pages.\n  Last year, more than $3.5 billion was spent on lobbying in \nWashington, DC. There are more than 13,000 lobbyists trying to \ninfluence the legislation in Washington. Believe me, it works. Look at \nthe last 50 years.\n  Back in 2004 we passed a bill which the New York Times described as \nincluding ``goodies for almost every kind of corporation'' and that \n``perhaps the most amazing provision might be called the foreign \ngambler relief act.''\n  Under prior law, if a person is lucky and they win big at the horse \nor dog track, their winnings are subject to a withholding tax. It is \nkind of logical. But now foreigners do not have to pay tax on their \nwinnings. They found a lobbyist and they got it in the Tax Code and we \npassed it somehow.\n  Section 872 of the Tax Code excludes from gross income, ``income \nderived from wagering transactions in certain parimutuel pools.'' It \nspecifically says, ``gross income derived by a nonresident alien \nindividual from a legal wagering transaction initiated outside the \nUnited States in a parimutuel pool with respect to a live horse race or \ndog race in the United States.''\n  Until I read this I was not absolutely certain what a parimutuel pool \nwas, but I do know a provision like that does not get in here without \nlobbying. It comes at the expense of a lot of other choices because the \nproblem is all these breaks--whether it is subsidies for oil or \nsubsidies for gas exploration--which made sense 60 and 70 years ago, \nbut here we are with record profits coming into these companies, $35 \nbillion of profit just for the last quarter, 3 months. Yet they get a \nbreak. That break comes at the expense of average folks having the \nschool they deserve, having the road they want to ride on properly, and \nhaving decent public transportation. Those are the choices and those \nare some of the things for which we are fighting.\n\n[[Page S4362]]\n\n  Not only are lobbyists arguing for tax breaks, highly skilled tax \nlawyers have a history of finding looping holes for corporations to \nexploit. We use to have a provision in the Tax Code which was finally \neliminated that provided a tax credit for synthetic fuels for coal. I \nfound this process questionable and one company admitted it was \nprofitable just because of this tax credit. Some firms getting this \ncredit were simply spraying newly mined coal with diesel fuel or some \nother substance. We need to work together to find these type of \nprovisions and remove them.\n  If there is a loophole, someone will find a way through it. I think \nwe all remember how one oil company was getting a tax credit for co-\nprocessing animal fat with biodiesel from biomass. We shut that one \ndown but other loopholes have opened.\n  Last year, we thought that we had seen the end of the ``black liquor \nboondoggle.'' Paper mills were using a mixture of diesel fuel and a \nbyproduct of the pulping process as an energy source for the mill. The \nintended purpose of this credit is to produce motor fuels from biomass. \nThese companies were getting a windfall that was never intended. I am \nnow hearing that some companies are still finding a way to benefit from \nblack liquor. I have also heard that some are trying to benefit from \nthis same credit for alternative fuels by adding cow waste and other \nwaste to diesel fuel. This was not the intended purpose of this \nprovision. In past Congresses, I have introduced line-item veto \nlegislation which included tax benefits. These are abuses that we can \nall agree to end.\n  For years, we have been trying to repeal subsidies for major oil \ncompanies. Just last month, we failed to eliminate $2 billion a year in \ntax incentives for oil companies. These incentives are no longer \nneeded. We needed to jointly review the Tax Code and remove the \ndeadwood. Some subsidies are no longer needed. And some are completely \nnecessary. The Tax Code has become riddled with special interests. Over \nthe past 25 years, Congress has introduced billions of dollars of worth \nof special tax breaks, loopholes and subsidies into the Tax Code--\nmaking total tax expenditures now exceed $1 trillion.\n  With the future of our country at stake we have to decide if we want \nto care for our elderly and educate our children or provide tax breaks \nfor those who do not need them. Would we rather invest infrastructure \nor allow race horse owners a shorter period to depreciate their horse?\n  As we consider legislation to increase our debt limit, our colleagues \nin the minority refuse to even discuss eliminating any of the tax \nexpenditures that these lobbyists have helped enact into law. Not one \npermanent tax expenditures. I guess they prefer to increase the \nspending cuts that hurt low and moderate-income families.\n  I think we need to review the $1 trillion in expenditures and decide \nwhat is really needed instead of slashing programs which will weaken \nour economy. It is time for us in Congress to stop falling prey to \ncorporate lobbyists and stand up for our future. To reduce the deficit \nwe need to make hard choices and we should not be afraid of saying \n``no.'' If we do not start eliminating tax expenditures, we will not be \nable to reduce the deficit without gutting Medicare or Medicaid.\n  We hear a lot about the Ryan budget, but make no mistake: the House \npassed budget does not eliminate the deficit. It just makes a series of \nspending cuts to provide tax cuts to those at the very top even greater \nthan the existing 2001/2003 tax cuts.\n  And Chairman Ryan may call his budget the ``Path to Prosperity,'' but \nthat is not where its path would take our seniors. At least two-thirds \nof the over $4 trillion in budget cuts come from programs serving those \nof modest means. To be clear, the House budget is not about reducing \nthe debt. It is about putting in place Republican priorities--\nincreasing tax cuts for the wealthy and slashing social programs that \npeople depend on.\n  We should examine all spending and not leave defense spending off the \ntable. For example, we should be cutting programs like the Medium \nExtended Air Defense System, MEADS, which had a budget request of $406 \nmillion for fiscal year 2012 but the Pentagon said was running over \nschedule and running over cost. Or the F-22 raptor fighter jet, which \nin 2009 we were able to cut $1,750,000,000 in procurement funds of a \nplane that was costing too much money and wasn't appropriate for the \n21st century wars we are engaged in. We should aggressively go after \nfraud and abuse, eliminate erroneous payments to health providers, and \nbetter coordinate health care for people who receive both Medicare and \nMedicaid. These dual eligible beneficiaries account for only 15 percent \nof Medicaid enrollment but constitute nearly 40 percent of Medicaid \nspending.\n  Instead of digging more ideological trenches, we should look at the \nlast time we actually achieved a path to fiscal stability. The \nbipartisan 1990 budget agreement included discretionary caps and \nrevenue increases. It was a real compromise that looked at both sides \nof our budget equation. And in January of 2001, the Congressional \nBudget Office projected that the debt would be erased by 2006 and that \nby 2011, there would be a $2.3 trillion surplus.\n  Yet somehow, in the years since this real bipartisan success, too \nmany people in this building seem to have forgotten that there are two \nsides of the budget ledger.\n  Just look at the balanced budget amendment House and Senate \nRepublican leaders proposed. It caps Federal spending in any fiscal \nyear at a completely unrealistic 18 percent of GDP. It wouldn't just \nresult in unthinkable cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid; \nit would also impose arbitrary limits on the Federal Government's \nability to respond to the recession. So the recession could be deepened \nby increasing the number of unemployed, decreasing business investment, \nand withholding services needed to jump-start the economy. And yet this \nsame proposal would require a two-thirds vote to increase revenues, \nmaking it nearly impossible to eliminate wasteful tax loopholes or \nunnecessary tax giveaways.\n\n  So let's be realistic. We need to set ourselves on a course to rein \nin deficits and debt. No one disputes it. To do this, the budget \nnegotiations should include a budget enforcement mechanism--and it \ncan't result in a sequestration of spending only; if a budget \nenforcement mechanism only focuses on spending cuts, we are only \naddressing part of the problem. It would slash essential programs while \nignoring revenues. That is simply not a responsible long-term budget \nsolution, and it would never get bipartisan support.\n  For an enforcement mechanism to work, both sides should not want the \ntrigger to occur. We shouldn't be hoping for automatic spending tax \ncuts or increased revenues. A tough budget enforcement mechanism will \nforce us to make difficult choices, both substantively and politically.\n  It is time to end the polarization over how to resolve our budget \ncrisis. We can't hide behind global spending caps, unrealistic \nconstitutional amendments, or pledges vowing opposition to tax \nincreases. The cuts that would be required to meet the spending targets \nof a cap would have to be as drastic as or even worse than proposals \nincluded in the House-passed budget resolution.\n  Spending for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are driven by \nfactors beyond the programs' control. Under spending caps, their \npercentage cuts would be bigger than the percentage cut in \ndiscretionary programs and they would be subject to automatic large \ncuts.\n  We need to think hard about what is fair in America. The only tax \nPresident Obama or we Democrats have talked about is on the wealthiest \npeople. Millionaires. People who earn more than $1 million a year. That \nis about 7,000-plus lucky families and individuals in the United \nStates. All we are doing is talking about asking those who benefit \nenormously from the strength of our economy and the strength of our \nmilitary and all the things we need to do--we are just asking them is \nit too much to go from 36.9 percent up to 39.6 percent, which is where \nthey were in the year 2000, before President Bush gave them a tax cut \nwe could not pay for.\n  It is not as if they have done badly these last 10 years. The fact \nis, more wealth has been accumulated in the hands of the smallest part \nof America, the top 1 percent, than at any time in America's history. \nThe wealthy are far wealthier than when we had no income tax and when \nwe had the great names\n\n[[Page S4363]]\n\nof the 1920s and 1930s and the industrial revolution: Pierponts, \nMorgans, Carnegies, Mellons, Rockefellers, and so forth. They are much \nwealthier today. Yet they are paying far less of their share than at \nany time in modern history.\n  Here we are with a deficit problem. They are talking about cutting \nMedicaid. They are talking about cutting Medicare. They are talking \nabout cutting education loans, making it more expensive for kids to go \nto college--the one thing we desperately need in order to compete with \nthe rest of the world, people who have a college education. I do not \nhear anybody in America saying make it harder for my kid to go to \ncollege, but that is what they are doing in their budget. That is \nexactly what they are doing. But they stand up adamantly and say: No \nway will we allow people earning more than $1 million a year to pay \nanything additional into the system. It is just wrong. It is morally \nwrong. It is repugnant in this country we are condoning the \ninstitutionalization of a larger and larger gap between the haves and \nthe have-nots, between the people who have already gotten their brass \nrings and the people who are trying to reach it. That is not the \nAmerican story. I believe we need to fight to have a balanced approach.\n  President Obama and the Democratic proposals I have seen and we have \ntalked about--and I hope people will hear more about in the next days--\ngive a tax cut to about 98 percent of America. The only people we are \ntalking about asking to kick in and give us some more revenue are \npeople earning the most.\n  If a person is earning $500,000 a year, they would not pay any \nadditional tax on their first $250,000. On the next $250,000 all they \nwould pay is $12,000 of additional tax. Let me ask--no, I will say I \nknow this. There is not one business person, there is not one \nmillionaire for whom $12,000 will change one consumer purchase, one \ndecision of investment--not one. All this talk about how it will slow \ndown the economy or hurt America is just bunk. It is not true.\n  We need to have a real discussion. We need to have a real effort that \nI think matches the greatness of this institution with this moment. \nThis can be the world's greatest deliberative body, but we need to put \nall of these issues on the table. We need to debate them openly. We \nneed to have the courage of our convictions and vote up or down and do \nwhat is needed to put our country on track because right now we are \nlosing countless investment opportunities, countless job opportunities. \nIf we do not make the right choices we are going to have a very \ndifficult time living up to the promise all of us hope to live up to in \nour time in this office.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 15 minutes \nto address this body as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, it is well known to all Americans who \nhave observed, and certainly the media and certainly Members of this \nbody, the Congress, that the debt limit talks are bogged down. There \nhas been little if any progress, certainly not any perceptible to the \nAmerican people. We are in a gridlock, a gridlock that is not favored \nby many Americans. In fact, I continue to hear from my constituents the \ncall: Why can't you all sit down and work this out? Why can't we not be \nfaced with a shutdown of the government and the loss of the important \nservices that the Federal Government gives to the American people--most \nof which they have earned and all of which they deserve?\n  Here we are with the President of the United States demanding that \nthere be tax increases and the Republicans, certainly many of them, are \ninsisting on a balanced budget amendment which cannot pass the Congress \nof the United States.\n  On the one hand, President Obama and my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle insist on tax increases and argue somewhat inflammatory and \npopulist issues such as corporate jets, carried interest for private \nequity, oil and gas. Those are hard to defend.\n  At the same time it is very clear that the American people spoke and \nadministered what the President of the United States called a \n``shellacking'' last November. They want us to stop mortgaging our \nchildren's and our grandchildren's future and get the spending under \ncontrol. I have yet to meet a constituent who wants their taxes \nincreased.\n  We are in a gridlock. There will be a meeting tomorrow on the debt \ncrisis again, this time between the President and leaders of Congress. \nWe all hope it will succeed, but it is my view the way to break this \ngridlock is to agree to certain tax increases and closing loopholes, \nbut only in return for an overall reduction of the corporate tax rate. \nThat way, Republicans can say we have not raised taxes overall, and the \nadministration and the Democrats can say they eliminated loopholes and \nindeed made the taxation of Americans more fair.\n  It is time we got serious. The debt, as we all know, is $50,000 for \nevery man, woman, and child living in America today. That is why we \nhave seen the rise of the Tea Party and the fiscal conservatives. I \nhope these negotiations can be made visible to the American public by \nC-SPAN so they can see what is being discussed.\n  As I said, the debt stands at $14.5 trillion. We cannot continue to \nsit idly by while saddling future generations of Americans with the \nburden. So if we are serious about our commitment to reduce our debt \nand eliminate the deficit, then Congress needs to start making some \nserious decisions, and we need to start now.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues, particularly in light of the \nimpassioned speech I just listened to from my friend from \nMassachusetts, here is what President Obama's thoughts on the debt \nlimit were in 2006 when he was a Member of this body. I quote him from \na speech he made on the floor of this Senate:\n\n       The fact we are here today to debate raising America's debt \n     limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the \n     U.S. Government cannot pay its own bills. It is a sign that \n     we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign \n     countries to finance our Government's reckless fiscal \n     policies. . . . Increasing America's debt weakens us \n     domestically and internationally. Leadership means that ``the \n     buck stops here.'' Instead, Washington is shifting the burden \n     of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and \n     grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of \n     leadership. Americans deserve better.\n\n  Then-Senator Barack Obama on the floor of this Senate.\n  I guess it shows on some issues with then-Senator Barack Obama it is \nnot where one stands, it is where one sits. I could not agree more with \nwhat then-Senator Obama said in 2006. Americans do deserve better. We \nare in this mess today because of a serious lack of leadership. It is \nnot the fault of just one of the political parties; it is the fault of \nboth parties. Year after year of uncontrolled spending by both \nRepublicans and Democrats has brought us to the brink of bankruptcy. \nThe point at which we will begin to default on our obligations is now \njust weeks away, and it is shameful. It should be inconceivable that \nthe greatest Nation in the history of the world should face such \ncrippling debt while its leaders engage in such partisan bickering \ninstead of solving this problem.\n  I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues the lead \neditorial in today's Wall Street Journal, which I believe holds the \nanswer to this stalemate.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that today's editorial in \nthe Wall Street Journal entitled ``A Debt-Limit Breakout'' be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, July 5, 2011]\n\n                         A Debt-Limit Breakout\n\n       The debt-limit talks in Washington are bogged down in the \n     hedgerows, with some Republicans insisting on a balanced \n     budget amendment that can't pass Congress and President Obama \n     insisting on tax increases that Republicans oppose. What this \n     debate needs is a breakout strategy--to wit, Republicans \n     should answer Mr. Obama's tax call by accepting his business \n     tax increases in return for a lower corporate tax rate.\n       We've long favored such a reform, and last year so did the \n     Simpson-Bowles deficit commission and the White House \n     economic advisory council headed by Paul Volcker. But the \n     cause has now acquired no less a convert than Bill Clinton. \n     Speaking Saturday at something called the Aspen Ideas \n     Festival, the former President admitted that he had once \n     raised tax rates on corporations.\n\n[[Page S4364]]\n\n       ``It made sense when I did it. It doesn't make sense \n     anymore. We've got an uncompetitive rate,'' he said. ``We tax \n     at 35% of income, although we only take about 23%. So we \n     should cut the rate to 25%, or whatever's competitive, and \n     eliminate a lot of the deductions so that we still get a fair \n     amount, and there's not so much variance in what the \n     corporations pay.''\n       We opposed Mr. Clinton's tax increases, not least because \n     corporations don't pay taxes so much as they serve as a \n     collecting agent. But on the rest of Mr. Clinton's riff, \n     Milton Friedman and Robert Mundell couldn't have put it \n     better, though perhaps they'd think that 25% is still too \n     high.\n       We'd prefer 15% ourselves, but Mr. Clinton is exactly right \n     on the failure of the 35% rate (39% on average including the \n     states) to capture that share of corporate income in \n     government revenue. We wrote earlier this year about \n     Whirlpool, which had an effective tax rate of zero due to its \n     many write-offs. Everyone knows the notorious case of GE.\n       The average effective corporate rate varies by industry but \n     is far less than the 35% rate, and the injustice is that some \n     pay much less than others if they can afford lobbyists to \n     write loopholes or they invest in politically correct \n     purposes. Anyone not in thrall of class-war symbolism \n     understands that the U.S. corporate tax code provides the \n     worst of both worlds: It makes U.S. companies less \n     competitive even as it is raises much less revenue than \n     advertised. Mr. Obama and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner \n     have acknowledged this in the past, the President as recently \n     as this year's State of the Union address.\n       As for the debt-limit politics, this is also a winner. \n     Democrats and Republicans say they've agreed privately on \n     sizable spending cuts over a 10-year budget window. No doubt \n     some of those cuts are less real than others, and future \n     Congresses could rewrite any enforcement provisions passed \n     this year. But Republicans still have an incentive to set \n     spending on a downward path, and Mr. Obama has an incentive \n     to show he is no longer a hostage of Nancy Pelosi as he runs \n     for re-election.\n       The political sticking point is Mr. Obama's desire for some \n     Republican buy-in on raising revenues. His political left is \n     still sore that he agreed to extend the Bush tax rates \n     through 2012. Thus he's pounding Republicans to agree to \n     eliminate certain business tax deductions that political \n     advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe have told him will \n     be hard for Republicans to defend. Corporate jets. Carried \n     interest for private equity. Oil and gas. Even LIFO \n     accounting, which few understand but can be made to sound \n     nefarious.\n       Whatever their individual merits, each of these would be a \n     tax increase on business, and Republicans campaigned last \n     year on not raising taxes. But the politics is different if \n     they can offset these revenue raisers with lower tax rates. \n     That would let Republicans honestly claim they didn't support \n     a net tax increase, even as Mr. Obama could say he raised \n     revenue.\n       Our own guess is that such a reform would raise far more \n     money than the official scorers would predict, since it would \n     lead to a more efficient allocation of capital and less tax \n     evasion. This would also promote economic growth, breaking \n     out of the austerity mentality driven by debt reduction. If \n     Mr. Obama really is worried that lower federal spending will \n     hurt the economy, then this tax reform is also his best \n     growth policy.\n       In offering his grand bargain on Saturday, Mr. Clinton \n     included the caveat of ``how can they do that by August 2?'' \n     Mr. Geithner says that is the date when he can no longer \n     finagle federal finances to escape a potential default on the \n     debt, or must at least cut some federal spending, to avoid \n     breaching the $14.3 trillion debt limit.\n       But where there's political self-interest there's always a \n     way. Both sides could agree to a short-term debt-limit \n     reprieve of a month or two with some spending cuts that \n     everyone agrees on. That would give them more time to cut a \n     larger deal that includes corporate tax reform.\n       Think about it. On the current path both sides are headed \n     at best for a de minimis deal that makes everyone look bad, \n     at worst for a major political crack-up. Perhaps Mr. Obama \n     wants a crack-up to portray Republicans as extreme. But \n     Republicans should at least call his bluff and answer his \n     demands for fewer business tax deductions by saying yes--in \n     return for lower tax rates.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I quote from it:\n\n       The debt-limit talks in Washington are bogged down in the \n     hedgerows, with some Republicans insisting on a balanced \n     budget amendment that can't pass Congress and President Obama \n     insisting on tax increases that Republicans oppose.

If \n     Mr. Obama really is worried that lower federal spending will \n     hurt the economy, then this tax reform is also his best \n     growth policy.\n\n  The Journal argues that we can offset the costs to businesses of \nclosing loopholes and eliminating subsidies with a cut in the corporate \ntax rate. I completely agree. We should be openminded when considering \nwhat should be eliminated. For instance, the distorting effect of \nsubsidies is clearly evident in the energy sector. We should eliminate \nthese subsidies, lower the corporate tax rate, and allow the \nmarketplace to pick winners and losers, not the government.\n  The ethanol tax is a perfect example. This year the ethanol tax \ncredit cost taxpayers almost $6 billion in addition to the $41.2 \nbillion we have already spent in subsidies on ethanol since 1980.\n  A recent CRS, Congressional Research Service, report indicates that \ntax credits and subsidies for solar, wind, and geothermal power will \ncost $8.6 billion from 2008 to 2012. For the oil and gas industry, the \neight tax breaks recommended for elimination by President Obama would \neliminate $43.6 billion in spending over 10 years. The largest among \nthese tax breaks is the section 199 manufacturing tax subsidies that \nwill cost approximately $18 billion over 10 years. We should eliminate \nthe section 199 tax subsidies for all industries to avoid arbitrarily \npicking winners and losers. Why should we value manufacturing over \nother service providers?\n  Additionally, we should eliminate all agricultural subsidies, \nincluding sugar programs, end corporate welfare, and end tax breaks for \ncorporations for things such as corporate jets. We need to put aside \nthe rhetoric of corporate jets, which is just a poll-tested political \nphrase concocted behind one-way mirrors. Everyone knows eliminating all \ntax breaks on corporate jets would not amount to any real progress, but \nif we seriously looked at curbing corporate subsidies, such as the \nethanol subsidy I just mentioned, then all Americans would benefit.\n  I feel the need to provide my colleagues with some straight talk. As \nthe Journal notes, some of my Republican colleagues are ``insisting on \na balanced budget amendment that can't pass Congress.'' Let me be \nclear--I am an avid supporter of a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. Since 1983, I have introduced or cosponsored more than a \ndozen bills or amendments calling for a balanced budget amendment, and \nI have had the privilege of\n\n[[Page S4365]]\n\nvoting in favor of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution no \nless than 13 times in my Congressional career. I applaud my colleagues \nfor their tireless dedication to this cause. But our reality today \ndictates that we do not have the votes in this body to enact such a \nmeasure. Perhaps that will change after next year. I hope so. But for \nour purposes today, in order to avoid what could be disastrous \nconsequences for our markets, our economy as a whole, and our standing \nin the world, I encourage my colleagues to lay aside, at least \ntemporarily, their insistence that amending the Constitution be a \ncondition of their support for a solution to this terrible problem.\n  The Wall Street Journal editorial ends with this:\n\n       Think about it. On the current path both sides are headed \n     at best for a de minimis deal that makes everyone look bad, \n     at worst for a major political crack-up. Perhaps Mr. Obama \n     wants a crack-up to portray Republicans as extreme.\n\n  As my colleague from Massachusetts just did.\n\n       But Republicans should at least call his bluff and answer \n     his demands for fewer business tax deductions by saying yes--\n     in return for lower tax rates.\n\n  I couldn't agree more with the Wall Street Journal. This debate \ndesperately needs a breakout strategy. I am pleased to see that \nPresident Clinton has joined the Wall Street Journal in embracing a \ncommonsense solution to this problem. I hope President Obama will \nfollow former President Clinton's lead and the example set by the great \nRonald Reagan and put aside politics, work with the Congress on this \nmatter, and accept a compromise that will allow us to responsibly deal \nwith our debt while creating jobs and spurring economic growth.\n  I would like to point out again:\n\n       The average effective corporate rate varies by industry but \n     is far less than the 35 percent rate, and the injustice is \n     that some pay much less than others if they can afford \n     lobbyists to write loopholes or they invest in politically \n     correct purposes. Anyone not in thrall of class-war symbolism \n     understands that the U.S. corporate tax code provides the \n     worst of both worlds: It makes U.S. companies less \n     competitive even as it raises much less revenue than \n     advertised.\n\n  So the fact is, the corporate Tax Code needs to be reformed anyway, \nand we need to cut it to 25 percent. It is either the first or the \nsecond highest tax rate in the world. Yet somehow major corporations \nsuch as Whirlpool and GE end up paying no taxes, but yet small \nbusinesspeople who can't afford a lobbyist here in Washington end up \npaying the 35-percent rates if they are incorporated. It is time we \ntell the American people who are frustrated by our lack of leadership, \nby our failure to come together. It is time to end the rhetoric, \nfulfill the commitment we made to the American people last November who \nresoundingly sent the message that they want the spending cut and the \nmortgaging of our children's future stopped. This is a reasonable \nproposal that I believe, with spending cuts, can be a breakthrough that \nwe can proudly return to our constituents and say we are taking care of \nthem, not the special interests and not hide-bound ideology.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I ask unanimous consent that the time of the \ndebate of the previous order be extended until 7 p.m., with all the \nprovisions of the previous order remaining in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I ask unanimous consent I be able to speak for \n15 minutes as in morning business and that Senator Coons be allowed to \nspeak as in morning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I believe we may be in a \nsituation where we are exchanging speeches one side and the other. May \nI withdraw my unanimous consent request for Senator Coons?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The consent is vitiated.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I came to the floor to \ndeliver a speech on the debt ceiling and all the activity surrounding \nthe need to increase our debt ceiling, but I took the time to listen to \nSenator McCain while I was here, and I have to say I agree with Senator \nMcCain. We need a breakout strategy. We need cooler heads to prevail, \nand I think many, if not all, of us can agree our tax system is overly \ncomplex. It ought to be simplified. We ought to lower rates. We ought \nto end the loopholes and the subsidies and the deductions and let the \nfree market reign. I look forward to working with the Senator from \nArizona as we, hopefully--and hope sometimes is a strategy--but we get \na broad agreement, we go big. We deal with our debt, we strengthen our \nentitlement programs, we reduce spending, and find ways to generate \nmore revenues.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona for his comments.\n  I rise, as I just implied, because I think the fiscal challenges that \nconfront us demand a bipartisan solution. Both parties approach the \nissues before us from very different points of view, but time is truly \nrunning out on our Nation's structural deficits and our long-term debt \nand the need for us to address those. I want leaders in both parties to \nshow genuine commitment to action. How about if we set aside our \ntalking points so we can get some work done. If any other Members \nbelieve the solution to our deficit and debt demands comprehensive and \nbipartisan solution such as the fiscal commission or the Gang of 6, I \nwould invite them to come down to the floor and let our colleagues know \nwe are clearly racing toward a crisis that seems like we can't let go \nof the partisanship and the political posturing that creates gridlock \nin the Capital City of Washington. It sure strikes me as childish. I \nthink it strikes many Americans and Coloradans as that way as well.\n  We are more broadly having this debate because the time is upon us to \ndecide the economic future of our country. Yes, we have to raise the \nnational debt, but this is about our economic future, and this is the \ncountry we inherited by our children and grandchildren. Quite simply, \nwe are not going to win the global economic race of this 21st century \nunless we start taking action now to improve our economy, grow American \njobs, and get our debt under control. With these challenges, as large \nas they are facing us, this is the time to set aside our political \ndifferences and challenge ourselves to put our country first.\n  A few basic facts focus the attention. Our national debt is $14 \ntrillion and it is growing. Today, each citizen's share of that debt is \nover $46,000 per individual. If we remain on this path, which is \nirresponsible, there is no question about that. The Government \nAccountability Office projects that by 2050, our Nation could owe more \ninterest on our debt than the Federal Government raises in taxes in a \ngiven year, and our sky-rocketing debt is not only spooking \ninternational markets, but it is a serious threat to our national \nsecurity. Listen to Secretary of Defense Gates or Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs Admiral Mullen, they will make that point in a compelling \nfashion. Look, we got here in ways that are not simple. But \nunquestionably two unpaid-for wars, two rounds of massive tax cuts, \nunpaid-for prescription drug benefits, and drastic rescue measures \nneeded to address the most serious economic downturn since the Great \nDepression have all contributed to the current situation.\n  The solutions are even more difficult. While we may disagree about \nthe path forward, I think we all know in our hearts that we cannot get \nto a solution unless we all agree to come to the negotiating table \nwilling to compromise to ensure that our country, the United States--\nthe largest economy in the world--can honor our bills and begin to pay \ndown our debts. That is the challenge, that is the problem, that is the \nopportunity, as I see it, that brings us to the Senate floor today.\n  We began this year with serious and, I believe, earnest conversations \nabout this in not one but two groups of lawmakers in the House and \nSenate. Yet, despite all the talk and a lot of hard work, rather than \nnearing an agreement, we seem to be coming to an impasse. In the last \nfew weeks, the state of negotiations seems to have fallen apart, with \nkey players choosing to walk away rather than compromise. We hit the \nsame roadblock that always inhibits action when things get tough: \nPolitics get in the way.\n\n[[Page S4366]]\n\n  In fact, it seems as if everybody in the world except the Congress \nseems to know time is running out. Think back to April. Standard & \nPoor's cut the U.S. ratings outlook to ``negative'' due to the \nuncertainty over budget deficits and the debt ceiling. This month, \nMoody's piled on, warning that it too may downgrade the U.S. ratings \noutlook to ``negative'' as early as July--it is July 6--because of \nconcern over gridlock in Washington.\n  I have to say the American people are running out of patience as \nwell. Back home in Colorado, people are wondering what in the world we \nare doing in Washington. I was not up for reelection in 2010, but I was \nlistening to what the voters were saying. They clearly said to us they \nwant us focused on jobs, the economy, and the debt. And they want us to \nwork together.\n  Consider the direction I got recently from Curt, who is a constituent \nin Arvada, CO. He wrote:\n\n       I am counting on you to put the interests of everyday \n     Americans above party politics and join your legislative \n     colleagues on both sides of the aisle in finding sensible \n     solutions to our long-term national debt problem.\n\n  Many more Coloradans have sent me similar messages. I got one from a \nBoy Scout, David, in Evergreen, CO, whose words were stronger than \nmine. He said:\n\n       I think the United States government should stop spending \n     unnecessary money. We should first focus on what is \n     necessary. . . . It is amazing how much money our country \n     owes. It is constantly going up! I just looked at information \n     about the United States debt clock, and I think this debt is \n     way too high. People in the federal government in Washington \n     D.C., are spending money as if they had all the money in the \n     world.\n\n  David, if you are listening, I agree.\n  No question, Americans want quality roads, a safety net for the sick \nand elderly, and strong investments in education and research that will \nspur innovation and good-paying jobs. But we need to commit to ensuring \nwe have the financial stability to pay for them.\n  For too long, the American people have collectively been told by us \nhere in Washington that they can have more of everything they want \nwithout us fully paying for it. But to preserve a promising future for \nour children--for Curt's children, for David--we are going to need to \nface up to some hard truths.\n  Fifty years ago, my father, former Arizona Congressman Mo Udall, \nsupported what should only seem natural: tying spending directly to \nrevenues. Let me give you a couple examples. If we want to give oil \ncompanies $1 billion in tax subsidies, then let's raise taxes by $1 \nbillion to pay for them. The same thing, though, goes for overseas \nconflicts, agricultural subsidies, infrastructure, and, yes, even \nentitlements.\n  Coloradans from across my home State have told me they want to see \ntheir leaders try using some common sense--the kind of common sense \nAmericans use when they are faced with the hard job of balancing their \nown budgets when money is tight.\n  As a Senator, I have successfully led the fight to end wasteful \nearmark spending, proposed measures to cut redundant government \nprograms, demanded line-item veto authority for the President, and, \nyes, pushed--and I see my colleagues from the other side of the aisle \nhere--for a very sensible balanced budget amendment to our U.S. \nConstitution. But these measures only serve as tools to get Washington \nto clean up its act, and that is not enough. We need to suck up our \ncourage and actually make the tough budgeting decisions.\n  If we are going to get anywhere, we have to realize we all have skin \nin the game and we have to check ultimatums at the door--especially on \nissues such as Social Security and taxes. The challenge facing us is so \ngreat we cannot afford to let partisanship or electioneering get in the \nway--and both parties are guilty.\n  For example, we cannot seriously address debt reduction without \nlooking at Social Security. If we do nothing, by 2036, Social Security \nbenefits will have to be cut by 20 percent. Congress will undoubtedly \nbe under enormous pressure to fill in that hole in lieu of telling \nseniors their benefit checks would be reduced. To say Social Security--\nwhen you look at it that way--must be divorced from deficit reduction, \nas many Democrats do, is to ignore the problem.\n  In a similar vein, it is unrealistic to maintain, as my Republican \ncolleagues do, that raising revenues cannot be a part of the deficit \nand debt reduction equation. We should all be honest enough to admit a \nsimple fact: No amount of spending cuts alone will reduce our deficits \nwithout unreasonably harming Social Security and Medicare. For some to \nsay that revenues should not be part of the deficit reduction picture \nis either a sign that they are not serious about getting our debt \nsituation under control or they are being disingenuous about the \ndangerous implications spending cuts alone would have on our hard-\nworking constituents who rely on these important programs.\n  What is so agonizing about the last 6 months is that we have a \nbipartisan solution in front of us, one that I know--I don't just \nbelieve but I know--would responsibly reduce our debt while also \nallowing the economy to grow and protect our middle class.\n  In December 2009, I know the Presiding Officer and I, along with a \nnumber of other Senators, pushed for the creation of the President's \nNational Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, which was then \nchaired by Erskine Bowles, a North Carolinian, and Alan Simpson, a \nWyoming resident. They did an exhaustive study of what it would take to \nget our debt under control, and last year they delivered a report on \nhow to reduce the debt by over $4 trillion in the next decade and bend \nthe curve back to a much more sustainable Federal budget situation. \nThey comprehensively addressed all of the issues that must be on the \ntable; namely, spending cuts, reasonable entitlement reform, and some \nnew revenues. The plan has already received bipartisan support, \nincluding from Senators of each party who were members of the \ncommission. Rather than arguing, we could be acting on these \nrecommendations. And, look, if we do not want to follow those exact \nrecommendations, let's all at least agree that everything must be on \nthe table in these ongoing debt discussions.\n  Many of us here simply want to roll up our sleeves and get to work. I \nsee some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I know they \nshare that sentiment, even if our leaderships in both parties are \ndemanding that we be quiet. But I think we can all focus our attention \non a sensible, bipartisan plan, work together, and pass it into law \nbefore our national credit rating is downgraded and we damage our \nchances of winning the global economic race.\n  The Presiding Officer knows, my colleagues know, I am not a \nparticularly dramatic person. But I have to tell you, I believe that \nnothing less than the fate of the U.S. economy hangs in the balance, \nand I am certainly willing to stay here day and night, weekends and \nholidays, in Washington, DC, to help put a plan in motion.\n  Madam President, thank you for your attention.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I rise to follow the comments of my \ncolleague from Colorado, and I appreciate the forbearance of my \ncolleagues from Florida and New Hampshire.\n  I simply want to follow on the comments of the Senator from Colorado \nin emphasizing the sense of urgency, the sense of frustration and of \ndeep concern I know many of us feel in the Senate of the United States.\n  On the Fourth of July, as I went up and down the State of Delaware to \ndifferent parades and picnics and gatherings, I had the opportunity to \nmeet with and talk to thousands of Delawareans. Over and over, I would \ngo up to men who were wearing hats that showed they served, whether in \nthe Korean war, the Vietnam war, the Second World War, and I thanked \nthem for their service. Repeatedly, I would hear the same thing back: \nWe have done our job. We hope you will do yours.\n  When I was elected in 2010 to serve in the Senate, I heard the same \nmessage from the folks across Delaware that I just heard Senator Udall \nreflect from the people of Colorado: Help the private sector create \ngood jobs, deal with the deficit and debt, and do it in a bipartisan \nand responsible way.\n  I am gravely concerned we are on the verge of the most predictable \nfinancial crisis in modern American history as we slowly grind toward \nthe predicted default on America's mortgage on August 2.\n\n[[Page S4367]]\n\n  Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner has warned us since the beginning of \nthis year with a letter he sent to us on January 6, with repeated \ntestimony in front of various committees of the Senate. We have gone \nwell past the May 16 deadline, and the Department of the Treasury is \nnow using extraordinary measures to prevent us from defaulting on \nAmerica's commitments.\n  I have heard other analogies used, but they are mistaken. This is not \nabout cutting up the credit cards or ending the blank check for our \ncurrent President. This is about whether we will continue to meet the \ncommitments America has already made, whether we will continue to make \nthe payments that were already committed to for our troops in the \nfield, for contractors who are providing military supplies and \nequipment, for our Federal workforce, and for all the different \nprograms and benefits the Senator who spoke before me mentioned: \nMedicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and others.\n  We cannot afford the consequences of default. One study says we would \nlose 640,000 jobs--more than a half a million additional Americans \nneedlessly thrown out of work because of a foolish game of chicken. The \ncost to home mortgages, to car loans, the daily cost of living, \nincluding for food and gas, would go up needlessly if we simply fail to \nuphold the tradition of meeting our commitments as a nation.\n  I am here to say today that we cannot afford to have America become a \nbad investment. The best thing we can do going forward is to restore \ncertainty to our markets, to put some confidence back in the American \neconomy, to make certain the international community continues to \nregard us as the safest and best investment in the world. The way to do \nthat is to come together in a bipartisan way around a big deal, around \n$4 trillion in savings, at least.\n  The Senator from Colorado went into some detail as to the bipartisan \nDebt and Deficit Commission, chaired by Erskine Bowles and Alan \nSimpson, the Democratic former Chief of Staff and the Republican former \nSenator from Wyoming, with the 11 members of that commission, including \nMembers of this body, currently serving Senators, Republican and \nDemocrat, who came together around a plan that would make $4 trillion \nin savings over the next decade.\n  I think we should do no less than that. I think the plan we should be \nworking on in detail now should include all four major areas where we \nhave to have savings: reductions in discretionary domestic spending, \nreform to our entitlement programs, reductions in Pentagon spending, \nand increases in Federal revenue through tax reform. All four of these \nhave to be on the table. In my view, our values ask no less than that.\n  As we work through a recovery, we need to continue to invest in \neducation, in infrastructure, in innovation. But we also need to \nresponsibly put together a bipartisan path that will take on the sacred \ncows of this institution and of America's Tax Code.\n  Three weeks ago, we had more than 70 Senators cast votes to end the \n$6 billion in needless annual ethanol subsidies. I hope that was an \nopening door toward a recognition that on both sides of the aisle and \nin both Chambers of this Congress we need to be willing to make the \ntough votes even though they will upset treasured constituencies, even \nthough they will end up causing us potential political harm, to reduce \nreckless Federal spending, whether through the Tax Code or through \nunsustainable Federal programs.\n  In the end, I simply wanted to come to the floor today and add my \nvoice to that of many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who \nare expressing our grave concern. As the clock ticks away and as the \nhours left to August 2 shrink, we need to come together.\n  What Americans have done for generations is sacrificed. What \nlegislators need to do now is compromise. There are in front of us \nreasonable, solid, bipartisan proposals that have been available to us \nsince March and that this body and our leadership need to be willing to \nmake responsible compromises to make happen.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse.) The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to enter into a colloquy with my Republican colleague Senator \nRubio for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, it is an honor to be here with my esteemed \ncolleague from Florida, Senator Marco Rubio. My husband Joe and I are \nblessed to be the parents of two wonderful children, our daughter Kate, \nwho is 6 years old, and our son Jacob, who is 3 years old.\n  This Fourth of July we walked together as a family in the parade in \nWolfeboro, NH. As I watched my children in the parade hand out candy to \nother New Hampshire children while they were standing with their \nparents, it reminded me again of why I am here and how concerned I am \nabout the future of our country for Kate and Jacob and for all of our \nchildren.\n  As parents, we all want to provide our children with a brighter and \nat least the same if not greater opportunities we have all had in the \ngreatest country on Earth. That is the American dream, that a young \nwoman like me from a middle-class family can have the opportunity to \nserve in this Chamber; that someone like Senator Rubio, the son of \nCuban immigrants, could serve as a Senator from Florida, a leader of \nour great country who has come here to address our challenges.\n  I am fearful that we are the first generation that will not pass on \nthe American dream to the next generation. With the accumulation of $14 \ntrillion in debt, we are borrowing 40 cents on the dollar to fund our \ngovernment. Half of our debt we have borrowed from other countries, \nincluding the country of China, a country that does not share our \nvalues. I am concerned with the amount of debt we have accumulated, \nthat if we do not address this debt crisis right here and now, we are \nensuring our children will have less opportunities than we have all \nhad.\n  We have seen what is happening in Greece. If we do not address our \ndebt, with real, substantive legislative proposals, ideas we have \nalready proposed in this Chamber, Members of both side of the aisle--\nthe balanced budget amendment, spending cap legislation, how about a \nreal budget resolution that reduces spending and puts forth a \nresponsible fiscal plan for this country--we will be setting up our \nchildren to pay for our failure to act today with either massive tax \nincreases or the value of our dollar will be diminished and everything \nthey own will be worth less and everything that we own, and it will \ndiminish their economic opportunities in this great country.\n  I know Senator Rubio is the father of four young children. What is it \nthe Senator is most concerned about with respect to the future of our \ngreat country?\n  Mr. RUBIO. Well, first I want to thank the Senator from New Hampshire \nfor allowing me the opportunity to do this together because it is \nimportant. She brings a tremendous amount of credibility to this \ndiscussion. She is not just a mother and a Senator, but she is also a \nsmall business owner who has run a small business, been there on the \nfront lines with her husband running a small business, who recently got \noff the campaign trail, as I did, and heard from job creators all \nacross the State as to what they are talking about, and we are going to \nget back to that in a moment.\n  But as the Senator rightfully outlined, I am the father of four young \nchildren, four children whom I think deserve to inherit a country that \nis as great as the one my parents and their generation left us, and \nthat is what we are debating here at the end of the day.\n  If you look at the numbers, they are absolutely startling. I think \nthese numbers have been said before, but you cannot say them enough--\n$14.3 trillion of debt. Trillion is not a number or a figure I have \never used in my life until I got to Washington. I do not know where \nelse in the world that applies other than in the Congress, the term \ntrillion--$14.3 trillion is our debt.\n  Our kids already owe $46,000. My oldest is only 11 and already owes \n$46,000. Our total debt is about to reach the size of our entire \neconomy. That is kind of the framework in which we are operating when \nwe discuss this.\n  I actually think we are closer to some sort of an agreement than a \nlot of people realize. I have heard the term\n\n[[Page S4368]]\n\nthrown around in the last couple of days, ``a balanced approach'' to \ndealing with it. And I think there is agreement that there has to be a \nbalanced approach. I certainly have always said you cannot simply cut \nyour way out of this problem. You have to have a combination of cuts \nand growth, growth in revenues to government. I think the debate is--\nthe debate is--how do you accomplish these two things. I am not going \nto focus so much on the cut part of it today. I want to focus on the \nrevenue part of it, because that is the part the President and some of \nmy colleagues here have focused on over the last days, this idea of \ngetting more revenue, or this new term ``revenue enhancers'' which is \nWashington talk for more money to the government.\n  According to the President, for some in his party--most in his party, \nI should say--the idea is simple. They think there is a bunch of people \nout there in America who are making a lot of money, more money than \nmaybe they should be making, and they need to pay more in taxes; if \nthese people pay more in taxes, then all of these problems will get a \nlot easier to deal with. That is kind of the viewpoint they bring to \nthis debate.\n  I know tomorrow we will be voting here on the floor on something the \nmajority leader has offered, something called a sense of the Senate, \nwhich people watching at home are probably wondering what that is \nabout. Well, that basically means what is on the Senate's mind.\n  The sense of the Senate we are going to be voting on tomorrow is \nbasically that you have a bunch of people in this country who make over \n$1 million, and that these people need to do more to help with the \ndebt. That is basically the sense of the Senate that there is going to \nbe a vote on tomorrow. It is very interesting. So I looked at it, \nbecause ultimately this is a serious issue. So let's explore this with \nan open mind. Let's not be doctrinaire. Let's not be blindly \nideological. Let's look at this from a commonsense perspective, this \nidea that if all of these millionaires and billionaires paid more \ntaxes, these problems will be solved. Let's analyze it, because this is \nall about math.\n  Here is the fact. The fact is it does not solve the problem. First of \nall, if you taxed these people at 100 percent--basically next year you \nsaid: Look, every penny you make next year the government is going to \ntake from you--it still does not solve the debt.\n  Not only does that not solve the debt problem, but I looked at a host \nof other--there are some great publications that came out today from \nthe Joint Economic Committee. Our colleague Senator DeMint is the \nchairman. It kind of outlines some of the tax increases being proposed \nby our colleagues in the Democratic Party and the President to solve \nthe debt problem.\n  You add them all up, you add all of these things up--the jet \nairplanes, the oil companies, all the other things they have talked \nabout. You put them all together in one big batch, and you know what it \ndoes? It basically deals with 9 days and 23 hours worth of deficit \nspending--9 days and 23 hours--it does not even get to 10 days of \ndeficit spending. That is how much it solves.\n  So all of this talk about going after people who make all of this \nmoney, it buys you 9 days and 23 hours. Let's round it off. Let's give \nthem the benefit of the doubt. It buys them 10 days of deficit spending \nreduction. That is what all of this rounds up to.\n  Here is the bottom line. These tax increases they are talking about, \nthese so-called revenue enhancers, do not solve the problem. So what do \nwe do then? Because clearly we have to do two things. One, we have to \nhold the line on spending. If you keep digging yourself in the hole, \nthe hole is going to bury you. But the other thing is, how do you start \ngenerating revenue for government so it can start paying down this \ndebt. That is what the debate should be about.\n  We already know these taxes they are talking do not work. So here is \nwhat works. Here is what I would suggest works, in a balanced \napproach--using the President's terminology. Let's stop talking about \nnew taxes and start talking about creating new taxpayers, which \nbasically means jobs.\n  Here in Washington, this debt is the No. 1 issue on everyone's mind, \nand rightfully so. It is a major issue. But everywhere else in the real \nworld, the No. 1 issue on people's minds is jobs. And I will tell you \nevery other problem facing America--the mortgage crisis, home \nforeclosure crisis, this debt problem--all of these issues get easier \nto deal with as people are gainfully employed across America. The \nimpact that unemployment is having across this country is devastating. \nWe hear about unemployment in facts and figures. They give us numbers: \nOh, X percent people are unemployed. Well, there are stories behind \nevery one of those people.\n  Do you know who a lot of these people are who are unemployed in \nAmerica? They are people who have done everything they have been asked \nto do and they have done it right. Maybe they served their country \noverseas. Maybe they went to college and got a degree and now came back \nhome. Maybe they worked for 10 or 20 years and did a good job at work. \nAnd now you know what, they cannot find a job, or maybe they were lucky \nenough to find a job after losing their original job, but it pays them \nhalf as much and they work twice as long. That is the real face of \nunemployment in America, of people who are hurting.\n  Our job here is to do everything we can to make it easier for them to \nfind a job, not harder. I think that is what we have to do when it \ncomes to a balanced approach and when we talk about revenue. We do not \nneed new taxes. We need new taxpayers, people who are gainfully \nemployed making money and paying into the tax system. Then we need a \ngovernment that has the discipline to take that additional revenue and \nuse to it pay down the debt and never grow it again. That is what we \nshould be focused on. That is what we are not focused on.\n  So you look at all of those taxes that are being proposed. Here is \nwhat I say: I say we should analyze every single one of them through \nthe lens of job creation, issue No. 1 in America. I want to know which \none of these taxes they are proposing will create jobs. I want to know \nhow many jobs are going to be created by the plane tax. How many jobs \nare going to be created by the oil company tax that I heard so much \nabout? How many jobs are created by going after the millionaires and \nbillionaires that the President talked about? I want to know how many \njobs do they create.\n  Because I will tell you--and I am going to turn it over to Senator \nAyotte in a second, because I am interested in her perspective of this \nas a job creator, as a spouse of a job creator who runs a small \nbusiness, as someone like me who just came off the campaign trail.\n  Let me tell you something. I traveled the State of Florida for 2 \nyears campaigning. I have never met a job creator who told me they were \nwaiting for the next tax increase before they started growing their \nbusiness. I never met a single job creator who has ever said to me: I \ncannot wait until government raises taxes again so I can go out and \ncreate a job. I am curious to know if they say that in New Hampshire, \nbecause they do not say that in Florida.\n  So my view on all this is, I want to know how many jobs these tax \nincreases the President proposes will create, because if they are not \ncreating jobs and they are not creating new taxpayers, they are not \nsolving the problem.\n  I do not know what the Senator's perspective is on that.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I could not agree more with what my \ncolleague from Florida has said, that we need to create a positive \nclimate to create jobs. But one thing we do know is that does not \nhappen by more spending in Washington. The recent report that came out \nabout the President's stimulus package has shown that it cost $278,000 \nper job created by that stimulus package. Yet we had to borrow so much \nmoney, nearly $1 trillion to create a limited number of jobs that cost \nus $278,000 a job.\n  I do come from a small business family. My husband started a \nlandscaping and snow-plowing business. I worked with him to start that \nbusiness. New Hampshire is a small business State. As I campaigned up \nand down our State, I talked to so many small business owners. I never \nhad a small business owner tell me they were being taxed too little, \nplease tax me more.\n  What I did hear was too many burdensome regulations from Washington\n\n[[Page S4369]]\n\nwere coming down and making it difficult for our small businesses to \nthrive and grow. Frankly, some of the taxes coming down from Washington \nwere making it difficult. In the health care bill, there was a tax on \nmedical device companies. New Hampshire has nearly 50 of those \ncompanies. And what I heard from those companies--and I have heard that \neven more recently--is the tax in that health care bill on medical \ndevice companies is going to take away significant amounts of their \nresearch and development budget to create new products that will \nimprove the quality of our health care and save lives.\n  So with the actions we are taking in Washington, we need to create a \npositive climate for our small businesses, not thinking that we create \nthe jobs here in Washington. We know that it is those small businesses \nand the hard-working entrepreneurs and those who have a great idea in \nthis country in the private sector who create those jobs. They do not \nneed more taxes and burdens from Washington. What we need to do is \nfrankly get out of their way and allow them to thrive and grow and to \ncreate jobs for all of our children going forward.\n  I do not know if the Senator heard from businesses in Florida about \nthe regulatory concerns and burdens from Washington hurting economic \ngrowth in the private sector.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Well, the truth is that throughout the campaign and even \nnow, that is what I hear all of the time from people, that these \nregulations are making it harder, not easier, for them to create jobs. \nThat, combined with the uncertainty of the Tax Code--they do not know \nwhat the taxes are going to be next year. But they read the newspaper, \nthey listen to the news, and every time they hear talk about this tax \nincrease stuff, it scares job creators. They make this decision: Oh, \nwait. You know what, maybe this is not the year to hire people, because \nwe still do not know how much it is going to cost to hire people.\n  The other great phrase here--both Senator Ayotte and I have only been \nhere a few months so I think we are still learning the language of \nWashington; I hope it never becomes part of my permanent vocabulary, \nbut one of the things I have been hearing recently is this notion of \neverything should be on the table, which is funny because everything is \nnot on the table according to the President and others.\n  For example, there is no serious discussion of a spending cap. I \nwould love to have a vote. Why do we not have a vote on the balanced \nbudget amendment? Why is that not on the table? Why is a balanced \nbudget amendment not on the table? Why are we not voting on that \ntomorrow? Because a balanced budget amendment basically says you cannot \nspend money you do not have, which makes all of the sense in the world \nfor the rest of the people who live in the real world. But, apparently, \nthat doesn't apply here, and the results are these problems we face. I \nthink something should be off the table. Bad ideas should be off the \ntable. If something is a bad idea, it should not be on the table. It is \na bad idea to pass things that will make it harder to hire people. How \nmuch higher do you want unemployment to be?\n\n  Here is what I think we have to ask ourselves: These tax increases \nSenator Ayotte pointed out, along with the regulations that kill job \ncreation in America--these do not raise enough money to do anything \nsignificant about the debt. They don't create jobs; in fact, they kill \nthem. How could the tax increases they are outlining be part of the \nsolution? Why is it being offered? These are smart people. They know \nthe math. The answer lies in the politics of this, which is clear.\n  This appears to be an effort to save face. Everybody here knows there \nwill have to be spending reductions at some level because we have a \nspending problem. It is the reason we are in this mess today. It is not \nbecause we don't pay enough taxes. We spend more money--a lot more \nmoney--than we have.\n  It appears to me that the President and others in his party are \npositioning and looking for some pound of flesh in return for these \ncuts so they can go to their political base and say: We got something \nout of this. We went after the people who make all this money--the \ngreedy billionaires and millionaires and the oil companies--even though \nit has nothing to do with the debt.\n  That is the only explanation for why this is even on the table. I \nthink anything that kills jobs should be off the table. I think \nanything that hurts the ability of the job creators to grow their \nbusiness should be off the table. I think anything that helps increase \nthe unemployment rate should be off the table. I think that is what \nshould be off the table--anything that hurts our ability to grow our \neconomy.\n  Things that force this government, once and for all, to put itself \nback on the path of sanity should be on the table. Sanity means we stop \nhaving a government that spends money it doesn't have.\n  I will turn it back over to Senator Ayotte to close. I thank her for \nthis opportunity. I thought it was important to bring these points to \nthe floor.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank Senator Rubio for his leadership on this issue \nand for the important issues he has raised today because he is \nabsolutely right that class warfare is unproductive.\n  The proposals the President has made are not serious in terms of how \nmuch revenue they would even address--not even 10 days' of our debt. \nUnfortunately, right now, the leader of the Senate has brought forward \na resolution, a nonbinding sense of the Senate, that does nothing to \naddress the spending in Washington, and we are spending over 24 percent \nof our GDP, or our economy, right now. Historically, we have spent \nabout 20 percent of our GDP. Our spending is way out of line from where \nwe have been over the 40-year historical level. Common sense tells us, \nwhy not a balanced budget amendment? Why aren't we addressing that \ninstead of a nonbinding resolution that, again, will have no effect--\nwill not reduce our deficit, will not help create any jobs, and will \nnot help our economy thrive? We should be addressing real legislation--\na balanced budget amendment.\n  I could not agree more with my colleague from Florida about living \nwithin our means. Families sit around their kitchen tables and make the \ntough decisions. They see the revenue coming in and the expenditures \ngoing out. Washington should do the same. Spending caps will ensure \nthat we put handcuffs on Congress to make sure we are not spending this \ndrastic 24 percent of our GDP and putting ourselves on a more \nresponsible spending path going forward, and a budget resolution.\n  It has been nearly 2 years since the Senate has passed a budget. No \nbusiness would run without a budget. Families make budgets. Here in the \nSenate, what we should be bringing to the floor is a real budget \nresolution that the parties can debate to put ourselves on a \nresponsible fiscal path going forward rather than voting on a sense of \nthe Senate that will, again, not have any impact and the full force of \nlaw.\n  With this August 2 deadline, it is time for real legislative \nproposals and solutions. We have put some ideas out there--a balanced \nbudget amendment, a spending cap amendment, a real budget resolution. I \nhope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will come forward so \nwe can work on this fiscal crisis here and now so that my children and \nSenator Rubio's children and all of our children and grandchildren will \nhave greater opportunities in the greatest country on Earth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, there is no question that we are at a \npoint where we have to take substantial and painful steps to get our \nNation's fiscal house in order. That is why we are rightfully working \nto tighten our Nation's belt at a time when American families are doing \nthe same.\n  I am here to talk about one major difference in the way Republicans \nhave proposed to go about addressing our budget and the way American \nfamilies, who understand shared sacrifice and equal burden, have done \nit. I will point out one glaring omission in the Republicans' plan amid \nall their tough talk about fiscal responsibility.\n  I am here to ask Republicans why they are asking everyone to \nsacrifice except those who can afford it the most?\n  I am here to ask them why they are willing to risk not only \ndefaulting on our Nation's debt but also the health care and benefits \nour veterans rely on,\n\n[[Page S4370]]\n\npay for our troops, Social Security benefits, and the Medicare system \nour seniors are counting on--all to defend tax breaks for oil and gas \ncompanies, sweetheart deals for corporations, and the most generous tax \nrates wealthy Americans have enjoyed in 60 years.\n  Sometimes it is hard for me to listen to some of my Republican \ncolleagues talk at length about their newfound fiscal sensibilities on \nthe Senate floor and in the press. It is difficult because, like many \nof them, I was here in 2000. I remember when President Clinton left \noffice. We were on a course to completely pay down the $5.6 trillion \ndebt by 2012. I remember the projection of surpluses. I remember the \nefforts by many of us to safeguard that funding for our seniors and to \npay down that debt. But I can also remember at that time many \nRepublicans could not wait to get their hands on the Nation's credit \ncard. When they did--when President Bush took office--they spent \nlavishly.\n  A lot of that spending went to some of our Nation's wealthiest \nindividuals and companies. Throughout the Bush years--and particularly \nin the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003--trillions of dollars in tax \nbreaks went to the very wealthiest Americans.\n  There were capital gains tax rollbacks, tax breaks designed to \nbenefit corporate giants, and a new tax bracket that provided wealthy \nAmericans the lowest tax rates they have enjoyed since World War II. \nThese tax breaks were all unpaid for, all handed out to those who could \nmost afford to pay, and they were all put on the Nation's credit card.\n  Now that that credit card bill has come due, guess who will not be \nasked to pay their fair share? Unfortunately, under the Republican \nplan, it is the wealthy companies and individuals who have benefited \nthe most from their spending. It is corporations such as ExxonMobil \nthat despite reporting a profit of over $10 billion in the first \nquarter of this year--at the same time, by the way, that gas prices for \nfamilies across this country are rising--they are being protected from \na rollback of tax subsidies for oil and gas giants.\n  It is corporate CEOs who are lobbying against closing the tax \nloophole that they enjoy for private jets and yachts. It is companies \nthat all too often ship American jobs overseas but still enjoy offshore \ntax havens.\n  Guess who has drawn a line in the sand to protect these corporations \nand wealthy individuals? It is the very same Republicans who were so \nquick to break out the Nation's credit card when we were running a \nsurplus, the same Republicans who have repeatedly pledged to block any \nnew revenue--even as we have met them far beyond halfway in these \nnegotiations.\n  Finally, guess who it is who is left to pick up the credit card tab \nunder the Republican plan? Unfortunately, it is everybody else. It is \nseniors who, under the Republican budget, will lose access to Medicare \nas we know it; it is students who will be asked to pay more even as \ntuition rises; it is family farmers and those who can't afford health \ncare for their children; it is the middle-class families who have found \nthemselves living paycheck to paycheck.\n  If Republicans get their way, it will be everybody but those who can \nafford it most who will be left to sacrifice alone.\n  Unfortunately, the Republican approach is something that has become \nall too common in the aftermath of this recession.\n  While the effect of this recession is being felt profoundly by \nworking families in lost jobs, lower wages, and less financial security \nthan ever before, the very wealthiest Americans seem to be doing pretty \ndarn fine.\n  On Sunday I picked up the New York Times and noticed they ran an \narticle that showed that the salaries of CEOs at America's largest \ncompanies grew by an average of 23 percent over last year's mark. \nHowever, the same article noted that over the past year, the pay for \naverage workers had declined. It didn't even mention the thousands of \nlayoffs at the same companies where those bonuses have skyrocketed.\n  Unfortunately, that is the same economic theory that Republicans are \nbringing to the budget negotiations. For those who can't afford it, \ntheir budget provides all the perks, none of the sacrifices; all of the \ntax breaks, none of the revenues; all of the benefits, none of the \npain.\n  It doesn't have to be this way. We can have a plan that works for \nmiddle-class families and invests in our Nation's future, a plan that \nbalances tough but necessary spending cuts with new revenues that \nensure corporations and wealthy Americans are also paying their fair \nshare; that restores fairness to this process by making sure that in \nthese difficult times we are not balancing our budget solely on the \nbacks of seniors and students and middle-class families; and, most \nimportantly, a plan that recognizes that, yes, we have a budget deficit \nand we need to address that, but we also have an infrastructure \ndeficit, and we have an education and a skills deficit and, most \nimportantly, we have a jobs deficit.\n  The only way that we will address those deficits is to invest in \neducation, energy, and infrastructure--areas that will produce jobs \nboth now and in the future.\n  Workers who lost their jobs through no fault of their own don't just \nwant to hear about cuts, cuts, cuts. They want to hear about how we are \ngoing to create jobs. A small business owner who had to shut her doors \nwhen the recession hit and customers stopped coming in doesn't want to \nhear about debt ceilings. She wants to hear about how we are going to \nget the economy back on track.\n  It cannot just be about slashing; it also has to be about investing \nin jobs and workers in America. That is what we should be working \ntogether toward.\n  I understand that time is not on our side in this debate. The truth \nis, Republicans aren't merely offering their ``everybody pays except \nthe rich'' philosophy up for debate; they are holding our Nation's \neconomy hostage with it.\n  By refusing to accept new revenues from corporate tax loopholes and \ntying that refusal to the Nation's debt limit, they are rolling the \ndice on default. In fact, in my 18 years on the Senate Budget \nCommittee, I have never seen anything like what Republicans are willing \nto risk in these budget negotiations and who they are willing to risk \nit all for.\n  Last week, the Bipartisan Policy Center put out a report authored by \na former Bush Treasury official about what would happen if Republicans \ncontinued to play chicken with default and the administration was \nforced to make desperate spending decisions in August. The scenarios \nwere worse than grim.\n  Potentially at risk are the benefits and health care we owe our \nveterans, loans for struggling small businesses, food stamps for people \nwho are struggling to buy groceries, Social Security checks for our \nseniors, unemployment benefits for millions of workers who are \ndesperately seeking jobs, and even Active-Duty pay for our military. \nYet by rejecting revenues in this deal, and by not asking everybody to \nsacrifice, and by dealing in ultimatums rather than compromise, \nRepublicans are willing to put all these Americans at risk; and they \nare willing to risk it all in order to go to the mat to protect \nmillions of dollars in tax breaks for the wealthiest few.\n  They are willing to chance loans for Main Street businesses in order \nto defend offshore tax breaks for multinational companies. They are \nwilling to jeopardize troop pay in order to stand up for hedge fund \nmanagers. They are willing to gamble default on tax breaks for horse \ntracks.\n  I believe that is a bet we all lose.\n  Mr. President, we were elected to work for all Americans, not just \nthe privileged few at the top. It is time for our Republican colleagues \nto come to the table with flexibility. It is time for compromise. It is \ntime for common sense. And it is time to ask everyone to sacrifice to \nmeet a challenge we all face together.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have heard a lot of talk on the Senate \nfloor, including from the last speaker, and certainly from the \nPresident of the United States about shared sacrifice. The White House \nspin is that the Democrats in the negotiations about extending the debt \nceiling have conceded hundreds of billions of dollars in savings and \nRepublicans have conceded nothing and therefore Republicans need to be \nwilling to raise taxes. That is the mantra. That is the spin.\n  But there are two things wrong with this spin: First, it is wrong as \na matter\n\n[[Page S4371]]\n\nof fact, as I will point out, and second, it would result in very bad \npolicy. As Senator Rubio said a moment ago, the only thing that should \nbe off the table is bad policy, and certainly anything that would hurt \nour economy and job creation at this time is bad policy.\n  First with regard to the assertion from some in the White House that \nDemocrats have made all the concessions and so it is the Republicans' \nturn--the last speaker, as a matter of fact, said, and I will quote her \ndirectly, ``Everybody pays except the rich.'' Well, I would like to \npoint out why that is absolutely not the case.\n  The negotiations Vice President Biden has presided over have talked \nabout two different kinds of savings: on the discretionary side, which \nis the budget we deal with every year, and on the mandatory side, which \nis spending programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, some of TRICARE, some \nveterans' benefits, Social Security, and things of that sort.\n  If the savings the White House has attempted to portray as all coming \nfrom Democratic concessions refers to the discretionary part of this \npie, then I would simply say that is a false statement because we \nhaven't discussed it. What we have talked about is setting a top-line \nbudget number--a so-called 302(a) number in budget parlance--and that \nis what the Members of the House and Senate would then have to spend. \nBut there has been no discussion of where those savings come from, so \nit simply would be wrong to say there has been any kind of negotiation \nabout where those savings come from and the Democrats have made all of \nthe concessions. There have been no concessions made by either side, as \na matter of fact.\n  If it is the mandatory side we are talking about, it is true we have \nhad a lot of discussion about savings that can result from changes in \nthe way we operate some of these mandatory programs. Now, we are not \ntalking about any major reform of Medicare or anything of that sort, \nbut if I can just sort of characterize something in a very loose way as \nwaste, fraud, and abuse, there are a lot of savings that can occur in \nvarious programs, and there are even some revenue increases that can \nresult from increased fees and that sort of thing that do result in \nsome additional savings overall on the mandatory side.\n  In terms of the revenue increases, I would point out that between \n$153 billion and over $200 billion of the money on that side of the \nledger actually comes from increased revenues. So when the White House \nsays: Well, revenues have to be on the table, the fact is that revenues \nhave been on the table. We have been talking about increased revenues. \nWe are not talking about increasing taxes. But if the government sells \nsomething and gets money from it, that is revenue. If there is a user \nfee of some kind and we want to raise that to keep up with the times, \nthat is revenue. And if you add up all of the revenues we have agreed \nto, we Republicans have agreed to between $150 billion and $200 \nbillion. So it is simply false to suggest that we haven't been willing \nto talk about revenues and that all of the concessions have been on the \nDemocratic side.\n  We have also had some spending reductions or less rate in the growth \nof spending in some of these mandatory programs on the table for \ndiscussion, and about 60 percent of those, in my calculation, are \nconcessions Republicans have made, and about 40 percent are concessions \nDemocrats have made. My Democratic counterparts would probably argue it \nis somewhat different, from their point of view, but the fact is both \nsides have made concessions. And even if you concede they are 50-50, \nthe fact is, therefore, Republicans have made as many concessions in \nthese negotiations as have our Democratic colleagues.\n  By the way, one reason we have both been willing to make concessions \nis we agree we are in a dire circumstance here, and we sometimes have \nto get out of what we call our comfort zone and agree to what in \nordinary times we would never agree to but we realize now we have to \nmake some changes. So we are willing to make concessions that \nordinarily we wouldn't, and we have, and so have the Democrats. The net \nresult, as I said, I think it is 60-40 on our side, plus all the \nrevenues we have conceded. But if somebody on the other side said: No, \nit is 50-50, or something on that order, I wouldn't argue. But the fact \nis, it is false and misleading for the White House to suggest that all \nof the concessions have been made by the Democrats and none have been \nmade by Republicans. That is simply factually incorrect.\n  The second thing that is wrong with this spin is that, as Senator \nRubio said, bad ideas should be off the table, and it is a bad idea to \nraise taxes on an economy that is already sick. I mean, the last thing \nwe should be doing is raising taxes, as a result of which job creation \nwould be inhibited. It is the worst medicine for a sick economy.\n  I asked one of my Democratic colleagues why, since we shouldn't be \nraising taxes at this point in time, there was such an insistence on \nhis side. His response was: Well, you have to understand, with us, it \nis kind of theological. Well, maybe it is theological, but I would \nargue that ideology here has a place to the extent that it is backed up \nby reality, but ideology that is not backed up by reality has no place \nin these negotiations. And raising taxes just for the sake of raising \ntaxes, so that somebody can say to their constituency: Well, we did it, \nwe were able to raise taxes, is not a sound way to approach the \nproblem.\n  Thomas Sowell, one of the most erudite observers of the American \nscene, wrote, in National Review Online on July 5, a piece he titled \n``Politics vs. Reality.'' It goes to this point.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthis article at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. The whole point here about raising taxes is this should not \nbe about shared sacrifice. It shouldn't be about sacrifice at all. We \nare not talking about austerity. We should be talking about \nprosperity--in other words, the conditions by which everyone can do \nwell, and specifically, how we can create jobs, how we can put \nAmericans back to work, and how our economy can grow.\n  As I said, the worst medicine for a sick economy is raising taxes, \nand that is why Republicans oppose tax hikes and not because, for \nexample, I have some interest in protecting some Hollywood movie \nmillionaire. I don't. The person is probably not in my political party. \nWhat I have an interest in is protecting America's small businesses so \nthey do not go broke and so they do not have to close up shop because \nhigher taxes were imposed on them. That is exactly what the President's \nown Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy said would happen \nwith one of the taxes they propose to raise; that is, repealing LIFO, \nwhich is an accounting term meaning last in, first out. The SBA Office \nof Advocacy said repealing LIFO ``would result in a tax increase for \nsmall businesses that could ultimately force many small businesses to \nclose.'' That is from the President's own Office of Advocacy for the \nSBA. That is what I oppose--putting small businesses out of business \njust because of some theological attachment to raising taxes.\n  Accountants have talked for a long time about what the best method of \naccounting is. The IRS has always said LIFO is perfectly acceptable, \nand about 36 percent of American businesses--primarily retailers and \nmanufacturers--use this accounting technique. It would be fine if we \ndecide to say: Well, we are going to go to a different technique. What \nwould be wrong is to retroactively impose a tax on people who have been \nusing this accounting method as though they have been doing something \nwrong. They haven't. The IRS has always said LIFO is fine. But it is \nall about revenue. We need more money to spend, so we are going to \nretroactively tax 36 percent of American businesses that use this \naccounting method. That is wrong, and that is why the Small Business \nAdministration Office of Advocacy has said this could put many small \nbusinesses out of business. It is why we shouldn't be considering it.\n\n  What are the other taxes they propose? Well, one of them is to cap \nitemized deductions, so you would only be able to deduct either 28 \npercent or maybe up to 35 percent of your income. Obviously the first \neffect of this is to make it much more difficult for Americans to \ncontribute to charity, to buy\n\n[[Page S4372]]\n\nhomes because they wouldn't have the advantage of the mortgage interest \ndeduction, or to pay medical expenses, and so on. As the Wall Street \nJournal has editorialized, this is just a backdoor way of raising \nmarginal tax rates without actually appearing to do so.\n  But the biggest problem with this capping of deductions is not that \nit is going to hurt the millionaires. They are either going to be \ncaught by the AMT or their income is so high they are even going to be \npaying above AMT rates notwithstanding these limits on deductions. The \nreal people this hurts are the small business owners who pay in the \nhigher bracket. We know that 50 percent of small business income falls \nin the top two brackets. Businesses have deductions that are the \nordinary and necessary part of doing business. All businesses are \nallowed to take them, both corporate and noncorporate. Why would we \neliminate the ability of small businesses to take the same kinds of \ndeductions corporations can take by capping the amount of deductions \nthat could be taken in income reported in the top two brackets?\n  The final point about this is we know that efforts to tax \nmillionaires and billionaires always end up taxing a lot more people \nthan that. According to the IRS, in 2008 there were only about 319,000 \ntax returns that showed an income of $1 million or more, but the number \nof returns falling in the top two brackets--the ones affected by this \nproposal of the Democrats--numbered more than 3.6 million people. These \nwould be the people who are affected by this proposed increase in \ntaxes.\n  I would just parenthetically note two others. The last millionaire \ntax was the alternative minimum tax. It was created in 1969 and \ntargeted against 155 millionaires. Guess how many people it will apply \nto this year. It will apply to 34.4 million Americans. So when you aim \nfor the millionaires, you end up getting everybody else.\n  The third tax the Democrats talk about raising is the old favorite: \nBig Oil. This is so targeted, it only hits five companies in the whole \nworld, five American companies. Never mind that we are punishing \nAmerican businesses--American oil companies--that are in the same \nbusiness as other companies all over the world that are not being \npunished. No, we are going to attack American businesses that, by the \nway, employ 9.2 million Americans. We are going to say they have to pay \nhigher taxes than other businesses just like them.\n  There are three particular tax provisions.\n  Other businesses get to take an R tax credit--research and \ndevelopment. Aren't we all for research and development? Yes, but not \nin the oil and gas industry. And where might they put that research and \ndevelopment money? Well, for example, into ensuring that when they sink \na well deep in the Gulf of Mexico, it will be environmentally safe. \nNope, you can't deduct that. All other businesses will be able to but \nnot you. What sense does that make? It is bad policy.\n  How about the usual and necessary business expense, the deduction for \nwriteoffs for business investment? All other companies get to deduct \nthat, but we would say to the oil companies: You don't get that same \ndeduction.\n  Perhaps most perniciously, we are trying to compete with foreign \nbusinesses, so we would say to Americans who earn income abroad: You \ncan deduct against the taxes you would owe here the taxes you pay over \nthere. All of the other world nations get to do that. They would take \nthat away from these particular kinds of companies.\n  So this is discriminatory, it is job killing but, most of all, it \nimpacts American consumers directly because every dollar of increased \ntaxes is going to find its way into the price we pay at the gas station \nwhen we buy gas. Now, whom does that hurt, therefore? Does it hurt some \nmillionaires and billionaires? Who owns the oil companies? Well, a lot \nof pensions do, a lot of retired teachers and firefighters and so on.\n  People have to think this through. You are not hitting millionaires \nand billionaires. I know it sounds like good rhetoric, but when you are \nhitting American businesses that try to compete around the world and \nthat develop a product we would like not to have to pay four bucks a \ngallon for, the last thing you want to do is to play politics by \nsaying: Well, for those particular folks, we are going to raise their \ntaxes.\n  I remember the last time we raised taxes on another millionaire kind \nof outfit, the yachts. It was a luxury tax that we opposed back in \n1990, and it seemed like a good idea, just like this tax they were \ntalking about imposing on airplanes. They didn't actually talk about \nthat in our meeting, so I don't know exactly what it is. But they say \nit would raise $3 billion over 10 years, which pays for hardly a \nfraction of the $14 trillion debt we have. Nonetheless, they want to go \nafter private airplanes.\n  I don't know how many people work in the private airplane \nmanufacturing business. But it was interesting that in 1990 when the \nluxury boat tax was passed, there were 7,600 jobs lost in the boating \nindustry. Very quickly the people who made the boats, a lot of them up \nin Massachusetts, decided this wasn't such a hot idea and so they \nrepealed the tax in 1993. By the way, it lost revenue because of the \nunemployment benefits and lost income tax revenue had to be developed \nin order to offset the loss in business.\n  The point of all of this is that when the administration and others \ntalk about shared sacrifice, of making some kind of rich business or \nrich person pay taxes, you have to think through what the effect is on \nthe American economy and on job creation. The reason Republicans oppose \nthese is not because we love the person who pays the tax so much as we \nwish for American jobs to be created, or at least not have more jobs \nlost. And the people who are proposing these tax cuts seem to be \nabsolutely oblivious to the effect their proposals would have on hard-\nworking Americans.\n  My colleague from Washington State a moment ago said, and I will \nquote her again: Everybody pays except the rich under Republicans' idea \nof how things ought to be.\n  I think I pointed out that is not true. But in case anybody needs a \nreminder of who pays income taxes in the country: The top 1 percent \npays 38 percent of all income taxes. The top 10 percent pays 70 \npercent. The bottom 40 percent pays no personal income tax.\n  So is it true that everybody pays except the rich? No. The rich pay \nby far and away most of the taxes paid in this country, and a lot of \npeople believe that is as it should be. We have a progressive system. \nThe rich can afford to pay more, and so we expect more from them. But \nlet's not demagog the issue and suggest that isn't true. It is true. \nThe rich do pay more, and we have decided in this country that they \nshould. But how much more do you want them to pay? Ninety percent? \nNinety-five percent? How about 100 percent? How much revenue do you \nthink we could get from somebody if we said he is going to have to pay \n100 percent of what he earns in income taxes? We know there are two \nrates at which you generate exactly zero revenue: zero and 100.\n  So when we talk about shared sacrifice, let's put this into \nperspective and let's realize we are not talking about sacrifice in the \nsense of trying to hurt people or austerity so much as we are talking \nabout prosperity. And you don't create more prosperity with job-killing \ntaxes.\n  I want to add one other thing for the record here. There are two \npublications that note areas in which we could save hundreds of \nbillions of dollars if we were willing to discuss them. When we talk \nabout things that are on the table or off the table, here are two \nthings our Democratic friends have said are not on the table: We will \nnot talk about fraud in the unemployment insurance system or fraud in \nMedicare and Medicaid. According to these two articles, which I will \nask to be put in the Record, there are tens of billions of dollars in \neach where we could save the taxpayers money, money that is being paid \nout now to either downright crooks or being paid inappropriately to \npeople who don't qualify.\n  Since 1986, the GAO has published at least 158 reports about Medicare \nand Medicaid fraud, for example. In 1993, Attorney General Janet Reno \ndeclared health care fraud America's No. 2 crime problem, right behind \nviolent crime. These are off the table, some of our Democratic friends \nsay. Well, we think this is a way in which we can save money without \nrequiring others to have to sacrifice.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe\n\n[[Page S4373]]\n\npiece by Michael Cannon in the National Review On Line dated July 4, \nand the piece by Paul Davidson from USA Today dated July 5 at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate my colleagues' indulgence here.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that when we talk about shared \nsacrifice, we need to appreciate that in the negotiations that have \nbeen occurring Republicans have made a lot of concessions, and that the \nreason we oppose the concession of raising taxes is not because we have \nsome ideological attachment to somebody who makes a lot of money but, \nrather, because we have an ideological attachment to the American \nworker who needs a job or who needs his or her job protected. From what \nwe understand, the taxes that have been proposed by our Democratic \ncolleagues would all be job killers. At the time our economy is in the \nunhealthy state it is, the worst medicine is job-killing taxes.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield. I am also happy to \nconclude. I think we are rotating between Democrat and Republican.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I don't want to step on your colleagues' time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. One of the things I have been tracking is the share \nof wealth, income, and taxes at various percentages toward the top. The \nSenator was good enough to mention that the top 1 percent pays about 28 \npercent of the taxes, the top 5 percent pays a little over 44 percent \nof the taxes, and the top 10 percent pays 55.4 percent of the taxes.\n  But I think in order to get a complete picture, it is also important \nto note that the top 1 percent controls 24 percent of the income, the \ntop 5 percent controls 39 percent of the income, and the top 10 percent \ncontrols 50 percent of the income. If you go to wealth, the top 1 \npercent controls 33.8 percent of the wealth, the top 5 percent controls \n60.4 percent of the wealth, and the top 10 percent controls 71.5 \npercent of the Nation's wealth.\n  So if you are in the top 10 percent and you control 71.5 percent of \nthe Nation's wealth, it doesn't seem to be unreasonable that you should \nbe paying 55 percent of the Nation's taxes, particularly if you are \ntaxing based on dollars and not on just number of people.\n  I don't know if those numbers are wrong. We got them from the Federal \nReserve Board, from the IRS, and from the Congressional Budget Office. \nI think they are accurate. It would appear to show that at the very \nhigh end, although these individuals are paying considerable taxes \ntoward our Nation's economy, they are paying considerably less than the \namount of wealth they control and not much more than the amount of \nincome they control. In a graduated system of progressive taxation, \nwhich we are supposed to have, that is not surprising. In fact, what is \nsurprising is that the top 24 percent of the income only pays 28.3 of \nthe taxes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am not sure where the question is in there. \nBut what I would say in response is, with all due respect to my \ncolleague, his numbers are absolutely wrong. I don't have at my \nfingertips the precise figures, but I can tell you this--by the way, I \ndon't also know what you mean by ``in charge of wealth.'' In terms of \nwho owns wealth or income, the people in the upper brackets pay far \nmore in taxes than the percentage of wealth as a percent of the \neconomy, and I would be happy to supply those figures to my colleague. \nAnd there is a difference between income taxes and all other taxes as \nwell, and that chart doesn't suggest which is which.\n  I would be happy, though, to demonstrate to my colleague that whether \nyou are talking about income taxes or all taxes, the upper income level \npays far and away the higher percentage than those in the lower \nportion, and in taxes they pay more than the percentage of wealth that \nthey create or that they earn.\n  The bottom line is that I think anybody making the argument that \nthere is not shared contribution to the revenues of the country by the \nupper income would be making a false argument. I know that is not the \nargument my colleague is making, because he agrees with the progressive \nincome tax system and has pointed out that it is progressive even by \nthe numbers you have.\n  But let's do this, because I respect my colleague. I will get the \nnumbers I rely upon, you get the numbers you think you rely upon and \nthe sources of each, and you and I can agree to come to the floor at an \nappropriate time convenient to us both, and then we can both have the \ndata at our fingertips from which we can make our respective arguments.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I would be delighted to do that. And I might actually \nthrow in the data from the IRS that shows that the top 400 income \nearners in the country in the most recent period that they have \nactually gone back and done the calculation paid 18.2 percent total \ntaxes, which is less than I think the average American, certainly the \naverage middle-class American family pays. So there is this reversal at \nthe high end where people actually end up paying less.\n  Indeed, in one building in New York, the payment for the most recent \nyear was 14.7 percent from the occupants, whereas janitors and doormen \nand security guards are paying up in the 20-percent ranges. It is not \nprogressive in that sense. It is regressive at the high ends, according \nto those things. So let's get the information together, and we will \nhave that discussion.\n  Mr. KYL. Sure. And on that last point, it makes a larger point. When \nCongress tries to get the millionaires and the billionaires, those are \nthe very people who can adjust their way of earning and of giving and \nof living so that they end up paying less in taxes. That is why it \ndoesn't much matter what the rate of taxes is at the upper income. They \nare never going to pay more than a certain percentage, because they can \nafford the lawyers and the accountants to make sure that they don't pay \nmore. It is the people in the middle income who can't do that, and they \nend up paying up what the IRS says they owe, and they can't adjust \ntheir way of living and giving in order to pay less in the way of \ntaxes. Whatever deductions they get, they get, and they are going to \nhave to live with those.\n  When we try to hit the upper income with higher rates, it generally \ndoesn't work. That is another reason why we think it is an ineffective \nway.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. That is why I think the loopholes need to be closed, \nand I thank the distinguished Senator for the colloquy.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n            [From the National Review Online, July 5, 2011]\n\n                          Politics vs. Reality\n\n                           (By Thomas Sowell)\n\n       It is hard to understand politics if you are hung up on \n     reality. Politicians leave reality to others. What matters in \n     politics is what you can get the voters to believe, whether \n     it bears any resemblance to reality or not.\n       Not only among politicians, but also among much of the \n     media, and even among some of the public, the quest is not \n     for truth about reality but for talking points that fit a \n     vision or advance an agenda. Some seem to see it as a \n     personal contest about who is best at fencing with words.\n       The current controversy over whether to deal with our \n     massive national debt by cutting spending, or whether instead \n     to raise tax rates on ``the rich,'' is a classic example of \n     talking points versus reality.\n       Most of those who favor simply raising tax rates on ``the \n     rich''--or who say that we cannot afford to allow the Bush \n     ``tax cuts for the rich'' to continue--show not the slightest \n     interest in the history of what has actually happened when \n     tax rates were raised to high levels on ``the rich,'' as \n     compared with what has actually happened when there have been \n     ``tax cuts for the rich.''\n       As far as such people are concerned, those questions have \n     already been settled by their talking points. Why confuse the \n     issue by digging into empirical evidence about what has \n     actually happened when one policy or the other was followed?\n       The political battles about whether to have high tax rates \n     on people in high income brackets or to instead have ``tax \n     cuts for the rich'' have been fought out in at least four \n     different administrations in the 20th century--under \n     Presidents Calvin Coolidge, John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, \n     and George W. Bush.\n       The empirical facts are there, but they mean nothing if \n     people don't look at them, and instead rely on talking \n     points.\n       The first time this political battle was fought, during the \n     Coolidge administration,\n\n[[Page S4374]]\n\n     the tax-cutters won. The data show that ``the rich'' supplied \n     less tax revenue to the government when the top income tax \n     rate was 73 percent in 1921 than they supplied after the \n     income tax rate was reduced to 24 percent in 1925.\n       Because high tax rates can easily be avoided, both then and \n     now, ``the rich'' were much less affected by high tax rates \n     than was the economy and the people who were looking for \n     jobs. After the Coolidge tax cuts, the increased economic \n     activity led to unemployment rates that ranged from a high of \n     4.2 percent to a low of 1.8 percent.\n       But that is only a fact about reality--and, for many, \n     reality lacks the appeal of talking points.\n       The same preference for talking points, and the same lack \n     of interest in digging into the facts about realities, \n     prevails today in discussions of whether to have a \n     government-controlled medical system.\n       Since there are various countries, such as Canada and \n     Britain, that have the kind of government-controlled medical \n     systems that some Americans advocate, you might think that \n     there would be great interest in the quality of medical care \n     in these countries.\n       The data are readily available as to how many weeks or \n     months people have to wait to see a primary-care physician in \n     such countries, and how many additional weeks or months they \n     have to wait after they are referred to a surgeon or other \n     specialist. There are data on how often their governments \n     allow patients to receive the latest pharmaceutical drugs, as \n     compared with how often Americans use such advanced \n     medications.\n       But supporters of government medical care show virtually no \n     interest in such realities. Their big talking point is that \n     the life expectancy in the United States is not as long as in \n     those other countries. End of discussion, as far as they are \n     concerned.\n       They have no interest in the reality that medical care has \n     much less effect on death rates from homicide, obesity, and \n     narcotics addiction than it has on death rates from cancer or \n     other conditions that doctors can do something about. \n     Americans survive various cancers better than people anywhere \n     else. Americans also get to see doctors much sooner for \n     medical treatment in general.\n       Talking points trump reality in political discussions of \n     many other issues, from gun control to rent control. Reality \n     simply does not have the pizzazz of clever talking points.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n            [From the National Review Online, July 4, 2011]\n\n                          Entitlement Bandits\n\n                         (By Michael F. Cannon)\n\n       The budget blueprint crafted by Paul Ryan, passed by the \n     House of Representatives, and voted down by the Senate would \n     essentially give Medicare enrollees a voucher to purchase \n     private coverage, and would change the federal government's \n     contribution to each state's Medicaid program from an \n     unlimited ``matching'' grant to a fixed ``block'' grant. \n     These reforms deserve to come back from defeat, because the \n     only alternatives for saving Medicare or Medicaid would \n     either dramatically raise tax rates or have the government \n     ration care to the elderly and disabled. What may be less \n     widely appreciated, however, is that the Ryan proposal is our \n     only hope of reducing the crushing levels of fraud in \n     Medicare and Medicaid.\n       The three most salient characteristics of Medicare and \n     Medicaid fraud are: It's brazen, it's ubiquitous, and it's \n     other people's money, so nobody cares.\n       Consider some of the fraud schemes discovered in recent \n     years. In Brooklyn, a dentist billed taxpayers for nearly \n     1,000 procedures in a single day. A Houston doctor with a \n     criminal record took her Medicare billings from zero to $11.6 \n     million in one year; federal agents shut down her clinic but \n     did not charge her with a crime. A high-school dropout, armed \n     with only a laptop computer, submitted more than 140,000 \n     bogus Medicare claims, collecting $105 million. A health plan \n     settled a Medicaid-fraud case in Florida for $138 million. \n     The giant hospital chain Columbia/HCA paid $1.7 billion in \n     fines and pled guilty to more than a dozen felonies related \n     to bribing doctors to help it tap Medicare funds and \n     exaggerating the amount of care delivered to Medicare \n     patients. In New York, Medicaid spending on the human-growth \n     hormone Serostim leapt from $7 million to $50 million in \n     2001; but it turned out that drug traffickers were getting \n     the drug prescribed as a treatment for AIDS wasting syndrome, \n     then selling it to bodybuilders. And a study of ten states \n     uncovered $27 million in Medicare payments to dead patients.\n       These anecdotes barely scratch the surface. Judging by \n     official estimates, Medicare and Medicaid lose at least $87 \n     billion per year to fraudulent and otherwise improper \n     payments, and about 10.5 percent of Medicare spending and 8.4 \n     percent of Medicaid spending was improper in 2009. Fraud \n     experts say the official numbers are too low. ``Loss rates \n     due to fraud and abuse could be 10 percent, or 20 percent, or \n     even 30 percent in some segments,'' explained Malcolm \n     Sparrow, a mathematician, Harvard professor, and former \n     police inspector, in congressional testimony. ``The \n     overpayment-rate studies the government has relied on. . \n     .have been sadly lacking in rigor, and have therefore \n     produced comfortingly low and quite misleading estimates.'' \n     In 2005, the New York Times reported that ``James Mehmet, who \n     retired in 2001 as chief state investigator of Medicaid fraud \n     and abuse in New York City, said he and his colleagues \n     believed that at least 10 percent of state Medicaid dollars \n     were spent on fraudulent claims, while 20 or 30 percent more \n     were siphoned off by what they termed abuse, meaning \n     unnecessary spending that might not be criminal.'' And even \n     these experts ignore other, perfectly legal ways of \n     exploiting Medicare and Medicaid, such as when a senior hides \n     and otherwise adjusts his finances so as to appear eligible \n     for Medicaid, or when a state abuses the fact that the \n     federal government matches state Medicaid outlays.\n       Government watchdogs are well aware of the problem. Every \n     year since 1990, the U.S. Government Accountability Office \n     has released a list of federal programs it considers at a \n     high risk for fraud. Medicare appeared on the very first list \n     and has remained there for 22 straight years. Medicaid \n     assumed its perch eight years ago.\n       How can there possibly be so much fraud in Medicare and \n     Medicaid that even the ``comfortingly low'' estimates have \n     ten zeros? How can this much fraud persist decade after \n     decade? How can it be that no one has even tried to measure \n     the problem accurately, much less take it seriously? The \n     answers are in the nature of the beast. Medicare and \n     Medicaid, the two great pillars of Pres. Lyndon Johnson's \n     ``Great Society'' agenda, are monuments to the left-wing \n     ideals of coerced charity and centralized economic planning. \n     The staggering levels of fraud in these programs can be \n     explained by the fact that the politicians, bureaucrats, \n     patients, and health-care providers who administer and \n     participate in them are spending other people's money--and \n     nobody spends other people's money as carefully as he spends \n     his own. What's more, Medicare and Medicaid are spending \n     other people's money in vast quantities. Medicare, for \n     example, is the largest purchaser of medical goods and \n     services in the world. It will spend $572 billion in 2011. \n     Each year, it pays 1.2 billion claims to 1.2 million health-\n     care providers on behalf of 47 million enrollees.\n       For providers, Medicare is like an ATM: So long as they \n     punch in the right numbers, out comes the cash. To get an \n     idea of the potential for fraud, imagine 1.2 million \n     providers punching 1,000 codes each into their own personal \n     ATMs. Now imagine trying to monitor all those ATMs.\n       For example, if a medical-equipment supplier punches in a \n     code for a power wheelchair, how can the government be sure \n     the company didn't actually provide a manual wheelchair and \n     pocket the difference? About $400 million of the \n     aforementioned fines paid by Columbia/HCA hospitals were for \n     a similar practice, known as ``upcoding.''\n       And how does the government know that providers are \n     withdrawing no more than the law allows? Medicaid sets the \n     prices it pays for prescription drugs based on the ``average \n     wholesale price.'' But as the Congressional Budget Office has \n     explained, the average wholesale price ``is based on \n     information provided by the manufacturers. Like the sticker \n     price on a car, it is a price that few purchasers actually \n     pay.'' Pharmaceutical companies often inflate the average \n     wholesale price so they can charge Medicaid more. Teva \n     Pharmaceuticals recently paid $27 million to settle \n     allegations that it had overcharged Florida's Medicaid \n     program by inflating its average wholesale prices, and the \n     Department of Justice has accused Wyeth of doing the same. \n     Merck recently settled a similar case.\n       Most ominously, how does the government know that people \n     punching numbers into the ATMs are health-care providers at \n     all? In his testimony, Malcolm Sparrow explained how a \n     hypothetical criminal can make a quick million: ``In order to \n     bill Medicare, Billy doesn't need to see any patients. He \n     only needs a computer, some billing software to help match \n     diagnoses to procedures, and some lists. He buys on the black \n     market lists of Medicare or Medicaid patient IDs.'' With this \n     information in hand, Billy strides right up to the ATM, or \n     several at a time, and starts punching in numbers. ``The rule \n     for criminals is simple: If you want to steal from Medicare, \n     or Medicaid, or any other health-care-insurance program, \n     learn to bill your lies correctly. Then, for the most part, \n     your claims will be paid in full and on time, without a \n     hiccup, by a computer, and with no human involvement at \n     all.'' These schemes are sophisticated, so Billy might hire \n     people within Medicare and at his bank to help him avoid \n     detection.\n       Last year, the feds indicted 44 members of an Armenian \n     crime syndicate for operating a sprawling Medicare-fraud \n     scheme. The syndicate had set up 118 phony clinics and billed \n     Medicare for $35 million. They transferred at least some of \n     their booty overseas. Who knows what LBJ's Great Society is \n     funding?\n       And there are other forms of fraud. An entire cottage \n     industry of elder-law attorneys has emerged, for instance, to \n     help well-to-do seniors appear poor on paper so that Medicaid \n     will pay their nursing-home bills. Medicaid even encourages \n     the elderly to get sham divorces for the same reason. It's \n     all perfectly legal. It's still fraud.\n       Medicaid's matching-grant system also invites fraud. When a \n     high-income state such as New York spends an additional \n     dollar on its Medicaid program, it receives a matching dollar \n     from the federal government--that is, from taxpayers in other \n     states. Low-income states can receive as much as $3 for every \n     additional dollar they devote to Medicaid, and without limit. \n     If they're clever, states can get this money without putting \n     any of their own on the line. In a ``provider tax'' scam, a\n\n[[Page S4375]]\n\n     state passes a law to increase Medicaid payments to \n     hospitals, which triggers matching money from the federal \n     government. Yet in the very same law, the state increases \n     taxes on hospitals. If the tax recoups the state's original \n     outlay, the state has obtained new federal Medicaid funds at \n     no cost. If the tax recoups more than the original outlay, \n     the state can use federal Medicaid dollars to pay for bridges \n     to nowhere. As Vermont began preparations for its Obamacare-\n     sanctioned single-payer system this year, it used a provider-\n     tax scam to bilk taxpayers in other states out of $5.2 \n     million. In his book Stop Paying the Crooks, consultant Jim \n     Frogue chronicles more than half a dozen ways that states \n     game Medicaid's matching-grant system to defraud the federal \n     government.\n       Since 1986, the GAO has published at least 158 reports \n     about Medicare and Medicaid fraud, and there have been \n     similar reports by the HHS inspector general and other \n     government agencies. In 1993, Attorney General Janet Reno \n     declared health-care fraud America's No 2 crime problem, \n     after violent crime. Since then, Congress has enacted 194 \n     pages of statutes to combat fraud in these programs, and \n     countless pages of regulations.\n       Yet federal and state anti-fraud efforts remain uniformly \n     lame. Medicare does almost nothing to detect or fight fraud \n     until the fraudulent payments are already out the door, a \n     strategy experts deride as ``pay and chase.'' Even then, \n     Medicare reviews fewer than 5 percent of all claims filed. \n     Congress doesn't integrate Medicare's myriad databases, which \n     might help prevent fraud, nor does it regularly review the \n     efficacy of most of the anti-fraud spending it authorizes. \n     Many of the abuses noted above, such as those of the Brooklyn \n     dentist, were discovered not by the government but by curious \n     reporters poking through Medicaid records. The amateurs at \n     the New York Times found ``numerous indications of [Medicaid] \n     fraud and abuse that the state had never looked into,'' but \n     ``only a thin, overburdened security force standing between \n     [New York's] enormous program and the unending attempts to \n     steal from it.\n       The federal government's approach to fraud is sometimes so \n     inept as to be counterproductive. Sparrow testified that a \n     defect in the strategy of Billy, our hypothetical criminal, \n     is that he doesn't know which providers and patients on his \n     stolen lists are ``dead, deported, or incarcerated.'' But \n     Medicare's anti-fraud protocols help him solve this problem. \n     When Medicare catches those claims, it sends Billy a notice \n     that they have been rejected. ``From Billy's viewpoint,'' \n     Sparrow explained, ``life could not be better. Medicare helps \n     him `scrub' his lists, making his fake billing scam more \n     robust and less detectable over time; and meanwhile Medicare \n     pays all his other claims without blinking an eye or becoming \n     the least bit suspicious.''\n       Efforts to prevent fraud typically fail because they impose \n     costs on legitimate beneficiaries and providers, who, as \n     voters and campaign donors respectively, have immense sway \n     over politicians. At a recent congressional hearing, the \n     Department of Health and Human Services' deputy inspector \n     general, Gerald T. Roy, recommended that Congress beef up \n     efforts to prevent illegitimate providers and suppliers from \n     enrolling in Medicare. But even if Congress took Roy's \n     advice, it would rescind the new requirements in a heartbeat \n     when legitimate doctors--who are already threatening to leave \n     Medicare over its low payment rates--threatened to bolt \n     because of the additional administrative costs (paperwork, \n     site visits, etc.).\n       Politicians routinely subvert anti-fraud measures to \n     protect their constituents. When the federal government began \n     poking around a Buffalo school district that billed Medicaid \n     for speech therapy for 4,434 kids, the New York Times \n     reported, ``the Justice Department suspended its civil \n     inquiry after complaints from Senator Charles E. Schumer, \n     Democrat of New York, and other politicians.'' Medicare \n     officials, no doubt expressing a sentiment shared by members \n     of Congress, admit they avoid aggressive anti-fraud measures \n     that might reduce access to treatment for seniors.\n       It's not just the politicians. The Legal Aid Society is \n     pushing back against a federal lawsuit charging that New York \n     City overbilled Medicaid. Even conservatives fight anti-fraud \n     measures, albeit in the name of preventing frivolous \n     litigation, when they oppose expanding whistle-blower \n     lawsuits, where private citizens who help the government win \n     a case get to keep some of the penalty.\n       Sparrow argued that when Medicare receives ``obviously \n     implausible claims,'' such as from a dead doctor, ``the \n     system should bite back. . . . A proper fraud response would \n     do whatever was necessary to rip open and expose the business \n     practices that produce such fictitious claims. Relevant \n     methods include surveillance, arrest, or dawn raids.'' Also: \n     ``All other claims from the same source should immediately be \n     put on hold.''\n       Some of the implausible claims will be honest mistakes, \n     such as when a clerk mistakenly punches the wrong patient \n     number into the ATM. And sometimes the SWAT team will get the \n     address wrong, or will take action that looks like overkill, \n     as when the Department of Education raided a California home \n     because it suspected one of the occupants of financial-aid \n     fraud. How many times would federal agents have to march a \n     handcuffed doctor past a stunned waiting room full of \n     Medicare enrollees before Congress prohibited those measures?\n       ``It seems extraordinary,'' Sparrow said, that the HHS \n     Office of Inspector General recommends ``weak and inadequate \n     response[s] . . . to false claims and fake billings'' and \n     that Medicare ``fail[s] . . . to properly distinguish between \n     the imperatives of process management and the imperatives of \n     crime control.'' Extraordinary? How could it be any other \n     way? Anti-fraud efforts will always be inadequate when \n     politicians spend other people's money. Apologists for \n     Medicare and Medicaid will retort that fraud against private \n     health plans is prevalent as well, but this only drives home \n     the point: Since employers purchase health insurance for 90 \n     percent of insured non-elderly Americans, workers care less \n     about health-care fraud, and have a lower tolerance for anti-\n     fraud measures, than they would if they paid the fraud-laden \n     premiums themselves.\n       The fact that Medicare and Medicaid spend other people's \n     money is why the number of fraud investigators in New York's \n     Medicaid program can fall by 50 percent even as spending on \n     the program more than triples. That is why, as Sparrow \n     explained in an interview with The Nation, ``The stories are \n     legion of people getting a Medicare explanation of benefits \n     statement saying, `We've paid for this operation you had in \n     Colorado,' when those people have never been in Colorado. And \n     when you complain [to Medicare] about it, nobody seems to \n     care.''\n       The Ryan plan offers the only serious hope of reducing \n     fraud in Medicare and Medicaid. Its Medicare reforms, \n     especially if they were expanded later, would make it easier \n     for the federal government to police the program, and its \n     Medicaid reforms would increase each state's incentive to \n     curb fraud.\n       To see how the Ryan plan would reduce Medicare fraud, \n     imagine that the proposal really were what its critics claim \n     it is: a full-blown voucher program, with each enrollee \n     receiving a chunk of cash to spend on medical care, apply \n     toward health-insurance premiums, or save for the future. \n     Instead of processing 1.2 billion claims, Medicare would hand \n     out just 50 million vouchers, with sick and low-income \n     enrollees receiving larger ones. The number of transactions \n     Medicare would have to monitor each year would fall by more \n     than 1 billion.\n       Social Security offers reason to believe that a program \n     engaging in fewer (and more uniform) transactions could \n     dramatically reduce fraud and other improper payments. As a \n     Medicare-voucher program would, Social Security adjusts the \n     checks it sends to enrollees according to such variables as \n     lifetime earnings and disability status. The Social Security \n     Administration estimates that overpayments account for just \n     0.37 percent of Social Security spending. Overpayments are \n     higher in the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program \n     (8.4 percent), a much smaller, means-tested program also \n     administered by the Social Security Administration. But \n     total overpayments across both programs still come to less \n     than 1 percent of outlays.\n       In reality, the Ryan ``voucher'' is much closer to the \n     current Medicare Advantage program, through which one in four \n     Medicare enrollees selects a private health plan and the \n     government makes risk-adjusted payments directly to insurers. \n     Skeptics will rightly note that, judging by the official \n     improper-payment rates, Medicare Advantage (14.1 percent) is \n     in the same ballpark as traditional Medicare (10.5 percent). \n     Therefore, the Ryan plan should be seen not as a solution to \n     Medicare fraud in itself, but as a step toward a vastly \n     simplified, Social Security-like program in which the task of \n     policing fraud is less daunting.\n       The Ryan plan would also vastly increase the states' \n     incentive to curb Medicaid fraud. Just as a state that \n     increases funding for Medicaid gets matching federal funds, a \n     state that reduces Medicaid fraud gets to keep only (at most) \n     half of the money saved. As much as 75 percent of recovered \n     funds revert back to the federal government. In a report for \n     the left-wing Center for American Progress, former Obama \n     adviser Marsha Simon noted that ``states are required to \n     repay the federal share . . . of any payment errors \n     identified, even if the money is never collected.'' The fact \n     that Albany splits New York's 50 percent share of the \n     spending with municipal governments may explain why the \n     Empire State is such a hot spot for fraud: No level of \n     government is responsible for a large enough share of the \n     cost to do anything about it. The result is that states' \n     fraud-prevention efforts are only a tiny fraction of what \n     Washington spends to fight Medicare fraud.\n       Ryan would replace Medicaid's federal matching grants with \n     a system of block grants. Under a block-grant system, states \n     would keep 100 percent of the money they saved by eliminating \n     fraud. In many states, the incentive to prevent fraud would \n     quadruple or more. Block grants performed beautifully when \n     Congress used them to reform welfare in 1996. They can do so \n     again.\n       The Ryan plan would not reduce Medicare and Medicaid fraud \n     to tolerable levels, but neither would any plan that retains \n     a role for government in providing medical care to the \n     elderly and disabled. What the Ryan plan would do is reduce \n     how much the fraudsters--many of whom sport congressional \n     lapel pins--fleece the American taxpayer. And that is no \n     small thing.\n\n[[Page S4376]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                     [From USA Today, July 5, 2011]\n\n                 Jobless-Benefits Fraud Is on the Rise\n\n                           (By Paul Davidson)\n\n       State and federal regulators are cracking down on waste and \n     fraud in the unemployment-insurance system, abuses that have \n     hit record levels as unemployment claims surge in a weak \n     economy.\n       In the 12 months through March, the overpayment rate was \n     11.6 percent--more than $1 for every $9 paid out. Labor \n     Department figures show.\n       That's up from the 12 months ending in June 2010, when a \n     record $16.5 billion, or 10.6 percent of the $156 billion in \n     unemployment benefits disbursed to Americans, should not have \n     been paid, according to the department.\n       The overpayment rate was 9.6 percent in fiscal 2009 and 9.2 \n     percent in 2008.\n       Officials partly blame soaring unemployment, which forced \n     state officials to use fraud-prevention workers to help \n     handle an unprecedented wave of claims.\n       ``They were using every person they could find,'' said Gay \n     Gilbert, Labor's unemployment-insurance administrator.\n       Lawmakers say excess payments could go to legitimate \n     jobless claims and help keep state unemployment trust funds \n     solvent. About 9.3 million Americans receive benefits.\n       The main reason for overpayments is that some workers \n     continue to receive unemployment checks even after they land \n     a new job.\n       Another problem is that many employers fail to adequately \n     provide state officials the reason an employee left the \n     company so the worker's eligibility can be determined. Also, \n     some workers receive benefits even when they don't comply \n     with state job-search requirements.\n       How state and federal officials are trying to reduce \n     overpayments:\n       A national directory of new hires lets states identify \n     workers still receiving benefits even after they get a new \n     job.\n       By the end of the year, all states must use the directory. \n     Labor officials also plan to provide funds so overtaxed \n     states can more frequently follow up and collect overpayments \n     from scofflaws.\n       A new computer system makes it easier for employers to \n     report why workers left their jobs. Only a few states use it, \n     but the Labor Department is providing funds to encourage \n     wider adoption.\n       New rules let states recover improperly paid benefits from \n     U.S. income-tax refunds.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. It scared me for a minute, I thought we were almost \nengaging in a debate on the Senate floor. This could get interesting \nhere.\n  I have great respect for both my colleagues who were making comments, \nand it will be an interesting discussion on the floor when they both \nhave their respective numbers and we will look forward to that.\n  I want to say to my colleague from Arizona that what he says is \nexactly right. Raising taxes in tough economic times is a very \ndifficult thing to do and is not stimulative of the economy. The way we \nneed to see revenues increased--and I don't think there is any \ndisagreement from anybody in the Senate or in the House that the 14.5 \npercent of GDP we are now seeing in revenues has got to be increased. \nBut the way we need to increase it is enacting policies, whether they \nbe tax policies or spending policies or otherwise, that will truly grow \nthe economy, and we can do that with the right kind of policies that \nwill not only in the short term stimulate the economy and show an \nincrease in revenues, but will also have the same impact on the other \nside of the ledger, which is reducing spending.\n  We are now at an all-time high since World War II on the spending \nside, we are at an all-time low on the revenue side, and that is what \nhas gotten us into this terrible fiscal problem we have today.\n  I concur with what the Senator from Arizona said, and I look forward \nto continuing to dialog with him as well as the Senator from Rhode \nIsland about what needs to be done to get this gap closed.\n  Mr. President, I rise tonight to discuss the need for the American \ngovernment to fundamentally change the way it conducts business. \nCongress and the President can no longer fail to make significant \nmeaningful changes to our fiscal path. We must act now to ensure the \nsafety and security of our Nation.\n  There is a mutual understanding from all involved in the ongoing \ndebate that the current fiscal path our country is on will lead us to \nruin. It is simply unthinkable to believe that we can continue to run \ndeficits in excess of $1 trillion, on top of $14.3 trillion in \naccumulated debt, and remain the leader of the global economy. It is \nwell known that the Federal Government will soon risk a potentially \ncatastrophic default on its credit obligations. Clearly, any increase \nin the debt ceiling must come with substantial policy reforms and \ncommitments that future spending and deficits are being addressed \nappropriately. Against this backdrop, we are being provided with a \nunique opportunity to review the underlying causes of our current path \nand potential effects we face.\n  Last week, the Congressional Budget Office released its long-term \nbudget outlook. Their release shows debt increasing to approximately \n200 percent of GDP by 2035, unless drastic and immediate changes are \nmade.\n  Economists have told me that a debt equaling 90 percent of GDP is the \ntipping point, and that after that it is impossible to turn the \nsituation around.\n  Under the same CBO scenario, interest costs alone in 2035 would reach \n9 percent of GDP, and 9 percent of GDP is more than the United States \ncurrently spends on both Social Security and Medicare.\n  This body spends a considerable amount of time deliberating on \nmatters of national security and, indeed, that is extremely important \nwork. We must stay vigilant that any threats to this country are \nswiftly dealt with. However, ADM Mike Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs, has said emphatically over and over again that our debt is the \nsingle greatest threat to our national security.\n  Admiral Mullen is not alone. The cochairs of the President's own \nfiscal commission warned him of the need for swift action. Mr. Bowles \nand Mr. Simpson continue to speak almost daily of the importance of \naddressing our fiscal situation and continue to make impassioned pleas \nthat this situation must be corrected and must be done so in the short \nterm.\n  It is during these hard times that most Americans look to their \nelected representatives and the Chief Executive of the United States \nfor guidance on these issues. The American people have waited for \nleadership on this issue and have demanded fiscal discipline. It is \nreprehensible that an issue of this magnitude and significance is \nsubject to the partisan bickering and gamesmanship that often rears its \nhead in politics. This is an issue that will determine the fate of our \ncountry. It deserves careful, serious, thoughtful deliberation and not \npolitical theater.\n  Not long ago the Senate held a series of votes on budget resolutions \nthat everyone knew were destined to fail. The American people expect \nand deserve an honest budget debate and a honest budget process. While \nI am glad the President is now engaging in this debate, he, too, has \nnot been forthcoming in helping to decide America's budget fate. He has \nnot given those in his party instructions or guidance on how to address \nour fiscal situation, nor has he given the Congress as a whole a \nrelevant plan. It would be reprehensible for these White House \nnegotiations that are now underway to produce a last-minute proposal \nthat leaves Congress no time to review the merits of the legislation or \nthe immediate and lasting effects to the American people.\n  I have been on record many times before stating everything must be on \nthe table when it comes to solving our debt problems, and I seriously \nmean that. We see daily the effects of oppressive debt on countries \nsuch as Greece and the fear and panic it creates for the citizens of \nthat country. We must take the steps now to ensure we do not fall off \nthe precipice, and that means looking at all of our options.\n  We must reduce discretionary spending, reform entitlements, simplify \nthe individual and corporate code, and lower tax rates. This is a \nproven path to prosperity because the solution is based on both \nspending reduction and economic growth.\n  We have a model for this. The model is what Tip O'Neill and Ronald \nReagan did in 1986. We saw an economy stimulated at a time when it \nreally needed it by the elimination of tax expenditures and the \nlowering of tax rates--particularly on the corporate side. It is \nimportant on both the personal and corporate, but if we are truly going \nto expand our tax base and see revenues increase, then we need to put \nthe corporations in this country that manufacture the finest quality of \nproducts of anybody in the world on the same level playing field as \ntheir competitors across the globe.\n\n[[Page S4377]]\n\n  So it is of critical importance that we reform our Tax Code, make it \nsimpler and more fair, and, particularly from a corporate level, make \nit more competitive from a worldwide perspective.\n  We must cut Federal spending in any way we can. Our current levels of \ndiscretionary and mandatory spending simply cannot be sustained. But we \ncannot solve our problems simply by reducing spending. We have to \nreform entitlements. We have to look at those issues that are very \ndifficult for a lot of us to deal with, and we have to make some hard \nand tough decisions. The unfortunate part about this is we do not have \na lot of time to do it.\n  I do not know the window. The window may be 6 months, it may be 12 \nmonths, it may be 2 years. No economist will give an exact definite \nprediction of how long this window continues. But we do know we were \nnot able to predict the financial crisis that occurred in 2008. As Mr. \nBowles has said time and time again, this is one crisis we can predict, \nso now is the time for policymakers in Washington to act.\n  It is job creation that will ultimately be the benefit to Americans \nonce a strong and balanced Federal budget is in place. Slower economic \ngrowth results in dramatic job loss. Christina Romer, the former Chair \nof the White House Council of Economic Advisers, equated 1 percentage \npoint of GDP with 1 million jobs annually.\n  We cannot allow the American people to suffer by not providing the \neconomic basis for recovery and growth. A balanced Federal budget that \nis free of excessive debt will lead to a healthy economy and long-term \nsustainable job creation activities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today deeply concerned that our \nRepublican colleagues, in their ideological haze, have lost sight of \nthe facts and the real people at home whose lives will be affected by \nthe choices we make. They are lost in an ideological haze, a political \ndust storm that is distorting the facts and confusing process and \npolicy with political propaganda.\n  As the conservative columnist David Brooks has said, ``A normal \nRepublican Party would seize the opportunity to put the country on a \nsound fiscal footing.'' He calls it ``the mother of no-brainers.'' But \nit is true, as many have said, that this Republican Party is not your \ngrandfather's Republican Party. It is not even Ronald Reagan's \nRepublican Party. This Republican Party is so far to the right that it \ncannot even see the center, where ideologies converge and good \ngovernance begins. This Republican Party sees the processes governing \nas one-sided--their side and no other.\n  Today, those on the far right wave the Constitution that established \na form of government to protect us from tyranny yet see any form of \ncompromise as defeat and the only clear victory is total surrender to \ntheir position.\n  Here we are, working to try to ensure that reason prevails. We have \noffered the largest spending cuts in a generation, asking that those \ncuts be accompanied by closing tax loopholes and ending tax giveaways \nand unreasonable subsidies to those who need them the least. But \nbecause almost every Republican has signed Grover Norquist's Americans \nfor Tax Reform pledge to never ever raise any tax, and because they \ndefine closing tax loopholes as a tax increase even when the recipients \nthemselves have said they do not need those tax breaks, we are forced \ninto this position, hoping that logical, moderate voices on the other \nside will rise up, demanding that we do what is right for the American \npeople.\n  In my view, ending subsidies to big oil companies does not fall under \nthat pledge. Only in Washington would Republicans call ending $21 \nbillion in tax breaks for big oil companies that will make $144 billion \nin profits a tax increase. It is not. It is not a tax increase; it is a \nmeasure of fairness. It is exactly what we need to do under the \ncircumstances, and it is a reasonable offer by those of us on this side \nof the aisle.\n  Our job, in a representative democracy, is to represent the values of \nthose who sent us here to do what is right for them, not wave a pledge \nand conveniently interpret the elimination of oil subsidies for \nmultibillion-dollar profitable corporations or ethanol subsidies to the \ntune of $2 billion as a tax increase. That is nonsense. We are offering \na reasonable compromise, as that conservative columnist David Brooks \nsays, ``the mother of no-brainers.''\n  Even USA Today said in their editorial:\n\n       Compromise is an essential part of democracy, but \n     negotiating with Republicans over taxes has become as futile \n     as trying to bargain with the Taliban over whether girls \n     should be allowed to attend school.\n\n  That is a pretty stark comparison, I admit, and I may not have gone \nthat far. But, frankly, our Republican brethren seem to hold to their \nideology almost as religiously. They see all things in black and white. \nThey act as though they believe those who disagree with that ideology \nare unpatriotic or heretics, and that the only truth is their truth. \nWhat they have forgotten is that negotiating with those with whom we \ndisagree and reaching a compromise is what good governance is all \nabout.\n  There is another falsehood. Spending is not a Democratic value, as \nour friends on the other side of the aisle would have us believe, but a \nRepublican reality. It was the reckless spending of Republicans \ncombined with a reckless tax policy and an ideology that let Wall \nStreet run wild, turning a free market into a free-for-all market, that \nbrought us to where we are today.\n  Let's remember, it was not long ago that the budget was, in fact, \nbalanced during another Democratic administration when we had budget \nsurpluses as far out as the eye could see. The day President Clinton \nleft office he handed the incoming President a $236 billion surplus \nwith a projected surplus of $5.6 trillion over the following 10 years.\n  When President Bush left office he had turned a $236 billion budget \nsurplus into a $1.3 trillion budget deficit with projected shortfalls \nof $8 trillion over the next decade. He handed the new President an \neconomy that was headed off the cliff into a near depression.\n  We have spent $786 billion, unpaid for, on President Bush's ill-\nadvised, wrongheaded war of choice in Iraq because of some false \nallegations of weapons of mass destruction, a political experiment that \ndistracted us from a war of necessity in Afghanistan, keeping us there \nfar longer than necessary at an additional cost of $430 billion, unpaid \nfor. The total cost for both wars, unpaid for, was $1.2 trillion.\n  The Republican Party that will not now agree to one penny in revenue \nand demands only more spending cuts has fought to make tax breaks for \nthe wealthy permanent that would cost this Nation another $5 trillion. \nThey have favored big business and Wall Street in a Tax Code that has \nresulted in major multibillion-dollar corporations paying no taxes--\nyes, no taxes at all.\n  In fact, a detailed Government Accountability Office study of \ncorporate income taxes from 1998 to 2005 showed that 55 percent of \nlarge U.S. corporations reported no tax liability for at least 1 of \nthose 8 years. Yet those same Republicans will look us in the eye in \ndefense of their defenseless position and tell us that most individuals \ndo not pay taxes either. What they will not say is that those \nindividuals who do not pay taxes do not pay taxes for a reason: They do \nnot earn enough to pay income tax, and many of them are among the \npoorest of the poor. Only in Washington could such an indefensible \nposition be accepted as defensible and logical.\n  Only in Washington could Republicans support policies that benefit \nthe wealthiest at the expense of the middle class. Only in Washington \ncould Republicans tell a construction worker in New Jersey, who has cut \nhis budget to the bone and needs to work another job to pay the bills, \nthat we do not need to end tax loopholes and tax breaks to help pay the \nNation's bills; that we only have to cut more spending and give more \nmoney to the top 1 percent of the wealthiest in the country who control \n45 percent of all of the wealth in America and that they will create \nmore jobs--notwithstanding the fact that 12 years of tax cuts for the \nwealthiest created virtually no jobs at all. When Ronald Reagan and \nBill Clinton increased the revenue side of the equation, it brought the \ngreatest economic progress in the last half century.\n\n[[Page S4378]]\n\nBut our Republican colleagues do not let the facts get in the way of \ntheir ideology.\n\n  The fact is, if Joe the construction worker in New Jersey cut his \nbudget and his spending and has made the difficult choices about what \nhe can afford and what he can't and still can't meet the bills he has \nto pay with the money he earns, then he has to get a second job or work \nmore hours or find a way to increase his income. Yet our Republican \ncolleagues will look that construction worker in the eye and tell him \nhe doesn't need to earn more, he needs to cut more and then cut again. \nCut to the bone, if necessary, but never, never do what needs to be \ndone to increase the revenue side. Only in Washington does such an \nargument seem reasonable. Only in this Republican Party does such an \nabsurd argument try to make sense.\n  Never before has America waged two wars at the same time, struggled \nto invest in our infrastructure to create new jobs--and done so at a \ntime of decreased revenue--and not seen the need at least to discuss \nthe idea of closing tax loopholes and tax breaks for Big Oil and \nmultibillion-dollar corporations. Never before has any party claimed we \ncan do all of that and at the same time balance the budget on the backs \nof seniors, students, middle-class families, and not even consider the \nshared sacrifice--a sacrifice that would end tax breaks for \nmultibillion-dollar corporations that in many cases don't even pay \ntaxes. Never before has such illogic passed for logic. But our \nRepublican colleagues will not take yes for an answer. We have said yes \nto spending cuts, more spending cuts than we have seen in a generation. \nNow they must say yes to common sense, fair increases in revenue, and \nchoose good governance over political ideology.\n  David Brooks, the conservative columnist to whom I referred, said, \n``The members of this movement talk blandly of default and are willing \nto stain their Nation's honor,'' meaning that the country will not meet \nits obligations. We teach our children that you have to meet your \nobligations, but this movement tells the country you don't have to meet \nyour obligations.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       If debt ceiling talks fail, independent voters will see \n     that Democrats were willing to compromise but Republicans \n     were not. If responsible Republicans don't take control, \n     independents will conclude that Republican fanaticism caused \n     this default. They will conclude that Republicans are not fit \n     to govern.\n\n  I would very rarely agree with Mr. Brooks, but I would agree his \nobservations in this case are absolutely right. This is about not only \nstanding up for the Nation's honor, it is about standing up for the \nNation's obligations. It is about standing up to make sure there is a \nfair and shared sacrifice, not just on the backs of middle-class \nworking families in this country and those who have the least among us. \nThat is the choice Republicans would have us make. It is a wrong choice \nfor the Nation, and I hope we get to some sense of reality in this \nChamber that can help us move forward, have the Nation be upheld in its \nobligations both here and abroad and not start a ripple effect that \nwill cause an enormous consequence to this Nation's economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes, \nfollowed by Senator Inhofe for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. We heard the Senator from Georgia talk about the \nupcoming predictable crisis, and our Nation faces an Olympic crisis \nright now, and it is a predictable crisis.\n  Back in 2006, then-Senator Obama called raising the debt ceiling ``a \nsign of leadership failure.'' So why 5 years later is it now-President \nObama who is asking us to raise the debt ceiling, and why is he doing \nit with no plan on how to pay back the new debt we continue to \naccumulate?\n  In his press conference last week, the President called on this party \nto ``go ahead and make the tough choices.'' When it comes to cutting \nspending, his allies in Congress refuse to make any choices. The \nPresident has attacked this body for not getting a deal done on time. \nYet he declined to meet with Republicans about these very issues and \nabout our ideas. According to the White House Press Secretary--the \nPress Secretary said this was ``not a conversation worthing having.'' \nWell, he has finally agreed to meet tomorrow with leaders from both \nparties.\n  The White House and Congress have a choice: Do we want America to be \nbroke or do we want America to be balanced? Facts are stubborn things, \nand the numbers do not lie. Our debt is swallowing our economy whole. \nEvery day Washington borrows $4.1 billion more--borrowed over $4.1 \nbillion yesterday, $4.1 billion today, and it will borrow $4.1 billion \nagain tomorrow. That is over $2 million a minute, every minute. In a \nsingle day, Washington borrows enough to buy tens of thousands of new \nhomes. In a single hour, Washington borrows enough to buy 2 million \nbarrels of oil. In a single minute, Washington borrows enough to send \n53 students a year to the most expensive colleges in America. In a \nsingle second, Washington borrows enough to buy two new Ford Mustang \ncars. Washington did all of that yesterday, and it will do it all \ntoday, and it will do it all tomorrow.\n  Well, of every dollar Washington spends, 41 cents of it is borrowed. \nMuch of it is borrowed from China. Every American child born today, \nborn tomorrow, and born the next day is born with a debt of over \n$45,000. Next year, of every dollar Washington spends, 68 cents will go \nfor Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and interest on the debt \nalone.\n  If those numbers don't sound scary yet, they will. Interest on our \ndebt cost $196 billion last year. It costs nearly $23 million an hour. \nIt costs over $370,000 a minute, every minute. It costs $6,000 a \nsecond, every second, interest alone on our debt. In the time it takes \nto give this speech, as well as my colleague's previous speech and the \nspeech coming up after that, in those 10 minutes, Washington will have \nspent millions of dollars on interest payments alone.\n  The President has railed against tax breaks for private jets. He did \nit in a press conference last week. He mentioned it six times. What he \ndidn't tell you is that every $100 of the huge deficit of this year \nalone--of every $100, only two cents of that $100 would be dealt with \nwith the tax he proposes and holds out as the No. 1 thing. What about \nthe other $99.98? What the President won't tell you is that the \ninterest on our debt costs enough to buy over 100 private jets every \nday--for the interest we pay on the debt alone. His party wants to end \ntax breaks for yachts. Yet the interest on our debt would buy over 50 \nluxury yachts every hour. Most Americans are feeling severe pain at the \npump. Yet Washington could buy nearly 2,000 gallons of gas at current \nprices every second with the money we spend on interest on our debt.\n  If we, as a nation, continue down this path, Washington will spend \nall of what it takes in on Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and \ninterest on this colossal debt. Everything else, from defense to \neducation, will be paid for on a budget of borrowed money. So where is \nthe money going to come from? How will we ever pay it back? A lot of it \nwill come from other countries, countries that do not always have \nAmerica's best interest at heart.\n  Debt isn't just a disaster for the distant future; our debt is so \nunsustainable and irresponsible that even our military leaders have \ncondemned it. ADM Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nhas said the biggest threat to our national security is our debt. The \ndebt is the threat. We do not and we should not take the biggest threat \nto our national security lightly.\n  The amount of debt we owe right now today is so high that it is \nhurting our employment at home. Experts continue to tell us that our \ndebt is costing us millions of jobs. Meanwhile, the Weekly Standard \nreports that every ``stimulus job'' costs over $\\1/4\\ million. In other \nwords, the White House could have just cut a check of $100,000 for \nevery American who got a job through the stimulus, and taxpayers still \nwould have come out ahead by $427 billion. Spending like this cannot \ncreate jobs because by nature it makes it harder for the private sector \nto grow, and no growth means no jobs. Because of this, it is harder for \nAmerican families to\n\n[[Page S4379]]\n\nbuy gas, groceries, cars, and homes, to pay tuition for their kids to \ngo to college, and it is harder to create jobs for those kids who will \nbe graduating this year and next year and every year until we get this \nspending under control.\n\n  Everyone seems to claim they understand that the situation is \nirresponsible and unsustainable. Two years ago, back in February of \n2009, the President called experts to the White House. He called them \nin for what he called a fiscal responsibility summit. In his opening \nremarks, here is what the President had to say:\n\n       Contrary to the prevailing wisdom in Washington these past \n     few years, we cannot simply spend as we please, and defer the \n     consequences to the next budget, the next administration, or \n     the next generation.\n\n  Well, I agreed with the President. He was right. So my question to \nthe President is, What have you done about it?\n  One thing he has done is to call together a debt commission. Late \nlast year, the debt commission released their report on America's \nfiscal situation, and the findings were sobering. According to the \nreport, they said the problem was real; the solution will be painful; \nthere is no easy way out; everything must be on the table. You know \nwhat else they said. They said Washington must lead.\n  Washington has not led. Instead, the administration has offered \nnothing but empty promises. As the White House makes promise after \npromise and speech after speech with no action to back it up, it is \nclearer than ever that in Washington spoken promises have become broken \npromises.\n  This administration's allies in Congress have no plan other than \nraising taxes. While they claim to have already accepted the idea of \ncutting trillions of dollars from the budget, I have yet to hear the \nDemocratic leadership endorse any spending cuts. Where is their plan to \ncut wasteful Washington spending? So far, they have only talked about \ntax increases that will kill jobs and hurt our economy. Raising taxes \nwill only make matters worse.\n  The fundamental difference in this fight is more than just practical, \nit is also philosophical. We can argue over whether raising taxes on \nthis or on that industry will lower the debt or just raise the costs \nfor the American people.\n  Let me make this very simple. I am not interested in raising taxes to \nexpand and sustain the size and scope of our Federal Government. I want \nless government, less costly government, and that means I am not \ninterested in ferreting out new ways to tax people or businesses. I am \nlooking for ways to cut spending to shrink the size of government. I \nwant to dramatically reshape government, spend less, do less, and put \npower back into the private sector. That is how you raise revenue--you \nslash government, you put people back to work. Washington's persistent \npush to put our fiscal crisis off until tomorrow is unacceptable and \nmust end now.\n  So I come to the floor and say, as someone from Wyoming, where we \nlive within our means, where we balance our budget every year, it is \ntime for this body, this Congress, and this President to sign into law \na balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. That is an amendment \nwhich would force Washington to live within its means.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, just one comment on the subject at hand, \nand then I want to talk about something completely different that is \nvery significant happening today.\n  I listened to the Senator from New Jersey down here. He kept talking \nabout only in Washington what can happen, only in Washington. Yet never \nwas anything said about cutting spending. It was all about passing tax \nincreases, and that is what we will be faced with tomorrow.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Inhofe pertaining to the introduction of S. 1335 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time for \ndebate be extended until 7:30 p.m., with all of the provisions of the \nprevious order remaining in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I wasn't going to come to the floor today, \nbut I was in the chair and I have been hearing some of the debate that \nis going on about this debt ceiling and I decided that, once again, I \nneeded to stand and remind people what this vote is about when we get \nto it. The Presiding Officer has heard me talk about this before.\n  Our failure to lift the debt ceiling is not like the United States \ncutting up its credit card and saying we are not spending money \nanymore. It is exactly like a household at home, back in Colorado, \nsaying we overspent, we weren't careful, and we are not going to pay \nthe cable bill this month even though we owe it or we are not going to \npay our mortgage this month even though we owe it. Those are the kinds \nof things that in the real world lead in worst cases to bankruptcy but \nin a lousy case can lead to interest rates going up because the bank \nsays we are not going to let people pay a lower interest rate for their \nmortgage because they are not a good credit risk. That is exactly what \nis going to happen to the United States of America if we renege on the \nfull faith and credit of the United States.\n  That is why I was so pleased to see an editorial today in the Wall \nStreet Journal called ``A Debt-Limit Breakout.'' The Journal observed \nthat:\n\n       What this debate needs is a breakout strategy--to wit, \n     Republicans should answer Mr. Obama's tax call by accepting \n     his business tax increases in return for a lower corporate \n     tax rate.\n\n  The Journal goes on to observe directly--and by the way, I said this \nfor 2\\1/2\\ years, the last 2\\1/2\\ years in Colorado--``. . . the U.S. \ncorporate Tax Code provides the worst of both worlds: It makes U.S. \ncompanies less competitive'' because we have one of the highest rates, \nif not the highest rate, in the world, ``even as it raises much less \nrevenue than advertised.'' Because there are so many special interest \nloopholes that even though we have this high rate we are projecting, we \nare not, as the Presiding Officer knows, collecting the revenue we \nneed.\n  Finally, the Journal says:\n\n       Think about it.\n\n  Talking about these negotiations.\n\n       On the current path both sides are headed at best for a de \n     minimis deal that makes everyone look bad, at worst for a \n     major political crack-up.\n\n  I think the Journal has it exactly right, and I think both of those \noutcomes are unacceptable to the people of Colorado and should be \nunacceptable to the Members of this body. A de minimis deal that \nsomehow gets us through this but doesn't actually address the \nfundamental structural issues we face is unacceptable, and a political \ncrackup is absolutely unacceptable as well not because of the political \nfate of anybody in this Chamber, but because of what is going to happen \nto our economy if our interest resets because we have failed to deal \nwith this debt ceiling issue.\n  I have spent a lot of time in the capital markets and I know that \nonce those interest rates reset, they will be reset for the rest of my \nlife. I am so worried the posturing and the politicking that has been \ngoing on in this Chamber is going to put us in a place where we \nactually run out of time to do the right thing.\n  I wanted to come down here today to say thank you to two Republicans \nwho came out today. One is Senator John McCain from Arizona who came \nout with this Wall Street Journal editorial--and, by the way, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Journal article I have been referring to be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, July 5, 2011]\n\n                    Editorial: A Debt-Limit Breakout\n\n       The debt-limit talks in Washington are bogged down in the \n     hedgerows, with some Republicans insisting on a balanced \n     budget amendment that can't pass Congress President Obama \n     insisting on tax increases that Republicans oppose.\n       We've long favored such a reform, and last year so did the \n     Simpson-Bowles deficit commission and the White House \n     economic advisory council headed by Paul Volcker. But the \n     cause has now acquired no less a convert than Bill Clinton. \n     Speaking Saturday at something called the Aspen Ideas \n     Festival,\n\n[[Page S4380]]\n\n     the former President admitted that he had once raised tax \n     rates on corporations.\n       ``It made sense when I did it. It doesn't make sense \n     anymore. We've got an uncompetitive rate,'' he said. ``We tax \n     at 35% of income, although we only take about 23%. So we \n     should cut the rate to 25%, or whatever's competitive, and \n     eliminate a lot of the deductions so that we still get a fair \n     amount, and there's not so much variance in what the \n     corporations pay.''\n       We opposed Mr. Clinton's tax increases, not least because \n     corporations don't pay taxes so much as they serve as a \n     collecting agent. But on the rest of Mr. Clinton's riff, \n     Milton Friedman and Robert Mundell couldn't have put it \n     better, though perhaps they'd think that 25% is still too \n     high.\n       We'd prefer 15% ourselves, but Mr. Clinton is exactly right \n     on the failure of the 35% rate (39% on average including the \n     states) to capture that share of corporate income in \n     government revenue. We wrote earlier this year about \n     Whirlpool, which had an effective tax rate of zero due to its \n     many write-offs. Everyone knows the notorious case of GE.\n       The average effective corporate rate varies by industry but \n     is far less than the 35% rate, and the injustice is that some \n     pay much less than others if they can afford lobbyists to \n     write loopholes or they invest in politically correct \n     purposes. Anyone not in thrall of class-war symbolism \n     understands that the U.S. tax code provides the worst of both \n     worlds: It makes U.S. companies less competitive even as it \n     raises much less revenue than advertised. Mr. Obama and \n     Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner have acknowledged this in the \n     past, the President as recently as this year's State of the \n     Union address.\n       As for the debt-limit politics, this is also a winner. \n     Democrats and Republicans say they've agreed privately on \n     sizable spending cuts over a 10-year budget window. No doubt \n     some of those cuts are less real than others, and future \n     Congresses could rewrite any enforcement provisions passed \n     this year. But Republicans still have an incentive to set \n     spending on a downward path, and Mr. Obama has an incentive \n     to show he is no longer a hostage of Nancy Pelosi as he runs \n     for re-election.\n       The political sticking point is Mr. Obama's desire for some \n     Republican buy-in on raising revenues. His political left is \n     still sore that he agreed to extend the Bush tax rates \n     through 2012. Thus he's pounding Republicans to agree to \n     eliminate certain business tax deductions that political \n     advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe have told him will \n     be hard for Republicans to defend. Corporate jets. Carried \n     interest for private equity. Oil and gas. Even LIFO \n     accounting, which few understand but can be made to sound \n     nefarious.\n       Whatever their individual merits, each of these would be a \n     tax increase on business, and Republicans campaigned last \n     year on not raising taxes. But the politics is different if \n     they can offset these revenue raisers with lower tax rates. \n     That would let Republicans honestly claim they didn't support \n     a net tax increase, even as Mr. Obama could say he raised \n     revenue.\n       Our own guess is that such a reform would raise far more \n     money than the official scorers would predict, since it would \n     lead to a more efficient allocation of capital and less tax \n     evasion. This would also promote economic growth, breaking \n     out of the austerity mentality driven by debt reduction. If \n     Mr. Obama really is worried that lower federal spending will \n     hurt the economy, then this tax reform is also his best \n     growth policy.\n       In offering his grand bargain on Saturday, Mr. Clinton \n     included the caveat of ``how can they do that by August 2?'' \n     Mr. Geithner says that is the date when he can no longer \n     finagle federal finances to escape a potential default on the \n     debt, or must at least cut some federal spending, to avoid \n     breaching the $14.3 trillion debt limit.\n       But where there's political self-interest there's always a \n     way. Both sides could agree to a short-term debt-limit \n     reprieve of a month or two with some spending cuts that \n     everyone agrees on. That would give them more time to cut a \n     larger deal that includes corporate tax reform.\n       Think about it. On the current path both sides are headed \n     at best for a de minimis deal that makes everyone look bad, \n     at worst for a major political crack-up. Perhaps Mr. Obama \n     wants a crack-up to portray Republicans as extreme. But \n     Republicans should at least call his bluff and answer his \n     demands for fewer business tax deductions by saying yes--in \n     return for lower tax rates.\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Senator John McCain came out and said we might not like \neverything in here, but it makes a great deal of sense and we need a \ngame changer to deal with this debt debate we are having right now. I \nwish to applaud him for that. When someone comes to the Senate they say \na person can have two mentors, one is a Democrat and one is a \nRepublican, but one has to ask the person if they will do it. I asked \nSenator McCain if he wouldn't mind being my Republican mentor and he \nthought about it a little bit, he came out on the floor and he said, I \nwill take you to lunch. Even though he didn't exactly support me in my \nlast campaign, he has given me a lot of advice over the last number of \nmonths. To see him out here today saying, you know what, we may need to \nthink differently about this, gave me some hope that maybe we are not \ngoing to run out of time.\n  The other person I wish to thank is Senator Chambliss from Georgia \nwho was speaking when I was sitting in the chair and said that \neverything needs to be on the table. This isn't a time to draw bright \nlines. It is a time to pull ourselves together, roll up our sleeves and \ndo what is right. We have the outlines of a plan from the deficit and \ndebt commission. I don't love everything in it--no one would love \neverything in it--but we have to find a way to compromise and come \ntogether for the benefit of our kids and for our grandkids, and I think \nimportantly, in the short term, to give American business the \nconfidence it needs to invest again in this economy.\n  There is $2.3 trillion of cash sitting on the balance sheets of our \nNation's businesses. There may be a lot of reasons for that, but I know \none is they are uncertain about our ability to straighten out the \nfiscal quagmire we face.\n  We have spent a lot of time on this, but we haven't made a lot of \nprogress and we are running out of time. So I urge all of my colleagues \nto come to the floor in the spirit of people who want to work across \nthe aisle, who are not interested in drawing these bright lines, and \ncome to a big deal--not a small deal--one that gets to the $4.5 \ntrillion that the deficit commission recommended or in that direction \ngenerally, and gives us the chance to feel as though we have done \nsomething useful for our kids, one that will give us the chance to feel \npatriotic, that we actually have honored the legacy of our parents and \ngrandparents, and that we have passed along more opportunity to the \nnext generation. I want the Presiding Officer to know, and I know he \nfeels the same way, that we will work with anybody on the other side of \nthe aisle to try to get this done.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask to speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, it is appropriate that we are here on this \nJuly 4 holiday week. I joined a number of my colleagues last week who \nmade it clear it was important for us to be here. Raising the debt \nceiling is a significant issue we face, and while I am pleased to see \nthe discussion ongoing on the Senate floor today, we do need actions \nthat speak louder than our words. I say that knowing I am coming here \nto talk about an issue that we have attempted to bring to the attention \nof my colleagues in the Senate now for a long time.\n  We have a looming financial crisis. All the Democratic leadership was \ncapable of bringing up on the Senate floor this week was a sense of the \nSenate that wealthy Americans should pay their fair share of something.\n  I suppose we will have a discussion about that, which has begun and \nwill continue for the next few days. But I believe Americans deserve \nleadership in our Nation's Capital to confront the real fiscal \nchallenges--not just this desire to kick the can down the road and \nignore the crisis we face.\n  In my view, our President and the Senate leadership have failed to \nlead. They have failed to adopt the President's own Deficit Reduction \nCommission report. The President has not proposed the results of that \nreport. They have failed to pass a budget in over 2 years. They have \nfailed to introduce a budget even in our committee this year, and the \nPresident's budget that he did propose this year is woefully inadequate \nin addressing the fiscal crisis, the deficits we face.\n  Crafting a budget is one of the basic responsibilities of Congress, \nbut it has not happened. No country, business, or family can operate \nresponsibly without a budget. I serve on the Appropriations Committee. \nI would love to have a budget that set the guidelines for us to begin \nthe process of determining how much money we should spend, what things \nmight be increased, decreased, or eliminated. Without a budget, the \nappropriations process continues to falter and, in fact, it would not \nbe surprising that once again we end up with either an omnibus spending \nbill or a continuing resolution.\n  The President and Senate Democrats have said they are serious about \ndealing with our Nation's debt crisis, but\n\n[[Page S4381]]\n\nactions will speak louder than words. The truth is the President's \nbudget and the policies of this administration have made our problems \nworse.\n  During the last 2 years, the government has spent more than $7.3 \ntrillion and increased the Nation's debt in just 2 years by more than \n$3.2 trillion. The President is missing and the Senate is \ndysfunctional. The struggling economy we are experiencing and the \nfinancial collapse around the corner is the most expected economic \ncrisis in our lifetime. Yet nothing is being done to stop it.\n  The cochairs of the President's own Fiscal Commission have said the \nsame thing and have warned that if we fail to take swift and serious \naction, the U.S. faces ``the most predictable economic crisis in its \nhistory.'' They predict such an event could occur in 2 years or less.\n  It is time to move past empty rhetoric and get serious about \nconfronting the debt crisis. Delaying difficult decisions and simply \nincreasing the debt ceiling once again without making any changes to \nthe way Washington spends taxpayer dollars should not be an option. We \ncannot afford business as usual.\n  The President's solution is to raise revenues to balance the budget. \nBut does anyone really believe that increased taxes will be used to pay \ndown the debt or will it just be used for even more spending? History \nshows that money raised in Washington, DC, results in more spending in \nWashington, DC.\n  When families struggle to pay the bills, they do not simply ask for a \npay raise; they cut their spending. The revenue increases we need are \nnot tax increases but increased revenues that come from a growing \neconomy.\n  The last time we had a balanced budget was at the end of President \nClinton's term. Yes, there was some spending restraint, and Republicans \nand Democrats could not get along well enough to agree to spend a bunch \nof money, but the real reason the budget was balanced was that people \nwere working and paying their taxes. We need a growing economy once \nagain to balance the budget.\n  Increasing taxes reduces the chances of economic growth and the \nability to create more and better jobs. If we increase taxes, we reduce \nthe chance of economic growth and we reduce the chance of more and \nbetter paying jobs.\n  In Kansas, for example, the President proposes we increase taxes on \nthose who own a business plane. Airplanes are a pretty important \ncomponent of our State's economy, and this proposal would have a \ndevastating impact upon the Wichita economy, which has already suffered \nthe loss of thousands of jobs under declining business in this country.\n  Now is not the time to penalize a U.S. industry that produces the \nbest quality airplanes in the world. The U.S. and North America ship a \nsignificant amount of business jets worldwide, more than any other \nregion in the world. But because of the recession, nearly every \naircraft manufacturer has had to cut jobs, some up to 50 percent of \ntheir workforce.\n  We see this in Kansas day in and day out, and yet the proposal is to \nmake it more expensive to own an aircraft. This does not punish the \nowners of aircraft. It punishes the people who work every day to make \nan airplane.\n  To turn our economy around and put people back to work, Congress and \nthe Obama administration should be implementing policies that encourage \njob creation, not diminish the chances; rein in burdensome government \nregulations; replace our convoluted Tax Code with one that is fair, \nsimple, and certain; open foreign markets for American manufactured \ngoods and agricultural products; and develop a comprehensive energy \npolicy. Yet none of these are being done by this Senate.\n  Spending more has failed to stimulate our economy. Instead, we should \ncut government spending to reduce our deficit, cap spending so it does \nnot continue to eat up more and more of our gross domestic product, and \nbalance our budget so we do not get back in this mess once again.\n  First, it is time to cut government spending and change the way \nWashington, DC, spends taxpayer dollars. Mr. President, 40 cents of \nevery dollar our Federal Government is spending is borrowed. One \nhundred percent of our tax revenue is spent on mandatory spending and \ninterest payments on the debt. Everything else--defense, homeland \nsecurity, energy, education--is borrowed. This year we will collect \n$2.2 trillion and spend $3.7 trillion--a $1.5 trillion deficit.\n  CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, now projects that debt held by \nthe public will exceed 100 percent of gross domestic product by 2021 \nunder current policies. This is a 10-percent increase in debt relative \nto CBO's projections of only a year ago.\n  The debate over government spending is often seen as one that is \nphilosophical or partisan bickering that always goes on in Washington, \nDC. And certainly I have heard, all of my adult life, the conversations \nthat go on in Washington, DC, and on the talk shows, and in the \nnewspapers, that talk about Republicans and Democrats arguing about \nbalancing the budget and how much money we can spend, but the reality \nis this time it is different, and our failure to act will have dramatic \nconsequences on the daily lives of Americans.\n  This is about whether Americans can find a job, can make their \npayments on their homes and automobiles, whether their kids have a \nbright future and can pursue the American dream. This is not a \nphilosophical discussion for Washington, DC. This has real consequences \nfor every American family.\n  We are not, unfortunately, immune from the laws of economics that \nface every nation. The failure to get our financial house in order and \nborrowing under control will lead to increased inflation, higher \ninterest rates, fewer jobs, and a lower standard of living for every \nAmerican. Our creditors may one day decide we are no longer \ncreditworthy, and we will suffer the same consequences that other \ncountries are now suffering that followed that path. We should learn \nfrom them.\n  Secondly, it is time to cap discretionary spending this year and \nnext. We must demand enforceable statutory caps to return Federal \nspending to 18 percent of gross domestic product, where it has been for \nalmost all of the past 60 years. Current Federal spending is now nearly \n25 percent of gross domestic product and remains on track to be high \nover the course of the next 10 years.\n  Third, we must pass a balanced budget amendment. This amendment to \nthe U.S. Constitution is the best way to discipline government \nofficials. This amendment would require the President to submit and \nCongress to pass a balanced budget each and every year, cap Federal \nspending at no more than 18 percent of gross domestic product, and \nrequire a two-thirds vote of the House and the Senate to raise taxes.\n  Nothing here is unreasonable. Cut spending, cap the percentage of \nspending to GDP, and pass a balanced budget amendment. When did it \nbecome radical or even irresponsible to live within our means? We know \nwhat is going to happen if we do not act, and it would be immoral for \nus to look the other way or to kick the can down the road because the \npolitics of these issues are too difficult to deal with.\n  Officials from the Obama administration warn that the failure of \nCongress to raise the legal debt limit would risk default. But the \nbigger economic threat that confronts our country are the consequences \nof allowing our country's pattern of spending and borrowing to continue \nwithout a serious plan to reduce that debt. Our out-of-control debt is \nslowing our economic growth and threatening the prosperity of future \ngenerations who will have to pay for our irresponsibility.\n  Our government is not on the verge of a financial meltdown because \nRepublicans will not vote to raise the debt ceiling. We are at the \npoint of financial collapse because Republicans and Democrats have \nspent money we do not have for way too long. We must use the leverage \nthat raising the debt ceiling now presents to force elected officials \nto do something they otherwise would not do: curb spending, grow the \neconomy, and balance the budget.\n  If we fail to respond, if we fail to act as we should, if we let this \nissue one more time pass for somebody else to solve because it is so \ndifficult, we will reduce the opportunities the next generation of \nAmericans have to pursue the American dream.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4382]]\n\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are here trying to figure out where \nAmerica goes in the near future, but also where it goes in the long \nterm because the decisions we make here are going to have a long \nlasting effect.\n  What we hear and the American people are witnessing over TV is the \nRepublicans are playing with fire, and millions of Americans are in \ndanger of getting scorched. It reminds us some of those who played the \nfiddle while Rome burned. The Republicans are willing to allow our \ncountry to go into default rather than ask the wealthiest among us to \npay their fair share.\n  The Republican side of the Capitol is clear. They say: Don't ask our \nmillionaire friends to contribute anything more to keep our ship of \nstate afloat. Yes, the ride is going to be bumpier for everyone, but \nthat is life. Why shouldn't the middle class pay something, they ask. \nAfter all, there are so many of them.\n  In fact, a Republican Senator was on the floor this afternoon saying \nthe wealthy are overburdened. It is not easy, I guess, to pick out a \nnew car every year, maybe make sure your reservations for your trip \nabroad are made, and renovations for the house are in order. Life gets \ncomplicated if you are rich. These decisions do not come easy.\n  The Senator who spoke this afternoon complained that the poor and the \nmiddle class--and I quote him here--``need to share some of the \nresponsibility.''\n  So there it is. It is the poor and the middle class who need to \nsacrifice once again, but not the wealthy. The fat cats sit purring on \nthe front deck while middle-class workers are breaking their backs.\n  Middle-class workers should not have to explain to their kids why \nthey cannot afford to help them get a college education. Democrats know \nthe way to keep our country strong is to educate every young person \ncapable of learning.\n  Now, what is the real cost of millionaire protection? This risk is an \neconomic calamity for middle-class families across the country if we \nmake a mistake here as we deal with the raising of the debt ceiling, as \nwe deal with the problems of the budget.\n  It is time to stop protecting millionaires when so much is needed \nfrom everyone who can help this country regain its footing. If the \nRepublicans force default on our debt, it could mean tens of millions \nof Americans might not receive their Social Security checks. Retirees \nand disabled Americans on fixed incomes depend on Social Security for \nsurvival.\n  But Social Security is only the beginning. If the Republicans insist \non pushing the government into default, the men and women who wear our \ncountry's uniforms may not even get their paychecks. Right now there \nare 140,000 brave Americans risking death and injury in Afghanistan and \nIraq. Do we reduce our responsibility to them because Republicans do \nnot want to burden millionaires?\n  Additionally, payments to doctors under Medicare and Medicaid could \nbe suspended. Where do the seniors and needy Americans turn then in the \nevent of an urgent medical problem?\n  At a time when nearly 14 million Americans are out of work and \nstruggling to keep food on the table, unemployment benefits could \nlapse. We are talking about the possibility of people without incomes, \npeople unable to sustain their basic needs. In addition to destroying \nthe safety net for ordinary Americans, a default crisis would likely \nthreaten America's position as the economic giant of the world, as we \nsee the possibility of widespread panic on Wall Street and the damage \nto the credit markets that could lead to the loss of millions of jobs \nacross the country.\n  The question has to be answered: Why are the Republicans willing to \nwalk on this economic tightrope to win favor among wealthy \ncontributors? It is because they do not sufficiently value the human \ninfrastructure that enabled the millionaires to make their millions. \nThey are insisting on protecting tax breaks for millionaires and \nbillionaires.\n  They want to keep subsidizing big oil companies to the tune of $4 \nbillion a year in tax breaks. I look at what our leader, the majority \nleader, has proposed. I am proud to be a cosponsor of a commonsense \nresolution introduced by Senator Reid.\n  The resolution says: Americans who earn $1 million or more a year \nshould pick up the shovel and help their country dig its way out of the \ndisaster instead of just playing politics.\n  The American people see through the Republican games of protecting \nthe rich, while middle-class families lose jobs, homes, and the belief \nthat their children have a chance of success that their forebears \ndreamt about. In poll after poll, survey after survey, they say we \nshould ask the very wealthy to pay more to reduce the deficit. Yet the \nRepublicans refuse to close outrageous tax loopholes for oil companies \nthat are rolling in profits. We cannot ask them to sacrifice.\n  Look at what the CEOs of these companies are being paid. ExxonMobil, \nthey made over $11 billion in a quarter. The CEO made, in 2010, $29 \nmillion. ConocoPhillips, their CEO made $18 million in 2010. Chevron, \nthe CEO was paid $16 million in 2010.\n  The facts are clear and so are the Republican priorities. They do not \nwant the giant corporations and the wealthy to lose their lucrative tax \nloopholes. The Republicans want to end Medicare as we know it, forcing \nseniors to pick up an extra $6,000 a year for their health care. The \nquestion has to be asked: Why are the Republicans trying to slow the \neconomic recovery? Why run the risk of financial collapse just 3 years \nafter the last one? Do they believe destroying the economy now will \nhelp them during next year's election? What a terrible thought that is. \nWe heard the minority leader say his No. 1 priority is stopping this \nPresident from winning another term.\n  Our No. 1 priority ought not to be to destroy lives for political \ngain. It ought to be about restoring our economy, restoring jobs, \nmaking sure all Americans can share in what this great country has to \noffer.\n  The question lurks: What is it that propels this unyielding refusal \nto ask those who make $1 million a year or more to participate some in \nrestoring our economic viability? The bottom line is, avoiding a \ndefault crisis requires all to participate or we could witness the \nfailure of a nation that has survived for more than 200 years--200 \nyears as a beacon of freedom, liberty, and democracy--with great risk \nof substantial failure in the future if we do not raise the debt \nceiling.\n  The Democrats feel the need to protect the basic values that have \nmade this dream heard only in America, over centuries, a reality. Going \nforward into the future, we have to continue to protect the values we \ntreasure in our society.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Woitowicz, U.S.M.C.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, on June 7, 2011, Groton, the State of \nMassachusetts, and our country lost a brave young man who gave his life \ndefending the Nation he loved. Sergeant William ``Billy'' Woitowicz \ndied serving with the U.S. Marine Corps in Afghanistan, fighting as a \npart of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  In the difficult days that followed this awful news, the entire \nGroton community came together to show their support for his family and \nto remember Billy's dedication and selflessness. Joe Moore, a family \nfriend, described Bill movingly in a tribute that was itself an act of \ngreat devotion. I ask that it be printed in the Record so that all of \nus can reflect on the sacrifice of a courageous marine tragically lost \nmuch too soon in service to a grateful nation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Eulogy for Sergeant William J. Woitowicz\n\n                     (Delivered by Joseph F. Moore)\n\n       Before I begin, I would like to read the statement I \n     prepared for the media on behalf of the Woitowicz family this \n     past Tuesday. It did not make its way to the individuals and \n     communities that poured love from their hearts for Billy and \n     his family.\n       On behalf of the Woitowicz family, I would like to thank \n     everyone for their heartfelt condolences, the kind words, the \n     outpouring of emotion, gifts of food, offers of help, cards, \n     and prayers. I can't tell you how much that has meant to my \n     friends. They appreciate your kindness very much.\n       They would also like to thank the Marines for the \n     tremendous support of their family and the respect they've \n     shown Billy in the way they have treated him as they've \n     brought him home. My father was a Marine during World War II \n     and I've always had a tremendous respect for the Corps. The \n     actions of these Marines, in the way they've treated my \n     friends, especially Sergeant Owens, only enhances that \n     admiration.\n       If I could pause for a moment--Would you please stand and \n     join me in a round of applause for the United States Marine \n     Corps, and the Marines joining us today to honor their fallen \n     comrade, to show them how much we appreciate the sacrifices \n     they make for us?\n       Billy was a wonderful person. You only need to see the \n     flags lining the streets of Groton and Westford, the messages \n     of love, the swollen eyes, to see how people cared about him. \n     It is because he cared for them--that was Billy, always more \n     interested and concerned for you than he was for himself.\n       Although we mourn for Billy and our hearts ache for the \n     loss of him, we know there is a celebration in heaven for the \n     return of one of God's favorite sons and soldiers.\n       I am pleased to announce the Groton Dunstable Youth \n     Basketball League, which I have great pride in saying I \n     served for 15 years, has named their 3-on-3-basketball \n     tournament after Billy. Thanks so much to the Board members; \n     this means a lot to the Woitowicz family and to me.\n       Our State Representative Sheila Harrington is spearheading \n     a movement to create the Sergeant William J. Woitowicz \n     Memorial Trust. The trust will fund a scholarship named after \n     Billy and other activities chosen by the family. Thank you, \n     Sheila. We appreciate your efforts.\n       Billy's second mother, my wife Karen, said, ``For a kid who \n     didn't like attention, he sure drummed up a lot of it.''\n       Billy, did you see us on the tarmac waiting for you to come \n     home?\n       Did you see the respect of your fellow Marines as they \n     gently held you?\n       Did you see the people standing in honor as we drove \n     through Hanscom?\n       Did you see Mr. Clickner with tears in his eyes holding a \n     basketball?\n       Did you see the gentleman, also a Marine, at the exit with \n     the sign that read, ``Thank you Corporal Woitowicz, I try to \n     be worth dying for.''\n       Did you see the cherry pickers with American flags flowing \n     down from them at the rotary?\n       Did you see the fire trucks from Acton and Maynard, Boxboro \n     and Littleton, parked on the overpass, with their ladders \n     extended and connected in a salute of honor, and the firemen \n     standing on top of their trucks?\n       Did you see people who simply stopped by the procession and \n     got out of their cars with their hands over their hearts?\n       Did you see along the route you traveled, the rescue \n     squads, state police, sheriffs, and the police and firemen \n     from Lexington, Concord, Acton, Watertown, Melrose, Medford, \n     Lowell, Maynard, Boxboro, Lancaster, Littleton, Harvard, \n     Ayer, Dunstable, Groton, and Westford?\n       Did you see the older veterans, in their uniforms, standing \n     at salute?\n       Did you see the people pouring out of their offices as your \n     procession passed by?\n       Did you see the elderly gray-haired woman, standing by \n     herself in Harvard, holding an American flag?\n       Did you see the lines of people in bordering towns with \n     genuine looks of anguish?\n       Did you see the rows of people on Main Street in Groton? \n     And did you notice they were patiently waiting when we \n     returned from the high school to honor you twice?\n       Did you see the Groton-Dunstable High School \n     administrators, teachers, and students in respectful \n     alignment? The students were proud to attend the same high \n     school as you.\n       Did you see that we stopped at Orr Road, to pay tribute to \n     where you grew up?\n       Did you see the fire trucks from Groton and Westford, your \n     two home towns, with their ladders outstretched over 225, \n     forming a gateway for your return?\n       Did you see the people in Forge Village, waiting patiently \n     for you?\n       Did you see the little kids of Norman E. Day Elementary \n     School saluting and waving?\n       Did you see the people holding flags in front of St. \n     Catherine's?\n       Did you know your friend Kelly was going to give up her \n     vacation to drive back from California because she loves you \n     so much?\n       Kevin and Rose, and my wife Karen and I have seven \n     children. Their children are ours and ours, theirs. Just as I \n     know Kevin and Rose love our kids, we love Chris, Bill, and \n     Mandy as our own. Billy was like a son and, for reasons that \n     I never completely understood he seemed to be attached to me. \n     Rose and Karen would often say, ``Billy really likes talking \n     to you. He looks up to you, Joe. Talk to him.'' And when my \n     dearest friend Rosemary asked me to do this eulogy, Karen \n     said, when I hung up the phone, ``He loved talking to you. \n     You should to do it. Share how much we all love him, respect \n     him, and how much we now miss him.''\n       Please bear with me as I give honor, through this eulogy, \n     to my friend and hero, Sergeant William J. Woitowicz, USMC. \n     It is a great privilege that you have bestowed on me, Kevin \n     and Rose. Thank you.\n       At the same time that I was saying yes to Rose, I was \n     wondering how I would ever get through this without breaking \n     down. I knew I couldn't, but nothing could ever keep me from \n     it, not even the fear of losing my composure in front of all \n     of you, once my friends Kevin and Rose asked me to do this \n     for them.\n       Do me a favor. In the minutes that it might take me to \n     recover, please raise your eyes to heaven and look for \n     Billy's smiling face. And while you focus on him, pray for \n     his mom and dad, and his brother and sister. I would ask that \n     you to pray for Bill but I know he is in a better place, \n     happy to be home. Even if he did need our prayers, it \n     would be the preference of our unselfish Bill that you \n     turn your thoughts not to him but to his family.\n       And please get comfortable, as this might take longer than \n     one of Father Peter's sermons. We sometimes pack a lunch for \n     the 11:00 Mass when we know he is preaching.\n       Speaking of Father Peter, some of you may not know that \n     prior to being a parish priest, he was at a monastery for \n     which he had to take a vow of silence. He was only allowed to \n     say two words every seven years. After the first seven years \n     the elders called him in and asked for his two words. ``Cold \n     floors,'' he said. The elders nodded and sent him away. Seven \n     more years passed. They brought him back in and asked for his \n     two words. He cleared his throat. ``Bad food,'' he said. They \n     nodded and sent him away. Seven more years passed. They \n     brought him in for his two words. ``I quit,'' he said. \n     ``That's not surprising,'' the elders said. ``You've done \n     nothing but complain since you got here.''\n       You might think it inappropriate to begin this eulogy with \n     a joke, but it is exactly what Bill would have wanted. There \n     is not a doubt in my mind that Billy is saying right now, \n     ``Way to go, Mr. Moore.'' That happens to be one of his \n     favorite expressions. I will try to paint a picture of Billy \n     to help you understand why this is so.\n       In 1996, Karen and I moved our family from Allentown, \n     Pennsylvania, to Groton. We were building a new house and it \n     was not completed before the start of the school year so we \n     crammed into a suite at the Westford Regency Hotel for six \n     weeks. Prior to trekking to Groton, we had signed our kids up \n     for soccer, and on our first Saturday as New Englanders we \n     drove our kids to a match held behind St. Anne's Church in \n     Littleton. As fate would have it, Chris, Billy, and our son \n     Mike were all on the same team.\n       We knew no one in the area and Karen was determined to find \n     a doctor for our kids. She happened to approach Rosemary on \n     the sideline--she liked how Rose was cheering so loudly for \n     her kids--and, as Rosie would, she went out of her way to be \n     helpful to Karen. As they spoke, they connected partly \n     because our kids went to Catholic schools. Let me interject \n     here that Karen and Rose have not stopped talking since that \n     day--literally, just ask our kids. Also while they chatted \n     our daughters Jenny and Mandy struck up a friendship and, \n     although they don't burn through their cell phone minutes \n     talking like their mothers do, they have remained best \n     friends.\n       The mothers figured out during their discussion that we \n     lived near each other and Rose told us that she knew a short \n     cut. We were headed to see how our house was coming along so \n     we followed them home and pulled up to thank Rose for her \n     help. It was then that we saw our first glimpse of Billy's \n     tremendous charisma. Before we pulled away, little eight-\n     year-old Bill looked at us and said, ``Do you want to come in \n     for coffee? My mom made muffins.'' He then\n\n[[Page S4384]]\n\n     glanced at his mother as if to say, ``Come on, of course were \n     going to invite them in--right, mom?''\n       The rest, as they say, is history. Our older boys also \n     became best friends. Drew became the younger brother to all \n     of the kids and they each had a hand in raising him. Kevin \n     and myself and even our dogs, Freckles and Maya, became \n     friends. They all grew up together as our families \n     intertwined.\n       When Billy decided to become a Marine, his parents, of \n     course, tried to talk him out of it. So did many others. No \n     one could change his mind. Finally, Rosemary asked me to talk \n     to Bill about his decision. She told me that he seemed so \n     committed, and that it was so very important to him that I \n     shouldn't try to talk him out of it. But, even though she \n     wanted him to follow his dream, she was hoping I could \n     convince him to change his mind. I tried but failed. He \n     listened--looking off into a place I could not see--patiently \n     and politely. We ended our conversation with Bill telling me, \n     ``Don't worry Mr. Moore, everything will be okay.'' Billy had \n     made his decision and no one could change it.\n       On other occasions when I talked to Bill about things that \n     might be troubling him, he would listen intently but I always \n     sensed that he had figured out his own answer. He would \n     masterfully turn our conversations and I would walk away \n     feeling as though it was he who had lectured me. And, as if \n     he sensed my thoughts, he would give me his standard but \n     heartfelt response, ``Don't worry Mr. Moore, everything's \n     okay.''\n       Part of the connection Bill had with me, I believe, was \n     that my father was also a Marine. He was a proud member of \n     the First Marines and fought in World War II. He was at \n     Guadalcanal, the first victory for America in the Pacific \n     after suffering so many horrific losses. He fought at \n     Peleliu, which had the highest percentage casualty rate of \n     any battle in the Pacific, called, by some, the bitterest \n     battle of the war for the Marines.\n       Bill constantly asked me questions about my dad and wanted \n     me to tell him the stories I knew about his war experiences. \n     He listened, riveted, as I told him that of the 200-plus men \n     in my father's unit on Peleliu, only 27 returned unharmed. \n     His face wore a look of reverence as I told him my father \n     watched his closest friend, Sandy, die in front of him.\n       He loved to look at dad's medals, dog tags, and his old \n     green-covered book about the First Marines, The Old Guard. \n     The two of us watched a black-and-white video together that \n     my father had given me about the battle of Peleliu--Bill \n     could not take his eyes off of the television screen. Then \n     again, when the mini-series ``The Pacific'' was released, I \n     sat with Bill in our basement watching as it amazingly \n     replayed the exact stories that I had told Bill about my \n     father, including a scene where the soldier on whose life it \n     was based, on leave in Australia, slept--just as my dad had--\n     with other wounded and fatigued soldiers in a soccer stadium \n     where the bleachers had been removed and replaced by cots. It \n     also chronicled many of the horrific battle scenes. Bill, who \n     could never sit still, did not move a muscle.\n       On several occasions Billy said to me, ``I hope I will make \n     your dad proud, Mr. Moore.'' And, just prior to leaving for \n     Afghanistan, he asked me, ``Do you think your dad will be \n     proud of me, Mr. Moore?'' I told him, ``Billy, my dad is \n     already proud of you.''\n       I would like to share an email that Bill sent me this past \n     April from Afghanistan. It will give you a good sense of his \n     character, his humor, and what was important to him.\n       mr moore,\n       glad to hear from you . . . just headed off to bed, going \n     to be a long day tomorrow--and my pack is starting to get \n     heavy--as the afghans say in their broken English noooooooo \n     goooood hahah. its been warm and rainy the last two days. i \n     wonder what your dad would think of this war. probably a cake \n     walk compared to WWII; but all i can do is try and make him \n     proud. i bet he's watching down on all marines up there in \n     heaven with a big smile on his face every time we have \n     success. cant wait to be back home and have a relaxing day by \n     the moore pool after a good game of bball. hope works been \n     great and everyone's been staying out of trouble--i know its \n     probably hard for drew this day in age haha. anyways tell the \n     whole family i said hi, and tell matt to catch up with me on \n     email--i called and left a message on his phone the other \n     day. my beards nice and thick and the hair is nice and long \n     (im trying to give ole tom brady a run for his money haha) \n     ill keep in touch but write soon and often. its funny, last \n     year for my 22nd bday i was in the middle of losing 20lbs \n     being chased by dogs in the woods, now im turning 23 and \n     being chased by dogs in afghanistan haha . . . wouldn't want \n     it any other way\n       love,\n       Bill\n       This is a list of the Marine Core Leadership Traits. \n     Reading them, a vision of the man that Billy became appears:\n       Dependability\n       Bearing\n       Courage\n       Decisiveness\n       Endurance\n       Enthusiasm\n       Initiative\n       Integrity\n       Judgment\n       Justice.\n       Knowledge\n       Tact\n       Unselfishness\n       Loyalty\n       Certainly, these are all words that describe Bill.\n       To quote Albert Einstein, ``Life is not worth living unless \n     you live it for someone else.'' Joining the Marines was an \n     unselfish act, and a decision Bill made with certainty. Bill \n     was not just a Marine, but part of MARSOC, or United States \n     Marine Corps Special Operations Command--think Navy Seals on \n     steroids.\n       Its core objectives are to direct action, special \n     reconnaissance, and foreign internal defense. MARSOC has also \n     been directed to conduct counter-terrorism, information \n     operations, and unconventional warfare. MARSOC comprises \n     roughly 2,500 Marines. About 30% of those that attempt make \n     it through. If the Marines are the best of the best, MARSOC \n     is the best--of the best of the best. Kevin told me that when \n     Bill said he had to re-enlist to complete MARSOC, he started \n     to tell Bill all the reasons he might want to reconsider. \n     Frustrated, Bill finally told his dad he didn't need a ``Plan \n     B'' because he would not fail. He was right. Billy also was \n     one of only 1% of all Marines with a perfect score on the \n     required physical fitness test.\n       Some of you may not know that Bill volunteered to go to \n     Afghanistan ahead of his own unit. As a matter of fact, they \n     are still here in the United States. Due to an injury to a \n     soldier that had to return, there was a position open and \n     Bill volunteered to go early, ahead of his unit. That was \n     Bill, anxious to get going and positive he would make an \n     impact.\n       The following is a note sent to Mandy from one of Billy's \n     fellow Marines.\n       I worked with your brother in Miramar and I was the \n     Sergeant in charge of the division that he was assigned to. I \n     like to think I taught him most of what he knew as a computer \n     repair tech at his first duty station. I was grief stricken \n     to hear of his passing but please know that for a Marine as \n     dedicated to the Corps as your brother, there is no more \n     honorable way to leave us. I wish the best for you and your \n     family and am truly sorry for this tragic loss.\n       Sincerely,\n       Jonathan Sypole\n       One Christmas Billy gave me a Marine flag as a present. If \n     it hasn't yet come through clearly to you, Bill loved and \n     dedicated himself completely to the Corp. Bill, like my dad, \n     passed away from us taking his fierce pride in being a Marine \n     with him.\n       I believe we live our earthly lives simultaneously on two \n     planes, the physical and the spiritual. In the ongoing \n     struggle to overcome the physical and live more in the \n     spiritual, there are a few saints and mystics who succeed. \n     Advanced souls like Saint Thomas Aquinas, Padre Pio, and \n     Mother Teresa, to name a few, are on Earth to help others \n     rather than live for themselves. Some fail miserably, \n     succumbing to the earthly pull. Most of us live our lives \n     somewhere in between. I believe Billy, like the saints and \n     mystics, was one of the more advanced souls, one that \n     influenced others even if they were not aware. When you \n     looked into his eyes, it seemed like he understood things \n     that the rest of us couldn't comprehend.\n       C. S. Lewis said, ``You don't have a soul. You are a soul. \n     You have a body.'' Not many of us fully grasp this concept \n     while here on Earth, but I believe our Billy did. He knew \n     that this was just a temporary parking place for his soul; \n     his real home is in heaven. I think that is why he was so \n     impatient, why he couldn't sit still. Just maybe he was \n     anxious to get back where his vibrant, loving soul belonged. \n     Why he was with us for so short a time.\n       On the physical plane, Billy certainly had faults, like the \n     rest of us. But, as we know, even the Apostles Jesus selected \n     weren't perfect. I think Billy was a lot like St. Peter--a \n     bit impulsive, temperamental, impatient, and blindly loyal. \n     Most of you never saw that side of him, but it was there. Far \n     outweighing it, however, was his other side, loving and \n     caring, unselfish and kind, and extremely loyal--he was one \n     of the good ones. In his book The Imitation of Christ, Thomas \n     a Kempis wrote, ``The grace of the Holy Spirit always seeks a \n     meek and humble heart.'' If so, the Holy Spirit was a \n     permanent tenant in the heart of Billy Woitowicz.\n       We all loved and respected the Billy of the physical plane, \n     but to really understand the depth of him you needed to look \n     much deeper. I don't mean look so much as I mean feel. To \n     know him, you had to feel Billy's spirit, the energy that \n     exuded from him. Many of us don't slow ourselves down enough \n     to feel the soul of another. We are too busy with our day-to-\n     day. We waste our time idolizing athletes and movie stars. We \n     pay too much attention to what we own, how we look, what we \n     wear, and what others think of us. Bill cared nothing about \n     these things--he cared about others.\n       Those who truly knew Bill took the time to know his spirit \n     and they could not help but fall in love with his pure, \n     unadulterated soul. Although I miss the Bill that I could see \n     and hear and touch, it is the loss of his soul next to mine \n     that has tilted my world askew. I've heard many stories from \n     many people about Bill, including his family, my family, his \n     friends, teachers, and others that loved him. I can't tell \n     them all but would like to share a few that I hope you will \n     enjoy.\n       Billy always seemed to be in a hurry. He didn't like \n     staying in one place he was always talking and moving. More \n     than once he came into our house and, as I was engrossed\n\n[[Page S4385]]\n\n     in a television program or movie, he would start asking me \n     questions. ``So, Mr. Moore,'' (he loved to begin his \n     sentences with the word ``so''), ``have you seen that show on \n     sharks yet?'' ``Mr. Moore, have I told you the story about my \n     buddy?'' He referred to most everyone, it seemed, as his \n     buddy. ``Mr. Moore, what do you think of the change in the \n     economy?'' ``Mr. Moore, I have a great business idea. What do \n     you think--Grilled Cheese, a restaurant where that's all we \n     serve. I'll let you in on it.'' And, invariably, he would \n     ask, ``So, Mr. Moore, how is work going for you?'' Now, that \n     isn't the type of question I typically get from a 20 year \n     old. But Bill was anything but typical.\n       Karen summed up Bill when she said, ``I guess what Billy \n     always gave most was his time. He always had time for you.'' \n     My son Mike said, ``Bill always did what you wanted rather \n     than what he wanted, and when you talked to him he asked \n     about you. He rarely spoke about himself.''\n       Mike went on to say, ``There is a great debate about which \n     I've studied in many of my philosophy and psychology classes, \n     whether altruism in humans really exists. While to this day \n     there is no definitive proof for or against, Billy's life, \n     and the way he lived it, makes one hell of a case in support \n     of its existence.''\n       A close friend, Matt McElroy, echoed this theme in a \n     beautiful letter he wrote to the Woitowicz family. I would \n     like to read a part of it to you:\n       Bill was instantly likeable and I think I know why. I \n     noticed it in a conversation I had with him around Christmas \n     this year. He called me at school to see how I was doing and \n     soon our conversation turned into him telling me how much he \n     admired me for studying to become a lawyer and working hard \n     towards a career. As Bill went on, I remember feeling \n     immediately rejuvenated and energized--It is an incredible \n     feeling to be admired like that! I tried to reciprocate the \n     praise as much as I could because I was just as proud of him \n     for working so hard to achieve excellence in his own \n     profession. After thinking about our conversation that day, I \n     reflected on past experiences with Bill and finally realized \n     why Bill connected with so many people. I remembered Bill \n     admiring the way I played basketball and asking for advice on \n     how to get better; I remembered at the gym he would tell me \n     how strong I was and saying he wanted to look like me. Even \n     though I had seen Bill do these things before, I wasn't \n     mature enough to realize his emotional genius, but now I \n     know. Bill's secret was his ability to identify your best \n     traits and tell you what they were. What an unbelievable \n     gift! And he did it in such a genuine and honest way--never \n     insincere. It is so rare to see that in anyone, let alone \n     someone that young.\n       When Karen read Matt's letter she said immediately, That \n     describes Rose, Joe. Rosie, it is from you that he received \n     this wonderful trait.\n       Bill never wanted attention. Even though he could get a \n     discount at some stores because he was military, he did not \n     use it. This past December, I listened as he spoke on the \n     phone to a store from which he had ordered three new suits. \n     He ordered them in plenty of time for Christmas and New \n     Years, the last time he could wear them before shipping out. \n     But a clerk made an error and Bill was told the suits would \n     not be there in time. He spoke patiently trying to find a way \n     to make it happen. I said to Bill, ``Tell them you are a \n     Marine and headed to Afghanistan.'' He would not. I told him \n     to give me the phone, I would to talk to them. He would not. \n     The suits did not make it; they have never been worn.\n       Bill did not care about money. When Chris and Matt \n     discussed who would pick up a dinner check, the conversation \n     turned to how some people never offer to pay. Bill replied, \n     ``People should not be so focused on money I like spending my \n     money on friends.'' When a close high school friend expressed \n     concern about how she was going to pay her college tuition, \n     he told her not to worry, he had plenty of money.\n       Chris, Matt, Mike, Matt McElroy, and a group of their \n     friends formed what they call the Power Group. They share \n     inspirational sayings and their own thoughts with each other. \n     Bill sent the following note to the group from Afghanistan.\n       hey chris, send this around to the power group if you think \n     it makes the cut-its short and sweet.\n       (1) perception is reality, no matter what you think\n       (2) word travels fast, so fast that what you say about \n     someone may travel faster than expected. and now your trying \n     to backtrack on what was said.\n       (3) life is short, even to usama life was probably too \n     short.\n       (4) if there's one thing i learned through this deployment \n     so far is that what's said can be taken back, but if you \n     don't take it back today, tomorrow may be too late.\n       (5) and finally, stressing over the small stuff only makes \n     things look fuzzy around the edges and the goal is harder to \n     accomplish.\n       anyways i thought i might contribute to the power group \n     because every day i strive to be looked at as a professional, \n     and more importantly be a professional.\n       eat your vegetables,\n       woita\n       Riding a dirt bike was Billy's first love. As a kid, he was \n     determined he was going to be a professional dirt bike rider. \n     He and Mike would often bomb up and down our driveway popping \n     wheelies. I would hear the whine of Bill's dirt bike in the \n     woods behind our house, it was the signal that Bill was \n     paying us a visit. Matt's laptop screen is a picture of Bill \n     popping a wheelie on a dirt bike in Afghanistan. Billy's \n     Sergeant, Danny Draher, told Kevin that they use dirt bikes \n     in Afghanistan to travel to remote areas. Each time he put \n     Bill out on point he'd just be gone, ahead of the pack, and \n     Sergeant Draher had to keep reeling him back in. He asked \n     Kevin where Bill learned to ride like that. Bill was a \n     natural. And, just like Bill, he was having fun no matter \n     where he was.\n       Bill loved to eat. Rose said that when he was an infant in \n     his crib, you could hear him from the other room making \n     sucking sounds, looking for food. She said he was that way \n     the rest of his life. He was eating steak at 10-months-old. \n     One of his favorite sayings was ``Eat big, get big.''\n       One of his greatest gifts was how he could build your self-\n     esteem. One night during dinner at our house he turned to \n     Drew and said, ``So, Drewman, are you going to play in the \n     NBA or the NFL?''\n       He was a people person. When Bill was home on leave you \n     would often find him in the Village chatting with people of \n     any age, asking them endless questions, never turning the \n     conversation to himself.\n       Kevin told me Bill loved hypotheticals. He would propose, \n     ``Dad, if we drove by a dirt bike laying along the side of \n     the road every day for three weeks and no one claimed it, \n     couldn't you just take it? That wouldn't be stealing would \n     it?'' Another example. Matt and Bill were having lunch \n     together and they struck up a conversation with the man at \n     the next table. He turned out to be the co-founder of Safety \n     Insurance and he told the boys that he had cashed out and now \n     lived his life helping others. He said he was a deacon at his \n     church. Bill, who could be skeptical of organized religion, \n     posed a hypothetical. ``So, let's say that I steal something \n     and die. I learned that it is a mortal sin and if I die \n     without confessing the sin I go to hell. But, another guy \n     commits murder. He confesses his sin before dying and he \n     doesn't go to hell. Explain to me how that is right?'' Kevin \n     and Chris would sometimes tease Billy about his \n     hypotheticals. ``So, Bill, if that house was sitting empty \n     for a year could we just move in?'' Bill would see the humor \n     and laugh along with them.\n       Bill was a prankster. As he grew physically strong through \n     his training, he loved to wrestle Matt, Chris, Mike, or Drew. \n     We would be sitting talking or watching TV and, unexpectedly, \n     he would jump up, grab one of them, and try to wrestle him to \n     the ground. All the while, laughing and taunting, ``Let's see \n     what you got.''\n       My daughter Jenny had gym class with Bill when she was a \n     freshman and he was a junior. They were playing dodge ball \n     and one of the boys hit her in the head at close range with a \n     ball, which made her teary eyed. Billy noticed, sought out \n     the perpetrator, took aim, and hit him square in the face. \n     Bill the White Knight had defended her honor.\n       When Billy was learning to read from a picture book, the \n     kind with one sentence per page, his dad said that any time \n     he made a mistake he would close the book, go back to the \n     beginning, and start over. If he made ten mistakes, that's \n     how many times he would start again. If anyone helped him \n     pronounce a word, he did the same. Of course, Chris enjoyed \n     tweaking his brother by helping him with a word even if he \n     didn't need it. Bill would yell, ``You're messing me up,'' \n     slam the cover shut, and start again.\n       Bill's Grandfather Labelle said, ``All I can say about him \n     as a child was that wherever he went he was on the run. That \n     kid never stopped moving.''\n       Kevin recounts another story. One hot summer afternoon when \n     Billy was around 13 years old, Kevin was taking the kids for \n     a drive. Just past the Village, Bill pushed a ballpoint pen \n     into the side of a hot can of Pepsi, and it sprayed everybody \n     and everything and made Bill roar with laughter. Kevin, \n     furious, pulled over and yelled at Billy to start walking. \n     Bill was laughing when got out of the car, unfazed by his \n     dad's punishment. But, after driving away, Amanda was crying \n     so hard for her brother, Kevin had to grudgingly go back to \n     pick him up. There stood Bill, with a big grin still on his \n     face, deciding whether he would get back in the car or not. \n     After he got in, they all laughed about Bill's antics and \n     being sticky with soda. They headed home to wash up.\n       On another occasion, when Bill was eight or nine, he was \n     shopping with his dad and as they were walking back to the \n     car there was a group of rowdy teenagers pushing and shoving \n     each other in the parking lot. As they got closer to the \n     teenagers, Kevin saw that they were watching them and it was \n     clear to him they were claiming the space between them and \n     their car. Kevin stopped and tried to move Billy to the \n     opposite side of him, away from the teens. As he tried, Billy \n     stopped, pushed back, and looked up at his dad and said in a \n     loud voice, ``Dad, you don't need to be afraid!'' While Kevin \n     thought he was protecting his son, Billy was looking out for \n     his dad. Kevin said he has never forgotten how fearless Bill \n     was.\n       Bill's Uncle Larry told me, ``If I had a dollar for every \n     time I heard Kevin yell, `Billy, don't!' I would be rich. \n     But, the amazing change in him from his childhood to \n     adulthood is beyond comprehension.'' His Uncle Al said that \n     even the growth in him from the time he started boot camp to \n     when he graduated from MARSOC was the difference between a \n     boy and a man.\n       We spend every Christmas Eve with the Woitowicz family. We \n     have shared our home\n\n[[Page S4386]]\n\n     with them and our good friends the Roccos, Hutchinsons, \n     MacDonalds, and Decoteaus for many years. My son Matt \n     describes it as the best night of the year. Karen goes all \n     out decorating our home, everyone brings food, and Mr. Rocco \n     makes his phenomenal Christmas punch. We all have some \n     wonderful Billy memories tied to this annual celebration of \n     our Lord's birthday and the friendship shared by our \n     families. On a few occasions, Billy partook a bit too much of \n     the Christmas punch and entertained us.\n       Typically, these events happen at the end of the evening, \n     in our kitchen, as everyone is preparing to leave. One year \n     Billy was telling a story, gesturing with his hands as he \n     tended to do, and accidentally knocked our sugar bowl off the \n     counter. It shattered as it hit the floor. We all looked at \n     him. The expression on his face was priceless, as was his \n     response. ``I really don't know how that happened!'' As we \n     all burst into laughter he bent down and started scraping the \n     sugar into his hands in an attempt to clean it up. He \n     apologized to ``Mrs. Moore'' for days after that.\n       One of the best Christmas Eve memories was the year he told \n     his parents he couldn't make it home. Matt gathered all of us \n     in the kitchen for the purpose of making a toast to Billy. As \n     we raised our glasses, Billy burst through the kitchen door, \n     shocking the rest of us--especially his parents. This time \n     the priceless expression was pasted on the faces of his \n     parents. They were frozen, not moving, not believing--as if \n     he were a vision. Billy the magician had made himself appear.\n       This past Christmas, our kids gave Kevin, Rose, Karen, and \n     me a gift of a cruise to Bermuda. It was Billy's idea, and he \n     was determined to do it for us. He took charge and, in his \n     larger-than-life way, gestured through telling us how we \n     married folk could use the time away and should enjoy some \n     rest and relaxation. Billy the marriage counselor was taking \n     care of us.\n       As in past years, at the end of the evening, around 1:00 \n     a.m., those remaining were in the kitchen saying good-bye. \n     Kevin and I had spent a good bit of time herding the boys up \n     from the basement toward the door. The kids had been joking \n     through the night about the song ``Teach Me How to Dougie,'' \n     which they thought was funny. I was teasing Billy that I was \n     going to show him how to Dougie but he kept pushing me back \n     saying he would show me. He started dancing and we all \n     laughed as he Dougied in his tipsy state. Finally, I was able \n     to move Billy toward the door, but he stopped abruptly, \n     turned away, and started toward the door. Just as abruptly, \n     he turned around, walked quickly toward me and shouted as he \n     pointed at my chest, ``Good day, sir. I said good day!'' He \n     turned again and walked out the door. We couldn't stop \n     laughing for a long time. We tell this story often.\n       We have all been struggling to make sense of the loss of \n     Billy. On the day we received the news, as Rose hugged me, \n     she asked, ``Oh, Joe what are we going to do?'' My good \n     friend Kevin and I sat and tried to make sense of it and he \n     said, ``I have always been able to fix things but I can't fix \n     this.'' Kevin's nickname at the fire station is MacGyver \n     because he really can fix almost anything, but, although we \n     wish so much he could, this is not fixable.\n       I can feel the pain of his brother and sister, Chris and \n     Mandy, and my kids, his other brothers and sister, Matt, \n     Mike, Jenny, and Drew. I see the hurt behind the eyes of my \n     good friends Jay, Peter, Ralph, and Mark, and many others \n     that were so close to Billy. I see the swollen eyes of his \n     young friends. And I feel the unbelief and numbness as I read \n     the letters, e-mail, and texts from those that loved him. \n     Karen and I cant stop crying. But most of all, I can barely \n     endure the grief I see in Kevin and Rose.\n       Casey Mahoney, the daughter of Brian and Kirsten Mahoney, \n     and friends of Billy's family wrote a beautiful poem for \n     Bill.\n     God bless Billy for all of his love,\n     God bless the loving father above,\n     God bless Billy's family and friends,\n     We all pray that war will end.\n       Oh, Bill Boy, where have you gone? Why did you leave us? \n     What answer do I give your mother if she asks me again, \n     ``What are we going to do now?'' And, Dear Lord our God, why \n     did you take our Billy away?\n       Maybe there is no answer, or at least not one we can \n     understand. Saint Thomas Aquinas wrote [paraphrased]. Above \n     all God destines us an end beyond the grasp of reason; \n     according to Isaiah, Our Eyes cannot see, O God, without your \n     help, what you have prepared for those that love you. Many \n     things are shown that are above the understanding of men.\n       As to your question, Rosie, I can only say that we will \n     endure through the love that we have for Bill, and he for us. \n     He is with you. He will be able to help you more now, where \n     he is, than when he was here. He loves his parents, he told \n     me that during one of our many conversations, and he wants \n     you to be happy. He respects you, Kevin. He will be with \n     you, Chris, when you move to Virginia. You know that he \n     will try to wrestle you to the ground, even from heaven. \n     He will guide your hand, Mandy, as you learn to become a \n     nurse like your mother. He is standing next to all of you \n     right now, right there, and he is looking at me saying, \n     ``Dont worry Mr. Moore, they will be okay. I will make \n     sure of it.''\n       To my last question, I received a reply in a dream the \n     other night. God said, ``Remember, Joe, he was my son too. \n     And, although I did not call him home--that was his choice--\n     my heart ached, as yours does now, when I released him to \n     Earth at his request to be with and guide Rose and Kevin, \n     Chris and Mandy, you and your family, and his many friends. \n     That was his mission, and like everything he does, he chose \n     it enthusiastically.''\n       As to where Billy has gone, I am certain I know that \n     answer. He is sitting next to God our Father. His arm is \n     around Bill and He has a look of great pride on His face. \n     Bill is bathed in the pure love and light of God the Holy \n     Spirit. And, he is chatting up his friend Jesus, asking him a \n     thousand questions. ``Are those gates really made of pearl, \n     or do they just say that?'' ``Can I ride my dirt bike here?'' \n     ``Yo, Jesus, would you introduce me to Mr. Moore's dad?'' \n     ``Do I get to eat here, and do you have grilled cheese?'' \n     ``Dude, have I told you the story about my friend?'' And, \n     invariably, ``How is your work going for you, Jesus?''\n       The Blessed Virgin Mother Mary is hugging him while smiling \n     and saying, ``Welcome back, Billy, I missed you. You have \n     always been one of my favorites.'' He is teaching the \n     Cherubim and Seraphim how to Dougie. He is receiving a salute \n     from the greatest military heroes of all time--there are rows \n     and rows of them, as far as you can see, and the Marines are \n     out in front, just as in battle. Chesty Puller, the great \n     Marine, is shaking Bill's hand and pinning the highest award \n     given in heaven to soldiers who sacrifice their lives for \n     others, the Wooden Cross of Jesus.\n       When Jesus introduces them, my dad says, ``Yes, Billy, I am \n     very proud of you.''\n       And, he is wrestling St. Peter to the ground.\n       He is reading a poem that he wants me to share with you \n     now.\n     Do not stand at my grave and weep,\n     I am not there, I do not sleep.\n     I am in a thousand winds that blow,\n     I am the softly falling snow.\n     I am the gentle shower of rain,\n     I am the field of ripening grain.\n     I am the morning hush,\n     I am the graceful rush,\n     Of beautiful birds in circling flight,\n     I am the star shine of the night.\n     I am in the flowers that bloom,\n     I am in a quiet room.\n     I am in the birds that sing,\n     I am in each lovely thing.\n     Do not stand at my grave and cry,\n     I am not there, I do not die.\n       He is whispering in my ear, ``Don't worry Mr. Moore. \n     Everything will be okay.''\n       I know it will, Bill. Eventually. But, before you go, there \n     is something you need to hear. And this time, please listen \n     carefully.\n       Your mom wanted me to tell you, ``I want you to know that \n     as soon as I could pull myself together, I had our family say \n     a prayer of gratitude to you because underneath my deep grief \n     is the tremendous joy of loving you for 23 years.''\n       I love you too, Billy, and I promise never to forget how \n     much you've meant to me.\n       Semper Fi [salute my friend]\n       ``Good day, sir.

CAPT Matthew Gunnar Nielson of Jefferson, IA, gave his life \nfor his country on June 29, 2011, during an attack by insurgents in \nBadrah, Iraq. He was 27 years old. My prayers are with Captain \nNielson's parents, Roger and Christine, and all his family and friends \nwho are feeling his loss.\n  In a statement, his family said, ``Since Matt was a small boy he \nloved anything military, so he died doing what he loved best.

He's already home, and we \nknow we'll be together again someday. Apart, but forever in our hearts. \nPsalms 11.'' What can I say about such selfless service and sacrifice? \nWe just celebrated 235 years of independence and liberty, which is an \noccasion to reflect on the incalculable debt we owe to Matt and his \ncomrades in arms over the years who have secured that legacy for us and \nfor posterity.

Mr. President, today I want to take a few minutes to offer \nspecial congratulations to Joseph ``Joe'' Bykowski, an extraordinary \nyoung man who has served Massachusetts and the United States in \nremarkable ways.\n  After returning home from service in the Iraq war, Joe wanted to give \nsomething back to his fellow veterans. So since 2007 he has interned in \nmy Boston office for 4 days a week, working with\n\n[[Page S4387]]\n\nmy senior staff on behalf of active servicemembers, veterans and their \nfamilies. He is also an active member of the American Legion and the \nCatholic War Veterans Organization, where he volunteers in assisting \nwounded veterans and their families. And as if that is not enough, all \nthe while he has also been working toward an undergraduate degree at \nUMass Boston.\n  This spring, Joe completed his degree's requirements. During the \nuniversity's commencement ceremony, UMass Boston Chancellor J. Keith \nMotley cited Joe as an inspiration to all his classmates. ``Joseph \nBykowski served our country for eight years, from Ground Zero, to Iraq, \nbefore he joined us to major in history and political science,'' \nChancellor Motley said. ``He is a leader in veterans' affairs on campus \nand at the State House, where he's testified before the legislature, \ninterned for Senator John Kerry, and helped found the nation's first \nprogram dedicated to our veterans' mental health. Joe has overcome \ntremendous personal obstacles to get where he is, and he lifts others \nup with him.''\n  I couldn't agree more. I have known Joe for 5 years, and I have been \nimpressed all along by his dedication to public service and his \ndevotion to his fellow veterans. It was Joe's idea to organize a \n``Welcome Home Cruise'' to honor wounded Massachusetts vets who had \njust returned home from Iraq and Afghanistan. Joe worked with my office \nand leveraged his ties to Massachusetts Vets organizations, working \ntogether to invite hundreds of vets and their families to join us for \nan evening on the water in Boston. I was honored to have the chance to \npresent several of our wounded heroes with Purple Hearts on that boat--\na memory I treasure, and one I don't think would have been possible \nwithout Joe's creativity and initiative.\n  Joe is still reaching out to veterans. Just this month, Joe helped us \narrange an honorary GED for Vietnam veteran Ron Estrella, a longtime \npatient at the Brockton VA spinal care unit who was diagnosed with \nterminal cancer. To earn the GED, Ron worked with UMass-Boston's Upward \nBound, a program that helps students finish high school--no surprise, \nit is just one more program where Joe himself is an active leader and \nmember.\n  President Kennedy once said that ``the highest appreciation is not to \nutter words, but to live by them.'' He would have recognized that \nquality in Joe Bykowski. Joe has lived--and continues to live--a life \ndevoted to service to country, in many forms. Whether he's serving on \nthe other side of the world on the frontlines in Iraq, or down the \nstreet at the New England Center for Homeless Veterans serving a \nspaghetti dinner, there's one constant: Joe lives for service.\n  I have no doubt that he will put his UMass-Boston degree to the same \ngreat use.\n  I congratulate Joe Bykowski on his graduation, thank him for his \nservice these last years in my office, and salute all that he's \naccomplished. We can't wait to see what he does next.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/06/senate-section/article/S4387-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4387-S4388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL E. LEITER\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Michael \nLeiter, the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center and a good \nfriend of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. This is Mike's \nlast week and I want to thank him for his service and wish him the very \nbest in the next steps in his career.\n  Director Leiter has been at the National Counterterrorism Center, or \nNCTC, for most of its existence. He was the principal deputy director \nfrom February 2007 to November of that year when he became the acting \ndirector. President Bush nominated him to be the Director on March 31, \n2008, and he was confirmed by the Senate on June 10, 2008.\n  Mike has served in both the Bush and Obama administrations which \nspeaks to his bipartisan and professional approach to the Nation's \nsecurity, and the support that he has earned from the Congress and \nwithin the executive branch.\n  His leadership at the NCTC has brought stability and continuity to \nour Nation's counterterrorism efforts, and he should take pride in the \nfact that under his tenure, there have been no successful attacks \nagainst the United States homeland by foreign terrorists. In this \nthreat environment, that is an impressive accomplishment indeed.\n  As is often the nature of the intelligence business, much of the \nsuccesses of the National Counterterrorism Center go unrecognized. \nTerrorists plotting and carrying out attacks are captured through good \nintelligence and law enforcement work, and through strong cooperation \nwith allies and partners around the world. Often, terrorist plots fail \nto proceed because of the barriers to recruit, travel, raise funds, get \ntraining, or gain access to destructive materials that have been \nerected through the efforts of the United States and other nations.\n  Even in counterterrorism victories that become known, such as the \ncases of Najibullah Zazi in the United States or the identification of \nUsama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, the National Counterterrorism \nCenter's important--sometimes absolutely critical role--is often not \nwell known.\n  So I am pleased today to be able to recognize Mike Leiter for his \nwork in keeping our Nation safe for the past 4\\1/2\\ years.\n  As a member, and now as chair of the Intelligence Committee, I have \ncome to rely on Mike's analysis and judgment. He has been willing to \nadmit that at times our counterterrorism policies or practices haven't \nbeen what they should be.\n  He has appeared regularly before the committee and has been very \naccessible for the committee's staff as well. In addition to the \nregularly scheduled meetings we hold, I have received secure calls from \nMike often, apprising me on new threats and the status of \ninvestigations. He is, without fail, available to provide updates and \nassessments, and I appreciate the importance he has placed on keeping \nthe committee, and me personally, fully informed.\n  Director Leiter has also worked tirelessly to achieve the goals set \nout for the National Counterterrorism Center in the Intelligence Reform \nand Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The NCTC was established to bring \ntogether information and officers from across the intelligence \ncommunity and from other parts of the government involved in the \nspectrum of counterterrorism, including counter-radicalization, \ndetection, and prevention of attacks.\n  Even after the experiences of 9/11 and the findings of the 9/11 \nCommission, it was a difficult and enormously frustrating challenge to \ntruly integrate the Nation's counterterrorism efforts. It speaks to \nDirector Leiter's energy and dedication that he was, eventually, able \nto bring together analysts from the Central Intelligence Agency, the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the \nNational Security Agency, the Department of Homeland Security, and \nmilitary services to share the threat streams that each one collected \nand assessed.\n  The result has been the ability to better connect the intelligence \ninformation that points to suspicious activity, to develop the case \nwhen a terrorist or a terror plot is identified, and to take \ncoordinated action to disrupt that plot.\n  The NCTC now produces, on a daily basis, its own counterterrorism \nanalysis that provides Intelligence Community-wide assessments and \nwarning. Analysts at the NCTC are among the finest we have, and \nDirector Leiter has fostered a productive environment through \nanalytical roundtables and weekly forums in which analysts share \ninformation, provide briefings, and develop improved analytic \ntradecraft.\n  In fact, I recently learned that as the CIA was developing its \nassessment that Usama bin Laden was in the Abbottabad compound, it \nturned to NCTC analysts to ``red-team'' the intelligence case and give \ntheir assessments. And Director Leiter was involved in the briefings \nand discussions with the President that led to the decision to carry \nout the operation.\n  Director Leiter has demonstrated leadership in hard times, as well. \nAfter the failed terrorist attack on a Detroit-bound airliner on \nDecember 25, 2009, investigations uncovered significant failures and \nshortcomings in our counterterrorism efforts. The Senate Intelligence \nCommittee's review found 14 specific ``points of failure'' across the \ngovernment that enabled Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab to come so close to \ncarrying out a major attack.\n\n[[Page S4388]]\n\n  While several of our conclusions and recommendations fell to other \nagencies, Director Leiter moved quickly to implement the changes that \nwe and others suggested. Since early 2010, the NCTC has vastly improved \nits methods for screening counterterrorism data and watchlisting \nindividuals who pose a threat to our Nation.\n  In response to the finding that no agency in the government was \nensuring that all terrorist leads were pursued, Mike implemented \n``Pursuit Groups'' at NCTC, teams of highly skilled analysts who sift \nthrough massive amounts of data to identify disparate pieces of \nintelligence and find linkages that identify terrorists, their plans, \nand their networks before they reach the point of plot execution.\n  In addition to his service at the National Counterterrorism Center, \nMr. Leiter helped establish the Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence as its deputy chief of staff, having previously served as \nthe deputy general counsel and assistant director of the very well-\nregarded WMD Commission led by Senator Chuck Robb and Judge Laurence \nSilberman.\n  From 2002 to 2005, he was an assistant U.S. attorney in the Eastern \nDistrict of Virginia, one of the most active jurisdictions for national \nsecurity cases. He clerked for Justice Stephen Breyer and for Chief \nJudge Michael Boudin of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First \nCircuit.\n  Most people do not know that Mike was also a naval aviator, flying \nEA-6B Prowlers with action in operations in the former Yugoslavia and \nin Iraq.\n  In short, he has served the Nation in a wide variety of capacities \nover the past 20 years\n  I thank Mike for his exemplary service in keeping this Nation safe \nand for his very positive relationship with the Intelligence Committee \nas we have carried out our oversight duties.\n  I expect that this will not be Mike's last service to the Nation, and \nI wish him all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/06/senate-section/article/S4388-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              REMEMBERING SECOND LIEUTENANT ROBERT EMERSON\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor 2LT Robert S. \nEmerson who is coming home to Maine more than 60 years after he served \nhis country during World War II. Lieutenant Emerson perished when the \nB-24 aircraft he was flying in crashed in the Philippines on April 3, \n1945.\n  His body was recovered in 1947, and he was buried in Leyte, \nPhilippines. In 1949, his remains were moved from his resting place in \nthe Philippines to Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery in St. Louis, \nMO. In 2008, his remains were exhumed and transferred to the \njurisdiction of the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command in Hawaii, \nbringing him one step and thousands of miles closer to his home State \nof Maine. Thanks to the persistent efforts of the relatives of \nLieutenant Emerson's family and the other airmen that served with him \non his B-24, the Department of Defense was able to guarantee the return \nhome of this fallen service member.\n  Lieutenant Emerson's long and remarkable journey home is finally \ncoming to an end. On Saturday, July 9, 2011, he will finally be brought \nto home, to rest alongside his mother and father in Norway, ME. After \nmore than 66 years since he first left home, it is a privilege to \nwelcome home, and honor, a fallen warrior who gave his life in World \nWar II in defense of our Nation.\n  While no words of mine can console the grief that Lieutenant \nEmerson's family has felt for too long, I know Mainers and the American \npeople are profoundly grateful for his service. Like so many throughout \nour history, Lieutenant Emerson left the comfort and safety of home to \nanswer the call of duty to our country. He is now among that valiant \nlegion that has journeyed through the darkest valley to a place of \nquiet waters and now able to rest at home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/06/senate-section/article/S4388-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4388-S4389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         CATOCTIN MOUNTAIN PARK\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this year marks the 75th \nanniversary of Catoctin Mountain Park, one of Maryland's most \nspectacular national parks. Located in northern Frederick County in \nwestern Maryland, Catoctin, MD, is a popular wilderness refuge just a \nfew hours away from the bustling urban centers of Baltimore and \nWashington, DC. People of all walks of life visit Catoctin Mountain, \nwhether it is working Maryland and Pennsylvania families taking a \nweekend camping trip to Misty Mount or U.S. Presidents taking a weekend \nretreat to Camp David to work or relax without the distractions of \nWashington. I am proud to celebrate the diamond anniversary of this \nwonderful natural treasure in my home State.\n  Catoctin Mountain Park is 5,810 acres of wilderness in the foothills \nof Maryland's Blue Ridge Mountains. The name Catoctin is what the \nAlgonquians, the predominant Native American tribe of the Mid-Atlantic \nregion prior to European settlement, called the region where Catoctin \nMountain Park is located. The Algonquians were known to use rhyolite \nrocks found throughout the rocky terrain for spearheads and European \nsettlers and Algonquians alike would fish for trout in mountain streams \nthat also supplied water for early agricultural settlements in the \nvalleys around the mountain.\n  The growth of the settler population in Maryland during colonialism \nand postrevolutionary America, gave rise to agriculture and industry in \nwestern Maryland. The growing industrial age changed the ecological and \nsocial condition of the wilderness of the eastern United States and \nwestern Maryland was no exception. Logging activities for ship and \nstructural building, iron ore extraction and the arrival of the Western \nMaryland Railroad drastically changed the culture and natural state of \nCatoctin.\n  The Great Depression of the 1930s slowed economic progress and \nthwarted industrial growth across the country. The extractive \nindustries of the Mid-Atlantic suffered greatly. The Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt's New Deal ushered in sweeping public works programs to help \nget Americans back to work building America's infrastructure and \nrenewing the stewardship of our Nation's great resources. Catoctin \nMountain Park is a testament to the success of the New Deal's Works \nProgress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps.\n  In May of 1933 the Federal Emergency Relief Administration was \nappropriated $300,000,000 to be spent on public works projects designed \nto provide work for struggling Americans. In 1934 a land planning \ncommittee established under the Federal Emergency Relief Act was \nexamining how to put fallow land to better use. Conrad L. Wirth, \nAssistant Director to the Chief Branch of Planning of the National Park \nService served on the land planning committee. Based on the findings in \na 1928 report of the Joint Committee on Recreational Survey of Federal \nLands, Wirth decided one of the answers to the report's ``urgent need'' \nto ``provide quality outdoor recreation facilities at the lowest cost \nfor the benefit of people of lower and middle incomes'' on natural \nareas near urban areas was to establish a recreational area in western \nMaryland proximate to Baltimore and Washington.\n  By 1934, years of agricultural, logging and resource extraction \nactivities had taken its toll on the economic value of the land \ncomprising Catoctin. With $25 million transferred to Public Works \nAdministration the Department of the Interior was able to purchase the \n``sub-marginal'' lands that now make up Catoctin Mountain Park. \nCatoctin was officially placed into the program in January of 1935 and \nwithin a year and a half, and hundreds of man hours of work, Catoctin \nRecreational Demonstration Area was officially opened on August 8, \n1936.\n  In the years immediately following Catoctin's official placement \nunder the National Park Service's jurisdiction, The Works Progress \nAdministration and Civilian Conservation Corps provided work for \nhundreds of men looking to learn a trade, earn a wage and develop \nleadership skills. These programs are responsible for providing some of \nthe base training these men needed before going off to fight in World \nWar II. The programs themselves reforested the park and restored its \nnatural beauty. The CCC planted thousands of Maples, Pine and Oak trees \nin the park. The CCC also helped restore mountain streams and create \nsuitable habitat for native fish and wildlife to\n\n[[Page S4389]]\n\nreturn to the mountain. These hardworking men also built many park \nstructures still in use today including the Blue Blazes Contact Station \nwhich is now the Catoctin Mountain Park Visitor Center, Camp Round \nMeadow and Camp Misty Mount.\n  The legacy of the hard work of these Depression-era CCC and PWA \nworkers lives on today and will continue to be enjoyed for years to \ncome.\n  President Roosevelt personally experienced the success of the CCC and \nWPA at Catoctin on many occasions. This is because one major component \nof the Works Progress Administration's at Catoctin was to build Hi-\nCatoctin camp for Federal Government agents, now known as Camp David.\n  FDR hosted Winston Churchill at Catoctin in May of 1943 and every \nPresident since FDR has made use of Camp David. Perhaps most famously \nis President Jimmy Carter who brought Egyptian President Anwar Sadat \nand Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to Camp David where he \nbrokered the Camp David Peace Accords in September of 1978. But many \nPresidents and their families go to Camp David, for the same reason \neveryone else does, to simply enjoy the spectacular outdoor \nrecreational opportunities the park has to offer.\n  More than 80,000 visitors a year come to Catoctin Mountain Park to \nexperience the park's extensive trail system, scenic vistas, and \nterrific camping opportunities. When hiking around Chimney Rock or the \nold Whiskey Still or Sawmill it is not uncommon for visitors to see \nwhite tail deer, wild turkey, coyotes, dozens of species of songbirds \nor even the occasional black bear.\n  With further dwindling resources for the National Park Service it has \nbecome increasing challenging for the NPS to manage the park resources. \nInvasive species like the emerald ashe bore threaten the health of the \npark's forest and the sustainability of park habitat for the wildlife \nthat make the park so popular. It is essential that Congress and the \nFederal Government recognize the importance of preserving these natural \nresources. That is why I have been a staunch champion for robustly \nfunding the National Park Service because I believe the treasures the \nNPS work to protect for the public's enjoyment and enrichment is \ninvaluable and it is the responsibility of the Federal government to do \nthis work.\n  Despite tough fiscal times, the leadership at Catoctin Mountain Park \nis doing an outstanding job providing fun and educational activities \nfor park visitors and have put together a wide range of special \nprograms and activities to celebrate the park's 75 anniversary.\n  I congratulate Catoctin Mountain Park and the National Park Service \nfor 75 wonderful years and encourage my colleagues to take a trip to \nexperience this wonderful located in the backyard of your home away \nfrom home just outside of Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/06/senate-section/article/S4389-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CONGRATULATING SISTERS OF THE PRESENTATION\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, with great honor, \nI congratulate the Aberdeen congregation of the Sisters of the \nPresentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary who are in the process of \ncelebrating their 125 years of service.\n  Founded on December 25, 1775 by Nano Nagle in Cork, Ireland, with the \nmission to educate poor children and minister to the sick, the Sisters \nof the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary retain a strong \ndedication to their founding principle of providing for people's unmet \nneeds. Arriving in the Dakota Territory from Dublin, Ireland, in 1880, \nthe Sisters of the Presentation endured the hardship of isolation and \nharsh weather to teach the children of the early settlers of South \nDakota.\n  Teaching and healing remain the foundation of the work performed by \nthe Presentation Sisters. Today the sisters have expanded their work \ninto less traditional forms. From teaching the young to counseling \nindividuals in spiritual growth, the services provided by the Sisters \nhave grown steadily outside the classroom to provide deeper healing. \nAssisting in such healing has also led the Sisters to become involved \nin a wide range of activities-from walking alongside those with HIV to \nfacilitating healing and counsel to individuals after traumatic life \nevents. In addition, the Sisters continue to sponsor Presentation \nCollege and Avera Health, along with having sisters actively engaged in \nthose ministries.\n  While recognizing the need to adapt to the changing needs of those \nthey serve, the common thread that binds all the work the Sisters \nperform is their steadfast adherence to their apostolic tradition of \njoyfully going where the calls of need ring out most loudly.

Mr. President, today I wish to \nrecognize the community of Strandburg, SD, on reaching the 125th \nanniversary of its founding. Strandburg is a community that embodies \nthe spirit of hospitality, beauty, and an exceptional quality of life \nthat is well known in South Dakota. The people of Strandburg celebrated \nthis momentous occasion on the weekend of July 2-3.\n  The city of Strandburg was settled in 1886 and named after the town's \nfirst homesteader John Strandburg. John was the man that applied for a \npost office to be opened in Strandburg, and served as the first \npostmaster. With the help of the railroad, Strandburg soon prospered \nand grew like many South Dakota towns of the time.\n  Today, Strandburg has come a long way from its beginning days. The \ntown is currently working on developing the old town gymnasium to a new \ncommunity center as an effort to bring the community closer. The \nbeautiful and historic Swedish Lutheran Church still stands today and \nis known as the Tabor Lutheran Church, and was, recognized on the \nNational Register of Historic Places in 1978.\n  Residents of Strandburg plan to commemorate the anniversary with many \ncommunity events including a craft show, wagon train, and parade. On \nSunday the community will come together in the historic Tabor Lutheran \nChurch for a service to conclude the celebration.\n  South Dakota's small communities are the bedrock of our economy and \nvital to the future of our state. Towns like Strandburg and its \ncitizens truly know what it means to be South Dakotan, and I am proud \nto honor Strandburg on this historic milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/06/senate-section/article/S4389-3", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4389-S4390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING CHARLOTTE BLOOMBERG\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, most New Yorkers knew Charlotte \nBloomberg as Mayor Michael Bloomberg's spirited, independent mother \nwhose example shined through in her son.\n  But for us in Massachusetts, Mrs. Bloomberg was a presence and a \nfixture in a city where neighborhood ties run deep--Medford. There she \nwas known and loved as a schoolteacher, a community icon, and a beloved \nand caring friend.\n  Mrs. Bloomberg passed away at her home in Medford, in the same house \nthat she turned into a home with her husband and children. In his \nfarewell, Mayor Bloomberg remembered his mother for her ``constant \nlove.'' In Medford, Mrs. Bloomberg's generosity in sharing caring and \ncompassion was well known. Charlotte Bloomberg showered attention on \nher neighbors and friends, and her modesty, her grace, and unflagging \nenergy was infectious. She was a fixture at the Temple Shalom, which \nthe Bloombergs founded and where she served as copresident well into \nher eighties. Neighbors remember that they could always count on Mrs. \nBloomberg to be one of the first people to arrive for Friday services \nbecause she wanted the chance to say hello to everyone, especially the \nchildren.\n\n[[Page S4390]]\n\n  She was an energetic campaign volunteer--even in her midnineties, she \nwas frequently out on the campaign trail, telling anyone who would \nlisten why her son was the best choice for mayor. And when she couldn't \nbe there physically, she was still present because she was tightly \nweaved into her son's life and as a result his political speeches. Her \nvalues were instilled in her children--hard work, intellectual \ncuriosity, and ambition. These were values Charlotte Bloomberg lived \nday-in and day-out. She graduated high school at 16 and went to New \nYork University. She raised two great children--Michael and Marjorie \nTiven. And when her husband died while Michael was in college, \nCharlotte forged forward and became the family breadwinner. Mayor \nBloomberg later wrote, above all his mother was a woman who lived \naccording to the belief that ``we've got to take care of each other.'' \nThat is a lesson we should all hold close.\n  Mr. President, if there is an example we can all learn from the life \nof Charlotte Bloomberg, it is that we can always do more for our \ncommunity, our State, and our country. So today we join the Bloomberg \nfamily in mourning the passing of Charlotte Bloomberg, but we also join \nto rejoice in the blessings she shared with everyone who knew her and \nthe indomitable spirit her friends won't ever forget--a spirit that is \nthe very best of Medford, MA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/06/senate-section/article/S4390-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JACLYN LICHT\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, student activism has always been at \nthe forefront of every step forward we have taken as a country and as a \nsociety. It was true for my generation in the civil rights movement, \nthe women's movement, and the effort to end the Vietnam war. In recent \nyears it was students--young people--who put issues like AIDS in Africa \nand global poverty front and center on the Nation's agenda when few \nothers showed much interest in the fight.\n  Today I would like to recognize the special efforts of a student \nactivist in my State--Jaclyn Licht, a young woman carving out time from \nher studies to raise awareness about the brutal tactics of the Lord's \nResistance Army, LRA, in east and central Africa. Right now Jaclyn is \nlobbying to maintain the integrity and funding for the landmark LRA \ndisarmament bill that passed in the 111th Congress. And she recently \npenned an insightful article about the important role that all citizens \nplay in promoting democracy and peace throughout the world. Jaclyn's \narticle appeared in ``The Vanguard,'' the student newspaper of \nBuckingham Browne & Nichols Upper School in Cambridge, MA. She writes \nconvincingly about the right of Americans to petition their government \nand urges her fellow Americans not to waste that right, especially \ngiven the uncertain fate of the LRA disarmament bill. Jaclyn reminds us \nthat ``students . . . have the greatest ability to take advantage of \nthis right'' and urges activism on the part of her classmates.\n  Along with representatives from the group Resolve, Jaclyn recently \nmet with staff in my Boston office to discuss how important this \nlegislation is for the people of east and central Africa. She also \nshared her views about America's role in protecting the people most \nvulnerable to the brutalities of the LRA.\n  For Jaclyn, of course, activism is in her DNA--an inheritance from \ntwo parents who have always made the cause of justice their concern. \nBut Jaclyn is already writing her own chapter in that family history of \nurging change.\n  Mr. President, I am submitting the text of Jaclyn's article to the \nRecord as an example to all of us.\n  The information follows.\n\n                   [From The Vanguard, June 9, 2011]\n\n        Student Activists Lobby To Protect LRA Disarmament Bill\n\n                           (By Jaclyn Licht)\n\n       In the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, \n     citizens are guaranteed the right to free speech, including \n     the right to ``petition the government for a redress of \n     grievances.'' Though many students may easily overlook the \n     meaning of these words, it is students, in fact, who have the \n     greatest ability to take advantage of this right.\n       In early April, I received an email from Resolve, an \n     organization dedicated to raising awareness about the terror \n     of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in Central and East \n     Africa. The email outlined a nationwide lobbying campaign \n     taking place throughout the month and offered an opportunity \n     for Massachusetts residents to attend a meeting with a staff \n     member at the office of Senator John Kerry. Last year, \n     President Obama signed into law the LRA Disarmament and \n     Northern Uganda Recovery Act, a bill unanimously passed by \n     Congress that ensures the United States will aid in \n     dismantling the rebel group and protect affected civilians. \n     Though this bill only requires less than .002 percent of our \n     national budget, economic challenges have brought about risks \n     of foreign aid budget cuts and the possibility of losing the \n     bill's budget completely. Therefore, Americans throughout the \n     country attended lobby meetings with their local government \n     representatives in order to guarantee that the LRA \n     Disarmament Act budget will remain intact.\n       The meeting was led by a student from Worcester Polytechnic \n     Institute, and the group of ten comprised Resolve supporters \n     who were mainly high school or college students. We were \n     greeted warmly by Senator Kerry's representative at his \n     Boston office. After taking our seats around a large table in \n     a spacious conference room, we commenced our discussion. The \n     discussion lasted for almost 30 minutes, longer than we had \n     anticipated. Each of the group members outlined the current \n     issues posed by the LRA and proceeded to explain the need for \n     our government representatives to support these efforts as \n     well. As Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, \n     Senator Kerry could hold much influence in this area of \n     concern. The staff member nodded his head vigorously \n     throughout our discussion, frequently asking questions about \n     the situation in central Africa and about Resolve. He \n     explained that Senator Kerry and his staff were already \n     familiar with the deadly situation in countries such as \n     Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and South \n     Sudan. He assured us that the Senator was very concerned \n     about the situation in the region, as well, and even outlined \n     useful tips to help us carry out additional meetings with \n     other government officials. After outlining the key \n     information we hoped would be passed on to Senator Kerry, we \n     prepared to depart and began to thank him for his time. \n     However, the senator's representative interrupted us and \n     asked us each how we became involved in Resolve's efforts. \n     Our reasons for becoming involved varied, but each one shared \n     a similar message: that we could not allow such violence by \n     this African rebel group go unnoticed.\n       The dedicated interest of the government officials in our \n     concern for this issue reflects not only the overwhelming \n     number of opportunities available in this democratic country, \n     but also the true power of student activism in particular. \n     Throughout this country, students frequently raise awareness \n     for issues of local or global concern often only in their own \n     communities. While it is absolutely crucial to rally whole \n     communities around the cause, the opportunity to lobby \n     government officials or their staff directly is widely \n     overlooked. While citizens of several countries around the \n     world are prohibited from such petitioning, this country and \n     its officials welcome the opinions of those they are \n     representing. Moreover, American students must not hesitate \n     to contact their government leaders to express concern for \n     any issue. Throughout the United States' history, young \n     adults have instilled many lasting changes in the country \n     through many modes of activism. Therefore, government \n     officials take much interest in meeting with student \n     lobbyists, for it grants them the ability to learn and hear \n     firsthand from an influential segment of the population. \n     Moreover, students have the ability to take action \n     immediately through direct contact with government officials \n     to advocate for changes that will shape the history of our \n     country and our world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/06/senate-section/article/S4390-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4390-S4391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ALAN MACDONALD\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we are lucky in Massachusetts to \nhave men and women who--at the community level--give of themselves to \nmake lasting contributions to our quality of life, our neighborhoods, \nand our economic footing. I have always thought it was no coincidence \nthat when DeTocqueville came to America to study the country's \n``character,'' he spent much of his time in Massachusetts and reflected \nthere that ``America is great because Americans are good.''\n  DeTocqueville would find much of that character still abides in Alan \nMacdonald, executive director of the Massachusetts Business Roundtable, \nwhose life has been defined by good old fashioned civic leadership--for \n23 years a driving force making Massachusetts a better place to live, \nto work and to raise a family.\n  Today, as Alan prepares for a much-deserved retirement, I thank him \nfor everything he has done for our State.\n  Throughout 23 years at the helm of the Massachusetts Business \nRoundtable, Alan brought together the policymakers, industries and \neducators who make Massachusetts the center of economic growth, \neducational excellence and health care innovation it is today. The \nMassachusetts Business Roundtable set a laser focus on\n\n[[Page S4391]]\n\nstrengthening our State's long-term economic health. Alan himself \noversaw the creation of task forces on health care, on education and \nworkforce development, on transportation and infrastructure and \ncorporate social responsibility.\n  The results are clear for all to see. Massachusetts is creating jobs \nfaster than almost every other State, our economy is expanding at twice \nthe national growth rate, and our students are outperforming their \npeers around the country. Now, there are a lot of people to thank for \nthat, and many who have played a part in the success of our State--but \none of them is very definitely Alan Macdonald. Thanks in part to the \nstrategic thinking under Alan's leadership, Massachusetts became the \nmodel for health care reforms that expand coverage and lower costs. It \nis one of the reasons that a well-educated work force is our State's \ncalling card in the global economy. And it is one of the reasons our \nState has a competitive edge in building a 21st century infrastructure \nand developing clean energy. Thank you, Alan.\n  Alan's retirement gives him more time to spend with his wife Jane, \nmore time with his two sons, Alan and Daniel and their families, and \nmore time with his four grandchildren. And I think we can all agree \nthat he has earned the extra time for his other great passions--\nbaseball and golf.\n  But fortunately, the Massachusetts Business Roundtable has made Alan \nits president emeritus. So as the roundtable navigates the coming \nchallenges, it is comforting to know that Alan Macdonald won't be far \naway.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/06/senate-section/article/S4391-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING MORNING GLORY NATURAL FOODS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, our economy relies on small \nbusinesses, particularly small, family-owned firms that have been in \noperation for generation after generation. One such small business, \nMorning Glory Natural Foods in Brunswick, will be celebrating its ``30 \nYears on Maine Street'' on July 15, complete with festivities for the \nwhole community. Today I wish to commend Morning Glory Natural Foods \nfor its remarkable achievement.\n  Morning Glory Natural Foods opened its doors in May of 1981, proudly \nserving the mid-coast community of Brunswick with fresh, local, and \norganic products--from delicious local produce to organic cotton \nclothing, and everything in between. Since then, the firm has grown to \nincorporate dozens of other Maine-made products in its catalogue of \ngoods that truly exemplify the virtues of a local economic leader.\n  Like so many small Maine businesses, Morning Glory is rooted in \nfamily tradition. The Tarpinian family has continually operated the \nstore since its opening 30 years ago. It is particularly pleasing to \nacknowledge the successes of small, family-owned businesses, because \nthese companies help maintain the strong, community-oriented character \nof Main Street America. And certainly Brunswick's Maine Street is a \nshining example of this uniquely American proposition.\n  The long-term success and longevity of Morning Glory Natural Foods \nand the Tarpinian family is a byproduct of the strong work ethic, \ncustomer service, and decision to sell quality, local products at \naffordable prices. Indeed, this business serves the local community on \ntwo levels: by providing fresh, environmentally responsible products to \nMaine citizens, while also supporting other local businesses by \nelecting to sell their products. Morning Glory Natural Foods and the \nTarpinians are a true testament to the rewards of hard work and \nperseverance.\n  On Friday, July 15, Morning Glory Natural Foods will be holding a \ncelebration of ``30 Years on Maine Street,'' a storewide celebration \nbeing held at their location in the middle of Brunswick. Events include \nfree food and drink, raffles, and sampling throughout the day, a way to \nsay thanks to the community and the store's loyal customers. Morning \nGlory also plans to have an abundance of local food vendors and farmers \nlining the street, another wonderful way to promote and encourage \ngrowth in the local economy.\n  Small businesses like Morning Glory Natural Foods are the heart and \nsoul of our Nation's communities. Main Streets across America are chock \nfull of restaurants, grocery stores, and shopping boutiques which \nprovide citizens with the goods and wares they need in a friendly and \nconvenient location and deserve our recognition. Indeed, Morning Glory \nNatural Foods is a prime example of a small business that has \npersevered through a turbulent economy time and again, and has come out \non top each time. I congratulate everyone at Morning Glory for this \nincredible milestone and wish them many more years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/06/senate-section/article/S4391-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4391-S4392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING ROGER WILLIAMS\n\n Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today I wish to reflect on a \nrecent article on one of the most influential heroes from the earliest \ndays of our Nation's history: Roger Williams of Rhode Island.\n  Roger Williams' legacy is well known in my home State of Rhode \nIsland--the State he helped found after being banished from \nMassachusetts for his beliefs about religious tolerance.\n  Roger Williams argued that religious beliefs should be kept separate \nfrom government policies and that government should not impose a \nspecific set of religious beliefs on its citizens. The separation of \nchurch and state is widely embraced today, both in the United States \nand in many countries around the world. But in the 1600s, this was a \nscandalous idea. The Puritans who colonized the Massachusetts Bay \nColony fled England because of religious persecution, but they had no \nintention of allowing religious freedom in the new colonies. Rather, \nthey established the Massachusetts Bay colony as a theocracy that \nenforced adherence to their particular religious beliefs with the \ngallows and the lash.\n  Roger Williams rejected this framework, and was forced to flee \nMassachusetts. Upon arriving at the northwestern shore of Narragansett \nBay in 1636, he negotiated an agreement with the Narragansett Indians \nto establish a new colony on that land. As Williams wrote, ``. . \n.having made covenant of peaceable neighborhood with all the sachems \nand natives round about us, and having, in a sense of God's merciful \nprovidence unto me in my distress, called the place Providence, I \ndesired it might be for a shelter for persons distressed for \nconscience.'' Later on these views would be enshrined in Rhode Island's \nfounding charter, providing ``full liberty in religious concernments.''\n  Williams' principles of tolerance are the foundation on which our \nstate, and afterwards our nation, were built. To this point, I request \nto have printed in the Record a recent op-ed from the Providence \nJournal by Rhode Island College Professor J. Stanley Lemons entitled \n``Assessing the global importance of Roger Williams,'' which does an \nexcellent job of capturing this piece of American history.\n  The information follows.\n\n          [From the Providence Journal, Friday, June 24, 2011]\n\n           Assessing the Global Importance of Roger Williams\n\n                         (By J. Stanley Lemons)\n\n       The greatest contribution that the U.S. has made to world \n     religion is the concept and practice of separation of church \n     and state, and that was started in Providence with Roger \n     Williams in 1636.\n       Even if nothing in the rest of the history of the state was \n     remarkable, Providence would still have that one world-class \n     contribution to its credit. It was the first place in modern \n     history where citizenship and religion were separated, where \n     freedom of conscience was the rule.\n       While his ideas were reviled and attacked in the 17th \n     Century, they became embodied in the U.S. Constitution in \n     1789 and the Bill of Rights, appended to it in 1791.\n       Have you wondered why there is a Roger Williams Lodge of \n     B'nai B'rith? Why the oldest synagogue (Touro Synagogue, in \n     Newport) in America is in Rhode Island? Have you ever \n     wondered why Rhode Island never had a witch trial? Or \n     blasphemy trials? Nor hanged, whipped or jailed people \n     because of religion? All the other colonies executed witches, \n     but not Rhode Island. Most had blasphemy trials, but not \n     Rhode Island.\n       Nearly everywhere else in colonial America, people of faith \n     were persecuted, but not in Rhode Island. Massachusetts \n     hanged four Quakers, and Virginia imprisoned dozens of \n     Baptists. Maryland, which was created as a haven for Roman \n     Catholics, came to outlaw Catholic priests and prohibited \n     Roman Catholics from inheriting property. These things did \n     not happen here because Roger Williams founded Providence to \n     be a ``shelter for those distressed of conscience.'' Rhode \n     Island's freedom of religion prevented such religious laws \n     and abuses.\n       It is well to recall how this came about. Roger Williams \n     got into serious trouble in\n\n[[Page S4392]]\n\n     Massachusetts when he challenged both the political and \n     religious establishments by asserting that the government had \n     no role in religion. Moreover, he challenged the legitimacy \n     of the colony itself by charging that it had stolen its land \n     from the Indians. So he was tried and convicted of sedition, \n     heresy and the refusal to take an oath of allegiance to the \n     colony that required him to swear in God's name. In October \n     1635 he was ordered banished to England, whence he had fled \n     in 1630 because of religious persecution.\n       Before the banishment could be carried out, however, he \n     fled from Salem into the snow in January 1636 and trekked to \n     the Narragansett Bay. In June he left the shelter of the \n     Wampanoags and crossed the Seekonk River into the domain of \n     the Narragansetts. From Miantonomi and Canonicus he acquired \n     Providence. His relations with the Narragansetts were so \n     cordial that Providence and the Narragansetts remained allies \n     for the next 40 years against the efforts of Massachusetts, \n     Connecticut and Plymouth colonies to destroy them both.\n       When the householders first gathered in Providence to form \n     their town government, they agreed that they could make rules \n     and laws in ``civil matters only.'' In 1644 when Williams \n     secured his charter for the ``Province of Providence \n     Plantations in Narragansett Bay in New England,'' that \n     charter was for a ``civil government.'' It did not mention \n     religion because Williams did not believe that government had \n     any role to play in religion. ``Soul liberty'' was God's gift \n     to all humanity; it was not something granted by any \n     government.\n       Soul liberty was the freedom of every person to follow the \n     dictates of conscience. A government could only acknowledge \n     this freedom and stand aside to allow full freedom of \n     religion. This meant that one had to have complete separation \n     of church and state. For Roger Williams, separation of church \n     and state was for the protection of the church from the \n     corrupting effects of government. Williams wrote repeatedly \n     that true religion needs no support of the government and \n     that government support invariably corrupts religion.\n       All of the neighboring colonies regarded Providence \n     Plantations with undisguised horror and worked for the first \n     hundred years to dismember and destroy this ``hive of \n     heretics.'' But they failed, and the principle that Roger \n     Williams planted in Providence in 1636 came to be the law of \n     all of Rhode Island and then a basic principle of the United \n     States. And, Roger Williams, whose ideas were roundly \n     rejected by everybody in his lifetime, would be seen by the \n     20th Century as the quintessential American of the 17th \n     Century. What was the founding principle of Providence--\n     freedom of religion (which demands separation of church and \n     state)--now holds out a hope for the whole world where \n     religious intolerance is the basis of so much strife.\n       Williams believed that it was God's command that everyone \n     (including people that he regarded as heretics, pagans, \n     atheists, and infidels) had a right to freedom of conscience. \n     He believed that anyone had a right to be wrong, and that \n     only civil debate could be used to change a heart or mind. \n     The only tools of religion were those of the spirit, never \n     the sword. For him, the state had no role to play in \n     religion. He believed that whenever and wherever the \n     government tried to meddle with religion by trying to define \n     it or control it or enforce it, or even to support it, \n     religion was corrupted by such efforts.\n       Williams and his good friend John Clarke, of Newport, \n     shared the view that the key to a peaceful society was \n     complete separation of church and state. Nearly everyone else \n     believed just the opposite: They believed that peace was \n     possible only when everyone was united in a single church in \n     a single state. Williams's core religious principle held that \n     each person had freedom of conscience and freedom to practice \n     their faith. Nearly everyone else thought that the state had \n     to punish and coerce those who had divergent religious \n     beliefs, wrong practices, or wayward ideas.\n       His position on freedom of religion was wildly radical in \n     his day and, nearly four centuries later, this basic \n     principle is still wildly radical in great swathes of today's \n     world. Religious freedom does not exist in most nations on \n     the planet.\n       What would Roger Williams think of the idea that our nation \n     was founded as a Christian nation? Certainly Providence and \n     Rhode Island were not founded as a Christian government. It \n     is deeply troubling to know that a pastor of one of the \n     largest churches in Texas declared on national TV that \n     ``separation of church and state is the product of some \n     infidel's mind.''\n       To call Roger Williams an infidel reveals profound \n     ignorance of our nation's history. Roger Williams utterly \n     rejected any such concept and regarded the idea of a \n     ``Christian nation'' as ``blasphemy.'' So, he established a \n     government that was confined to ``civil matters only,'' and \n     this has become a model for the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/06/senate-section/article/S4392-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 1326.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 regarding school libraries, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce with my colleagues \nSenators Cochran, Murray, Rockefeller, and Whitehouse, the \nStrengthening Kids' Interest in Learning and Libraries Act bill.\n  Our bipartisan legislation will reauthorize and strengthen the school \nlibrary program of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The key \nimprovements to the program include ensuring that elementary, middle, \nand high school students are served; expanding professional development \nto include digital literacy instruction and reading and writing \ninstruction across all grade levels; focusing on coordination and \nshared planning time between teachers and librarians; awarding grants \nfor a period of three years; and ensuring that books and materials are \nappropriate for and gain the interest of students with special learning \nneeds, including English learners.\n  The SKILLS Act will also strengthen Title I by asking state and \nschool district plans to address the development of effective school \nlibrary programs to help students develop digital literacy skills, \nmaster the knowledge and skills in the challenging academic content \nstandards adopted by the state, and graduate from high school ready for \ncollege and careers. Additionally, the legislation will broaden the \nfocus of training, professional development, and recruitment activities \nunder Title II to include school librarians.\n  Since 1965, more than 60 education and library studies have produced \nclear evidence that school libraries staffed by qualified librarians \nhave a positive impact on student academic achievement. Knowing how to \nfind and use information are essential skills for college and careers. \nA good school library, staffed by a trained school librarian, is where \nstudents develop and hone these skills.\n  The SKILLS Act will build on the success of the Improving Literacy \nthrough School Libraries programs that was part of the No Child Left \nBehind Act and is the only Federal initiative solely dedicated to \nsupporting and enhancing our Nation's school libraries. The Department \nof Education's January 2009 evaluation of the program found that it had \nbeen successful in improving the quality of those school libraries \nreceiving the grants. Unfortunately, even in the face of all the \nevidence of the role school libraries play in boosting student \nachievement and the efficacy of the program itself, the Administration \nopted not to use its authority to provide funding for the school \nlibrary program under the fiscal year 2011 continuing resolution.\n  This was a very short-sighted decision. Since its enactment in 2002, \nthe Improving Literacy through School Libraries program has been making \na difference for students across the country.\n  In Rhode Island, for instance, this program supported the Get READY, \nGet Ready, Empowered And Determined Youth, project of the Woonsocket \nschool district, which encompassed a comprehensive strategy to improve \nthe reading skills and academic achievement of 6,296 students, in \ngrades K-12, by addressing critical elements of an effective school \nlibrary program. Grant funds allowed the district to replace outdated \nlibrary materials, add one to two books per student at each library, \nextend library hours, and add new computers to connect students to \ninformation at other libraries. The funds also increased resources for \nprofessional development in technology training for teachers and \nlibrarians.\n  Absent the Federal program, the libraries in many of our high poverty \nschools will languish with outdated materials and technology. This is a \ntrue equity issue, which is why I will continue to fight to sustain our \nFederal investment in this area and why renewing and strengthening the \nschool library program is of critical importance.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in cosponsoring the Strengthening Kids' \nInterest in Learning and Libraries Act.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1328\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the treatment and temporary financing \nof short-time compensation programs; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Layoff Prevention \nAct, legislation to strengthen and expand work sharing programs to keep \nAmericans on the job and provide employers with a practical alternative \nto layoffs that is good for business.\n  While the U.S. has experienced 15 consecutive months of private-\nsector job creation, too many Americans, nearly 14 million, remain out \nof work. Like everyone in my State, I am fully focused on finding ways \nto create jobs. As we work to stabilize employment, our efforts should \nalso be aimed at preventing the loss of jobs in the first place.\n  This is where work sharing programs make a real difference. If you \nare a business owner faced with the prospect of having to let go some \npercentage of your highly-skilled workforce because of a rough patch, \nwork sharing allows you to keep your workers on the job with reduced \nhours until you can bring them back on full time when business \nrebounds. In this way, a business does not lose out on the considerable \nexpense and time it has put in to hire and train these workers. This \ninitiative helps workers by lessening the impact of those reduced hours \non workers and their families because workers receive a proportionate \nshare of unemployment benefits.\n  Work sharing has proven to be effective not only in my State of Rhode \nIsland, but in the more than 20 States and the District of Columbia \nthat have adopted it across the Nation. At the height of the recession \nin 2009, there was a significant jump in employer participation, \ndemonstrating the program's value to small, medium, and large \nbusinesses. Indeed, according to the Department of Labor, work sharing \nprograms saved approximately 165,000 jobs in 2009, nearly triple the \nnumber the year prior. As the overall economy improved in 2010, the \nsystem continued to be a valuable tool, saving 100,000 jobs. But these \nnumbers could be much larger if more States adopted work sharing.\n  Although work sharing has played an increased role in preventing \nlayoffs, it remains underutilized. Some States are not actively \npromoting its use; while in many other States it is simply not \navailable.\n  Despite these limitations, the current economic circumstances have \nshined a bright light on the value of job sharing and these initiatives \nhave been front and center as States are increasingly turning to them \nto prevent job losses. A growing number of States with Republican and \nDemocratic Governors have taken action. In just the past few weeks, \nMaine and Pennsylvania have enacted laws to create work sharing \nsystems, following Colorado, Oklahoma, and New Hampshire last year. The \nPresident has also recognized the potential of work sharing to stave \noff further job losses by including in his fiscal year 2012 budget \nproposal that expanded on legislation I introduced last Congress.\n  The bill I am introducing today along with Senators Harkin, Murray, \nSchumer, Sherrod Brown, Whitehouse, Leahy, Casey, and Blumenthal builds \non this momentum and encourages States with existing lay off prevention \nsystems to utilize them more frequently and incentivizes States without \nwork sharing to create them. It strengthens the legislation that I \nauthored last Congress by including changes suggested by the business \ncommunity, States, economists, and other stakeholders. As in past \nversions, it provides States that have approved programs with temporary \nFederal financing for 100 percent of work sharing benefits paid to \nworkers, limited to 26 weeks worth of benefits spread out over the \ncourse of a year. This financing is available for three years.\n  While the bill is designed to incentivize States to enact permanent \nlaws to create work sharing, the bill also includes provisions to allow \nStates to get work sharing up and running more quickly. Specifically, a \nState can reach an agreement with the Department of Labor to create a \ntemporary program under which they would receive 50 percent Federal \nfinancing. This financing incentive would be available for 2 years, and \nsuch States would be eligible for a third year of 100 percent federal \nfunding if they pass a permanent law.\n  In addition, the bill provides flexible grants to State labor \nagencies at a time when they are doing more with less. States that \nenact work sharing programs are eligible for grants to improve \nimplementation and administration, and there are also grants for \npromotion and enrollment. These resources will play a critical role in \nensuring that States are efficiently able to inform employers of its \nbenefits, and encourage greater use of work sharing to stave off \nlayoffs. Moreover, as work sharing programs take hold, States will see \ntheir unemployment insurance systems less burdened as fewer individuals \nwill need to avail themselves of full unemployment benefits.\n  Simply put, this legislation will help more workers, businesses, and \ncommunities stay afloat, while the country works its way through these \ntough economic times. Moreover, the bill lays a needed foundation to \nprotect businesses and workers from any future recession. It is a win-\nwin for all.\n  First, work sharing helps speed economic recovery. Economist Mark \nZandi estimates that temporary financing of work share offers a very \nhigh ``bang for the buck'' of $1.69. That is, every $1 devoted to \nfinance State work share programs results in $1.69 in real GDP.\n  Second, work sharing allows businesses to retain skilled workers, \ntemporarily cut costs, and maintain employee morale.\n  Third, it keeps people working while receiving a share of \nunemployment benefits to make up for lost wages and retaining health \ninsurance and retirement benefits. This means workers can continue to \npay their mortgages and bills, provide for their families, and support \nbusinesses in their local communities.\n  Keeping workers attached to the workforce is a key element of \nensuring economic growth.\n\n[[Page S4398]]\n\n  This legislation does not reinvent the wheel, it is not a mandate on \nemployers or States, and it is not telling anyone what they must do.\n  Instead, it takes a proven jobs-saving initiative, that is \nincreasingly being used by States, and strengthens and expands it. It \ngives more employers in more States the opportunity to take advantage \nof its benefits.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this important \nlegislation. It is my hope that we can proceed in a bipartisan manner \nas has been accomplished in the more than 20 States where work sharing \nhas been adopted and take swift action to pass this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1333\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to provide \nrights for pilots, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, just a few minutes ago I did introduce and \nwe have a bill number that is S. 1335. It is the Pilot's Bill of \nRights. It is very significant that we get this done today, and I will \nexplain why.\n  First of all, when Senator John Glenn from Ohio retired, that left me \nas the last active commercial pilot in the Senate. Consequently, I \nprobably get more complaints than anybody else does about problems and \nabuses with the FAA.\n  I have to say this: I was very complimentary yesterday to so many of \nthe people. The vast majority of the inspectors, the controllers, and \nothers at the FAA are so talented. In fact, the first thing I do when I \ngo up to Oshkosh every year, the largest air show in the world, is I go \nup to where they are all gathered together and I compliment them on the \nfact that they are taking on the toughest job for a 6-day period in \nOshkosh as a volunteer. So I love their virtues. However, we have to \nkeep in mind that any bureaucracy can become abusive.\n  So I have introduced the Pilot's Bill of Rights. The reason I am \nspeaking right now is because we have 25 cosponsors at this time, which \nmeans 25 percent of the Senate has signed on as cosponsors.\n  The way the rules work around here, any of the Members who might be \nlistening right now--and I know the occupier of the Chair is very \nconcerned about this and he is very active with me on this \nlegislation--any staffers who are watching, they should advise their \nMembers that they have until close of business today, probably 1 more \nhour, to put their names down as original cosponsors.\n  Now, the bill simply does four things. First of all, it requires the \nFAA, for any enforcement action, to make sure the pilot is fully aware \nof what he is being accused of before any ultimatums are put forth. \nConsequently, that pilot is able to defend himself.\n  The second thing is it clarifies what they call statutory deference. \nRight now, statutory deference relates to the National Transportation \nSafety Board. The NTSB is the only area of appeal, so that if a pilot \nis accused of something and he looks at it and thinks it is unfair, he \nwould have to go to the NTSB. Yet because of deference, they merely \nrubberstamp in almost all cases what the FAA does. As an example, of \nthe emergency determinations that were made last year, only one was \nactually granted and the rest of them were denied. This bill will \nallow, in terms of fairness, that if something is going on and they \nrefuse to consider a case, there will be an appellate process where the \npilot can go to the Federal District Court and be heard there.\n  The third thing it does is it has to do with notice. That is notice \nto airmen. That is very significant. Those of us who are pilots know \nthat when we go into a field, we check and see what the NOTAMs are, so \nthat if there is any work on the runway, any problem there, any \ntaxiways that are closed, they will give the pilot that information. \nHowever, the problem is it is the pilot's responsibility to do this and \nthe FAA many times doesn't even post these NOTAMs. So what we are \nsaying with our FARs, or our laws, is we are saying to a pilot, You \nhave to be responsible to know what is going on at the airport, where \nyou are going to be landing. Yet there is no place you can find out. So \nthis requires that they revamp this system so that there is a central \nlocation. We specify that in the legislation, so that can be found.\n  Then the fourth and final thing, there is another problem in terms of \nmedical certification. Those of us who are pilots have to have medicals \nand we have to have a certification process. This has been a problem \nfor a long period of time. I have had countless people call me and talk \nabout the problems they are having with their medical certification. In \nfact, of all the requests for assistance to the Aircraft Owners and \nPilots Association--they represent hundreds of thousands of pilots--of \nall the requests for assistance they receive each year, 28 percent are \nrelated to the FAA's medical certification process. So I would say this \nof this very simple legislation. Two sections actually change the \nstatutes so that it offers protection to pilots, but\n\n[[Page S4401]]\n\nthe other two are working together to come up with a system where we \ncan have a central location for NOTAMs as well as having a fair process \nfor medical evaluations.\n  I think it is very obvious that there are a lot of bureaucracies \nwhere one or two people can be bad. When I was in Tulsa, I can remember \nall it took was one or two bad cops and that gave a black eye to \neverybody else. I remember actually, when I was running--it is the \nwhole reason I ran for office in the first place. When I was out in the \nprivate sector, I was doing things that I thought I was supposed to be \ndoing, and I had one old building called the Wrightsman Oil Estate. I \nwas going to take this old eyesore and make it into a building and \npreserve it as it was originally. Old, in my city of Tulsa, OK, in this \ncase was maybe 1910 or 1912. We weren't even a State until 1907. This \nis something everybody wanted.\n  I went to the city engineer and I said, I want to take this eyesore \nof a fire escape on the second floor and move it from the south to the \nnorth end. It is the same thing; it will service the same number of \npeople, but it is an eyesore and this gets it out of the way. No one is \nagainst it. He said, You can't do that until this committee meets. So \nlet's see. You have to have notice. That would be 3 more weeks before \nyou can get notice. A month after that, you can get on the agenda. I \nsaid, Look, everyone is for it. He said, That is your problem, not \nmine. I said, I will run for mayor and fire you, and I did, and I fired \nhim. This can happen in any bureaucracy.\n  So the reason there is a sense of urgency is because we have already \ntold all of the groups--the Experimental Aircraft Association, ALPA, \nall of these groups that represent these different organizations--that \nwe are going to be getting this bill ready with all of our original \ncosponsors and then cosponsors so that when we arrive and when I arrive \nat the end of July, at Oshkosh, WI, I am going to do the same thing I \ndid in 1994 that caused us to be able to pass the first product \nliability bill on aviation and aviation products that had the effect of \nchanging us from a major importer of aviation products and of airplanes \nto a major exporter, just by changing that. It was an 18-year repose \nbill. I did that at Oshkosh with an audience of 200,000 people. These \nare single issue people. I can assure my colleagues that they will be \njust as interested in this bill.\n  So I will be presenting this, and I am going to encourage Members of \nthe Senate who want to get their name in today, they can be cosponsors, \noriginal cosponsors, as is the occupier of the chair at the present \ntime, and myself, and 23 other Members of the Senate.\n  One last reminder. This is S. 1335. This is the last chance. \nColleagues have 1 more hour to be an original cosponsor. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in sponsoring this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/06/senate-section/article/S4401-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JULY 7, 2011\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.
