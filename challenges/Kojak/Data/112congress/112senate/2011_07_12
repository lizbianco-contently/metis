Madam President, for more than 2 years now, \nRepublicans in Washington have stood united in the belief that America \nwould never recover from the economic crisis that struck our Nation 3 \nyears ago so long as some in Washington persisted in the mistaken \nbelief that government had the cure. For most clear-eyed observers, \nthat view has found its clearest vindication in the daily drumbeat of \nnews about lost jobs, shuttered businesses, and slumping home values, \nand in the stories each of us hears from our constituents about the \neconomic hardships they continue to face. If anyone was still looking \nfor proof that the President's economic policies have been a failure, \nthey don't have to look any further than the morning papers or their \nconstituent mail. Indeed, the more the administration insisted on \nspending and debt as a solution to our problems, the worse those \nproblems became and the more Americans demanded the status quo in \nWashington had to change. But the administration was slow to get the \nmessage.\n  After an election that any honest observer saw as a repudiation of \nits policies, the White House continued to cling to its playbook. As \nconcerns about debt and deficit grew, the President presented a budget \nso unequal to the task that not a single Democrat voted for it--not \none. As the Nation inched closer to a potential default, the President \nfocused his attention elsewhere.\n  Meanwhile, Republicans were offering detailed solutions to the \napproaching crisis. We offered detailed budgets of our own. We offered \nto work out a compromise that lowered the debt and protected \nentitlements from bankruptcy. And here is what we got in return: \nsilence.\n  That is where the debate over the debt limit came in. If Democrats \nwould not agree on their own to do something about their addiction to \nspending and\n\n[[Page S4494]]\n\ndebt, then we refused to enable it. If they wanted our votes to \nincrease the debt limit, then they would have to do something to \nrestrain the size and scope of government first. For a while, there \nweren't many takers. Democrats from the President on down insisted that \nwe simply raise the debt ceiling and endorse the status quo on spending \nwithout any reforms.\n  That changed a couple of months ago when the President agreed to \ndelegate bipartisan debt-reduction talks to the Vice President. Then, a \ncouple of weeks ago, the President broke his own silence on the debt \nceiling and got personally involved himself. Incredibly, for those of \nus who had been calling for action on this issue day-in and day-out for \nabout 2 years, the President tried to put the burden on us. With the \nNation edging closer to the debt limit deadline, the President \nretreated behind the poll-tested rhetoric of class warfare. At a moment \nwhen we needed leadership the most, we got it the least. The financial \nsecurity of the Nation was being gambled on the President's wager that \nhe could convince people our problems would be solved if we would all \nagree to take it out on the guy in the fancy house down the street. In \nmy view, that was the saddest commentary on the status of leadership at \nthe White House.\n  I am proud of the fact that Republicans refused to play along. We \nstood our ground. We know that what Americans need right now is for the \ngovernment to make job creation easier, not harder, and we said so. At \na time when 14 million Americans are looking for work, we refused to \nsupport a tax hike. We supported jobs and economic growth instead. When \nDemocrats saw we wouldn't budge, they proposed one last offer to craft \na deal. They asked us to join them in another Washington effort to pull \nthe wool over the eyes of the American people. They offered us the \nopportunity to participate in the kind of deliberate deception of the \npublic that has given public service such a bad name in recent years. \nWe all saw how it worked. The administration carefully leaked to the \nmedia, without any details, the idea that it was willing to go along \nwith trillions of dollars in spending cuts. The lack of detail \nconcealed the fact that the savings they were supposedly willing to \nsupport were at best smoke and mirrors. The hope here was that the \nbudget gimmicks and deferred decisionmaking they actually supported \nwould have the appearance of serious belt-tightening, but the practical \neffect would have been at most about a couple of billion dollars in \ncuts up front with empty promises of more to follow. We have seen this \nkind of thing before. It is just the kind of sleight-of-hand governing \nthat has put our Nation more than $14 trillion in debt. I will not \nassociate myself with it, and I refuse to join in an effort to fool the \nAmerican people.\n  Republicans have told the President we are not interested in business \nas usual in Washington, and we actually mean it. We will not be party \nto something that claims to save trillions but leaves future \ngenerations to pick up the tab and future Congresses to reverse it with \na simple vote. We will not pretend a bad deal is a good one, which \nbrings me to a larger point.\n  The suggestion has been made that this debate was hinged on the \nquestion of whether the two parties could find a solution to our \neconomic problems without raising taxes. Wrong. We could have done that \nwithout breaking a sweat. The truth is, the Democrats saw this debate \nas a unique opportunity to impose the types of tax hikes they want so \nbadly but couldn't even pass in a Democrat-controlled Senate last year. \nSo let's not be fooled by a false choice. This was not in the end a \ndebate about whether taxes needed to be raised; it was a debate about \nthe kind of government we want. This was a debate between those who \nbelieve Washington doesn't have enough money to spend and those, like \nme, who believe Washington has become too big, too expensive, and too \nburdensome already. If one thinks the Federal Government isn't big \nenough, then the only responsible thing to do is to support higher \ntaxes. For those who are honest about that, I appreciate their candor. \nBut for those of us who don't think the Federal Government should be in \ncharge of banks, the auto industry, the housing business, the student \nloans business, health care, and regulating everything else under the \nSun, we are not about to further enable that model of government by \nshaking down the American people for more money at a time when they can \nleast afford it. That is what this debate is about. It is about saying \nWashington has gotten too big, and if it can't afford its commitments, \nthen it needs to find a way to cut back on them. But don't demand that \nthe American people pay more so Washington can make its bad habits \npermanent. I read an article yesterday that said $2 out of every $5 \nAmericans spend right now comes from the Federal Government. Is this \nreally the model we want?\n\n  I have a lot of meetings with constituents, and I am not sure I have \never heard anyone say the problem with Washington is they don't have \nenough money to spend. I don't think I have ever heard that.\n  It was my hope the two parties could reach a meaningful, bipartisan \nagreement. I have to say I was initially encouraged by the prospect of \nthe bipartisan discussions led by the Vice President. Although I \ndisagree with him on most issues, Vice President Biden is a man I have \ncome to respect as a straight-shooting negotiator. We found common \nground last December to prevent a tax hike on the American people, and \nmy hope was we could find a solution once again.\n  Sadly, these discussions started with the shared goal of reducing the \ndebt but quickly regressed to a public sideshow in which the price of \nadmission became an insistence that we raise taxes on job creators and \non millions of American families who don't have yachts or corporate \njets. At a time when jobs are few and far between, that is not a price \nthe American people can afford.\n  So Republicans searched in good faith for common ground, but the \ngoalposts just kept moving. We trudged on, hoping the administration \nwould at some point realize the crisis we face demands a clear change \nin direction, a departure from the government-driven policies of the \npast 2 years. But our hopes for a grand bargain eventually ran into the \nbitter reality that this administration is just not interested in a \nmeaningful and lasting solution to our mounting debt. It is simply too \ncommitted to big government. We showed a willingness to sacrifice all \nalong, even as we made it crystal clear from the outset that tax \nincreases would not be a part of any agreement. It was their commitment \nto big government that stood in the way of a grand bargain. It was \ntheir determination to freeze the policies of the past 2 years in \nplace, permanently. The American people don't want that, and \nRepublicans won't be seduced into enabling it.\n  An ideological commitment to big government has outweighed the White \nHouse's commitment to find a meaningful compromise that does not damage \nour fragile economy in the process. Rather than find a way to bring \ngovernment back to the people, the administration has committed itself \nto protecting the size and scope of government at the cost of job \ncreation, economic growth, and America's status in the global economy.\n  The tragedy in all of this is that we all know what is necessary to \nsolve the economic crisis we face. The answer is to cut spending. The \nanswer is to cut spending.\n  It is no secret how to solve the entitlement crisis, either. Any one \nof the people involved in these discussions could write it out on the \nback of an envelope. It is also no secret that Democrats would rather \ndemagogue any solution Republicans propose in next year's election than \njoin us in seriously reforming them, despite what some Democrats \nstarted to say once it became clear Republicans wouldn't agree to a \nplan that raises taxes.\n  We all saw the news stories yesterday about how senior Democrats have \nbeen worried that reforming Medicare now would make it harder for them \nto campaign against Republicans later. Evidently, they would rather \nsave their own jobs than save these programs from insolvency.\n  I truly believed we could get this done. I truly believed, perhaps \nnaively, that this administration would see the necessity of preserving \nSocial Security and Medicare for future generations.\n  In the end, it appears that the perceived electoral success of \ndemagoguing a solution proved its\n\n[[Page S4495]]\n\nundoing. Or perhaps it was the ideological commitment to preserving the \nsize of government by the most stridently liberal Members of the other \nside. Whatever the reasons, Madam President--whatever the reasons--it \nis a tragic missed opportunity for the country.\n  I hope the economists are wrong and that our economy will continue to \ngrow over the next year and a half to buy us time to tackle the \nproblems we face. But after years of discussions and months of \nnegotiations, I have little question that as long as this President is \nin the Oval Office a real solution is probably unattainable. This was \nnot an easy decision for me.\n  From my first day as Republican leader in the Senate, I have called \non Presidents from both parties to work with Congress on real solutions \nto the problems we face. For more than 2 years I have had conversations \nwith the administration about working together to accomplish something \nbig for the country. On each occasion, I have been met initially with \nencouraging words that gradually give way to moving the goalposts.\n  In the end, they have always expressed a fundamental unwillingness to \nengage in a meaningful effort to reduce spending as a means to rein in \nthe debt. Despite our stagnant economy, and the dire warnings of \neconomic and security experts that we cannot sustain our mounting debt \nor unfunded liabilities, this President has proven that he will do \nalmost anything to protect the size and the scope of Washington, DC's \nburgeoning bureaucracy, including to threaten the economic security of \nevery American by backing us up to the edge of default.\n  I have heard some on the other side of the aisle suggest that \nRepublicans have put us in this position by refusing to accept what \nthey call a balanced approach.\n  My response is that if the American people have learned one thing \nover the past few years, it is that they need to bring their decoder \nrings to any debate in Washington these days. When Democrats say \n``investment,'' they mean government spending. When they say \n``revenue,'' they mean higher taxes. And when they say ``shared \nsacrifice,'' they mean they want you to take the hit, not Washington. \nIt starts with the so-called rich, with the owners of the corporate \njets, but pretty soon it hits the family flying in coach. Eventually \neveryone gets fleeced.\n  Well, Americans have had enough. They think it is time Washington \nshares in the sacrifice. Republicans invited Democrats into these \ndiscussions about finding a solution to our problems, and while we \napproached them with clear and unwavering principles, we also brought \nan open mind. The record reflects that. I will not betray the \nconfidence of those who were willing to negotiate with us, but there \ncan be no question by anyone involved in these discussions that \nRepublicans were willing to make tough choices.\n  So where do we go from here?\n  Well, I was one of those who had long hoped we could do something big \nfor the country. But in my view the President has presented us with \nthree choices: smoke and mirrors, tax hikes, or default. Republicans \nchoose none of the above. I had hoped to do good, but I refuse to do \nharm. So Republicans will choose a path that actually reflects the will \nof the people, which is to do the responsible thing and ensure the \ngovernment does not default on its obligations, and to continue to \npress the administration to rein in Washington, not to freeze it in \nplace.\n  That is why I will continue to urge the President to rein in our \ndeficits and debt in a way that puts the short- and long-term health of \nour economy ahead of his personal vision of government. That is what \nthe American people want. That is what Republicans will continue to \ninsist on. Nothing less will solve the crises we face. Nothing less \nwill do.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/12/senate-section/article/S4495-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise today as our Nation \nhonors the bravery and sacrifice of Santa Fe native Leroy Arthur Petry, \nan Army Ranger who, in 2008, risked his life to save his fellow \nsoldiers on the battlefields of Afghanistan.\n  Today Sergeant First Class Petry will be honored for his \n``conspicuous gallantry'' with our Nation's highest military \ndecoration: the Medal of Honor.\n  I will be humbled to be at the White House along with Sergeant First \nClass Petry's family, friends, and fellow soldiers as President Obama \nhonors him with the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n  It will be a special day for Sergeant First Class Petry, for his wife \nand his children, and all his family, and for his fellow Americans, as \nhe becomes only the second living active-duty servicemember to receive \nthe Medal of Honor for actions in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n  Sergeant First Class Petry's story is one of courage and sacrifice \nand immense love of country. It is a story that began years ago in \nSanta Fe with a young man who struggled in high school but refused to \ngive up and, instead, buckled down, dug deep, and found the hero \nwithin--a hero to the men he saved on that fateful day in Afghanistan, \nand a hero to all Americans who owe their freedoms to our brave men and \nwomen in uniform. It is the story of that day in May of 2008 that I \nwish to tell you today.\n  Sergeant First Class Petry was a member of the 75th Ranger Regiment \nwhen he and his fellow rangers were deployed to capture a high-value \ntarget in Afghanistan. During their raid, they were engaged in a \nfirefight with the enemy when several in their regiment were pinned \ndown by grenades.\n  Petry had already been wounded by bullet fire, shot through both legs \nby a hidden enemy. But Petry did not allow his wounds to stop him as \nthe battle raged on. Pinned inside a courtyard with a fellow ranger, he \ncontinued the fight, calling in support and creating a brief pause in \nenemy fire by throwing a grenade their way.\n  One enemy grenade exploded within 10 yards of Petry and a group of \nrangers. The explosion knocked the rangers down and wounded two members \nof the team.\n  Soon after the first grenade exploded, the insurgents threw a second. \nThis time the grenade landed near two of Petry's comrades. With no \nthought to his personal safety, Ranger Petry grabbed the grenade and \nattempted to toss it away. The grenade exploded as he tossed it, taking \nPetry's hand with it, but saving the lives of those near him.\n  Losing a hand would have been enough to break most people, but not \nSergeant First Class Petry. Instead, he calmly inspected his wound, \nstemmed the flow of blood with a tourniquet, and continued the fight, \nhelping to pin down the insurgents until they could be killed.\n  It was this immense act of bravery that saved the lives of his \nbrothers in arms. In fact, one of his fellow rangers, SGT Daniel \nHiggins, wrote in a statement about that day:\n\n       If not for Staff Sergeant Petry's actions, we would have \n     been seriously wounded or killed.\n\n  On that fateful day in 2008, then-Staff Sergeant Petry was no \nstranger to service to his country. He was on his eighth deployment--\nlet me repeat that: his eighth deployment--in support of U.S. \noperations overseas, his sixth in Afghanistan, after two tours in Iraq.\n\n[[Page S4496]]\n\n  Sergeant First Class Petry's life of heroic service was based in \nhumble beginnings. A 1998 story in the Santa Fe New Mexican newspaper \nfeatured a then 18-year-old Petry. The young man was a senior at St. \nCatherine Indian school--the institution's final graduating class. He \nwas also a recipient of the ``Bootstrap'' award, which honored area \nhigh school seniors who had committed to improving themselves and their \ncommunity.\n  Here is what the teacher who nominated him wrote:\n\n       With a record of fights, suspensions, and ditching school, \n     Petry realized that he was on a path that led nowhere. He \n     tried harder in school and appreciated how it felt to make \n     his parents proud.\n\n  From a path to nowhere to a path to history as a national hero, \nSergeant First Class Petry is an inspiration for all young people who \nare struggling to find their place in the world. To young people who \nmay be considering giving up and taking a more destructive path, he is \na model.\n  Three years after his heroic actions on the battlefield, Sergeant \nFirst Class Petry continues to give back to his country and his fellow \nsoldiers. As a liaison officer for the U.S. Special Operations Command \nCare Coalition in Washington State, Sergeant First Class Petry provides \na helping hand and much needed resources to wounded soldiers, ill and \ninjured servicemembers, and their families.\n  Here is what Leroy's father Larry Petry said of his son in a recent \ninterview with a local New Mexico television station:\n\n       He's really overwhelmed by this. He keeps saying, ``Dad, I \n     was just doing my job. Any other soldier would have done \n     it.''\n\n  I think we will all agree with what his father said in return:\n\n       Well, son, you did something great, and they really want to \n     honor you for that.\n\n  Despite all the attention and recognition brought by this award, \nPetry--like so many of those brave warriors before him--remains humble. \nA recent posting on his Facebook page reads:\n\n       The award is bigger than the person . . . and I will always \n     remember that.\n\n  New Mexico has a long and proud tradition of military service--\nexemplified in the heroic actions of SFC Leroy Petry on the \nbattlefields of Afghanistan.\n  To Sergeant First Class Petry's wife Ashley and their four children, \nto his mother and father and siblings and extended family, I know I \nspeak for the people of New Mexico and all of America when I offer the \nthanks of a grateful nation. You sacrificed time with your loved ones \nso he could bravely serve our country. Along with Sergeant First Class \nPetry, you are all heroes in our eyes.\n  Sergeant First Class Petry is highly deserving of this honor, and New \nMexico is honored to call him a native son.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, first let me thank the Senator from New \nMexico for his heartfelt remarks. I know how much he cares about his \nconstituents and our country. We too at the opposite end of the country \nthank our soldiers for their sacrifice and also the families of those \nwho make the highest sacrifice to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/12/senate-section/article/S4496-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4496-S4497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              DEBT DEFAULT\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise to speak about a subject that is \nforemost on my mind and the mind of my Democratic colleagues here \ntoday; that is, the danger of defaulting on our debt.\n  In the entire history of this great country, we have never once \ndefaulted on our debt. America has always kept her promises. But an \nalarming number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem \ncontent to reverse that proud record.\n  Time after time, they have rejected sensible compromises to avert \ndefault. Late last year, all the House Republicans voted against the \nSimpson-Bowles commission. Then a key Republican walked away from the \nGang of 6. Then Leader Cantor abandoned the Biden-led talks. Most \nrecently, Speaker Boehner balked at President Obama's grand bargain-\nstyle offer because of pressure from so many in his party. It is an \nobvious and unsettling trend.\n  In each of these instances, the Republican retreat was precipitated \nby one thing and one thing only: an ideological quest to ensure that \ntax breaks for the richest few are protected. They have insisted we \ncan't raise a single dollar from millionaires and billionaires, no \nmatter how wasteful the tax break or how generous the subsidy.\n  Instead, they would rather balance the budget on the backs of middle-\nclass families. They think giving tax breaks to millionaires and \nbillionaires creates jobs. What about all those dollars that sit there \nin vaults and bank accounts? Isn't it true that taking away money from \nmiddle-class people hurts the job effort? It is a one-sided ideological \nquest to help the most privileged few among us.\n  This morning, The Hill newspaper reported that Majority Leader Cantor \nmade a proposal at the White House yesterday that outlined $353 billion \nin health care cuts. Among the cuts listed by Leader Cantor were \napproximately $250 billion in reductions in Medicare. According to The \nHill, several of his proposals ``would raise costs for Medicare and \nMedicaid beneficiaries.''\n  That would protect the wealthiest among us--the millionaires and \nbillionaires--and hurt the average middle-class senior citizens.\n  This is the tradeoff Leader Cantor and the Republicans wish to make: \nprotect millionaires and cut Medicare benefits instead. This approach \nis not balanced, it is not fair, it is not moral, and it will not be \naccepted.\n  The proposal by Leader Cantor is very troubling, but we can't ignore \nit because, according to press reports this morning, Leader Cantor is \nnow the leader of these negotiations for the Republicans. It was \nreported that he did the plurality, if not the majority, of the talking \non the Republican side at the meeting yesterday.\n  Leader Cantor will need to approach this set of negotiations better \nthan he did the last one. During the Biden-led talks, Leader Cantor \nbolted the room as soon as it was time to make tough decisions he \ndidn't like.\n  Let me read from the front page of the Washington Post this morning. \nThis is the Washington Post story, not my words:\n\n       Cantor thinks the way to win this haggling session--one of \n     Washington's most important in years--is by walking out of \n     it.\n\n  I will repeat that from the Washington Post front page:\n\n       Cantor thinks the way to win this haggling session--one of \n     Washington's most important in years--is by walking out of \n     it.\n\n  Leader Cantor cannot repeat that maneuver again this time. We are too \nclose to the debt limit deadline, and there is no margin for error.\n  This is crunch time. The clock is ticking. If we don't reach an \nagreement in the next few weeks, we risk roiling the financial markets, \nand our Nation's fragile economy will suffer a serious setback. Middle-\nclass families will see their mortgage rates and credit card rates go \nup. Even a technical default--the failure to pay interest on our debt \nfor just a few days--will cause the GDP to contract and jobs to be \nlost, in all likelihood. It doesn't just affect the government. It is \nnot just something far away. It affects every family with a variable \nrate mortgage or credit card debt. That is why it is time for my GOP \ncolleagues to jettison their ideological blinders and get down to \npragmatic problem-solving that will allow us to avoid default and its \naftermath.\n  We have had debt ceiling renewals on our desks for decades. No one \nhas ever played brinkmanship like this. No one has ever said our Nation \nwill not live up to its obligations--this great Nation, which always \nhas, from the days of the Founding Fathers and Alexander Hamilton.\n  On this side of the aisle, we are working in good faith to reach a \ndeal. Over the past few months, we have worked diligently to identify \nmore than $1 trillion in spending cuts, many of which are just as \npainful to our caucus as taking away tax breaks to millionaires are to \nthe caucus on the other side. It can't be just one way. We have put \nthese difficult cuts on the table because, on this side of the aisle, \nwe recognize our deficit is unprecedented and bold comprehensive action \nneeds to be taken.\n  Let me say this: A budget agreement cannot be considered bold and \ncomprehensive unless it asks millionaires, billionaires, and wealthy \ncorporations to contribute to deficit reduction. They\n\n[[Page S4497]]\n\ndon't have to do the whole thing, but they have to do their share. That \nis why we want to repeal tax breaks that serve no purpose whatsoever, \nother than to bloat our budget deficit. We want to make sure that at \nthis time of fiscal restraint there is shared sacrifice.\n  Let's face it, middle-class Americans and working-class Americans \ndepend on government programs in ways the wealthy do not. If you are a \nmillionaire or billionaire, you don't need Pell grants to send your \nkids to college. You don't need to go to a community health clinic to \nhave your teeth examined when they ache. You don't have the high cost \nof prescription drugs to be a barrier to you, and you don't need help \nto pay them.\n  If we are going to scale back vital spending programs, which go right \nto the core of middle-class, hard-working American families, we must \nalso scale back special interest tax breaks that benefit only the \nwealthiest few, such as tax breaks for yachters and corporate jet \nowners.\n  I wish to make something clear. I have nothing against those who have \nmade a lot of money. I think that is great. I think that is America. I \nknow lots of people like that. Most of the ones I know say: Yes, I \nshould pay my fair share. But somehow there is a small group that seems \nto feel they should not pay almost any taxes. Those people are running \nthe show on the other side of the aisle.\n  If we are going to bequeath the American dream to future generations \nand ensure that the American dream continues to burn brightly in the \nAmerican breast, then we need to institute some shared sacrifice.\n  In normal times, this would be a consensus, middle-of-the road \nposition. It is a position Ronald Reagan took. It is a position George \nH.W. Bush took. As David Brooks and other commonsense Republicans have \nnoted, Republican Presidents and leaders have long supported coupling \nincreased revenue with spending cuts to reduce deficits.\n  But today's GOP has, unfortunately and sadly, been dragged so far to \nthe right by its ideological fringe that they now reject this balanced \napproach out of hand. They would sooner end Medicare as we know it than \nask millionaires and billionaires to pay a little more in taxes. That \nis the nub of it. They would sooner end Medicare as we know it than ask \nmillionaires and billionaires to pay a little more in taxes.\n  How many Americans agree with that? Certainly, our political system, \nfor all its faults, at the end of the day has truth at the bottom of \nit. This position will not help my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle. When either party moves too far to the extreme--Republicans too \nfar to the right or Democrats too far to the left--they ultimately \nlose. That is what is happening to the Grand Old Party in this Chamber.\n  More than 40 Republicans, unfortunately--40 in the House--have vowed \nto vote against any increase in the debt limit no matter how much \ndeficit reduction accompanies it. I am not aware of a single Democrat \nwho has drawn such a dangerous, Draconian line in the sand. Remember, \nit is not future spending you are voting against. You are voting \nagainst paying your bills, paying your debt. Every American family has \nto do it. Every American worker has to do it. To say the government \nshould not do it is unprecedented.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to reevaluate \ntheir position. It is time for Republican leaders to do some much \nneeded soul searching. Are they willing to risk an economic cataclysm \nto mollify an extreme wing of their party and score political points \nagainst the President? Do they want us to be remembered in the history \nbooks as the first generation of Americans to renege on our \nobligations? Will they put their country before party, come to the \nbargaining table, and forge a bipartisan path forward?\n  Similar to most Americans, I am a natural optimist. Sure, I don't \nhave much evidence on which to base my optimism, when Republicans walk \nout on negotiations time after time when they don't get their way. But \nI nevertheless possess an innate belief that at the end of the day, we \nwill do what is best for our country and our economy; we will raise the \ndebt limit, pass a far-reaching deficit reduction package that includes \nboth spending cuts and repeal of tax breaks for the richest few among \nus. As the President recently put it--and he was, whether intentionally \nor not, quoting a great thinker from ancient Babylon--``If not now, \nwhen?''\n  Let us hope we arrive at an agreement soon. Time is, unfortunately, \nnot on our side.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/12/senate-section/article/S4497-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4497-S4498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                ETHANOL\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I am here to talk about the recent \nbipartisan compromise on biofuels. I have come to the floor a number of \ntimes to talk about this country's biofuels policy.\n  In the last month, I have worked on a bipartisan basis with Senator \nFeinstein of California and Senator Thune of South Dakota to develop a \ncompromise agreement that represents a good-faith effort to improve our \nenergy policy under very difficult economic times.\n  At a time of bitter budget debates and entrenched positions, we \nworked together to find common ground and we took a step in the right \ndirection and that is a step of reducing the debt immediately by $1.3 \nbillion of the $2 billion remaining on the subsidy. I will add that \nthis is a subsidy this Congress voted for just in January of this year. \nThe biofuels industry understands this subsidy was going to end at the \nend of this year, but they didn't just let it whittle away toward the \nend every year, knowing there was waning support for it; they came to \nthe table and said let's see if we can do something good for energy \npolicy and for this country's fiscal position.\n  Under this deal, the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit will expire \nat the end of the month, instead of the end of 2011, as scheduled.\n  I have continued to say this debate is not about whether we end this \ntax credit; it is about how we do it. This compromise agreement \nrepresents a responsible and cost-effective approach to reforming our \nNation's biofuels policy.\n  First, this compromise dedicates $1.3 billion or two-thirds of the \nremaining ethanol subsidies in savings toward deficit reduction. It \ngoes right into the coffers of the government to reduce the debt. At a \ntime when our country is struggling with increasing debt and partisan \nbickering, the compromise represents a step forward. Two-thirds of the \nmoney goes toward the debt.\n  What happens to the rest of the money? Normally, it would be going \ninto that tax credit--$400 million every month--for the rest of this \nyear. Instead, we take that existing $668 million--the other third--and \nuse it to extend and expand support for the production of cellulosic \nbiofuels. As the occupant of the chair knows, coming from New \nHampshire, we have a lot of cellulosic biofuels in the Midwest, but it \nis something you can see all over the country. It is a commitment to a \nnew generation of fuel--algae, biofuels, switchgrass, you name it.\n  There are a lot of possibilities here when you look at what could be \nthe next generation of cellulosic ethanol. In fact, many of the first \nadvanced biofuels plants are expected to be retrofitted onto existing \ncorn-based ethanol facilities, providing additional benefits to rural \ncommunities.\n  This compromise also extends the small-producer tax credit for 1 year \nat a reduced rate. This tax credit benefits smaller ethanol plants, \nwhich were some of the earliest pioneers in the industry and often \nstructured as farmer co-ops. Again, this is not new money. The money is \nending, under our plan, as of July 31 for the tax credit. It simply \ntakes one-third of the existing money and uses it in a smart way so \nthat Congress won't have to spend any new money on very important \nareas, such as cellulosic biofuels. This extension helps provide small \nethanol plants located in rural communities a glidepath to adjust to \nthe elimination of the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit.\n  Lastly, the compromise invests in the infrastructure we need to bring \ngreater competition to the fuel market. This means extending tax \ncredits--the existing money--to help gas stations install a variety of \nfuel-dispensing technologies, including ethanol, hydrogen, natural gas, \nand electric charging stations.\n\n[[Page S4498]]\n\n  So let me again repeat that this is not just about biofuels, it is \nabout all kinds of alternative energy that competes with oil. We should \nencourage our homegrown fuels to compete with foreign oil, and this \ninvestment will help do just that and give consumers a real choice at \nthe pump. I have always believed we should be investing in the farmers \nand workers of our country instead of the oil cartels in the Mideastern \ncountries.\n  The ethanol industry should be commended for coming to the table to \noffer over $1 billion in savings during these difficult budget \ndiscussions. I think this is most significant for some of the \ndiscussions Senator Schumer was having and we have all been having \nabout the debt. This compromise, while it may be $1 billion instead of \n$1 trillion, is an example of what we can do if we are really serious \nabout reducing our debt. It is a model for what can happen to reduce \ngovernment subsidies going forward.\n  Take for example the oil industry. Traditional ethanol is a maturing \nmarket providing only about 10 percent of America's fuel supply--10 \npercent of the fuel supply. We are now at the point where we are making \nmore biofuels than we import oil from Saudi Arabia. That is pretty \nsignificant, but we are still only 10 percent with biofuels.\n  How about oil? Well, the rest is oil. The oil industry has been a \nmature industry and collected subsidies for nearly 100 years. Americans \nhave shouldered these costs for too long. The oil companies no longer \nneed these tax breaks, and we simply can't afford them when we look at \nthe debt we are facing.\n  The list of the oil production tax deductions includes the domestic \nmanufacturing tax deduction for oil production, costing $18.2 billion \nover 10 years; the expensing of intangible drilling, costing $12.5 \nbillion to taxpayers over 10 years; the percentage depletion allowance, \ncosting $11.2 billion over 10 years; and the dual-capacity rule for \nforeign tax credits, costing $10.8 billion to taxpayers over 10 years.\n  The question isn't about whether the oil companies deserve the \nprofits; it is a question about whether the American people should pay \nthe cost of providing preferential tax treatment for the five largest \noil companies in the United States, which have racked up almost $1 \ntrillion in profits in just the past decade. That is the issue. When we \nare dealing with this debt, when we are dealing with a debt where \nmiddle-class families are paying multiple amounts every single year--\nmultiple dollars in interest on our debt--should they also be asked to \nfoot the bill to pay for these subsidies to oil companies when these \noil companies have made almost $1 trillion in profits in the past \ndecade? That is the issue. It is a question about whether the mature \noil industry should continue to receive billions in subsidies at a time \nwhen their profits are up 30 percent in the first quarter of 2011.\n  I am not against drilling at all. I am pleased about what is going on \nin North Dakota, right to our west. But when I look at what is \nhappening with this debt right now, we have to be smart, and this is \nclearly one place to look for savings. It is a question about whether a \nhugely profitable industry should continue to enjoy lucrative tax \nadvantages at a time when our Nation can least afford it. With oil \nprices much higher than actual costs, the oil industry doesn't need \nextra money from the government.\n  We must get serious about tackling the deficit and putting our \ncountry back on sound fiscal ground. The problem we are facing now is \nnot only a crisis of dollars and cents, it is also a crisis of the \ndivide and the deadlock. It is time to open the deadlock. We did it \nwith biofuels. We came forward with a compromise with Senator \nFeinstein, who has spent her lifetime in the Senate fighting against \nethanol. Senator Thune and I came together on a bipartisan basis and \ngot it done. We did it--two-thirds of their immediate subsidy going to \ndebt reduction.\n  We know this deficit isn't going to fix itself.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 more minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. We all know this debt isn't just going to go away. We \nall know we can't just close our eyes and click our heels and wish our \ndebts away.\n  In their report, the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and \nReform wrote that ``every modest sacrifice we refuse to make today only \nforces far greater sacrifices of hope and opportunity upon the next \ngeneration.'' And they are right. A relatively small industry such as \nethanol is willing to put two-thirds of its tax breaks on the table for \ndeficit reduction immediately. The much larger and much more profitable \noil industry can certainly afford to do the same, if not more.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/12/senate-section/article/S4498-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4498-S4501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into \na colloquy with my Republican colleagues.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank Senator Klobuchar. She is a \nvaluable Member of the Senate, and she mentioned some savings or \nadditional revenue from tax increases--some were $10 billion, one was \n$8 billion, and I think one was $3 billion. I would just say that over \n10 years, that is how much those changes would raise.\n  I would recall for all my colleagues that we unwisely spent $847 \nbillion on a stimulus package that produced little income, and we are \npaying interest on that of about $27 billion to $30 billion a year. It \nadds up as the years go by, every year, just the interest on that one \nsingle expenditure.\n  We have now gone 804 days without a budget in this body. During that \ntime, this country has spent $7.3 trillion. That is $7,300 billion. We \nhave paid in interest on the money we have borrowed $439 billion just \nin that period of time we haven't had a budget. Interest on our debt is \n$439 billion in 804 days. And we have accumulated, during this time, an \nadditional $3.2 trillion in debt. During the past 2 years, under the \nsuper Democratic majority here in the Senate and in the House--60 \nDemocratic Senators and the President's leadership--the discretionary \nnondefense spending went up 24 percent, and the President proposes in \nhis budget next year to increase the Education Department, the State \nDepartment, the Energy Department, and the Transportation Department \ndouble-digit increases again, when this year 40 cents of every dollar \nwe spend is borrowed.\n  I am glad my colleagues can be with me now. I see Senator Johnson is \nhere. He is a member of the Budget Committee. We had more people want \nto get on the Budget Committee this year, the new Senators who were \nrecently elected. Senator Johnson was one of the few to be selected. \nAnd they hope to make a difference and to confront the problems we \nface.\n\n  Senator Johnson is a successful businessman. He just joined the \nSenate last year. How has the Senator felt to date about the process?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. I appreciate the kind words. My background \nis in accounting, and I have been in business for 34 years. I have \nproduced budgets for people on time. I have had people produce budgets \nfor me on time. I look at the process--or the lack of a process here as \nabsurd. Think about it. I have certainly produced budgets for smaller \nbusinesses--let's say a $10 million company. They would go through an \nawful lot of detail to draw up a budget. Talk about a little bit larger \nbusiness, maybe a $1 billion-per-year business. There would be a lot of \npeople involved, a lot of detail, and all that information filters up \nto the top. Then you come here to Washington and you see business as \nusual. I just want to make sure the American people understand how \nabsurd this process is, the fact we haven't passed a budget in the \nSenate in over 2 years.\n  We now have the President--at least he has finally gotten engaged \nthis last week. They are meeting behind closed doors. Is it really true \nthey are going to produce a budget over the course of a couple of \nmeetings--a budget for the Federal Government that would be $3.7 \ntrillion, $3,700 billion worth--and they\n\n[[Page S4499]]\n\nare going to do this behind closed doors, just a couple of people? That \nis an absurd process.\n  The fact is, I am glad the President finally acknowledged Medicare is \nunsustainable. That is a sad fact. I wish it weren't so, but the first \nstep, of course, in any process of being healed is to acknowledge that \nyou have a problem. So I am glad the President finally acknowledged \nMedicare is unsustainable. But if he was really serious about \nstructural reform, if he was really coming to the table in good faith, \nhe would have come to the table 6 months ago. He would have been \nsitting down in good faith with Republican Senators, Republican Members \nof Congress, who understand how urgent the problem is, who want to work \nwith this President, who want to work with anyone who is willing to \nseriously address the fact that we are bankrupting this Nation.\n  So, again, I find this process absurd. And I would ask the American \npeople to please think about what is happening here. Rather than an \norderly process, rather than a process being conducted in the light of \nday, we are doing it behind closed doors, and there will be something \ndropped, I am afraid, in our laps with no time to review it--another of \nthese bills nobody has time to read. And that is what the financial \nfate of America rests on? I don't think so. It should not be that way.\n  Mr. WICKER. I wonder if my friend would yield on the matter of the \nprocess.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Absolutely. The floor is the Senator's.\n  Mr. WICKER. Of course, the process is important, and it is designed \nfor the President and the Congress to work together to solve these \nproblems. I think the process may be broken, which I think points up \nwhy we really, bottom line, need a constitutional amendment to require \nthe President to submit a balanced budget and to require this Congress \nto enact a balanced budget.\n  You know, the President submitted a budget to us with deficits as far \nas the eye could see. The budget was brought to a vote under sort of an \ninteresting procedure here, and it didn't get one single vote. Not one \nRepublican, not one Democrat would vote for President Obama's budget.\n  We hear rumblings that the Democratic chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee may actually be about to bring a budget forward. It has been \n800 days. We passed the 800-day mark last week. The chairman of the \nBudget Committee and the process have failed to work to actually bring \na budget out to the floor, out from behind closed doors, as my friend \nfrom Wisconsin had said, and let us vote on all of these procedures.\n  So I would simply say the President's budget was a nonstarter. I \nthink if the Senate Democratic version ever were to be devised and \nbrought to the floor, it would be a nonstarter, which is why we haven't \nseen such a proposal in 800 days.\n  Bottom line: Republicans are united on this side in resisting tax \nincreases on our economy at a time when we are at 9.2 percent \nunemployment, and we are united--all 47 of us--in saying we need a \nbasic change in the process in this country of enacting a balanced \nbudget amendment and sending that amendment out to the States for \nratification. That would be the type of process reform I think the \nAmerican people agree we need.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask my colleague, Senator Lee from \nUtah who just joined us, his late father was Solicitor General of the \nUnited States and law school dean, and we are glad that Senator Lee has \nput a lot of effort in drafting a constitutional amendment, the good \nlawyer that he is, that would make a difference for our country.\n  Maybe the Senator would share his thoughts about his observations as \na new Senator on how things are going and why he believes a \nconstitutional amendment, as Senator Wicker from Mississippi said, \nwould be helpful for our country and help put us on a sound path for \nthe future.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, the need has never been greater for us to \navoid gimmicks. Gimmickry in this context can have very high stakes and \ncan prove most detrimental to our economy and to the ability of our \ngovernment to function.\n  We have to look out for those gimmicks that would say we are going to \nmake a few cuts now, but most of the cuts we are going to propose in \nreturn for our ability to raise the debt limit will involve sacrifices \nby future Congresses, not the 112th Congress. We will just make a few. \nBut we will say that the 113th and the 114th and successive Congresses \nafter will make the difficult necessary sacrifices.\n  We can't do that. Nothing allows us to bind a future Congress. That \nis why we need something that is gimmick free. That is why we need to \namend our laws of laws, our U.S. Constitution, to place important, \nmeaningful, permanent restrictions on the ability of Congress to engage \nin perpetual reckless deficit spending of the sort that has produced a \nnational debt now fast approaching $15 trillion, to a degree that is \nescalating now at a rate in excess of $1.5 trillion every single year.\n  In order to rid the problem, we have to change the root causes. We \nhave to change the ability of the Congress to exercise its authority \nthat it has so severely abused in recent decades under clause 2 of \narticle I, section 8 to engage in deficit spending. A balanced budget \namendment, the balanced budget amendment that has been endorsed and \nembraced and cosponsored by all 47 Republicans in the Senate will do \nthat. We have a growing number of Republicans, a couple dozen, who have \nnow gotten behind the one proposal that would allow us to approach the \ndebt limit with this in mind, and would require the balanced budget \namendment to be part of that, and I urge my colleagues to support that.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Lee for his leadership and hard work on \nthat. It is not an easy thing to draft something that people would all \nagree with, but I think all the Republicans have signed on to that, and \nwe are happy for that, and I believe this is not an impossible dream.\n  When I came to the Senate in 1997, we had a vote on the balanced \nbudget amendment. It fell one vote short. We got 66; it required 67. \nHow much better off would we have been today, how much less debt would \nwe have placed on our children and grandchildren had that amendment \nbeen passed then? I do think it is time for a national discussion again \non this issue and to make that change, and would wish to point out \nsomething about the debt we now have.\n  The unemployment rate came in disappointingly with only 18,000 jobs \ncreated last month, in June. We look to have 150,000 just to stay \nlevel. Unemployment went up. Economic growth in the first quarter was \nexpected to be much higher than it came in. I think the first number \nwas 1.8. Maybe it has been revised to 2 percent.\n  The Rogoff-Reinhart study has studied debt defaults in countries all \nover the world for eight centuries, a highly respected study. Secretary \nGeithner, the Treasury Secretary, said it is an excellent study and in \nsome ways it underestimates the risk.\n  This study says when your debt reaches 90 percent of the economy, 90 \npercent of the gross domestic product, it pulls down economic growth by \n1 percent to 2 percent. We are now at 95 percent debt to GDP. We will \nbe at 100 percent of debt to GDP by the end of this year.\n  I believe our growth could have been 3 percent instead of 2 percent \nthe first quarter. And 1 percent growth, according to Obama White \nHouse's economic adviser Christina Romer amounts to 1 million jobs \ncreated. So I believe we have lost 1 million jobs that could have been \ncreated, we have lost additional tax revenue and growth and prosperity \nthat would help us deal with our debt because of the debt. You see, you \ncan't keep borrowing.\n  Maybe when we get our GDP was 30 percent--maybe that is what it was \nwhen Senator Wicker probably came to Congress and now we are at 100 \npercent. Our debt is as large as the entire productivity of our \neconomy, and economists tell us it is pulling down our growth and it is \ncosting jobs. Americans are not working today because of debt, and what \nwe hear is, Don't worry about it; debts don't matter.\n  Senator Wicker has been here in the House and in the Senate. Has the \nSenator seen the situation in which our financial crisis, short term \nand long term, systemically is more severe than it is today?\n  Mr. WICKER. Well, I guess I got to the House in 1995; my friend from \nAlabama came to the Senate 2 years later.\n\n[[Page S4500]]\n\nI don't think we could have imagined an annual deficit of $1.5 trillion \nin 1 short year. We are spending that much more than we are taking in. \nIn other words, we take in $2.2 trillion a year, approximately, and we \nspend $3.7 trillion a year, a difference of $1.5 trillion. I don't \nthink we ever expected it to get that serious when the Senator from \nAlabama and I first got here.\n  Clearly there is no way we can turn back the clock, but the Senator \nis correct. If we had enacted with just one more vote in this very body \na constitutional amendment to balance the budget, clearly we would not \nbe facing this fiscal crisis.\n  I want to also make a very important point, and it is what all of the \npapers are talking about, and that is whether somehow a tax increase \ntargeted to deficit reduction is the thing to do.\n  Listen, my friends, Republicans and Democrats over time until \nrecently have been united in saying tax increases are a bad thing to \ndo. I want to ask my colleagues if they can help identify the public \nofficial who said this quote:\n\n       The last thing you want to do is to raise taxes in the \n     middle of a recession, because that would take more demand \n     out of the economy and put businesses in a further hole.\n\n  Would any of my colleagues care to guess? Senator Lee?\n  Mr. LEE. That was President Obama in the middle of 2009 who made that \ncomment.\n  Mr. WICKER. Absolutely. Somehow the President, who made a very cogent \nand correct statement in 2009, has completely changed his tune now.\n  We could have a budget deal in place on the floor of the House and \nSenate and ready to be passed if the President of the United States \nwould simply come back to the position he took in 2009 and 2010. As \nlate as December of 2010, the President was telling the New York Daily \nNews we should keep the tax rates in place. The budget chairman in the \nSenate told Reuters last July, only 1 year ago, that he supported \nextending the tax cuts and keeping them in place, because to raise \ntaxes on the private sector during a time of economic downturn is \ntaking money out of the private sector and killing its ability to \ncreate jobs.\n  I would simply call on my colleagues from the other side of the aisle \nto return to the position they had 1 year ago and 2 years ago. Let's \nget a budget deal that addresses the debt by cutting spending and be \nunited as we were on that issue some 1 year and 2 years ago.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Senator Johnson, as I recognized, is a businessman. \nPresident Clinton recently said we need to reduce our corporate tax \nrate. I was on a TV show with Senator Bill Nelson, my good Democratic \ncolleague, who said we ought to reduce some of these tax expenditures, \nas some call them. My understanding was we could use that to help get \nour rates down so we are more competitive worldwide and create more \njobs.\n  I guess my question is, if you simplify the Tax Code and you \neliminate gimmicks, should the money be applied, as President Clinton \nsuggested, to reducing our rates so we are more competitive or should \nthey be used to subsidize more spending by Washington?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Well, obviously it makes more sense to \nactually use them to make us more competitive so that global capital \nactually flows to the United States to create jobs here.\n  I am a long-term job producer. I certainly recognize it is the \nprivate sector that creates long-term self-sustaining jobs. I am afraid \nthat is what our colleagues on the other side of the aisle and \nPresident Obama simply don't understand.\n  I am often asked, Are you surprised by anything in Washington? I will \ntell you one thing I am not surprised about is that their solution is \nincreasing taxes. Let's face it, we just undertook a $4 trillion \nexperiment in Keynsian economics. We are down more than 2 million jobs \nsince that grand experience began when President Obama became elected. \nIt doesn't work. And now for the Democrats and President Obama \nproposing $1 trillion, $2 trillion or, as was pointed out, as much as \n$2.8 trillion in new taxes? What is that? That is actually taking money \nout of the private sector where real jobs are created. That would be \nthe wrong direction. That would be a big mistake. That is why the \nRepublicans are united in saying increasing taxes at any time, \nparticularly in a weak economy, is the wrong prescription.\n  Getting our debt and deficit and spending under control, a balanced \nbudget amendment is the solution. It can actually be enacted very \nquickly. We don't have to face the crisis that President Obama and the \nTreasury Secretary are trying to whip up here.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would say that I do believe we are at a national \ncrisis with our debt. I believe it endangers the Nation, because \nErskine Bowles, who chaired the Debt Commission appointed by President \nObama, has told us that we are facing an economic crisis as a result of \nthe debt in written testimony to the Budget Committee, and he warned \nthat we have to change our course. I certainly believe that is true; \nand I believe the Rogoff and Reinhart study, affirmed by Secretary \nGeithner, is correct, that it is already pulling down our growth. I am \nworried about the future of our country.\n  Maybe Senator Lee will wrap up for us. He just finished a campaign, \ntalking to hundreds of thousands of people in his State. What is the \nSenator's perception of what we need to be doing at this point in time?\n  Mr. LEE. The American people expect us to stop burying our children \nand our grandchildren under a mountain of debt, to stop spending money \nwe don't have, particularly when we are spending about 40 cents out of \nevery dollar that is borrowed, much of that being borrowed from foreign \nsovereign governments such as China.\n  Obviously there are times when as a country we have needed to do \nthis, when our circumstances have required it. The reason Congress was \ngiven this power to begin with is to make sure that, particularly in a \ntime of war, Congress had the means at its disposal to provide for our \nnational defense and to provide for other immediate emergent needs.\n  But this practice of what I refer to as perpetual deficit spending \nhas become not just something we do on an emergency basis, not just \nsomething we do in a time of war or other kind of unusual circumstance; \nit has become something we do as a matter of course to keep things \nmoving, to keep business as usual operating in Washington to the point \nwhere we are accumulating over $1.5 trillion a year in new debt.\n  Our constituents in every single State expect more and they deserve \nbetter. The reason for this has everything to do with the fact that \nthis unites people along every point along the political spectrum. \nWhether you are a conservative and you care about the deficit because \nyou want to protect our national defense system or because you care \ndeeply about our economy or whether you are a liberal and you care \nabout the deficit because you are concerned about what this will do to \nour entitlement programs, all of those things stand in grave jeopardy \nas a result of this practice of spending, this practice that will \nresult in the U.S. Government having to spend a lot more money every \nsingle year to pay interest on the national debt, interest that doesn't \nbenefit anyone, interest that crowds out private investment and kills \njobs. That is what voters in my State and every State are concerned \nabout.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator. Madam President, I would cite that \nthe interest factor my colleague mentioned is very real.\n  This year we are expected to pay $240 billion in interest. How much \nis that? That is just a number. The amount of money that we spend under \nthe Federal Highway Program is $40 billion. The amount of money we \nspend on Federal aid to education is $100 billion. This year we are \npaying $240 billion.\n  However, under the budget that was submitted to the Congress by the \nPresident--the Democratic Senate has never brought one forward on their \nown--that budget added $13 trillion more to the debt, and the \nCongressional Budget Office, our nonpartisan accountants, has \ncalculated what the interest payment would be in the 10th year of that \n10-year budget. It has concluded the interest payment that year would \nbe $940 billion. That is larger than Medicare, it is larger than \nMedicaid, it is larger than Social Security, it is larger than the \ndefense budget. These numbers are incredibly large and\n\n[[Page S4501]]\n\nwe cannot--as a gentleman told me at a townhall meeting--borrow our way \nout of debt. We cannot keep spending. It is dragging down our economic \ngrowth right now. It is costing jobs right now.\n  There are some people who say we do not have enough jobs; we need to \nspend more. Where are we going to get that money? Borrow that money. We \nare already borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend. Can we afford \nto borrow more to try to get a sugar high, keep growth artificially \ngrowing now? I think we just have to be mature, grownup, and realize we \nare going to have to work our way out of this fix.\n  We can do it if we create stability and soundness in our economy. If \nwe do this right we can create a system in which we can have growth. \nOur business community is hanging in there. They are doing pretty well. \nThey are holding up, but we have to create jobs. We have to have more \njob growth and more growth in the entire economy. That is what we need.\n  I do believe the debt is a weight on us. It is a burden that is \nreducing growth, and we must have that to pull our way out of this \ncrisis. I am glad to see the President has joined in the discussions, \nbut I have to say I think he has moved from the budget he submitted \njust a few months ago, which was the most irresponsible budget ever \nsubmitted to Congress calling for more taxes, more spending, and more \ndebt. In other words, over the period of 10 years his budget laid out \nthat taxes would go up, the spending would go up more than the taxes, \nand the deficit would go up more than the current path we are on. It \nmade it worse.\n  We cannot do that. When that budget was brought to the floor--I \nbrought it to the floor--and we got a vote, it failed 97 to 0.\n  I am glad the President is working now. Together we have to somehow \ndevelop a strategy to put us on a course so all Americans and the \nbusiness community in our country and the world financial community \nwill say: Boy, the United States is getting their act together. They \nare making the right decisions. They are on a sound course now. Maybe \nthat is where we need to put our money instead of some other place \nbecause they are on the right path. Right now it is very dangerous.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/12/senate-section/article/S4501-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4501-S4503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DAUNTING CHALLENGE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have been participating in the White \nHouse meetings with President Obama and the leaders of the House and \nSenate from both Democratic and Republican Parties for the last several \ndays discussing the deadline we face of August 2, where we are required \nto extend the debt ceiling of the United States and the larger question \nabout what we will do with our Nation's deficit and debt. It is a \ndaunting challenge but one with a sense of immediacy. Most people \nacross America would just react intuitively and say: Please, no more \ndebt. They wonder why we want to extend the debt ceiling. It is a part \nof our government and part of our economy that needs at least a little \nbit of explanation.\n  Imagine that you have decided to purchase a home and you have a \nmortgage. To stay in your home and enjoy it, you have to make your \nmonthly mortgage payment. When the time comes, if you do not make your \nmonthly mortgage payment, you run the risk of being pushed out of your \nhome, evicted, foreclosed. That is what we face on August 2, in a \ndifferent form. If we fail to extend the debt ceiling, we are, in fact, \nmissing our mortgage payment, and it creates problems. The credit \nrating of the United States of America will suffer as the credit rating \nof any family would suffer if they did not make a mortgage payment. The \nlikelihood that the United States could borrow more money soon without \nhigher interest rates is diminished. In fact, we would face higher \ninterest rates--our government would--if we did not extend our debt \nceiling. That is not the only problem. Higher interest rates for our \ngovernment mean more taxes have to be paid by our citizens to finance \nour debt, and interest rates across America will go up as well. So \naverage citizens and families who had nothing to say with this \nextension of the debt ceiling are going to face higher interest rates \nwhen it comes to purchases that they might make for cars and homes and \nappliances. It would be the height of irresponsibility not to extend \nthe debt ceiling.\n  Since 1939, I was told this morning, we have consistently, time after \ntime, extended the debt ceiling of America without fail. We have never \ndefaulted. We have never called into question the full faith and credit \nof the United States. We have never jeopardized our credit rating in \nthe world by failing to meet this responsibility, and we cannot do it \nnow. With an unemployment rate of 9.2 percent, with an economy still \nrecovering very slowly, we cannot run the risk of creating more \nunemployment and hurting businesses with higher interest rates, and so \nwe have to do it.\n  At the same time, though, we are embarking on an important, strategic \nnational discussion about our deficit and debt. I don't know whether I \nam fortunate or unfortunate. For the past year and a half I have been \nengaged in this conversation in a much more focused way than at any \ntime in my career. I was appointed to be a member of President Obama's \ndeficit commission. There are 18 of us, and I have stayed on to work \nwith 5 of my colleagues, 2 Democratic Senators and 3 Republican \nSenators, to see if we can come up with a bipartisan approach to deal \nwith a very difficult problem.\n  Let me give a few facts and a little history that puts it in \nperspective. Today, for every dollar our government spends in America, \nwe borrow 40 cents. I just left the meeting of the Chinese-American \nInterparliamentary Union where members of the Chinese Parliament are \njust a few steps away. China is our No. 1 creditor in the world. China \nloans more money to the United States, buys more of our debt, than any \nother Nation. That is worrisome because China, though it is our largest \ncreditor, is also our largest competitor.\n  Go to your local Big Box store and flip the product over and see \nwhere the product is made. Time and time again they are made in China. \nSo this country that is financing our debt is also competing with \nAmerican producers and workers. It is not a healthy situation. The more \ndependent we are on these countries to finance our debt, the weaker our \neconomy. So reducing the amount of money we borrow is in our economic \nbest interest, and it lessens the chance that our children and \ngrandchildren will have to pay off the debts we incur.\n  What is the status of the debt in America? It is about $14.5 \ntrillion, but it has not been at that level before, and it has not been \nat that level for a long time. It is likely to go up. Just to give a \nperspective on it, 10 years ago--just 10 years ago--the national debt \nof America was $5 trillion. Now it is $14.5 trillion. Mr. President, $5 \ntrillion. It was the end of the Clinton Presidency, and as President \nClinton left office we had 3 straight years of Federal budget surplus. \nWe were bringing in more revenue than we were spending. It was healthy \nbecause the excess we collected we put into programs such as Social \nSecurity to make sure they would be there for years and years to come. \nPresident Clinton, as he left office with a $5 trillion national debt, \nwhich was the debt accumulated across the history of America, and \nsurpluses coming in each year, said to the incoming President, George \nW. Bush: Next year's budget is going to generate another surplus, $120 \nbillion. Welcome to Washington.\n  President Bush became President, and now fast-forward 8 years later. \nWhat happened? The $5 trillion national debt during the Bush \nadministration grew to almost $11 trillion. It more than doubled in an \n8-year period of time. Instead of leaving President Obama a surplus, \nPresident Bush said: Next year's budget is going to have a $1.2 \ntrillion deficit. Mr. President, a $1.2 trillion deficit. So the \nPresident\n\n[[Page S4502]]\n\nfaced the largest single annual deficit as he came to office, President \nObama, and a national debt that had more than doubled in the previous 8 \nyears. How does one double the national debt of America in 8 years?\n  From George Washington until the end of President Clinton, the net \nnational debt of America was $5 trillion. How did it more than double \nin 8 years? Here is how: You wage two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and \nyou don't pay for them. You add them to the national debt. Then you do \nsomething that no President has ever done in the history of the United \nStates, in the middle of a war, with annual deficits: you cut taxes. It \nis counterintuitive. You are taking revenue away from the government \nwhen it needs it to pay for a war and to continue the functions of \ngovernment. So there were unpaid-for wars and tax cuts primarily for \nthe wealthy people in America, followed by programs that were not paid \nfor. Put those three together and build into it an economic theory that \nif we just keep cutting taxes on high-income individuals, America will \nget well. The theory fails, and the debt of America doubles in 8 years. \nThat is what happened. It is a fact. It went to $10.5 trillion from $5 \ntrillion in just 8 years, and we know what we have gone through since. \nPeople are out of work, folks are struggling to get by, and businesses \nare struggling. That is a reality of where we are.\n  So when we come together to talk about dealing with this debt, it is \na painful topic, and it affects every single American. Here is what we \nfound on the Bowles-Simpson Commission: Any serious conversation about \nreducing America's debt requires cutting spending and raising revenue. \nIf we do not do those two things, it will not work. What do we cut? \nWell, almost everything. We take a look across the board at all Federal \nspending, whether it is discretionary spending for domestic purposes or \nfor defense purposes. We take a look at the entitlement programs, \nprograms such as Medicare, Medicaid, veterans, agriculture, and we see \nwhere we can save money there. And we look at revenue. Where can we \ncome up with revenue that will not hurt the economic recovery but will \nhelp us bring our debt under control? The deficit commission came to \nthat conclusion, other Senators have come to that conclusion, and now \nwe are debating it again with the President on a daily basis in the \nWhite House.\n  This morning my colleagues from the Republican side of the aisle came \nwith their solution--at least one of their solutions. It is not a new \nidea. In fact, it is an idea that has been around a long time. It is \ncalled a balanced budget constitutional amendment. We first saw the \nmove for a balanced budget constitutional amendment in modern times \nduring President Reagan's Presidency. It was interesting.\n  President Reagan increased the debt limit of the United States more \nthan any other President. He ran up the highest deficits of any \nPresident in history before him and had this push on to amend the \nConstitution. It is ironic that at the same time members of his party \nwere spending the money and plunging us in debt, they said the answer \nwas to change the Constitution--not change their conduct, not change \nthe way they managed the government, but change the Constitution. It is \nlike saying: I will not tell you I am going to stop stealing, but I \nwill tell you I will vote for the Ten Commandments. It doesn't work.\n  We have it within our power, as Members of the Senate and the House, \nto change the way we spend money in Washington. To say we are going to \nwait for a constitutional amendment to get it done is to submit it to \nthe States and let them see if three-fourths of the States agree we \nshould amend the Constitution. How long does that take to amend the \nConstitution? The last amendment to the Constitution took 203 years \nbefore all the States--three-fourths of them--got around to ratifying \nit. Some of them take much shorter periods of time, but there is no \nguarantee when the States will get around to doing this if they agree \nwith amending the Constitution.\n  So I ask my friends on the Republican side of the aisle: Instead of \nfocussing on the Constitution, why don't you focus on the here and now, \nthe authority we have as elected Senators and Members of the House to \ndo something, not to give speeches and preach about changing our \nConstitution.\n  I have to tell you, when it comes to this Constitution, I don't \naddress it with fear but with humility. This is a document which is \nrevered not only in the United States but around the world. To say \nthat, well, we are just going to change the Constitution to deal with \ntoday's problems, I am skeptical and I am reluctant and I am humbled by \nthe fact that those words have created the greatest, strongest \ndemocracy on Earth.\n  Before we start changing the words of that Constitution, I always \nsay: Is there another way to do it? The answer is, yes; clearly there \nis. Instead of speeches on the floor of the Senate about constitutional \namendments, why don't we have speeches on the floor talking about the \nbipartisan deficit commission and what we can do about our debt? Why \ndon't we honestly come together and say everything has to be on the \ntable--everything? All spending programs, all entitlement programs, all \ntaxes have to be on the table, and let's take an honest look at how we \ncan address them and make this economy strong and moving forward. That \nis what we face.\n  We have had a bad track record from some Members on the other side of \nthe aisle who give speeches about constitutional amendments but don't \nstick around for the hard choices. We had a chance to put a bill \ntogether into a law that would have made a vote of Congress mandatory \non bringing the budget deficit down dramatically. Seven Republican \nSenators who were cosponsors of that bill when it came to the floor \nvoted against it and defeated it. They walked away from it. We have had \nconversations here where Senators have come together and tried to work \nout our differences on deficits and come up with a plan. In one group I \nhave been part of, one of the Republican Senators walked away from it, \nand it basically was put on hold because of that.\n\n  Vice President Biden was given the authority to sit down in a \nbipartisan conversation and come up with an approach to the deficit and \nthe Republican House majority leader walked away and said, I am not \ngoing to participate. This last week, President Obama was working \ndirectly with the Republican House Speaker, trying to come up with a \nplan over the weekend and the House Speaker said, I am walking away \nfrom it.\n  So the Republican Party has become the ``walk away, Renee'' party \nwhen it comes to this deficit. We have to keep them in the room. They \nhave to stop theorizing about constitutional amendments down the road \nmonths and years from now and deal with the here and now. The reality \nis we need to extend our debt limit, we need to deal with our deficit \nin an honest way, and we need to put everything--underline everything--\non the table. That is painful on our side of the aisle when it comes to \nentitlement programs and it is painful on their side of the aisle when \nit comes to taxing those in higher income categories. But until we \nreach that point, this conversation is going to continue to lead to \nmore debt, more money being borrowed from China, and an economy that is \nnot going to get back on its feet.\n  I think we can do this in a responsible fashion. I hope we can have a \nbipartisan approach to it. It is the only way it will work. With a \nRepublican House and a Democratic Senate, we need a bipartisan \napproach. We will be returning this afternoon with the President to \ndeal with this, to work on approaches to it, and I hope we can get \nsomething done in a positive fashion.\n  This morning Senator McConnell said some interesting things I wish to \naddress. Senator McConnell is the Senate Republican leader. He implied \nthat this debate should be fairly easy. I wish he were right. He said \nthe Republicans have been the party that has brought an open mind to \nthese discussions. Well, I don't think that is a fact that can be \nproven based on what I said earlier.\n  He said:\n\n       The suggestion has been made that this debate was hinged on \n     the question of whether or not the two parties could find a \n     solution to our economic problems without raising taxes. \n     Wrong. We could have done that without breaking a sweat.\n\n  He added:\n\n       It's no secret how to solve the entitlement crisis either. \n     Any one of the people involved\n\n[[Page S4503]]\n\n     in these discussions could write it out on the back of an \n     envelope.\n\n  Perhaps that is part of the challenge here. I know the Republican \napproach to Medicare is much different than the Democratic approach. \nThe House Republican budget would have dramatically changed Medicare as \nwe know it. It would have doubled the out-of-pocket expenditures of \nsenior citizens. It would have put the Medicare Program in the hands of \nprivate health insurance companies. Unfortunately, it would have put \nmany seniors in their sixties, seventies, and eighties at the tender \nmercies of health insurance adjusters. That is not a good approach to \nhealth care for our seniors.\n  The challenges we face are not easy, they are not cosmetic, and they \ncan't be solved by letting the market--meaning insurance companies--run \nMedicare.\n  In these negotiations, I believe many Democrats, myself included, are \nwilling to sit down and talk about reductions in government spending. \nEven though I believe in my heart of hearts our economy needs a \nstimulus at this point and reducing spending may be exactly the wrong \nthing to do, I am still prepared to sit at the table and find a \nconsensus if we can when it comes to spending cuts.\n  But we shouldn't make this economic challenge be subject to \ndramatically changing the benefits under Social Security and Medicare \nand Medicaid. These programs are critical for families across America. \nSome of them have watched their savings disappear, their pension plans \nevaporate in a bankruptcy court, and they count on Social Security. We \nhave to be there to make sure Social Security will be there for them.\n  Senator McConnell also wants the Senate and the American people to \nthink Republicans are negotiating in good faith and the Democrats are \nnot. He said:\n\n       We showed a willingness to sacrifice all along even as we \n     made it crystal clear from the outset that tax increases \n     would not be a part of the agreement.\n\n  So I have to ask Senator McConnell: What is it the Republicans are \nwilling to sacrifice in this debate? He went on to say:\n\n       There can be no question by anyone involved in these \n     discussions that Republicans are willing to make tough \n     choices.\n\n  Again, which tough choices? Right now we are at a stalemate in our \nconversations with the President because the Republicans have been \nunable to come up with an approach that will meet the needs of deficit \nreduction.\n  So we need to work together. Both sides need to be willing to make \nthese tough choices and face these challenges. Unless and until we do \nthis on a bipartisan basis, we will not be serving the people who \nelected us.\n  It struck me as I sat in that room the other night--the Cabinet Room \nwith the President--what a rare honor it is for me and for every one of \nus in that room to be there, to be entrusted with this responsibility \nfor this great Nation of over 300 million people who are counting on us \nto do something historic and maybe politically bold. I am prepared to \ndo that. I hope others are as well. I think if we approach it on a \nbipartisan basis, with both sides willing to give, with everything on \nthe table, we can solve this, and we should do it as quickly as \npossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/12/senate-section/article/S4503-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let us be very clear that in terms of the \ndeficit-reduction package that is being debated, we are talking about \nan issue of huge consequence not only for people today but for our kids \nand our grandchildren. This is likely, from a domestic perspective, the \nmost important issue any Member of the Senate or the House will ever \nvote on in his or her political career. This is a huge deal which in \nmany ways will shape the future of America.\n  I know the media refers to the discussion as whether we are going to \nhave a big deal of $4 trillion or whether we are going to have a \nsmaller deal of $2 trillion, but the real issue is whether we are going \nto have a fair deal--a deficit-reduction package that represents the \ninterests of working people and the vast majority of our people or \nwhether we are going to have a deficit-reduction package that ends up \nreflecting the needs of the wealthiest people in this country, who are \ndoing phenomenally well, and the largest corporations, which in many \ninstances are making recordbreaking profits. That is really what the \ndebate is about.\n  The Republican position on deficit reduction has been extremely clear \nand is consistent with their rightwing ideology. Despite the fact that \nour current deficit crisis has been caused by two wars--unpaid for--\nhuge tax breaks that have gone to the wealthiest people in this \ncountry, and a recession caused by the deregulation of Wall Street and \nthe lack of revenue coming in as a result of that recession, our \nRepublican friends are adamant that while the richest people in this \ncountry are becoming much richer, while today we have the most unequal \ndistribution of income and wealth of any major country, where the top \n400 individuals own more wealth than the bottom 150 million Americans--\nthat gap between the very rich and everybody else is growing wider--our \nRepublican friends say the deficit must be balanced on the backs of \nworking families, the elderly, the sick, and the children. No, the very \nrich, the top 1 percent, who now earn more income than the bottom 50 \npercent, should not be asked to contribute one penny more.\n  The Republicans are very clear, despite the fact that corporate \nprofits are soaring, that corporation after corporation is enjoying \nhuge tax loopholes that enable them to make billions of dollars a year \nin profits and not pay one penny in taxes. Republicans say: Sorry, off \nthe table. Large, profitable corporations, with CEOs making millions a \nyear, don't have to contribute to deficit reduction. Only the children \nhave to contribute, the elderly have to contribute, and only working \nfamilies, the unemployed, and the sick have to contribute to deficit \nreduction. We have to balance the budget on the backs of those people. \nBut if you are very rich and getting richer, if you are a profitable \ncorporation, that is off the table. You don't have to contribute a \nnickel.\n  Poll after poll shows that the Republican position and their ideology \nis way out of touch with what the American people need or want. This is \nnot Bernie Sanders talking; this is the American people talking. In \npoll after poll, when the American people are asked, ``What is your \npreferred option in terms of deficit reduction?'' they say it is to ask \nthe wealthy to pay more in taxes. So when our Republican friends say \nthe American people don't want to raise taxes on the wealthy, that is \njust not true.\n  To my mind, what the Republicans are proposing is immoral in terms of \ncoming down heavy on the most vulnerable people in our society, people \nwho are already hurting as a result of the recession. When real \nunemployment is 15 percent, what do you want\n\n[[Page S4504]]\n\nto take out of those people? They do not have any job. We have the \nhighest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world--21 \npercent of our kids living in poverty. They want to cut them even more? \nWe have hunger among senior citizens in this country going up. They \nwant to take away their nutrition programs? Not only is that immoral, \nto my mind, it is bad economics because you don't get the economy \nmoving until working people have some money to go out and buy the goods \nand services that companies are selling.\n\n  To my mind, where the Republicans are coming from on this issue is \nway out in right field and way out of touch with where the American \npeople believe we should go. But having said that, I have to say I am \nvery confused as to where President Obama is coming from on this issue. \nAnd maybe I speak here as an Independent--not a Republican, not a \nDemocrat, but the longest serving Independent in American congressional \nhistory--but I think I speak for the vast majority of the American \npeople on this issue. Where is President Obama on this issue? We know \nwhere the Republicans are coming from. But suddenly, out of nowhere, \nPresident Obama tells us that Social Security cuts have got to be \nplaced on the table.\n  Where does this come from? The President understands that Social \nSecurity hasn't contributed one nickel to our deficit. In fact, Social \nSecurity has a $2.6 trillion surplus today and can pay out every \nbenefit owed to every eligible American for the next 25 years. Social \nSecurity is funded by the payroll tax, not by the U.S. Treasury. The \nPresident understands that. Yet the President has now put on the table \nsignificant cuts in Social Security as well as Medicare, as well as \nMedicaid, despite his knowledge and his previous statements that cuts \nin these programs would be devastating to ordinary Americans.\n  The President of the United States, Barack Obama, in recent \nstatements has talked about the growth of political cynicism in this \ncountry and has argued the American people are sick and tired of \npoliticians who refuse to tackle big issues. There is truth to what he \nis saying. But there is also a bigger truth, and that is the American \npeople are sick and tired and dismayed about candidates who run for \noffice saying one thing, and then, after they are elected, doing \nsomething very different.\n  In that regard, let me mention that when candidate Barack Obama ran \nfor office he told the American people over and over he was going to \nfight to protect the needs of ordinary Americans, and the elderly and \nthe sick and the children. Among many other promises he made during his \ntough campaign against Senator McCain, he said he was not going to cut \nSocial Security benefits. That is what he said over and over.\n  Let me quote then-Senator Barack Obama and what he told the AARP on \nSeptember 6, 2008:\n\n       John McCain's campaign has suggested that the best answer \n     for the growing pressures on Social Security might be to cut \n     cost-of-living adjustments or raise the retirement age. Let \n     me be clear: I will not do either.\n\n  That was Barack Obama in September 2008. So, Mr. President, when you \nask why the American people are frustrated with politicians, why they \nare increasingly cynical, it has a lot to do with candidates who say \none thing and do another. If you told the American people you are not \ngoing to cut Social Security, then don't cut Social Security. Keep your \nword.\n  In case people think: Well, these proposed cuts are not significant; \nthey are trifling, let me quote from a document from Social Security \nWorks, a coalition of many organizations that is doing a great job \ndefending Social Security. And when President Obama and others are \ntalking about cutting Social Security, one of the approaches they are \nlooking at is changing how we do COLAs--how we do CPIs. So this is from \nthat document by Social Security Works:\n\n       The Congressional Budget Office estimates the adoption of \n     the so-called ``Chained-CPI,''--\n\n  Which is what I believe the President is talking about.\n\n     which would be used to determine Social Security's annual \n     COLA under this proposal, would cut benefits by $112 billion \n     over 10 years. The Social Security Administration's Chief \n     Actuary estimates the effects of this change would be that \n     beneficiaries who retire at age 65 and receive average \n     benefits would get $560 less a year at age 75.\n\n  Let me repeat that. They would receive $560 less a year at age 75. \nThat may not seem like a lot of money to some folks around here, but \nwhen you are trying to get by at the age of 75--when you have all kinds \nof medical bills and you have all kinds of prescription drug costs and \nyou are trying to eat, and maybe you are getting $14,000 a year in \nSocial Security--$560 a year is a lot of money.\n  But then it gets worse. Because what the Social Security \nAdministration estimates is that at 85--and more and more people, thank \nGod, are living to 85, people who are very fragile at age 85--people \nwould see cuts of about $1,000 a year. So the longer you live, the more \nyour cuts.\n  Is that what we are about in America now? We don't ask billionaires \nto pay any more in taxes, but we tell somebody who is 85 years of age, \nliving on $14,000 a year, they would get $1,000 less than otherwise \nbecause we have adopted this so-called chained CPI that I gather the \nPresident is pushing.\n  I think the issue is very clear, and that is that the Senate, this \nCongress, have got to stand with the overwhelming majority of the \nAmerican people who understand that the solution to this deficit crisis \nrequires shared sacrifice. Yes, we have to take a look at waste and \nfraud and bureaucracy at every agency of government. No one disputes \nthat. Yes, we have to take a hard look at military spending, which has \ntripled since 1997. And yes, maybe we have to bring the troops home \nfrom Iraq and Afghanistan sooner than many here wish, or that the \nPresident wishes, and save substantial sums as we do that. But most \ncertainly, if we are going to go forward with shared sacrifice, yes, we \ndo have to ask billionaires, who--despite all their power and all their \ncampaign contributions and all of their lobbying--are doing \nphenomenally well, to contribute to deficit reduction. And yes, maybe \nthose companies that stash their money in tax havens in Bermuda and the \nCayman Islands in order to avoid taxes to this country--$100 billion a \nyear--will have to start paying their fair share.\n  On my Web site, which is sanders.senate.gov, I put a letter which \nsaid: Mr. President, stand tall, take on these rightwing idealogs who \nwant to make devastating cuts to working families. In a couple of \nweeks, we have had 135,000 signatures on that letter. I think that \nletter reflects what the American people want. They want shared \nsacrifice. They do not want to see the elderly, the kids, or working \nfamilies being battered more and more, especially in the midst of this \nrecession.\n  I would say to President Obama: Do not assume--do not assume--because \nyou work and reach an agreement that everybody here is going to support \nthat agreement. The American people demand fairness, they demand shared \nsacrifice, and some of us intend to bring that about.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak for up to 7 minutes. I don't believe I will need all of that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I always enjoy listening \nto my New England colleague speak. The rightwing rhetoric stuff, \nthough, doesn't work for me when people of good will on both sides of \nthe aisle are trying to solve these problems.\n  We are working on a sense of the Senate here today, and I am rising \nto speak about my own sense of the Senate. It is an amendment I filed \nto this bill we are on addressing a key commonsense idea. It is very \nsimple: Don't raise taxes on small businesses, period. But especially \ndon't raise taxes at a time when unemployment is over 9 percent and \nthere is meager job growth throughout the country. Quite frankly, it \nhas stalled out. We can't afford more of the failed economic policies \nwe have been experiencing. Frankly, I can't believe increasing the tax \nburden on small businesses is even on the radar\n\n[[Page S4505]]\n\nscreen here in Washington. It makes no sense to me. I want to do the \nopposite. I think we should respond to these terrible unemployment \nnumbers with a progrowth idea such as a payroll tax deduction for \nbusinesses that hire workers. Let's do something constructive, \nsomething that adds incentives to actually get our economic engine \nmoving again, especially with the businesses that do it best, which are \nsmall businesses.\n  The idea we would raise taxes right now on small businesses is the \nvery definition of being out of touch with the people back home who \nactually work for a living and who create jobs for others. As I travel \nback to Massachusetts--and I do that virtually every weekend--I meet \nwith constituents, and I think I have had over 230 or 240 meetings \nsince I have been elected. The biggest question I am always faced with \nis: What is going on in Washington? Why do you guys always throw a wet \nblanket over us, with overregulation, overtaxation, creating a lack of \nstability and certainty? It is not something that is making a lot of \nsense back home.\n  When I hear from small business people back in Massachusetts, they \nare worried they can't hire more workers. We need to actually create \nconfidence in our small businesses so they will put people back to \nwork. Instead, we are terrifying them with these tax proposals and a \nlot of the rhetoric they are hearing here today. They do not know what \nis coming down. They do not know what is next. People up here listening \nhave no clue what is next. What are we in Washington going to do next \nthat will throw that wet blanket on things? Yet we expect them to hire \na new employee? It is not going to happen.\n  In particular, there have been recent calls from some on the other \nside of the aisle to repeal the LIFO--last in, first out--accounting \nmethod, and applying it retroactively, without even reducing the \ncorporate tax rate or doing anything to soften the blow on small \nbusinesses. That would be disastrous on those who depend on the current \nsystem. As the Presiding Officer knows, our corporate tax rate is \nalready the second highest in the world. If Japan lowers theirs, ours \nwill be the highest. And it is often the small local companies that get \npunished the most. Yet some here in Washington want to tax small \nbusinesses more. I don't get it; I am sorry.\n  Despite these many challenges, in the past decade this country has \nseen the creation of more than 300,000 small businesses--companies with \n500 employees or less. These small firms and the founders who started \nthem took risks during a time many large companies had been downsizing. \nAs a member of the Small Business Committee, I hear testimony regularly \nfrom many of our business leaders expressing the difficulties of the \ncurrent environment, and I believe we absolutely need to do everything \nin our power to protect small businesses from the heavy hand of \ngovernment--the overregulation, the lack of certainty and stability, \nthe potential overtaxation.\n  In Massachusetts and throughout this great country, small businesses, \nand especially manufacturers, have been the key to our economic \nrecovery. They are the economic engines in Massachusetts and the rest \nof the country. They are the lifeblood of our economy. They range from \nmom-and-pop stores to some of the country's most cutting-edge, high-\ntech startup companies. How can we tax these job-creating small \nbusinesses and then stand on the Senate floor and speak about how awful \nit is that unemployment is at an all-time high, cloaking it in the \nlanguage of rhetoric of ``millionaires and billionaires, and corporate \njets.'' We all know, even if we do the things we talk about, it doesn't \nget us close to solving or dealing with the problems.\n  It is outrageous and, quite frankly, the American people can see \nright through it. We should be doing better. So I filed the amendment \ntoday to say that I, for one, will not support more burdens on small \nbusinesses. They already face enough problems and challenges.\n  The current unemployment numbers that we are all seeing from States \nacross the country should serve as a wake-up call that people are still \nhurting. They need some relief. They want to do their best, but they \nare being stifled. That wet blanket is hurting them and stopping them \nfrom creating jobs. It should be our No. 1 priority, and I hope it will \nget the attention and support of every one of my colleagues.\n  If you care about the survival of your State's small businesses, stop \nproposing increasing the taxes, increasing regulatory burdens, creating \nthat wet blanket and killing off the incentive to actually go out and \nhire.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your courtesy in the beginning, and I \nyield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/12/senate-section/article/S4505-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n       Veterans Affairs and Military Construction Appropriations\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I urge Members of this body to support \ncloture on taking up the debate on the veterans and military affairs \nappropriations bill for next fiscal year. Chairman Johnson and I have \nput together a completely bipartisan bill which was unanimously \nsupported by Republicans and Democrats in the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee. This bill basically marked its spending level to the level \napproved by the House of Representatives, that passed the subcommittee, \nthe full committee, and out on the House floor. The bottom line for its \nbudget authority discretionary spending is the bill comes in $1.2 \nbillion below the President's spending request, $620 million below last \nyear's enacted level, and is even $2.6 million below the House. There \nare no earmarks in this bill.\n  A few details. The bill does provide $128 billion to support our over \n22 million veterans. That is $182 million in budget authority \ndiscretionary below the administration's request.\n  The bill provides $13.7 billion for military construction. That is \nabout $1 billion below the administration's request or $279 million \nbelow the House bill.\n  Our Senate bill cuts or eliminates 24 separate projects, and all of \nthose cut decisions were made in coordination with Chairman Levin and \nRanking Member McCain from the draft Senate Armed Services Committee \nbill so that appropriations and authorization are synched up. We also \ncompletely denied funding for the building of a new facility to house \nthe current Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.\n  The bill also lays the policy groundwork for making further spending \nreductions in outyears for Obama administration potential requests for \nfunding in South Korea, Germany, and Bahrain.\n  In short, we believe that this bill should move forward, that the \nAppropriations Committee should begin its regular work, and because \nthis is a unanimous, bipartisan product from the Senate appropriations \nbill and it marks to the House level, I urge Members to support cloture \non a vote we expect tomorrow morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time to talk about the pending \nbusiness: the deficit of this country and the looming debt ceiling \nlimit that will be exceeded in August if we don't take any action in \nthe Congress.\n  First, let me talk a little bit about the debt ceiling. There has \nbeen a lot of talk about the debt ceiling as to what is responsible for \nCongress to do.\n  We all know that over the last 50 years or so, the debt ceiling has \nbeen increased over 80 times. It is done after the fact. That means we \nhave already incurred the liability, and the question is whether we \nwill pay our bills.\n  The decisions we have to make in regard to our fiscal policies need \nto be made at the time we consider the budget, but now we have to pay \nour bills,\n\n[[Page S4506]]\n\nand raising the debt ceiling is not only a legal responsibility that we \nhave to pay our bills, it is also a moral responsibility and speaks to \nwhether we are willing to live up to our obligations.\n  The failure to raise the debt ceiling would be irresponsible. It \nwould jeopardize our national security because it would cost taxpayers \nmore money, and it would say to the world that U.S. bonds, which are \nthe safest in the world, are called into question. I think we all \nshould agree we need to make sure we increase the debt ceiling in time \nso we do not cause those adverse effects to our Nation.\n  The debt ceiling debate gives us an opportunity to do something about \nthe deficit. Our deficit is not sustainable. By that, I mean if we do \nnot change course, our debt will be too large as a percentage of our \neconomy to be sustainable. We need to deal with spending and we need to \ndeal with revenue and bring them into balance.\n  The discussions on the debt ceiling could be the opportunity for us \nto develop a credible plan to manage our deficit, and I certainly hope \nthat is the case, that we come together with a credible plan to manage \nour deficit. I hope it will be bipartisan, that Democrats and \nRepublicans will work together on a plan. It would not be exactly what \neither side wants. In fact, we will both have to make compromises. If \nwe do that, if we have a credible plan, I believe it will stimulate our \neconomy and clearly help us create more jobs, which is the best we can \ndo to help reduce our deficit.\n  To start, we have to understand how we got to this point. Ten years \nago, we had surpluses. Ten short years ago, we had surpluses. We were \nconcerned that we might be retiring all of our privately held debt. I \nwas proud to have been part of the Congress that voted on the \nlegislation that brought our deficits down and gave us a surplus and \none of the longest periods of economic growth in America's history.\n  Then, during the previous administration which inherited that large \nsurplus, policies were brought forward to cut taxes, not once but \ntwice. Many of those tax cuts went to our wealthiest people. The United \nStates went to war in two countries and borrowed money in order to \npursue those wars--I think the first time in modern history the United \nStates went to war and asked the people to sacrifice by cutting taxes. \nThe end result was large deficits, and when Barack Obama became \nPresident, he had huge deficits, unlike George W. Bush, who had huge \nsurpluses. When George W. Bush took the oath of office for the \nPresidency, our economy was growing jobs. When Barack Obama became \nPresident of the United States, we were losing 750,000 jobs a month.\n  That is the current situation. The situation we face today is we have \nthese deficits we have to deal with. How do we deal with them? We need \na balanced approach.\n  I must tell you that I am proud Senator Conrad, on behalf of the \nDemocrats on the Budget Committee, has come forward with a credible \nplan that preserves the priorities of this country to grow and does \nbring our deficit under control. I am proud to be a member of the \nBudget Committee. Working with Senator Conrad, working with my \nDemocratic colleagues, we put together the plan Senator Conrad spoke \nabout on the floor earlier this week.\n  First, the most important aspect of Senator Conrad's budget is that \nit brings down the deficit by $4 trillion over the next 10 years. It \nactually has more deficit reduction than the House-passed so-called \nRyan plan that the Republicans in the House sent over to us. The Conrad \nplan that the Senate Democrats have come up with will bring about more \ndeficit reduction and substantially more deficit reduction than the \nBowles-Simpson commission had recommended because we are using more \naccurate numbers.\n  It would stabilize the debt by 2014. That is a very important point. \nI think what we are all trying to do is manage our deficit and at the \nsame time help our economy. That is what the Conrad budget does. It \nstabilizes the debts by 2014, and it starts with reducing domestic \nspending. When we look at spending generally and what has happened, we \nare now spending about 24.1 percent of our GDP. The Conrad budget over \n10 years would bring that down to 22.1 percent--a substantial \nreduction in our spending programs. Let me tell you, 22.1 percent would \nbe the same amount of government spending as we were spending during \nthe Reagan Presidency. This is not any radical approach to saying we \nare going to spend a lot more money. Instead, we are bringing spending \ndown to the level it was when Ronald Reagan was President of the United \nStates.\n\n  The budget would also deal with our obligations for mandatory \nspending. We took major steps to do that in the last Congress. The \npassage of the affordable care act helped us to put forward a blueprint \nto manage our health care costs as a nation by providing universal \ncoverage, by investing in health information technology, by investing \nin wellness programs, by investing in reducing readmissions to \nhospitals--the list goes on and on. We are getting a handle on health \ncare costs. The CBO says to us that the bill we passed in the last \nCongress would reduce Federal spending by over $1 trillion over the \nnext 20 years. By reducing health care costs, we reduce Medicare and \nMedicaid future responsibilities. So we have already taken some steps.\n  The Conrad budget that the Democrats in the Senate have brought \nforward will build on that to bring about additional savings in \ndomestic spending. But the important thing about the budget Senator \nConrad has brought forward as compared to the Ryan budget, the \nRepublican budget that passed the House, is that the Conrad budget \ninvests in America's future because it is balanced. We invest in what \nis important for job growth in America. We continue to make education a \ntop priority so American families can afford to send their children to \ncollege, so we invest in improving educational opportunities for all \npeople in our Nation.\n  The Conrad budget allows us to invest so America can continue to lead \nthe world in innovation. That has been where we have created so many \njobs. In my own State of Maryland, I look at where the job growth is, \nand I see small innovative companies developing ways to protect our \nNation in cyber security, I see them finding ways to solve our energy \nproblems, moving forward with health technology--all in innovation, all \nfrom the ability to use our creative genius to keep America in the lead \neconomically.\n  The Conrad budget allows us to continue our investments in NIH in \nbasic research. The Ryan budget does not allow us to do that. There are \nsignificant cutbacks in all those areas.\n  The Conrad budget, which the House and Senate Democrats have brought \nforward, allows us to invest in our infrastructure--our roads, our \nbridges, our water systems, our transit systems--so that America can \ntruly be competitive in the future, creating more jobs for the people \nin this Nation.\n  The budget also deals with our military spending. Let me tell you one \nfact that I think the people of this Nation should understand. America \nspends as much on defense as almost the entire amount spent by all the \nother nations of the world. It is difficult to see how our Nation can \ncontinue to grow the way we want to with so much of our budget tied up \nin national defense. We need to figure out a better way and one where \nwe can save money. Between 1997 and 2011, the defense budget of our \ncountry grew from $254 billion a year to $688 billion a year. What does \nthe Republican budget do? They just increase those numbers dramatically \nover the next year, 5 years, 10 years. The Democratic proposal \nrecognizes the reality that we can bring our combat troops home from \nAfghanistan, that we can expect the international community to do more, \nand we can bring about savings on the military side.\n  Let me talk about the last major component of the Conrad budget and \nhow it differs substantially from the Ryan budget; that is, the area of \nrevenues. I know there has been a lot of discussion about revenues. \nWhat does the Democratic budget do in this regard? It takes our \nrevenues to 19.5 percent of our gross domestic product. That is the \nsame amount that was raised during the Clinton Presidency when we had \nunprecedented prosperity and job growth in America. How do we get \nthere? How do we get the revenues we need in order to be able to bring \nthis debt under control? Senator Conrad has given us some direction on \nhow we can do that. He has pointed out that shelters and loopholes need \nto be closed. These are inefficiencies in our Tax Code today.\n\n[[Page S4507]]\n\n  I have taken the floor on two occasions recently to talk about some \nthat I think we should eliminate. One is the ethanol subsidy. We had a \nvote on the floor of the Senate, and the majority of Senators voted in \nfavor of eliminating the ethanol subsidy. Why? Because it is not \nneeded. Ethanol sales are not dependent upon a Federal tax break. \nSecond, it is causing a disruption in the agricultural community. I \npointed out that the poultry industry in Maryland suffers from the high \nprice of corn, costing us jobs. Eliminating the ethanol subsidies is a \nwin-win situation. Why not take that money and use it for deficit \nreduction?\n  I also pointed out the major gas companies in this country are \nreceiving subsidies from the taxpayers. Their profits in the first 3 \nmonths of this year were $34 billion. They certainly don't need the \nhelp from the taxpayers. The taxpayers have already given them too much \nin the price of gasoline at the pump, which has hurt our economy except \nfor the profits of the gasoline companies. So there are tax loopholes, \nand there are shelters that could be closed that amount to a \nsubstantial amount of Federal expenditure. And, yes, the highest income \ntaxpayers, the millionaires and billionaires, is it reasonable or right \nor fair to expect that they should continue to get these lower tax \nrates that were temporarily extended under the Bush administration \nindefinitely when we are trying to figure out ways in which we could \nbring the budget into balance?\n\n  Senator Conrad has made it very clear that there would be no change \nfrom the current tax rates for those families who have $1 million of \nincome or less. I think that is a pretty generous commitment about not \nchanging tax rates, particularly during these economic times.\n  Let's compare the budgets. The Republican budget, the Ryan budget, \nsays: Look, all the savings are going to come out of the spending side \nand, in fact, we are going to have some additional tax cuts--asking \nmiddle-income families to pay more while our wealthiest enjoy even more \ntax breaks.\n  The Democratic budget, submitted by Senator Conrad, says: We are \ngoing to be balanced. Mr. President, 50 percent of our deficit \nreduction is on the revenue side, but that includes reducing tax \nexpenditures, tax spending. We spend money in the Tax Code, $1.4 \ntrillion a year. I don't understand the difference if we are spending \nmore on housing on the Tax Code or spending money on housing on the \nappropriations bill. Both should be subject to the same type of \nscrutiny.\n  So why aren't we using a similar standard? Well, we have a chance to \ndo that in the Conrad budget--50 percent from revenues, including tax \nspending, 50 percent from the direct spending cuts. That is a balanced \napproach. That is a credible approach. It is an approach that will \nprotect our most vulnerable. Our students are protected to make sure we \ncontinue our commitment to education and to the cost of higher \neducation through the Pell grants. Our seniors are protected in that we \ndo not do what the Ryan budget would do with Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Let me remind you, the budget the Republicans passed in the House \nwould change Medicare fundamentally, changing it from a program that \nguarantees benefits to our seniors to a program where seniors would get \na voucher and have to go out and buy from a private insurance company \nand be at the whim of private insurance companies for adequate \nprotection against their health care needs. It is estimated their \nhealth care costs would grow when fully implemented by $6,000 a year. \nThe seniors of Maryland cannot afford an extra $6,000 a year. That will \nbe the difference between an individual getting adequate health care or \nnot.\n  The Conrad budget rejects that type of radical change in our Medicare \nsystem. The Ryan budget would require the block-granting of Medicaid to \nour States. Our States are already burdened. The chances of them being \nable to maintain their commitment to young people who depend on the \nMedicaid system, our seniors who depend upon it for long-term care, is \nvery remote. The Conrad budget protects those programs to make sure we \nlive up to our commitments to provide adequate protection to our \nfamilies and seniors.\n  Social Security is protected in the Conrad budget because Social \nSecurity didn't cause the deficit. Social Security should be considered \noutside the budget debates, and I think more and more of the Members \nare now coming to that conclusion.\n  Let me mention one other point I think is very important about the \nDemocratic budget that Senator Conrad has brought forward. It \nrecognizes our Federal workforce. I know my colleague is particularly \nconcerned about that representing the State of Virginia. I am \nparticularly concerned about that representing the people of Maryland. \nWe have a lot of dedicated Federal workers who have devoted their \ncareers to helping this Nation by protecting our Nation in their \nservice in homeland security or protecting us in regards to how they \ndeal with health services or how they deal with our veterans. These are \ndedicated people, and they have already contributed to this deficit \nreduction. Two-year pay freezes have already been implemented. They \nhave already done their share in helping us bring our budget into \nbalance. The Conrad budget, I am proud to say, says that is enough. \nLet's not jeopardize our Federal workforce by reducing their \ncompensation package in addition to the freezes. It shows we can do it \nthat way.\n  Take a look at the Ryan budget that the Republicans have sent over. \nIt contains major reductions in the compensation packages going forward \nfor our Federal workforce. There is a better way. The better way is the \nConrad budget.\n  Quite frankly, we have a choice. We have a choice on whether we are \ngoing to move forward and how we are going to move forward. I strongly \nsupport a credible plan to deal with the deficit. As I said, we need to \nget our deficit under control, but we can do it in a way that preserves \nopportunities for all Americans, creates job opportunities that are \ndesperately needed for our Nation, and protects America's most \nvulnerable. To me, that is maintaining America's future. That is giving \nus the best hope so our children and grandchildren will enjoy the \nopportunities of this great Nation, and that should be the guiding \nforce for our work.\n  I certainly hope my colleagues will work together so we can come \ntogether for the future of this Nation.\n  With that, I would suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, conversations continue today about \nexactly how we are going to meet the financial obligations our country \nfaces. A fundamental question on hand seems to be do we borrow more and \nspend more or do we make the serious decisions that will get our Nation \nback on sound financial footing.\n  Today, our national debt stands at over $14 trillion. Unemployment \ncontinues to rise, with more than 14 million Americans out of work now, \nand the government continues to spend more money than it collects, or \nthat I believe it should collect.\n  As the cochairs of the President's own fiscal commission have warned, \nif we fail to take swift action, the United States faces, according to \nthem, the most predictable economic crisis in history. A quote \nattributed to many people, including my fellow Missourian Mark Twain, \nwould be that it is hard to make predictions, especially when you are \ntalking about the future. But the easiest to predict is demographics. \nIf you know how many people are here now and have all the other \ndemographic information you need, you should be able to figure out what \nthe population is going to look like.\n  As the population gets older, our programs for seniors will cost \nmore. At his news conference yesterday, President Obama was asked about \nSocial Security reform. He said, in a statement that I didn't quite \nunderstand, that Social Security is not the source of our deficit \nproblem. Then he went on to say that the reason we do Social Security \nin the debt ceiling plan is to strengthen Social Security, to make\n\n[[Page S4508]]\n\nsure benefits are there for the seniors in the outyears.\n  I agree totally. This is the time to deal with Social Security--\nparticularly the time to deal with it if you are going to deal with \nSocial Security in a way that doesn't impact anyone who is retired or \nwho is approaching retirement. The President went on to say the \nRepublicans want to talk about Social Security as part of a broader \ndeal because it is politically difficult to vote on.\n  I actually think a lot of Democrats and Republicans want to talk \nabout Social Security because we know now is the right time to save it. \nIf you are going to save it for future generations, you have to start \nsooner rather than later.\n  Our colleague, Senator Baucus, chairman of the Finance Committee, \nsaid during a hearing in May on deficit reduction and Social Security:\n\n       Addressing our deficits and debt is an economic issue, a \n     national security issue, and a moral issue.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       We have a moral obligation to leave this place better than \n     we found it.\n\n  I agree with his quote. If we are going to leave Social Security \nbetter than we found it, we have to begin to work on it right now. Each \nyear, Social Security costs are higher. This year, they are going to be \n3.6 percent higher than last year. That is a 1-year increase--3.6 \npercent in 1 year. The workers-to-beneficiary ratio--and we know how \nSocial Security works, with people paying in who largely fund the money \ngoing out today. The people paying in in 2035 will be 2.1 for every \nperson working.\n  In the current system, there is no way the pages on the floor today \nare going to be able to pay half of whatever the average recipient \ngets. But that is what you would have to do if we don't change the \nsystem.\n  We have to deal with the deficit facing Social Security. I think we \nneed to deal with that now, whether it is politically difficult or not; \notherwise, there won't be a Social Security Program that works for the \npeople who are paying in today. Social Security no longer collects what \nit spends. We have a $45 billion deficit, or a shortfall, in 2011, and \nthe truth is that we are still cashing in the IOUs to Social Security, \nand we will do that as long as they are there, but eventually those \nIOUs will run out as well.\n  Over the next 10 years, it is projected that we will spend $447 \nbillion more than comes into the Social Security trust fund. According \nto this year's Medicare and Social Security trustees report, Social \nSecurity is now operating under permanent annual deficit for as long as \nthey can calculate. Permanent annual deficits won't work, so what would \nwork?\n  Today, I want to discuss a plan to put Social Security on a path that \nmeans our children and grandchildren can have confidence that the \ncontributions that come out of their hard-earned paychecks will result \nin benefits when they retire. Ask people you know at work who are in \ntheir twenties and thirties if they expect to collect Social Security \nbenefits. Just under 26 percent of voters under 40 believe it is even \nsomewhat likely they will receive all their promised Social Security \nbenefits--26 percent believe it is somewhat likely--not absolute but \nsomewhat likely.\n  And just to give you an idea, 15 percent of people believe Social \nSecurity will be fine if it is not reformed--15 percent--while 20 \npercent of people polled believe aliens exist and live among us. So the \nnumber of people who believe aliens exist and live among us is higher \nthan the number of people who believe Social Security will be fine if \nit is not reformed.\n  The last time the Senate and the House made comprehensive changes in \nSocial Security was 1983. Well, it is time to do it again. It is time \nto do it again, and we can make changes in the program that will not \naffect those who are approaching retirement, though that will be always \nthe charge: They are going to take Social Security from retirees. Well, \nthis is a plan that talks about people who are 55 and younger and no \nchange for anybody who is 55 or older today.\n  So if you are 55 or older, and you hear the discussion about this \nplan, it has nothing to do with you. It will not affect your Social \nSecurity. So that is the first point. The second point is we would need \nto look at a new cost-of-living index that is based on the costs that \nseniors have. The third point is that we need a new distribution \nformula. If we do those three things, we will have a solvent system for \nat least seven decades.\n  In the next 70 years, somebody can look at this to come up with a \nplan to be sure it goes beyond then. But seven decades is about as far \nas we can safely predict anything. This would protect the life of \nSocial Security for at least that long as a solvent system.\n  Most seniors live on a fixed income, and they feel it when their \nutility bills go up, their health care costs go up, or when their food \nprices go up. The current cost-of-living adjustment, the so-called COLA \nformula--calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, known as the CPI \nor the Consumer Price Index--tracks purchases by working-age \nindividuals. Frankly, what working-age individuals buy may be quite \ndifferent from what seniors spend their money on, or at least how most \nseniors spend their money. Many economists believe this causes the CPI \nto misrepresent the inflation that impacts seniors, and seniors deserve \nbetter.\n  For example, the rising cost of education and childcare are heavily \nweighted in the current formula. These costs don't often have the same \nimpact on seniors as they do on the working-age population or the \nyounger population. But health care costs and utility bills, as an \nexample, have more impact on seniors and on the budget of seniors than \nthey do on the working-age population.\n  My plan directs the Bureau of Labor Statistics to develop a more \naccurate method of calculating COLAs for Social Security recipients. It \nwould move to a chain-weighted CPI that accounts for the purchasing \nhabits of individuals--not of all ages--who are over 65, and health \ncare costs would account for a much larger portion of seniors' spending \nin this type of index. What seniors spend their money on is what we \nwould be looking at instead of what everybody who is in the working-age \npopulation spends their money on.\n  This plan will eliminate the program's long-term funding shortfall \nand ensure payments for the next 70 to 75 years. As does the \nPresident's fiscal commission, my plan would account for the increase \nin life expectancy and would call for an increase in the normal \nretirement age.\n  Now, remember, primarily these are for retirees who don't believe \nthey are going to benefit from the system anyhow. Most of the people we \nare talking about who will be impacted don't think the system is going \nto be there for them. We are trying to ensure it will be. Over time, \nthe retirement age changes to 65 years. That is 1 year younger than the \nproposal of the President's commission, but I think it is an age that \nworks, and it looks like it is working as we look through these \nnumbers. This means the retirement age will rise slowly for future \nretirees--3 months for each year from 2022 to 2030. Nobody would be \nimpacted at all until 2022. The person who was going to retire in 2022 \nwould retire 3 months later, and that would be added on every year \nuntil 2030. Likewise, the plan would change early retirement benefits \nfrom 62 to 64 beginning in 2022. So it only, again, impacts people who \nget to that age in 2022.\n  Our current benefit structure is simply not sustainable, and that is \nwhy my plan would also modify the current benefit structure to ensure \nthat seniors who earn at or below the 40th percentile receive exactly \nthe same amount of retirement benefits as they would if the program \ncontinued exactly as it is today, and a new index slightly reduces \nbenefits that would occur above the 40th percentile.\n  Wealthier future seniors can plan for their retirement years through \npersonal savings, through retirement plans, through alternative \ninvestments, through IRAs, or through employer-sponsored plans. But \nthose who are not in that category would continue to get exactly the \nsame benefit when they retire they would get at today's retirement age.\n  So back to President Obama's comments yesterday. Let's look at a plan \nthat does the following, President Obama: Let's look at a plan that has \nno higher rate of contributions, no means test for Social Security \nrecipients, no\n\n[[Page S4509]]\n\ntax on future beneficiaries but slightly lower benefits and a slightly \nlonger time to work until retirement. The difference is, if you work \nuntil retirement, you actually get a benefit.\n  This is no longer a topic we can avoid, so let's not miss this \nopportunity. Let's make a promise right now--while we are dealing, \nhopefully, with big issues--to workers paying the bill today that \nSocial Security will be there for them when they retire.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I rise today to talk about the significant financial \nchallenges our Nation faces.\n  It will come as a surprise to no one that the topic of greatest \nconcern is jobs, jobs in partnership with how we manage our deficit and \nour debt so as to put America on a firm financial footing down the \nroad, put American families back on a firm financial footing.\n  My mailbox is full from families who have a lot of concerns about the \nRepublican plan for cutting programs that serve working Americans. It \nis a host of programs that are affected, but I pulled a couple letters \nto bring with me.\n  One is Linda writing from Canby, OR. She is a parent of a disabled \nyoung adult. She writes:\n\n       My daughter, Nicole, has cerebral palsy and other medical \n     issues. She is dependent on my husband and I for her total \n     24/7 care. Medicaid is essential because it helps her with \n     medical and dental needs and her mobility. If Medicaid is cut \n     or reduced, many of the disabled will be forced to live in \n     nursing homes or institutions, which as we both know would \n     not be cost effective. Please vote against cuts to our \n     Medicaid system.\n\n  Trudy from Keizer, OR, writes a very similar letter about her \ngrandson diagnosed with Asperger's.\n  The mail goes on and on from citizens who are working-class \nAmericans, have fundamental jobs, often with modest to no health care. \nThey have children and they have grandchildren who will be profoundly \naffected by the choices we make on health care, the choices we make on \neducation, and the choices we make in terms of creating jobs here in \nAmerica. So this debate has enormous import for the success of our \nfamilies, and in the context of that importance, we need to understand \nhow we got to the point we are right now. So let's start with a 10-year \nview of what has happened. These statistics might come as a surprise to \nmany of you because they are a little bit out of synch with some of the \nrhetoric we hear on the floor of the Senate.\n  Over the last 10 years, from 2001 to 2011, we have had a revenue \ndecrease of 18 percent. So revenue has decreased by nearly one-fifth.\n  On nondefense spending, you will see no bar here either negative or \npositive; the change has been zero over a 10-year period, zero change. \nThose are the programs that affect working America, programs that \naffect unemployment, programs that affect food support, nutritional \nsupport, Head Start Programs, health care programs, and training \nprograms so that people can get better jobs.\n  Then over here we have defense spending up 74 percent. Well, that is \ninteresting because these three bars tell the story of decisions made \nduring the 8 years of the George W. Bush administration.\n  Over here on revenue, we have breaks that were granted to the best \noff in our society and that have been fought for vigorously--the \nextension of those breaks--by some of my colleagues across the aisle. \nBreaks for the best off and revenues down over that 10-year period.\n  Over here we have the fact that decisions were made for two wars not \nfunded by the American people. That is an anomaly in our history. When \nwe go to war, we raise the funds to pay for it, but not during the \nirresponsible 8 years of the George W. Bush administration.\n  So it is not a surprise that we now have a deficit problem and that \nwe now have a debt problem because concrete decisions were made. And \nthese are only part of the story. The rest of the story is that \nderegulation of mortgages, leading to a vast tsunami of predatory \nmortgages on working Americans turned into securities that poisoned \nfinancial houses throughout the United States and, for that matter, \nthroughout the globe, also contributed to blowing up the economy and \ndriving down the revenue.\n  So concrete decisions from those 8 years have placed us where we are.\n  How do we address this shortfall? Well, let's start by looking at how \nthe Republican budget has been laid out with three principal points. \nThe first is to end Medicare as we know it. Well, this plan to create a \nvoucher system in lieu of Medicare is one that, frankly, terrifies \nevery senior citizen in America and every citizen who knows they will \nbe a senior citizen, who knows they have been paying for years into a \nprogram with administrative costs that are far more efficient than the \ngeneral insurance market. But the goal of the Republican plan is to \ndismantle that efficiency and throw people into the highly inefficient \nprivate insurance markets with a voucher that does not rise \nproportionately with health care costs. I don't think destroying the \nvery successful program to provide Medicare and health care for our \nseniors is where we should be going. The second part of the plan is to \ndo roughly $4 trillion in cuts to programs for working Americans. The \nthird is to protect all of the programs for the best off in our \nsociety, the benefits for the best off.\n  I think most citizens understand that when we come to a time of \nnational challenge financially, everyone should participate. There \nshouldn't be the sacred cows for the very best off while the workers \nare asked to pick up even more of the burden. In fact, let's take a \nlook at a chart that displays how this functions.\n  The average tax rate in America is 20.7 percent. Let's take the \nrichest 400 in America. The top 400, their average tax rate is 18 \npercent. Now, why do the richest 400 get the lowest tax rates? That is \nwhat Americans have a right to know. Why is it that the Republican plan \nis asking to cut programs for working America while protecting the \nbonus benefits for the best off in our society?\n  These richest 400 earn over $270 million per year--not collectively; \nthat is their average income. Well, wouldn't all of us love to be in a \nsituation where we earn even a fraction of $270 million a year.\n  And that structure, while reflected here for the top 400, is really a \nstructure for the best off of a high array--a 5- to 10-percent array of \nthe best earners in America.\n  So those three points--end Medicare as we know it, replaced with a \nvoucher program, cut programs for working Americans, and protect \nprograms for the best off--that is the Republican plan.\n  The chair of the Senate Budget Committee came to the floor this week \nwith a very different plan, and that plan has the same savings the \nRepublican plan has. Let's take a look at that.\n  Under this plan, the budget framework includes the same amount of \ndeficit reduction as the House Republican plan--in fact, actually a \nlittle bit more reduction: $4 trillion versus $3.9 trillion. So both \nplans get towards the same objective of fiscal responsibility, but they \ngo about it in very different ways.\n  First, the Conrad plan tosses away the Republican plan to end \nMedicare as we know it.\n  The second thing it does is it puts all spending programs on the \ntable. So let's turn to that piece of the structure. Here we have the \nRepublican plan, and it is all in direct spending cuts, touching none \nof the programs for the best off that have been carefully embedded in \nthe Tax Code.\n  Now, every American understands this game: You can fund a project \nwith a $10,000 grant or you can give a $10,000 tax credit that is in \nthe Tax Code or you can give a tax deduction that is worth $10,000, \nalso in the Tax Code--three different ways of accomplishing the very \nsame objective. But the Republican plan is to say: Wait. Let's only do \nthe first of those three strategies because the second and third \nstrategy we have utilized to create the programs for the best off in \nAmerica, and\n\n[[Page S4510]]\n\nwe don't want to touch those. We want to place this burden on working \nAmericans.\n  Well, the Conrad plan says: That is not right. There needs to be a \nconversation about fairness. We know those best off pay the lowest tax \nrates compared to working Americans, as I just showed in that previous \nchart--just 18 percent. So the Conrad plan says: Let's take 50 percent \nof that effort to close the deficit and do it in direct spending, and \nlet's take 50 percent by closing tax loopholes, cutting tax subsidies, \ncutting tax earmarks, and promoting fairness.\n  I came to the floor last week to talk about the bluegrass boondoggle. \nNow, that is not a lot of money in terms of the overall challenge we \nface as America--$120 million over 10 years--but to a working American \n$120 million is a lot.\n  That was a special provision inserted not for companies but for the \nowners. It was to the individual Tax Code for the richest Americans, \nmillionaires and billionaires who own thoroughbreds. They get a special \nbreak the rest of America doesn't get. There is program after program \nsuch as that, inserted for the best off. The Conrad plan says all of \nthis spending, whether it has been in the appropriations bill or it has \nbeen in the tax bill, is going to be examined. That is a fundamentally \nfair approach.\n  Let's look at that in a little more detail, look at what the Conrad \nbudget does in terms of fair rates for the middle class. First, it \nprovides the alternative minimum tax protection for the middle class. \nSecond, it continues tax reductions for the middle class that we have \ncurrently. Third, it cancels the bonus breaks for the millionaires and \nbillionaires. That is basic rate fairness.\n  In addition, it says let's take on those special tax subsidies and \ntax earmarks that my colleagues across the aisle have been so proud of \ninserting into the Tax Code to protect the best off in society. Let's \nexamine them and if they do not meet the fundamental test of creating \nemployment, contributing to fairness, and being more important than \nother programs compared against each other, then they should be \neliminated.\n  In addition, let's take off on those offshore tax havens. There are \nso many setups in which companies have essentially false addresses in \nthe Caribbean so they can transport their profits to a place where they \npay no taxes. Those tax havens, in combination with abusive tax \nshelters, need to be ended. These are all part of tax fairness and \ntaking on this very important challenge we have in terms of our \nnational deficit and our debt and taking it on in a manner that \nstrengthens the programs that need to be strengthened.\n  You will find the Conrad budget, in contrast to the Republican \nbudget, says let's invest in education. We are in a knowledge economy \nworld. We must invest in education if our economy is going to thrive \nand our children are going to be successful.\n  The Conrad budget, in contrast to the Republican budget, says let's \ninvest in infrastructure. We are falling behind in terms of supporting \ninfrastructure. China is spending 10 to 12 percent a year. Europe is \nspending 5 percent a year. America is spending only 2 percent and that \nis barely enough to repair our existing infrastructure. In fact, \nsometimes those repairs are falling short. I know our county officials \nand city officials will be glad to provide us with a list of how short \nwe are.\n  The third area is the Conrad budget invests in energy. Why is energy \nso important? Because currently we are spending $1 billion a day, \nsending it overseas, basically as a result of our addiction to oil. \nWhen you send $1 billion overseas for oil, you do three things. The \nfirst is you create a danger to our national security because of the \ndependence for our energy on governments in the Middle East and other \nplaces around the world that do not share our fundamental interests.\n  The second is you create jobs overseas spending that money rather \nthan creating jobs here in the United States. Let's spend that $1 \nbillion a day here in the United States of America on red, white, and \nblue American-made renewable energy. Not only does our security improve \nbut in addition we create the jobs here in the United States.\n  Third, by ending our addiction to oil we contribute to addressing the \ncarbon pollution challenge faced around this globe rather than being \npart of the problem ourselves.\n  Let's not adopt a budget plan that ends Medicare as we know it and \nreplaces it with a voucher program, that savages programs for working \nAmericans, and that protects the programs for the best off in our \nsociety. Let's instead invest in energy, invest in education, invest in \ninfrastructure, and obtain the same impact on our deficit but do it in \na manner that builds our economy and builds American families. That is \nthe type of program that Trudy from Keizer, OR, wishes to see, Linda \nfrom Canby, OR, wishes to see, and workers throughout the United States \nwant to see because they know we should have a plan that creates jobs \nand builds the success of our families rather than doing the reverse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, now you hear the other side of the \nstory. It is a privilege for me to come to the floor of the Senate to \nspeak on the issue of the bill before us, which is a sense-of-the-\nSenate bill, which means basically the Senate is debating something \nthat is not shooting with real bullets. In other words, it just \nexpresses the sense of the Senate, it does not change any law, so it \ndoesn't amount to much.\n  As the President and congressional leaders continue to debate how \nbest to reduce the deficit, it seems my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle and my President continue to demand a tax increase as part of \nany deal. For sure, any discussion of reducing the deficit should \ninclude a discussion of tax reform, but tax reform is different from \ntax increases. You heard the previous speaker speak about Republican \nplans that deal with reducing expenditures, and that is right, because \nwe believe the deficit problem in this country is not because the \nAmerican people are undertaxed, it is because Congress and Washington \noverspend. However, what is being discussed with this bill currently is \ntax increases on targeted groups, supposedly because they can afford \nit. This is not tax reform.\n  Professor Vedder of Ohio University has studied tax increases and \nspending for more than two decades. In the late 1980s he coauthored \nwith Lowell Galloway, also of Ohio University, a research paper for the \nCongressional Joint Economic Committee. That study found that every new \ndollar of new taxes led to more than $1 of new spending by the \nCongress. It did not reduce the deficit then--you raise a dollar, you \nincrease the deficit. I will be a little more specific.\n  Working with Stephen Moore of the Wall Street Journal, Professor \nVedder updated that research last year and came to the same result. \nSpecifically, Moore and Vedder found:\n\n       Over the entire post-World War II era, through the year \n     2009, each dollar of new tax revenue was associated with \n     $1.17 in new spending.\n\n  That is like a dog chasing its tail. Very few dogs catch them, so \nwhen you raise a dollar here, common sense might dictate it goes to the \nbottom line, but it doesn't work out that way. It actually increases \nthe deficit because Congress believes we have a new dollar coming in, \nlet's spend $1.17.\n  History proves tax increases result in spending increases. We know \nthat increasing taxes is not going to reduce the deficit. History also \nshows that tax increases do not increase revenues. That is probably \ncontrary to most people's common sense, but I have a chart here that I \nthink demonstrates this very clearly. I will be somewhat repetitive \nbecause I want to leave my remarks and go to this chart, and I will \nrefer to it again.\n  What this chart basically shows is that over a long period of time, \ngoing back to World War II to the present, all the taxes coming into \nthe Federal Government have been roughly 18.2 percent of gross national \nproduct, but pretty much even-steven across the board. Sometimes it is \nup a little bit, sometimes down a little bit, but for 50 or more years \nit is averaging about 18.2 percent of gross national product.\n  What this chart also shows is--contrary to what you believe, that if \nyou raise taxes you are going to bring in more revenue, and if you \nreduce taxes you are going to bring in less revenue--that is not true.\n\n[[Page S4511]]\n\n  That gets to this issue of taxing the wealthy. It gets to the issue \nof raising taxes on anybody. From World War II until Jack Kennedy, \nPresident Jack Kennedy, we had 90 percent marginal tax rates. Then from \nPresident Kennedy to President Reagan, we had 70 percent marginal tax \nrates. Then in the last half of the Reagan administration and up until \n1986 it was reduced to 50 percent, under Reagan's administration. Then \nReagan had another tax bill and it was reduced to 30 percent. Then of \ncourse President Bush the dad made this promise in the campaign:\n\n       Read my lips, no new taxes.\n\n  But he didn't keep his promise so the taxes went back up to about 40 \npercent for a period of time until you get to a period when Bush the \nson comes into office and the marginal tax rate is reduced to where it \nis now, 35 percent.\n  But whether you have high marginal tax rates or low marginal tax \nrates, you get about the same amount of revenue. I am going to be \nrepetitive on that point but it is very important that you understand \nthat.\n  History shows that tax increases do not increase revenues. The chart \nhere shows that revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product \nhovers around 20 percent as far back as post-World War II. I said in my \noff-the-cuff remarks it averaged out about 18.2 percent.\n  This chart also shows where you have high and low marginal tax rates \nover those same years. During the last years of World War II, we had a \n94-percent tax rate. Then from 1950 through 1963, it was 90 percent, as \nthis chart shows, and under President Kennedy--and I want to emphasize \nthat he was a Democrat--he was smart enough to reduce marginal tax \nrates to incentivize entrepreneurship. He reduced the marginal tax \nrates to 70 percent. They stayed around 70 percent until President \nReagan brought it down to 50 percent.\n  Let me say at this point, I gave President Reagan credit for it, but \nI was a brandnew Member of the Senate Finance Committee in 1981 and we \nhad some very brave Democrats on that committee who believed that 70 \npercent was too high and it was going to promote entrepreneurship more \nif you reduced it to 50 percent. President Reagan gets credit for it. I \ndon't think any Republican on the Senate Finance Committee could take \ncredit for it because we would have been accused, as we have just been \naccused, of wanting to reduce taxes on wealthy people, so thank God \nthere were a lot of smart, intellectually honest Democrats on the \nSenate Finance Committee in 1981, who said the tax ought to be reduced \nto 50 percent. Well, then it went down to 30 percent when we reduced \nmarginal tax rates further during the Reagan administration. Then, as I \nsaid before, the first President Bush reneged on his promise to not \nraise taxes, and the marginal tax rates went back up to 40 percent and \nstayed there until the tax relief enacted under the second President \nBush. During all of these tax increases and decreases, the amount of \nrevenue as a percentage of GDP stayed roughly flat, with a 50-year \naverage of 18.2 percent.\n\n  So everybody thinks that if you raise the marginal tax rates, you are \ngoing to bring in more revenue--seemingly common sense but not true \nbecause the taxpayers, the workers in America, the investors in this \ncountry that create jobs are smarter than we are, but we don't think \nthey are smarter than we are. And we have had 93 percent marginal tax \nrates, 70 percent, 50 percent, 30 percent, back to 40 percent, now 35 \npercent. Regardless of that rate, we get roughly the same amount of \nrevenue. Higher tax rates just provide incentives for taxpayers to \ninvest and earn money in ways that result in the least amount of taxes \npaid or you might say it this way: Some people just say to themselves \nthat they are not going to work hard because why should I work so darn \nhard if I am going to send the money to Washington for people in \nCongress to spend and waste? In other words, taxpayers have decided \nthey are going to give us politicians in Washington just so much money \nto spend, and it comes out about right here.\n  We ought to have some principles of taxation that we abide by, and I \nabide by this principle that 18 percent of the gross domestic product \nof our country is good enough for the government to collect and to \nspend. That leaves 82 percent in the pockets of taxpayers for them to \ndecide how to spend. When you send money to Washington with 535 of us \ndeciding how to spend it, it doesn't do as much economic good or turn \nover as much in the economy and create jobs as it would if it was left \nin the pockets of the 130-some million taxpayers individually to decide \nhow to spend it.\n  This benchmark of 18 percent of gross domestic product is good, and \nit has been consistent throughout recent history. It is a principle we \nshould keep in mind while we debate Tax Code changes.\n  This level of taxation--another reason I say it is justified is it \nhas not been harmful to the economy, as higher tax rates such as we \nfind in Europe are harmful to the economy--much higher tax rates than \nwe have in this country--and it seems to be a level of taxation that \nthere has not been a great deal of revolt by the taxpayers of America \nagainst.\n  There is another principle I would like to have you keep in mind; \nthat is, What is the purpose of tax law? Those who support bills such \nas the one we have here currently debated, this meaningless bill, \nassume that the key objective for our Federal Government through the \nFederal income tax laws should be to ensure that income is distributed \nequally throughout the country as opposed to government taxing for the \npurposes of government but not for the purposes of the redistribution \nof wealth. In other words, the authors of this bill believe the Federal \nGovernment is the best judge of how your income should be spent.\n  Bills such as the one we are considering today assume--I say it for a \nsecond time--assume that 535 Members of Congress know how to best spend \nthe resources of this country, and presently that is about 18 percent, \nbut that is not enough. Well, actually, they are spending more than 18 \npercent because the expenditures of this country add up to about 25 \npercent of the gross national product from the Federal Government \nbecause we borrow 42 cents out of every dollar we are spending today.\n  It assumes that government creates wealth and should therefore spread \nit around the way they do in Europe. In fact, government doesn't create \nwealth; government consumes wealth. Only workers and investors, \nlaborers, and people who provide capital and, in turn, people who use \ntheir brain to invent and create, is what creates wealth. Yet, as \nhistory shows, there is evidence that tax increases lead to more \nspending--and I quoted Professor Vedder--and that revenues as a \npercentage of gross domestic product pretty much stay the same \nregardless, even if the marginal tax rates are very, very high.\n  It would be one thing for me to vote for a tax increase if it went to \nthe bottom line: reducing the deficit. It is quite another thing to \nvote for a tax increase that just allows more spending and raises the \ndeficit instead of getting the deficit down.\n  The resolution before us now in the Senate requires us to concede \n``that any agreement to reduce the deficit should require that those \nearning more than $1,000,000 per year make a meaningful contribution to \nthe deficit reduction effort.'' The bill does not state that such a \n``meaningful contribution'' would be accomplished through tax \nincreases, but how else would the authors of this bill and the \ntaxpayers intend to or make such a contribution?\n  Let me make clear that I do not support this bill and will vote no on \nits adoption. However, I think it is a good thing we are debating such \nan issue. It is clear that those who support this bill believe those \nearning more than $1 million per year are not paying their fair share. \nNote, however, that just last year, these very same people believed \nthat a single person who earned $200,000 or a married couple who earned \n$250,000 weren't paying their fair share.\n  In evaluating whether people are paying their fair share, experts \nfrequently look at whether the proposal retains or improves the \nprogressivity of our tax system.\n  Critics of lower tax rates continue to attempt to use distribution \ntables to show that tax relief proposals disproportionately benefit \nupper income taxpayers. We keep hearing that the rich are getting \nricher while the poor are getting poorer, don't we? Almost every day. \nThis is not an intellectually\n\n[[Page S4512]]\n\nhonest statement, as it implies--what does it imply? It implies that \nthose who are poor seem to stay poor and that those who are rich seem \nto stay rich. So I want to dispute that position.\n  In 2007, the Department of Treasury published a report entitled \n``Income Mobility in the United States From 1996 to 2005.'' The key \nfindings of this study include the following:\n\n       There was considerable income mobility of individuals in \n     the U.S. economy during the period 1996 through 2005 as over \n     half of taxpayers moved to a different income quintile over \n     this period.\n       Roughly half the taxpayers who began at the bottom income \n     quintile in 1996 moved up to a higher income group by the \n     year 2005.\n       Among those with the very highest incomes in 1996--the top \n     1/100 of 1 percent--only 25 percent remained in the group in \n     2005.\n\n  One in four 10 years later. So the poor aren't always poor and the \nrich aren't always rich.\n\n       Moreover, the median real income of these taxpayers \n     actually declined over this period.\n       The degree of mobility among income groups is unchanged \n     from the prior decade (1987 through 1996).\n\n  So I used the group 1996 through 2005, and I am comparing it with the \ngroup 1987 through 1996, so I want to repeat that the degree of \nmobility among income groups was unchanged over a 20-year period of \ntime.\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       Economic growth resulted in rising incomes for most \n     taxpayers over the period of 1996 through 2005. Median income \n     of all taxpayers increased by 24 percent after adjusting for \n     inflation. The real incomes of two-thirds of all taxpayers \n     increased over this period. In addition, the median incomes \n     of those initially in the lower income groups increased more \n     than the median income of those initially in the higher \n     income group.\n\n  Therefore, whoever is saying that once rich, Americans stay rich, and \nonce poor, they stay poor, is purely mistaken because America is a \ncountry and land of opportunity.\n  Now, I want to say that the Internal Revenue Service data supports \nthe analysis I just gave. I was done quoting at that point.\n  A study of 400 tax returns with the highest income reported over 14 \nyears--and I don't know whether these are the same 400 taxpayers my \nfriend on the other side just referred to in his speech, but a study of \n400 tax returns with the highest incomes reported over 14 years, from \nthe year 1992 to the year 2006, shows that in any given year, on \naverage, about 40 percent of the returns that were filed were not in \nthe top 400 in any of the other 14 years. I got the impression that the \ntop 400 taxpayers in the previous speech were maybe always the same \npeople, but 40 percent were not in that group.\n  The so-called shared sacrifice bill before the Senate now does not \nacknowledge these trends; hence, I think it is intellectually \ndishonest. It presupposes that anyone making more than $1 million \nshould be contributing more to reduce a deficit that they likely did \nnot create in the first place. We created it.\n  The bill assumes that the folks in this income category have always \nmade more than $1 million, that they haven't paid their dues on their \nway up the ladder of success and, as a result, should pay a penalty for \ntheir current success even if they are on the way down the ladder. The \nbill also assumes these folks will continue earning what they are \nearning now.\n  As I just noted, however, the Treasury report and the IRS tax data \ncontradict this position.\n  I welcome this data on this important matter for one simple reason: \nIt sheds light on what America really is all about, what this great \ncountry is all about--vast opportunities. Of course, as I just said in \nthese statistics, but you can see it in a lot of different ways as \nwell, we are a country of great economic mobility. This country is \nbuilt by people from all over the world. Our country truly provides \nunique opportunities for everyone. These opportunities include better \neducation, health care, financial security, and probably a lot of other \nthings. But, most importantly, our country provides people with a \nfreedom to obtain the necessary skills to climb the economic ladder and \nlive better lives. We are a free nation. We are a mobile nation. We are \na nation of hard-working, innovative, skilled, and resilient people who \nlike to take risks when necessary in order to succeed. We have an \nobligation as lawmakers to incorporate these fundamental principles \ninto our tax system.\n  On another matter in this debate, we have also heard much about \n``closing loopholes.'' Well, that sounds good. I don't want to tell you \nhow I believe that ought to be done. There are things that are legal, \nand there are things that are not legal. There are things that are \nlegal and there are things that aren't legal. Let me say if there are, \nin fact, loopholes to be closed, I would support closing them.\n\n  During my tenure as chairman and then ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, I worked with colleagues from both sides of the aisle to cut \noff tax cheats at the pass. The American Jobs Creation Act signed into \nlaw in October of 2004 included a sweeping package to end tax avoidance \nabuses such as corporations claiming tax deductions for taxpayer-funded \ninfrastructure such as subways, sewers, and bridge leases; corporate \nand individual expatriation to escape taxes; and Enron-generated tax \nevasion schemes. We closed them.\n  One of the tax avoidance provisions the jobs bill shut down was so-\ncalled corporate inversions. Average workers in America can't pull up \nstakes and move to Bermuda or set up a fancy tax shelter to avoid \npaying taxes. Companies that do this make a sucker out of workers and \ncompanies that stay here in this great country and pay their fair share \nof taxes. So that was closed. Corporate inversions, we called that.\n  We also closed loopholes used by individual taxpayers. The jobs bill \ncontained a provision that restricted the deduction for donations of \nused vehicles to actual sales price. Prior to that fix, individuals \nwere claiming inflated fair market values before they gave their car to \na nonprofit organization.\n  Then in the Pension Protection Act, which was signed into law in \nAugust of 2006, I championed reforms to deductions for gifts of \n``fractional interests'' in art as well as donations to charities that \nwere controlled by the donor. Because if you give money away, it ought \nto be given away. A person should not be able to control it after they \ngive it away. The same way with art. In both cases, individuals were \ntaking huge deductions for donations without providing equivalent \nbenefits to the charities to which they donated.\n  In addition to ensuring income and deductions are properly reported, \nI also supported giving the Internal Revenue Service more tools to go \nafter tax cheats. The jobs bill contained provisions that required \ntaxpayers to disclose to the IRS their participation in tax shelters \nand increased penalties for participating in such tax shelters as well \nas not disclosing such participation to the IRS.\n  I also authored the updates to the tax whistleblower provisions \nincluded in the Tax Relief and Health Care Act which was signed into \nlaw in December of 2006. There was a whistleblower statute long before \nthat, but because of the low dollar threshold, it encouraged neighbors \nto blow the whistle on their neighbors. So the 2006 changes I \nchampioned increased the awards for those blowing the whistle on the \nbig fish--individuals and businesses engaged in large-dollar tax \ncheating through complex financial transactions.\n  I don't know why it took the IRS so long to get this law under way \nbecause they have had plenty of whistleblowers come forward, but we \nhave only had one time so far--I think we will get a lot of others \nnow--but we have only had one time so far under this provision, which \nwas instituted in April of this year, and we recovered $20 million for \ntaxpayers that otherwise would have been lost to fraud--from one \ncompany.\n  These are just a few examples of my support for provisions to stop \nabuses of the Tax Code to make sure everyone pays their fair share. If \nand when we get around to considering comprehensive tax reform, I look \nforward to shutting down any other abuses that exist. But first we need \nto be clear on what a loophole is.\n  Itemized deductions are just that: itemized deductions. They are not \nloopholes. Similarly, deductions and tax credits that enable a \ncorporation to zero out its tax liability are not loopholes. For \ninstance, if a person had a loss last year, they can carry it forward \nto this year. The question of whether deductions and credits should be \nlimited is a question that should be answered not to raise revenue but \nin\n\n[[Page S4513]]\n\nthe context of comprehensive tax reform. Eliminating deductions and \ncredits for certain taxpayers should be subject to extensive review and \nextensive debate. Taxpayers should not be targeted for tax increases \nfor political sport, as this resolution before us does.\n  I wish to finish by summing up in three points, very quickly. First, \naccording to this chart, tax increases don't--well, not according to \nthis chart. That is the second point I will make. First, tax increases \ndon't reduce deficits and they don't increase revenue as a percentage \nof GDP.\n  Secondly, we ought to have some principles of taxation. First of all, \nthis chart shows that we get about the same amount of revenue coming in \nover a 50-year period of time--about 18.2 percent of gross national \nproduct. We have high marginal tax rates, really low marginal tax \nrates, but it still brings in about the same amount of revenue.\n  Second, we ought to have some principles of taxation that we abide \nby. Limiting revenues to the historical average of 18 percent of GDP \nshould be one, while ensuring income equality should not be one. In \nother words, we raise revenue for the purpose of funding the functions \nof government, not to redistribute wealth.\n  Last but not least, it is right to consider tax reform when \ndiscussing deficit reduction. However, the proposals put forth so far, \nincluding the current bill, are political proposals--not reform \nproposals. Tax reform requires Presidential leadership, and we are just \nnow seeing that. I mean, we are not seeing it on tax reform, but we are \nfinally seeing it on deficit reduction. But I don't think it is going \nto last very long.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Will the Senator withhold his \nrequest?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         florida's citrus crop\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I will speak on this bill \nbefore us tomorrow and matters about the budget, the deficit, and how \nit ought to be solved, and it has to be solved. I will reserve comments \non that until tomorrow.\n  In the meantime, what I wish to point out to the Senate is that we \nhad a very significant benefit to not only the Florida citrus industry \nbut to the worldwide citrus industry, because there is a bacterial \ndisease and, of all things, it is called citrus greening. Well, it is \nanything but that, because what it does is it kills a citrus tree \nwithin 5 years. It has infected every grove in Florida.\n  When I say the worldwide citrus industry is being threatened, I mean \njust that. This strain of bacteria came somewhere from Asia and has \nbeen imported not only into the United States but into a lot of other \ncountries that have moderate climates, warm climates, humid climates. \nThere is another version that came from a different part of the world \nthat is not as virulent. But what happens is this bacteria that has now \nbeen brought into this country--it is in Brazil as well, another major \ncitrus-producing country--and it is carried by a little insect called a \npsyllid.\n  The little psyllid carrying this bacteria bites into the tree, the \nbacteria gets into the sap, and it will kill the tree in 5 years, and \nthere is no known cure. Well, if it is going to kill a tree in 5 years, \nwe can see the potential for the destruction of what we have come to \nthink of as standard fare--that we are going to have orange juice on \nour breakfast table, and that those who enjoy the mild elixirs and mix \ncertain elixirs with orange juice--called maybe mimosas, whatever--that \nthis is going to be a thing of the past if we don't get serious about \nfinding a cure for this disease.\n  The reason it is so extraordinarily lethal for the United States and \nfor the State of Florida is the fact that since every grove has been \naffected, and since almost all of our orange juice that we consume in \ndomestic consumption in the United States--I say almost all; the \nbiggest percentage comes from Florida, and some of it, a little bit, \nfrom California; mostly the juice that is added to Florida juice comes \nfrom Brazil, but when there is a bumper crop in Florida, they don't \nhave to ship it in, in refrigerated ships from Brazil--we are going to \nhave a whole way of life, a whole tradition, we are going to have \ndomestic consumption that is threatened if we don't come up with a \ncure.\n  The Florida citrus industry, to its credit, has been taxing itself--\nthe growers--to produce a stream of revenue that will allow it to \ncontinue the research to try to find a cure. We have gotten some \nlimited amount also from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and \nsupplementing all of that with back at the time when we could make a \nspecific appropriations request, otherwise called an earmark, this \nSenator certainly was asking for appropriations to help find a cure to \nthis dread disease. We haven't found the cure, and we have to have a \nstream of revenue to keep this going.\n  Since it is so difficult to pass anything around here these days--\neven the citrus trust fund I filed last year, we had a whole bunch of \ncosponsors. But this year, of course, we are all wound around the axle \nhere on passing anything if it has to do with the budget. So what I did \nwas go to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and I asked for help. We \nhave to have some help immediately. Fortunately, the administration--\nand I talked to the Chief of Staff of the White House about how dire \nthis situation is. We can't wait. So they announced yesterday they are \nreleasing $2 million immediately that will go into the USDA Research \nStation at Fort Pierce, FL, for the remainder of this fiscal year. In \nthe next fiscal year, assuming the competitive grants fund is funded by \nthe Congress for the Department of Agriculture--which we have to assume \nis going to continue--the USDA has set aside an amount of $5 million in \nthe next fiscal year, starting October 1, that will go directly into \nthis research, and they have agreed to set aside in the following 2 \nyears $2 million, $2 million in each of those years, so that we have a \nsteady stream of funding of $11 million for research specifically for \ncitrus greening.\n  California may have this bacteria. If Texas doesn't have it, it is \njust a matter of days or months, and the same with the citrus that is \ngrown in Arizona. Of course, in a country such as Brazil, it is to \ntheir credit some of the citrus growers in Brazil have actually \ncontributed money to our U.S. research institutions trying to find a \ncure, because Brazil has the same problem. They have it in a lot of \ntheir groves. The big difference between the Brazilian citrus industry \nand the United States is that they have more land, so they can mow down \nand burn a citrus grove and go over and clear new land that is \nunaffected and go on and start a new grove.\n  You don't have that luxury. We don't have it in any of our citrus-\ngrowing States in the Sun Belt, and certainly we don't have the luxury \nin Florida to go out and find new land to plant new citrus groves.\n  This is a very significant departure and a welcome new announcement \nby the U.S. Department of Agriculture that they will be sending $11 \nmillion over the next 3 years specifically dedicated to finding a cure \nfor citrus greening before it is too late.\n  Citrus growers can prolong the life of a grove by doing certain \nspraying and so forth, but at the end of the day the tree is going to \ndie, and they are not going to produce any oranges for orange juice and \nno grapefruit for the grapefruit we enjoy.\n  Just so the rest of the Senate will understand, this industry is part \nof us as Floridians. We have, even on our license tags in Florida, an \norange. We have an industry that has been a mainstay of our economy for \nyears and years. Of course, because of the forward thinking, the \nFlorida Citrus Commission, in the late forties, fifties, and sixties \nmade orange juice become a wanted and acceptable commodity on most \nevery American breakfast table. And it is threatened. It is up to us to \ndo something about it.\n  I was particularly thankful to the administration that they would \ncome up with the $2 million immediately because, in addition to the \ngrowers taxing themselves on a per citrus box produced assessment, they \nwere counting\n\n[[Page S4514]]\n\non the State of Florida to produce a $2 million appropriation to go \ninto a $15 million research fund, and this year, lo and behold, the \nGovernor of Florida vetoed that in the appropriations bill. So the \nreplacement of that vetoed item by the Governor, with this Federal \nmoney from USDA, considered an emergency allocation, is welcome, \ntimely, and it is much appreciated by all of the aficionados across \nAmerica that enjoy orange juice as a staple in their diet.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Space Shuttle Launch\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, let me just say that with the \nlast space shuttle launching last Friday--and it was a beautiful \nlaunch--of course, the expertise of the finest launch team anywhere in \nthe world was very evident. When they got down to T-minus 31 they saw \nan indication on the controls that there had not been a retraction of \none of the arms, which is a servicing arm, but they were ready for \nthat, and as it turned out, it was a faulty sensor. Of course, the way \nthey checked is they have cameras all over the launch tower. So they \nturned the cameras on and trained them over there and saw that it had, \nin fact, retracted and was pulled into a safe position. So with only 53 \nseconds left in the launch window--the window being that they had to \nlaunch the shuttle at that time so that it, once in orbit, could catch \nup with the space station, which was its destination, with 53 seconds \nto go, the count continued then, starting at T minus 31 and went down \nto a flawless launch and flawless flight, as they are now docked with \nthe space station, and as they are now transferring this 20,000 pounds \nof cargo and equipment and supplies that will keep the International \nSpace Station supplied for the next year.\n  I don't think people realize how big the International Space Station \nis. It is 120 yards long. If you sat on the 50-yard line of a football \nstadium and looked from the end of one end zone all the way to the \nother, that is how big the International Space Station is that we have \nbuilt with another 15 national partners. Primarily, our partner in \nbuilding it was Russia. Of course, you remember that the iteration \nbefore the International Space Station was originally the Soviet space \nstation that became the Russian space station called MIR, which we used \nto fly our astronauts with the space shuttle to the Russian space \nstation. So the Russians have been our partners.\n  Remember, when we have been down--for example, after the destruction \nof the space shuttle Columbia in early 2003, for over 2 years we would \nnot fly the space shuttle as we went through and made the corrections \nthat had caused the destruction of Columbia and the loss of seven \nastronauts. We relied on the Russians to get us to and from the space \nstation.\n  The sad thing is that the new rockets that we are building to go to \nand from the space station--there is one version of those rockets that, \nin fact, is going to fly later this year, rendezvous and dock with the \nspace station and deliver cargo. But it has not been human rated. To do \nthat, we have to go through and put in all the redundancies for safety, \nall of the escape mechanisms on the capsule, and once that is done this \nwill be a rocket that will be much safer than the space shuttle--as a \nmatter of fact, we can save the crew even from--if they had an \nexplosion on the pad, the crew can safely eject in the escape rocket \nwith the capsule parachuting to safety, all the way, 8\\1/2\\ minutes to \norbit--if they had a malfunction.\n  Contrast that with the space shuttle. When we saw Atlantis lift off, \nfor the first 2 minutes there is no escape. You are married to those \nbig solid rockets. If there is a failure then, there is no way out for \nthe crew, and, as we saw, that was how Challenger, 25 years ago, was \ndestroyed. They had a malfunction in one of the rockets. It caused the \nwhole thing to explode--one of the solid rockets--within the first 2 \nminutes of flight.\n  We are going to have a much safer way to get to and from the space \nstation. The sad thing, however, is that the rocket for humans is not \nready. It is going to take about another 3 years. Therefore, it is sad \nthat with all of that finest launch team in the world at the Kennedy \nSpace Center, a good part of them are having to be laid off. That \nemployment will ramp up over the next several years as we build and \nlaunch those kinds of rockets.\n  There is another set of human-rated rockets. I am talking about the \nmanned space program now, not the unmanned. This year we are going to \nJupiter. Later on we are getting ready to launch a Volkswagen-size \nrover that will go to the surface of Mars.\n  Do you know what those little rovers have done over the last number \nof years? They have gone, like the energizer bunny, all over the \nsurface. This one is going to be the size of a Volkswagen. So we have \nthese kinds of mixes going on, but the human space program--the next \nbig one to get NASA out of the Earth's orbit is the rocket that we are \ndeveloping, a monster rocket. The capsule contract has already been \nlet, and we are now going on in the process of--pursuant to the NASA \nlaw we passed last year--proceeding with the design and building of \nthis rocket, which will take us, on the goal set by the President, to \nMars with interim stations along the way. He has suggested an \nasteroid--to rendezvous and land with an asteroid by 2025. We have a \nvigorous space program going ahead.\n  Senator Hutchison, who has been a wonderful partner in helping set \nNASA policy in all of this, and I are going to have something to say \nabout this in the next few days because we think there is a holdup in \nthe Office of Management and Budget with regard to the rocket design \nand the architecture for the big rocket. We are wondering why this \ndelay keeps occurring. But we will talk about that in the later \nsession.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, had I been present to vote on the motion \nto proceed to consider S. 1323, I would have voted no.\n  There is broad consensus in Washington that a ``balanced approach'' \nbetween spending cuts, controls, and increased revenue is the only \npossible way to reduce our $14.3 trillion national debt and avert a \nGreek-style debt crisis. I share this perspective.\n  As the ongoing debt negotiations advance, Members of Congress should \nevaluate the components of a debt package through one question: Will \nthis make it harder or easier for the American people to create jobs? \nFor my part, I have never met a job creator in Florida that has told me \nthey are waiting for Congress to pass another tax hike before they \nstart growing their business.\n  Unfortunately, as evident by S. 1323, some in Washington believe \nhigher revenues in a debt package should come from massive tax \nincreases, even at a time when the unemployment rate is 9.2 percent and \n25 million Americans are unemployed or underemployed. I vehemently \ndisagree with this approach and will oppose a net tax increase on the \neconomy that makes its way into a debt reduction deal.\n  To be clear, new revenues are an essential component of debt \nreduction. We can't simply cut our way out of this debt; we also need \nto grow our way out of it. The best way to do this is by increasing the \nnumber of taxpayers gainfully employed in our economy and by easing \nburdensome regulations, not by raising taxes.\n  We can generate lasting economic growth and trillions in new revenues \nfor the Federal Government through pro-growth tax reform. Senator Pat \nToomey has a budget proposal that lowers top marginal tax rates to 25 \npercent in a revenue-neutral way and eliminates loopholes and \ndeductions, resulting in $1.5 trillion of additional real growth over \nthe next decade and millions of new private-sector jobs, according to \nthe Heritage Foundation. His budget recognizes that tax cuts and an \noverhaul of our 70,000 page Tax Code will create jobs and generate \ntrillions in new revenue.\n  Net tax increases are poor economic policy. Will raising taxes on \nmanufacturers make it easier for them to hire new workers? Will raising \ntaxes on American energy companies make it\n\n[[Page S4515]]\n\neasier to create jobs? Will raising taxes on the businesses that \nDemocrats refer to as ``millionaires'' allow those businesses to \nexpand? Across the board, the answer is no. Instead, these tax \nincreases will kill jobs in every district, State, and industry in the \ncountry. Regardless of the rhetoric coming from Washington politicians, \nthese taxes will also have a mathematically insignificant effect on \ndeficit reduction.\n  I proudly support a ``balanced approach'' in the context of debt \nreduction that grows the economy and boosts tax revenues in the \nprocess, but when presented with the option of choking our weak economy \nwith yet another tax increase, I will oppose it. Our country needs new \ntaxpayers, not new taxes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/12/senate-section/article/S4515-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                 Sergeant First Class Terryl L.

Madam President, I want to speak briefly about some \ntroubling developments in El Salvador, which should concern us all.\n  On June 14, 2011, the body of Juan Francisco Duran Ayala was found \nwith a gunshot wound to the head in the Soyapango Municipality of San \nSalvador. He was reportedly last seen alive on June 2 in Ilobasco, \nCabanas, posting flyers critical of gold mining in that area, the day \nbefore he disappeared. In addition to studying at the Technological \nUniversity in San Salvador, Mr. Duran had volunteered for the \nEnvironmental Committee of Cabanas in Defense of Water and Culture. His \ndeath is one of a shocking number of instances of violence against \nantimining activists in Cabanas.\n  In 2009, Gustavo Marcelo Rivera went missing for nearly 2 weeks \nbefore his body was found on June 30 in a well with signs of torture. \nMr. Rivera was the cofounder of the Asociacion Amigos de San Isidro \nCabanas, and was a vocal leader in the anti-mining campaign in San \nIsidro, Cabanas. Since Mr. Rivera's death, at least eight other members \nof the antimining community in Cabanas have reportedly been killed, \nincluding Mr. Duran, and yet it is still unclear who is behind this \npattern of deadly violence.\n  There have also been recurrent threats against the lives of \njournalists at Radio Victoria, which broadcasts in that area.\n  Cabanas is located in the north central part of El Salvador and has a \nlong history of gold mining. Pacific Rim Mining, a Canadian company \nthat acquired a large mine named El Dorado, was the subject of Mr. \nRivera's and Mr. Duran's protests. Now that their voices have been \nsilenced, people in that community are demanding thorough, credible \ninvestigations of these crimes, both to obtain justice for their \nfamilies and in order that future activists can exercise their right to \nspeak out peacefully without losing their lives.\n  Unfortunately, El Salvador is a country where criminal investigations \nrarely result in arrests, and those that do almost never result in \nconvictions. Impunity and corruption within the police are common, as \nin many other countries of the region. Some accuse local police and \nmunicipal officials of complicity in the harassment and threats against \nantimine activists and the radio station, and point to the fact that no \none has been punished for these crimes.\n  To compound the problem, judicial independence, already fragile, is \nunder threat in El Salvador. On June 2 the Salvadoran Legislative \nAssembly approved a decree which requires the five members of the \nConstitutional Court to rule unanimously instead of with the previous \nfour person majority. The law was approved with the support of a broad \nspectrum of political parties.\n  The vote was reportedly in response to a number of unpopular \ndecisions by the Court over the past 2 years. The passage of the decree \nthreatens judicial independence in a country where the Court has only \nrecently demonstrated a willingness to act as a check on executive and \nlegislative power. That is the role of the judiciary in a democracy, \nand the outcome of this impasse will have profound implications for the \ncountry.\n  El Salvador has been through a difficult history. The 1980s civil war \npolarized the country and those who suffered most, the rural poor, are \nstill struggling to recover. The country's democratic institutions are \nweak, particularly the judiciary. The country is coping with rampant \nviolent crime, and the infiltration of well financed criminal gangs \ninto all sectors of society.\n  In the midst of this, the brutal slayings of people like Juan \nFrancisco Duran Ayala and Gustavo Marcelo Rivera might be regarded as \nlittle more than a grim statistic, soon to be forgotten. But we have \nnot forgotten them. All indications are that they did nothing more than \nact as the voices of people in their communities who are concerned that \ntheir way of life, and the land they depend on, is being destroyed.\n  We know the Funes Government is coping with many problems. We are \nhelping, by providing tens of millions of dollars to support programs \nin health, education, economic development, and to strengthen law \nenforcement. We provided additional funding to help the country rebuild \nfrom the devastating floods in November 2009. But there is no more \nimportant responsibility of government than upholding the rule of law. \nThe urgent necessity of the message that would be sent to all the \npeople of El Salvador by bringing the perpetrators of these crimes to \njustice cannot be overstated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/12/senate-section/article/S4515-3", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4515-S4516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     VA INFECTION CONTROL PRACTICES\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I would like to take a moment today to \nrecognize the success of recent efforts at the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, VA, to reduce Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, \nMRSA, infections by more than 60 percent in intensive care units. This \ninitiative by VA was highlighted in a New England Journal of Medicine \narticle this year.\n  MRSA is a nationwide problem. It is estimated that it kills 20,000 \nU.S. residents a year and hospitals remain an important source of this \ninfection. Three years ago, VA launched this initiative to ensure that \nit leads the way on eradicating MRSA infections from their facilities. \nThe success of this initiative has created a culture that promotes \ninfection prevention by adding patient screening programs for MRSA, \nprecautions for hospitalized patients found to have MRSA, and hand \nhygiene reminders with readily available hand sanitizer stations \nthroughout VA medical centers.\n  Every day thousands of veterans visit VA health facilities to receive \ncare. VA provides care for more than 6 million veterans each year. In \nthe first 3 years of this initiative, more than 1.7 million screening \ntests for MRSA were given to veteran patients at VA medical facilities \nthroughout the United States. Screening tests such as these help our \nveterans stay safe from deadly antibiotic-resistant infections, a \nthreat no American should face when they visit a hospital.\n  Since the initiative's start in 2007, VA has increased the amount of \nMRSA screenings to 96 percent of all admitted patients. This newly \ninstituted culture that promotes infection prevention has been so \nsuccessful that infection rates for MRSA have decreased by 62 percent\n\n[[Page S4516]]\n\nover the past 3 years within VA intensive care units and by 45 percent \nin other areas of the hospital. The success of VA's work on MRSA \nprevention is proof that with dedication and strong leadership, VA can \nmake significant improvements in their ability to control infections \nand deliver high quality health care. It is my hope that these results \nwill be replicated across the healthcare system nationwide and that \nsuccess achieved by VA in improving the safe delivery of care through \nthe reduction in MRSA infections will be mirrored in their efforts in \nother areas, like the sterilization and reprocessing of reusable \nmedical equipment.\n  As the chairman of Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the \ndaughter of a disabled World War II veteran, I know firsthand the need \nfor quality health care for our veterans. No one who has made \nsacrifices to serve our Nation should ever struggle to find quality, \ntimely health care, which is why I am so pleased today to highlight \nthis successful initiative and commend VA on their efforts to eradicate \nMRSA from their health care facilities and continue to provide care for \nour Nation's heroes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/12/senate-section/article/S4516-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   TRIBUTE TO FATHER WILLIAM HULTBERG\n\n Mr. CASEY. Madam President, today I wish to honor Father \nWilliam Hultberg, a very special priest from my home State of \nPennsylvania. Known to many simply as ``Father Bill,'' he is a member \nof the Oblates of St. Francis DeSales and has provided both his country \nand his Pennsylvania community with a lifetime of service as a \nspiritual and religious counselor. Saturday, July 16, 2011, will mark \nhis 80th birthday.\n  To those who know him, Father Bill is a man whose commitment to \nspirituality, concern for his fellow man, and sense of service is \nvirtually unparalleled. After earning his bachelor's degree in \neducation and Spanish from LaSalle University and his master's degree \nin education and guidance from Niagara University, Father Bill began \nhis lifelong commitment to country and community with his chaplain \nservice in both the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy. He retired as a lieutenant \ncolonel in 1991 after 35 years of exemplary service. During his time as \na Navy Chaplain with the Marines, he received the Bronze Star Medal \nwith a ``Combat V'' for valor. As an Active-Duty chaplain with the U.S. \nArmy, he was awarded four Meritorious Service Medals for his efforts in \ndeveloping and implementing alcohol and drug prevention programs for \nservicemembers.\n  Father Bill's commitment to providing spiritual and religious \ncounseling to those suffering from alcohol and drug addictions \ncontinues to this day. As a certified pastoral and drug addiction \ncounselor at Caron Treatment Center in Wernersville, PA, Father Bill \nhas offered spiritual guidance and an understanding of the 12-step \nspirituality of recovery to addicts and their families. His efforts \nover his 24 years of service to Caron have been central in providing \nthose who suffer from addiction with the necessary tools to achieve \nsobriety and have truly left their mark on the Caron community. To this \npoint, his unique Sunday services have become an honored, albeit \nmandatory, tradition at Caron. Described by some as an ``evangelical \nrally,'' Father Bill integrates 12-step traditions, elements of \nChristian worship, and other material at these services to provide \nopportunities for those in recovery and their families to share their \npain and hope with one another as they struggle with addiction.\n  Throughout his career, Father Bill has also been a beacon of hope to \nthose suffering from HIV/AIDS. His development and implementation of a \nspiritual program for those afflicted with the disease and his \ncontribution to Caron's HIV retreat weekends have provided comfort and \nguidance to many. Not only have these efforts had an immeasurable \nimpact in Pennsylvania, but they have also garnered Father Bill \nnational recognition in the form of the Ryan White Youth Service Award, \na national awards program recognizing leaders for reaching out to \nsupport youth in the prevention of HIV.\n  I would like to join the Caron Treatment Center's community in \nwishing Father Bill a very happy 80th birthday this weekend and to \nthank him for his lifetime of service to both the Commonwealth and the \ncountry. I, and many others, wish him many more years of health and \nhappiness as he celebrates this milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/12/senate-section/article/S4516-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      29TH METRO DETROIT YOUTH DAY\n\n Mr. LEVIN.

This engaging and family-oriented event is a \nherculean undertaking, bringing together more than 1,600 volunteers to \nwelcome more than 37,000 young people within the Greater Detroit \ncommunity. This day-long event, which is sponsored by a multitude of \nbusinesses and more than 320 community and youth organizations across \nMichigan, provides a wonderful platform to bring the community together \nto award scholarships and recognize outstanding community service for \nand by young people.\n  From sports clinics to motivational talks to entertainment, this \nevent has grown to become the largest youth event in Michigan, with a \nmission of promoting community service and the need for physical \neducation and fitness. This event also seeks to inspire young people to \nstrive to better themselves through education, good deeds and other \npositive means.\n  Through the years, Youth Day has been recognized by many on the State \nand national level. In 1991, Metro Youth Day was recognized by \nPresident George H.W. Bush as the 477th Point of Light, and in 1999, \nthe Governor's Council on Physical Fitness, Health and Sports named \nMetro Youth Day the top youth event in Michigan. These honors are the \ndirect result of the hard work and dedication of the many individuals, \norganizations and businesses that team up to make sure this event is \nrewarding and memorable for the many youth across the Detroit metro \narea that participate.\n  Inspiring young people to better themselves and fostering stronger \ncommunity bonds are noble pursuits that reap rewards far into the \nfuture. I salute all those who have played a role in making this year's \nMetro Detroit Youth Day a tremendous success. This event has become a \ntradition in southeast Michigan over the last 28 years, and I look \nforward to hearing about this exciting celebration for many years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/12/senate-section/article/S4516-3", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PARKSTON, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to restrict the use of offshore tax havens and \nabusive tax shelters to inappropriately avoid Federal taxation, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am introducing today with my colleagues \nSenators Conrad, Bill Nelson, Sanders, Shaheen, and Whitehouse, the \nStop Tax Haven Abuse Act, legislation which is geared to stop the $100 \nbillion yearly drain on the U.S. treasury caused by offshore tax \nabuses. Offshore tax abuses are not only undermining public confidence \nin our tax system, but widening the deficit and increasing the tax \nburden on middle America.\n  People are sick and tired of tax dodgers using offshore trickery and \nabusive tax shelters to avoid paying their fair share. This bill offers \npowerful new tools to combat those offshore and tax shelter abuses, \nraise revenues, and eliminate incentives to send U.S. profits and jobs \noffshore. Its provisions will hopefully be part of any deficit \nreduction package this year, but should be adopted in any event.\n  The bill is supported by a wide array of small business, labor, and \npublic interest groups, including the Financial Accountability and \nCorporate Transparency, FACT, Coalition, American Sustainable Business \nCouncil, Business for Shared Prosperity, Main Street Alliance, AFL-CIO, \nSEIU, Citizens for Tax Justice, Tax Justice Network-USA, U.S. Public \nInterest Research Group, Global Financial Integrity, Global Witness, \nJubilee USA, and Public Citizen.\n  Frank Knapp, president and CEO of the South Carolina Small Business \nChamber of Commerce, has explained small business support for the bill \nthis way:\n\n       Small businesses are the lifeblood of local economies. We \n     pay our fair share of taxes and generate most of the new \n     jobs. Why should we be subsidizing U.S. multinationals that \n     use offshore tax havens to avoid paying taxes? Big \n     corporations benefit immensely from all the advantages of \n     being headquartered in our country. It is time to end tax \n     haven abuse and level the playing field.\n\n  The Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act is a product of the investigative work \nof the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations which I chair. For more \nthan 10 years, the Subcommittee has conducted inquiries into offshore \nabuses, including the use of offshore corporations and trusts to hide \nassets, the use of tax haven banks to set up secret accounts, and the \nuse of U.S. bankers, lawyers, accountants and other professionals to \ndevise and conduct abusive tax shelters. Over the years, we have \nlearned a lot of the offshore tricks and have designed this bill to \nfight back by closing obnoxious offshore tax loopholes and \nstrengthening offshore tax enforcement.\n  The 112th Congress is the fifth Congress in which I have introduced a \ncomprehensive bill to combat offshore and tax shelter abuses. A number \nof provisions from past bills have made it into law, such as measures \nto curb abusive foreign trusts, close offshore dividend tax loopholes, \nand strengthen penalties on tax shelter promoters, but much more needs \nto be done.\n  The last Congress made significant progress in the offshore battle. \nWe finally enacted into law the economic substance doctrine which \nauthorizes courts to strike down phony business deals with no economic \npurpose other than to avoid the payment of tax. My past bills supported \nthe economic substance doctrine, and its enactment into\n\n[[Page S4519]]\n\nlaw is a victory many years in the making.\n  Last year also saw enactment of the Baucus-Rangel Foreign Account Tax \nCompliance Act or FATCA, which is a tough new law designed to flush out \nhidden offshore bank accounts. Foreign banks are currently engaged in a \nmassive lobbying effort to weaken its disclosure requirements, but U.S. \nbanks have had it with foreign banks using secrecy to attract U.S. \nclients and want those banks to have to meet the same disclosure \nrequirements U.S. banks do. The Administration is so far resisting \ncalls to water down the provisions.\n  President Obama, who when in the Senate cosponsored my bills in 2005 \nand 2007 to end tax haven abuses, is a longtime opponent of offshore \ntax evasion. He knows how fed up Americans are with tax dodgers who \nhide their money offshore, use complex tax shelters to thumb their nose \nat Uncle Sam, and offload their tax burden onto the backs of honest \nAmericans.\n  The bottom line is that each of us has a legal and civil obligation \nto pay taxes, and most Americans fulfill that obligation. It is time to \nforce the tax scofflaws, the tax dodgers, and the tax cheats to do the \nsame, and end their misuse of offshore tax havens.\n  The bill I am introducing today is a stronger version of the Stop Tax \nHaven Abuse Act introduced in the last Congress. In addition to \npreserving the provisions from last year that have not yet been enacted \ninto law, it contains several new measures to stop tax dodgers from \ntaking advantage of middle Americans who play by the rules.\n  Among the bill's provisions are special measures to combat persons \nwho impede U.S. tax enforcement; establishment of legal presumptions to \novercome secrecy barriers; the treatment of offshore corporations as \ndomestic corporations for tax purposes when controlled by U.S. persons; \nclosing a tax loophole benefiting credit default swaps that send money \noffshore; closing another loophole that allows corporate deposits of \nforeign funds in U.S. accounts to be treated as nontaxable, \nunrepatriated foreign income; disclosure requirements for basic \ninformation on country-by-country tax payments by multinationals; and \nstronger penalties against tax shelter promoters and aiders and \nabettors of tax evasion.\n  Probably the biggest change in the bill from the last Congress is \nthat it would no longer require Treasury to develop a list of offshore \nsecrecy jurisdictions and then impose tougher requirements on U.S. \ntaxpayers who use those jurisdictions. Instead, the bill would build on \nthe Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010, by creating tougher \ndisclosure, evidentiary, and enforcement consequences for U.S. persons \nwho do business with foreign financial institutions that reject FATCA's \ncall for disclosing accounts used by U.S. persons. By focusing on non-\nFATCA financial institutions instead of offshore secrecy jurisdictions, \nthe bill relieves Treasury of a difficult task, while providing \nadditional incentives for foreign banks to adopt FATCA's disclosure \nrequirements.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section by section \nanalysis and a bill summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n     Section 101--Special Measures Where U.S. Tax Enforcement Is \n         Impeded\n       The first section of the bill, Section 101, which is \n     carried over from the last Congress, would allow the Treasury \n     Secretary to apply an array of sanctions against any foreign \n     jurisdiction or financial institution which the Secretary \n     determined was impeding U.S. tax enforcement.\n       This provision has added significance now that Congress has \n     enacted the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act requiring \n     foreign financial institutions with U.S. investments to \n     disclose all accounts opened by U.S. persons or pay a hefty \n     tax on their U.S. investment income. FATCA goes into effect \n     in 2013, but some foreign financial institutions are saying \n     that they will refuse to adopt FATCA's approach and will \n     instead stop holding any U.S. assets. While that is their \n     right, the question being raised by some foreign banks \n     planning to comply with FATCA is what happens to non-FATCA \n     institutions that take on U.S. clients and don't report the \n     accounts to the United States. Right now, the U.S. government \n     has no way to take effective action against foreign financial \n     institutions that open secret accounts for U.S. tax evaders. \n     Section 101 of our bill would change that by providing just \n     the powerful new tool needed to stop non-FATCA institutions \n     from facilitating U.S. tax evasion.\n       Section 101 is designed to build upon existing Treasury \n     authority to take action against foreign financial \n     institutions that engage in money laundering by extending \n     that same authority to the tax area. In 2001, the Patriot Act \n     gave Treasury the authority under 31 U.S.C. 5318A to require \n     domestic financial institutions and agencies to take special \n     measures with respect to foreign jurisdictions, financial \n     institutions, or transactions found to be of ``primary money \n     laundering concern.'' Once Treasury designates a foreign \n     jurisdiction or financial institution to be of primary money \n     laundering concern, Section 5318A allows Treasury to impose a \n     range of requirements on U.S. financial institutions in their \n     dealings with the designated entity--from requiring U.S. \n     financial institutions, for example, to provide greater \n     information than normal about transactions involving the \n     designated entity, to prohibiting U.S. financial institutions \n     from opening accounts for that foreign entity.\n       This Patriot Act authority has been used sparingly, but to \n     telling effect. In some instances Treasury has employed \n     special measures against an entire country, such as Burma, to \n     stop its financial institutions from laundering funds through \n     the U.S. financial system. More often, Treasury has used the \n     authority surgically, against a single problem financial \n     institution, to stop laundered funds from entering the United \n     States. The provision has clearly succeeded in giving \n     Treasury a powerful tool to protect the U.S. financial system \n     from money laundering abuses.\n       The bill would authorize Treasury to use that same tool to \n     require U.S. financial institutions to take the same special \n     measures against foreign jurisdictions or financial \n     institutions found by Treasury to be ``impeding U.S. tax \n     enforcement.'' Treasury could, for example, in consultation \n     with the IRS, the Secretary of State, and the Attorney \n     General, require U.S. financial institutions that have \n     correspondent accounts for a designated foreign bank to \n     produce information on all of that foreign bank's customers. \n     Alternatively, Treasury could prohibit U.S. financial \n     institutions from opening accounts for a designated foreign \n     bank, thereby cutting off that foreign bank's access to the \n     U.S. financial system. These types of sanctions could be as \n     effective in ending the worst tax haven abuses as they have \n     been in curbing money laundering.\n       In addition to extending Treasury's ability to impose \n     special measures against foreign entities impeding U.S. tax \n     enforcement, the bill would add one new measure to the list \n     of possible sanctions that could be applied: it would allow \n     Treasury to instruct U.S. financial institutions not to \n     authorize or accept credit card transactions involving a \n     designated foreign jurisdiction or financial institution. \n     Denying tax haven banks the ability to issue credit cards for \n     use in the United States, for example, offers an effective \n     new way to stop U.S. tax cheats from obtaining access to \n     funds hidden offshore.\n     Section 102--Strengthening FATCA\n       Section 102 of the bill is a new section that seeks to \n     clarify, build upon, and strengthen the Foreign Account Tax \n     Compliance Act or FATCA, to flush out hidden foreign accounts \n     and assets used by U.S. taxpayers to evade paying U.S. taxes. \n     When the law becomes effective in 2013, it will require \n     disclosure of account held by U.S. persons at foreign banks, \n     broker-dealers, investment advisers, hedge funds, private \n     equity funds, and other financial firms.\n       Some foreign financial institutions are likely to choose to \n     forego all U.S. investments rather than comply with FATCA's \n     disclosure rules. If some foreign financial institutions \n     decide not to participate in the FATCA system, that's their \n     business. But if U.S. taxpayers start using those same \n     foreign financial institutions to hide assets and evade U.S. \n     taxes to the tune of $100 billion per year, that's our \n     business. The United States has a right to enforce our tax \n     laws and to expect that financial institutions will not \n     assist U.S. tax cheats.\n       Section 101 of the bill would provide U.S. authorities with \n     a way to take direct action against foreign financial \n     institutions that decide to operate outside of the FATCA \n     system and allow U.S. clients to open hidden accounts. If the \n     U.S. Treasury determines that such a foreign financial \n     institution is impeding U.S. tax enforcement, Section 101 \n     would give U.S. authorities a menu of special measures that \n     could be taken in response, including by prohibiting U.S. \n     banks from doing business with that institution.\n       Section 102, in contrast, does not seek to take action \n     against a non-FATCA institution, but instead seeks to \n     strengthen tax enforcement efforts with respect to the U.S. \n     persons taking advantage of the non-disclosure practices at \n     non-FATCA institutions. Section 102 would also clarify when \n     foreign financial institutions are obligated to disclose \n     accounts to the United States under FATCA.\n       Background. In 2006, the Permanent Subcommittee on \n     Investigations released a report with six case histories \n     detailing how U.S. taxpayers were using offshore tax havens \n     to avoid payment of the taxes they owed. These case histories \n     examined an Internet-based company that helped persons obtain \n     offshore entities and accounts; U.S. promoters that \n     designed complex offshore structures to hide client \n     assets, even providing clients with a how-to manual for\n\n[[Page S4520]]\n\n     going offshore; U.S. taxpayers who diverted business \n     income offshore through phony loans and invoices; a one-\n     time tax dodge that deducted phantom offshore stock losses \n     from real U.S. stock income to shelter that income from \n     U.S. taxes; and a 13-year offshore network of 58 offshore \n     trusts and corporations built by American brothers Sam and \n     Charles Wyly. Each of these case histories presented the \n     same fact pattern in which the U.S. taxpayer, through \n     lawyers, banks, or other representatives, set up offshore \n     trusts, corporations, or other entities which had all the \n     trappings of independence but, in fact, were controlled by \n     the U.S. taxpayer whose directives were implemented by \n     compliant offshore personnel acting as the trustees, \n     officers, directors or nominee owners of the offshore \n     entities.\n       In the case of the Wylys, the brothers and their \n     representatives communicated Wyly directives to a so-called \n     trust protector who then relayed the directives to the \n     offshore trustees. In the 13 years examined by the \n     Subcommittee, the offshore trustees never once rejected a \n     Wyly request and never once initiated an action without Wyly \n     approval. They simply did what they were told. A U.S. \n     taxpayer in another case history told the Subcommittee that \n     the offshore personnel who nominally owned and controlled his \n     offshore entities, in fact, always followed his directions, \n     describing himself as the ``puppet master'' in charge of his \n     offshore holdings.\n       When the Subcommittee discussed these case histories with \n     financial administrators from the Isle of Man, the regulators \n     explained that none of the offshore personnel were engaged in \n     any wrongdoing, because their laws permit foreign clients to \n     transmit detailed, daily instructions to offshore service \n     providers on how to handle offshore assets, so long as it is \n     the offshore trustee or corporate officer who gives the final \n     order to buy or sell the assets. They explained that, under \n     their law, an offshore entity is considered legally \n     independent from the person directing its activities so long \n     as that person follows the form of transmitting ``requests'' \n     to the offshore personnel who retain the formal right to make \n     the decisions, even though the offshore personnel always do \n     as they are asked.\n       The Subcommittee case histories illustrate what the tax \n     literature and law enforcement experience have shown for \n     years: that the business model followed in all offshore \n     secrecy jurisdictions is for compliant trustees, corporate \n     administrators, and financial institutions to provide a \n     veneer of independence while ensuring that their U.S. clients \n     retain complete and unfettered control over ``their'' \n     offshore assets. That's the standard operating procedure \n     offshore. Offshore service providers pretend to own or \n     control the offshore trusts, corporations, and accounts they \n     help establish, but what they really do is whatever their \n     clients tell them to do.\n       Rebuttable Evidentiary Presumptions. The reality behind \n     these offshore practices makes a mockery of U.S. laws that \n     normally view trusts and corporations as independent actors. \n     They invite game-playing and tax evasion. To combat these \n     abusive offshore practices, Section 102(g) of the bill would \n     implement a bipartisan recommendation in the 2006 report by \n     establishing several rebuttable evidentiary presumptions that \n     would presume U.S. taxpayer control of offshore entities that \n     they form or do business with, unless the U.S. taxpayer \n     presents clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.\n       The presumptions would apply only in civil, judicial, or \n     administrative tax or securities enforcement proceedings \n     examining offshore entities or transactions. They would place \n     the burden of producing evidence from offshore jurisdiction \n     on the taxpayer who chose to do business in those \n     jurisdictions and who has access to the information, rather \n     than on the federal government which has little or no \n     practical ability to get the information.\n       Section 102(g)(1) would establish three evidentiary \n     presumptions that could be used in a civil tax enforcement \n     proceeding. First is a presumption that a U.S. taxpayer who \n     ``formed, transferred assets to, was a beneficiary of, had a \n     beneficial interest in, or received money or property or the \n     use thereof'' from an offshore entity, such as a trust or \n     corporation, controls that entity. Second is a presumption \n     that funds or other property received from offshore are \n     taxable income, and that funds or other property transferred \n     offshore have not yet been taxed. Third is a presumption that \n     a financial account controlled by a U.S. taxpayer in a \n     foreign country contains enough money--$10,000--to trigger an \n     existing statutory reporting threshold and allow the IRS to \n     assert the minimum penalty for nondisclosure of the account \n     by the taxpayer.\n       Section 102(g)(2) would establish two evidentiary \n     presumptions applicable to civil proceedings to enforce U.S. \n     securities laws. The first would specify that if a director, \n     officer, or major shareholder of a U.S. publicly traded \n     corporation were associated with an offshore entity, that \n     person would be presumed to control that offshore entity. The \n     second presumption would provide that securities nominally \n     owned by an offshore entity are presumed to be beneficially \n     owned by any U.S. person who controlled that offshore entity.\n       All of these presumptions are rebuttable, which means that \n     the U.S. person who is the subject of the proceeding could \n     provide clear and convincing evidence to show that the \n     presumptions were factually inaccurate. To rebut the \n     presumptions, a taxpayer could establish, for example, that \n     an offshore corporation really was controlled by an \n     independent third party, or that money sent from an offshore \n     account really represented a nontaxable gift instead of \n     taxable income. If the taxpayer wished to introduce evidence \n     from a foreign person, such as an offshore banker, corporate \n     officer, or trust administrator, to establish those facts, \n     that foreign person would have to actually appear in the U.S. \n     proceeding in a manner that would permit cross examination.\n       The bill also includes several limitations on the \n     presumptions to ensure their operation is fair and \n     reasonable. First, criminal cases would not be affected by \n     this bill which would apply only to civil proceedings. \n     Second, because the presumptions apply only in enforcement \n     ``proceedings,'' they would not directly affect, for example, \n     a person's reporting obligations on a tax return or SEC \n     filing. The presumptions would come into play only if the IRS \n     or SEC were to challenge a matter in a formal proceeding. \n     Third, the bill would not apply the presumptions to \n     situations where either the U.S. person or the offshore \n     entity is a publicly traded company, because in those \n     situations, even if a transaction were abusive, IRS and SEC \n     officials are generally able to obtain access to necessary \n     information. Fourth, the bill recognizes that certain classes \n     of offshore transactions, such as corporate reorganizations, \n     may not present a potential for abuse, and accordingly \n     authorizes Treasury and the SEC to issue regulations or \n     guidance identifying such classes of transactions, to which \n     the presumptions would not apply.\n       An even more fundamental limitation on the presumptions is \n     that they would apply only to U.S. persons who directly or \n     through an offshore entity choose to do business with a \n     ``non-FATCA institution,'' meaning a foreign financial \n     institution which has not adopted the FATCA disclosure \n     requirements and instead takes advantage of banking, \n     corporate, and tax secrecy laws and practices that make it \n     very difficult for U.S. tax authorities to detect financial \n     accounts benefiting U.S. persons.\n       FATCA's disclosure requirements were designed to combat \n     offshore secrecy and flush out hidden accounts being used by \n     U.S. persons to evade U.S. taxes. Section 102(g) would \n     continue the fight by allowing federal authorities to benefit \n     from rebuttable presumptions regarding the control, \n     ownership, and assets of offshore entities that open accounts \n     at financial institutions outside the FATCA disclosure \n     system. These presumptions would allow U.S. law enforcement \n     to establish what we all know from experience is normally the \n     case in an offshore jurisdiction--that a U.S. person \n     associated with an offshore entity controls that entity; that \n     money and property sent to or from an offshore entity \n     involves taxable income; and that an offshore account that \n     hasn't been disclosed to U.S. authorities should be made \n     subject to inspection. U.S. law enforcement can establish \n     those facts presumptively, without having to pierce the \n     secrecy veil. At the same time, U.S. persons who chose to \n     transact their affairs through accounts at a non-FACTA \n     institution are given the opportunity to lift the veil of \n     secrecy and demonstrate that the presumptions are factually \n     wrong. These rebuttable evidentiary presumptions will provide \n     U.S. tax and securities law enforcement with powerful new \n     tools to shut down tax haven abuses.\n       FATCA Disclosure Obligations. In addition to establishing \n     presumptions, Section 102 would make several changes to \n     clarify and strengthen FATCA's disclosure obligations.\n       Section 102(b) would amend 26 U.S.C. Section 1471 to make \n     it clear that the types of financial accounts that must be \n     disclosed by foreign financial institutions under FATCA \n     include not just savings, money market, or securities \n     accounts, but also transaction accounts that some banks might \n     claim are not depository accounts, such as checking accounts. \n     The section would also make it clear that financial \n     institutions could not omit from their disclosures client \n     assets in the form of derivatives, including swap agreements.\n       Section 102(c) would amend 26 U.S.C. 1472 to clarify when a \n     withholding agent ``knows or has reason to know'' that an \n     account is directly or indirectly owned by a U.S. person and \n     must be disclosed to the United States. The bill provision \n     would make it clear that the withholding agent would have to \n     take into account information obtained as the result of ``any \n     customer identification, anti-money laundering, anti-\n     corruption, or similar obligation to identify \n     accountholders.'' In other words, if a foreign bank knows, as \n     a result of due diligence inquiries made under its anti-money \n     laundering program, that an non-U.S. corporation was \n     beneficially owned by a U.S. person, the foreign bank would \n     have to report that account to the IRS--it could not treat \n     the offshore corporation as a non-U.S. customer. That \n     approach is already implied in the statutory language, but \n     this amendment would make it crystal clear.\n       Section 102(c) would also amend the law to make it clear \n     that the Treasury Secretary, when exercising authority under \n     FATCA to waive disclosure or withholding requirements for \n     non-financial foreign entities, can waive those requirements \n     for only for a class of entities which the Secretary \n     identifies as ``posing a low risk of tax evasion.'' A variety \n     of foreign financial institutions are pressing Treasury to \n     issue waivers under Section 1472, and this amendment would \n     make it clear that such waivers are possible only when the \n     risk of tax evasion is minimal.\n\n[[Page S4521]]\n\n       Section 102(d) would amend 26 U.S.C. 1473 to clarify that \n     the definition of ``substantial United States owner'' \n     includes U.S. persons who are beneficial owners of \n     corporations or the beneficial owner of an entity that is one \n     of the partners in a partnership. While the current statutory \n     language already implies that beneficial owners are included, \n     this amendment would leave no doubt.\n       Section 102(e) would amend 26 U.S.C. 1474 to make two \n     exceptions to the statutory provision which makes account \n     information disclosed to the IRS by foreign financial \n     institutions under FATCA confidential tax return information. \n     The first exception would allow the IRS to disclose the \n     account information to federal law enforcement agencies, \n     including the SEC and bank regulators, investigating possible \n     violations of U.S. law. The second would allow the IRS to \n     disclose the name of any foreign financial institution whose \n     disclosure agreement under FATCA was terminated, either by \n     the institution, its government, or the IRS. Financial \n     institutions should not be able to portray themselves as \n     FATCA institutions if, in fact, they are not.\n       Section 102(f) would amend 26 U.S.C. 6038D, which creates a \n     new tax return disclosure obligation for U.S. taxpayers with \n     interests in ``specified foreign financial assets,'' to \n     clarify that the disclosure requirement applies not only to \n     persons who have a direct or nominal ownership interest in \n     those foreign financial assets, but also to persons who have \n     a beneficial, meaning real, ownership interest in them. While \n     the existing statutory language implies this broad reporting \n     obligation, the amendment would make it clear.\n       Finally, Section 102(a) would amend a new annual tax return \n     obligation established in 26 U.S.C. 1298(f) for passive \n     foreign investment companies (PFICs). PFICs are typically \n     used as holding companies for foreign assets held by U.S. \n     persons, and the intent of the new Section 1298(f) is to \n     require all PFICs to begin filing annual informational tax \n     returns with the IRS. The current statutory language, \n     however, limits the disclosure obligation to any U.S. person \n     who is a ``shareholder'' in a PFIC, and does not cover PFICs \n     whose shares may be nominally held by an offshore corporation \n     or trust, but beneficially owned by a U.S. person. The bill \n     provision would broaden the PFIC reporting requirement to \n     apply to any U.S. person who ``directly or indirectly, forms, \n     transfers assets to, is a beneficiary of, has a beneficial \n     interest in, or receives money or property or the use \n     thereof'' from a PFIC. That broader formulation of who should \n     file the new PFIC annual tax return would ensure that \n     virtually all PFICs associated with U.S. persons will begin \n     filing informational returns with the IRS.\n     Section 103--Corporations Managed and Controlled in the \n         United States\n       Section 103 of the bill focuses on corporations which claim \n     foreign status--often in a tax haven jurisdiction--in order \n     to avoid payment of U.S. taxes, but then operate right here \n     in the United States in direct competition with domestic \n     corporations that are paying their fair share.\n       This offshore game is all too common. In 2008, the Senate \n     Finance Committee held a hearing describing a trip made by \n     GAO to the Cayman Islands to look at the infamous Ugland \n     House, a five-story building that is the official address for \n     over 18,800 registered companies. GAO found that about half \n     of the alleged Ugland House tenants--around 9,000 entities--\n     had a billing address in the United States and were not \n     actual occupants of the building. In fact, GAO determined \n     that none of the companies registered at the Ugland House was \n     an actual occupant. GAO found that the only true occupant of \n     the building was a Cayman law firm, Maples and Calder.\n       Here's what the GAO wrote:\n\n       ``Very few Ugland House registered entities have a \n     significant physical presence in the Cayman Islands or carry \n     out business in the Cayman Islands. According to Maples and \n     Calder partners, the persons establishing these entities are \n     typically referred to Maples by counsel from outside the \n     Cayman Islands, fund managers, and investment banks. As of \n     March 2008 the Cayman Islands Registrar reported that 18,857 \n     entities were registered at the Ugland House address. \n     Approximately 96 percent of these entities were classified as \n     exempted entities under Cayman Islands law, and were thus \n     generally prohibited from carrying out domestic business \n     within the Cayman Islands.''\n\n       Section 103 of the bill is designed to address the Ugland \n     House problem. It focuses on the situation where a \n     corporation is incorporated in a tax haven as a mere shell \n     operation with little or no physical presence or employees in \n     the jurisdiction. The shell entity pretends it is operating \n     in the tax haven, even though its key personnel and \n     decisionmakers are in the United States. The objective of \n     this set up is to enable the owners of the shell entity to \n     take advantage of all of the benefits provided by U.S. legal, \n     educational, financial, and commercial systems, and at the \n     same time avoid paying U.S. taxes.\n       My Subcommittee has seen numerous companies exploit this \n     situation, declaring themselves to be foreign corporations, \n     even though they really operate out of the United States. For \n     example, thousands of hedge funds whose financial experts \n     live in Connecticut, New York, Texas, or California play this \n     game to escape taxes and avoid regulation. In an October 2008 \n     Subcommittee hearing, three sizeable hedge funds, Highbridge \n     Capital which is associated with JPMorgan Chase, Angelo \n     Gordon, and Maverick Capital, admitted that, although all \n     they claimed to be based in the Cayman Islands, none had an \n     office or a single full time employee in that jurisdiction. \n     Instead, their offices and key decisionmakers were located \n     and did business right here in the United States.\n       According to a recent Wall Street Journal article, over 20 \n     percent of the corporations that made initial public \n     offerings or IPOs in the United States in 2010 and so far in \n     2011, have been incorporated in Bermuda or the Cayman \n     Islands, but also described themselves to investors as based \n     in another country, including the United States. The article \n     also described how Samsonite, a Denver-based company, \n     reincorporated in Luxembourg before going public. Too many of \n     these tax-haven incorporations appear to be a deliberate \n     effort to take advantage of U.S. benefits, while dodging U.S. \n     taxation and undercutting U.S. competitors who pay their \n     taxes.\n       Section 103 would put an end to such corporate fictions and \n     offshore tax dodging. It provides that if a corporation is \n     publicly traded or has aggregate gross assets of $50 million \n     or more, and its management and control occurs primarily in \n     the United States, that corporation will be treated as a U.S. \n     domestic corporation for income tax purposes.\n       To implement this provision, Treasury is directed to issue \n     regulations to guide the determination of when management and \n     control occur primarily in the United States, looking at \n     whether ``substantially all of the executive officers and \n     senior management of the corporation who exercise day-to-day \n     responsibility for making decisions involving strategic, \n     financial, and operational policies of the corporation are \n     located primarily within the United States.''\n       This new section relies on the same principles regarding \n     the true location of ownership and control of a company that \n     underlie the corporate inversion rules adopted in the \n     American Jobs Creation Act of 2005. Those inversion rules, \n     however, do not address the fact that some entities directly \n     incorporate in foreign countries and manage their businesses \n     activities from the United States. Section 103 would level \n     the playing field and ensure that entities which incorporate \n     directly in another country are subject to a similar \n     management and control test. Section 103 is also similar in \n     concept to the substantial presence test in the income tax \n     treaty between the United States and the Netherlands, which \n     looks to the primary place of management and control to \n     determine corporate residency.\n       Section 103 would provide an exception for foreign \n     corporations with U.S. parents. This exception from the $50 \n     million gross assets test recognizes that, within a \n     multinational operation, strategic, financial, and \n     operational decisions are often made from a global or \n     regional headquarters location and then implemented by \n     affiliated foreign corporations. Where such decisions are \n     undertaken by a parent corporation that is actively engaged \n     in a U.S. trade or business and is organized in the United \n     States--and is, therefore, already a domestic corporation--\n     the bill generally would not override existing U.S. taxation \n     of international operations. At the same time, the exception \n     makes it clear that the mere existence of a U.S. parent \n     corporation is not sufficient to shield a foreign corporation \n     from also being treated as a domestic corporation under this \n     section. The section would also create an exception for \n     private companies that once met the section's test for \n     treatment as a domestic corporation but, during a later tax \n     year, fell below the $50 million gross assets test, do not \n     expect to exceed that threshold again, and are granted a \n     waiver by the Treasury Secretary.\n       Section 103 contains specific language to stop the \n     outrageous tax dodging that now goes on by too many hedge \n     funds and investment management businesses that structure \n     themselves to appear to be foreign entities, even though \n     their key decisionmakers--the folks who exercise control of \n     the company, its assets, and investment decisions--live and \n     work in the United States. It is unacceptable that such \n     companies utilize U.S. offices, personnel, laws, and markets \n     to make their money, but then stiff Uncle Sam and offload \n     their tax burden onto competitors who play by the rules.\n       To put an end to this charade, Section 103 specifically \n     directs Treasury regulations to specify that, when investment \n     decisions are being made in the United States, the \n     management and control of that corporation shall be \n     treated as occurring primarily in the United States, and \n     that corporation shall be subject to U.S. taxes in the \n     same manner as any other U.S. corporation.\n       If enacted into law, Section 103 would put an end to the \n     unfair situation where some U.S.-based companies pay their \n     fair share of taxes, while others who set up a shell \n     corporation in a tax haven are able to defer or escape \n     taxation, despite the fact that their foreign status is \n     nothing more than a paper fiction.\n     Section 104--Increased Disclosure of Offshore Accounts and \n         Entities\n       Offshore tax abuses thrive in secrecy. Section 104(a) \n     attempts to pierce that secrecy by creating two new \n     disclosure mechanisms requiring third parties to report on \n     offshore\n\n[[Page S4522]]\n\n     transactions undertaken by U.S. persons. The first disclosure \n     mechanism focuses on U.S. financial institutions that open a \n     U.S. account in the name of an offshore entity, such as an \n     offshore trust or corporation, and learn from an anti-money \n     laundering due diligence review, that a U.S. person is the \n     beneficial owner behind that offshore entity. In the Wyly \n     case history examined by the Subcommittee, for example, three \n     major U.S. financial institutions opened dozens of accounts \n     for offshore trusts and corporations which they knew were \n     associated with the Wyly family.\n       Under current anti-money laundering law, all U.S. financial \n     institutions are supposed to know who is behind an account \n     opened in the name of, for example, an offshore shell \n     corporation or trust. They are supposed to obtain this \n     information to safeguard the U.S. financial system against \n     misuse by terrorists, money launderers, and other criminals.\n       Under current tax law, a bank or securities broker that \n     opens an account for a U.S. person is also required to give \n     the IRS a 1099 form reporting any capital gains or other \n     reportable income earned on the account. However, the bank or \n     securities broker need not file a 1099 form if the account is \n     owned by a foreign entity not subject to U.S. tax law. \n     Problems arise when an account is opened in the name of an \n     offshore entity that is nominally not subject to tax, but \n     which the bank or broker knows, from its anti-money \n     laundering review, is owned or controlled by a U.S. person \n     who is subject to tax. The U.S. person should be filing a tax \n     return with the IRS reporting the income of the ``controlled \n     foreign corporation.'' However, since he or she knows it is \n     difficult for the IRS to connect an offshore accountholder to \n     a particular taxpayer, the U.S. person may feel safe in not \n     reporting that income. That complacency might change, \n     however, if the U.S. person knew that the bank or broker who \n     opened the account and learned of the connection had a legal \n     obligation to report any account income to the IRS.\n       Under current law, the way the regulations are written and \n     typically interpreted, the bank or broker can treat an \n     account opened in the name of a foreign corporation as an \n     account that is held by an independent entity that is \n     separate from the U.S. person, even if it knows that the \n     foreign corporation is acting merely as a screen to hide the \n     identity of the U.S. person, who exercises complete authority \n     over the corporation and benefits from any income earned on \n     the account. Many banks and brokers contend that the current \n     regulations impose no duty on them to file a 1099 or other \n     form disclosing that type of account to the IRS.\n       The bill would strengthen current law by expressly \n     requiring a bank or broker that knows, as a result of its \n     anti-money laundering due diligence or otherwise that a U.S. \n     person is the beneficial owner of a foreign entity that \n     opened an account, to disclose that account to the IRS by \n     filing a 1099 or equivalent form reporting the account \n     income. This reporting obligation would not require banks or \n     brokers to gather any new information--financial institutions \n     are already required to perform anti-money laundering due \n     diligence for accounts opened by offshore shell entities. The \n     bill would instead require U.S. financial institutions to act \n     on what they already know by filing the relevant form with \n     the IRS.\n       This section would require such reports to the IRS from two \n     sets of financial institutions. The first set are financial \n     institutions which are located and do business in the United \n     States. The second set is foreign financial institutions \n     which are located and do business outside of the United \n     States, but are voluntary participants in either the FATCA or \n     Qualified Intermediary Program, and have agreed to provide \n     information to the IRS about certain accounts. Under this \n     section, if a foreign financial institution has an account \n     under the FATCA or QI Program, and the accountholder is a \n     non-U.S. entity that is controlled or beneficially owned by a \n     U.S. person, then that foreign financial institution would \n     have to report any reportable assets or income in that \n     account to the IRS.\n       The second disclosure mechanism created by Section 104(a) \n     targets U.S. financial institutions that open foreign bank \n     accounts for U.S. clients at non-FATCA institutions, meaning \n     foreign financial institutions that have not agreed under \n     FATCA to disclose to the IRS the accounts they open for U.S. \n     persons. Past Subcommittee investigations have found that \n     some U.S. financial institutions help their U.S. clients both \n     to form offshore entities and to open foreign bank accounts \n     for those entities, so that their clients do not even need to \n     leave home to set up an offshore structure. Since non-FATCA \n     institutions, by definition, have no obligation to disclose \n     the accounts to U.S. authorities, Section 104(a) would \n     instead impose that disclosure obligation on the U.S. \n     financial institution that helped set up the account for its \n     U.S. client.\n       Section 104(b) imposes the same penalties for the failure \n     to report such accounts as apply to the failure to meet other \n     reporting obligations of withholding agents.\n     Section 105--CDS Loophole\n       Section 105 of the bill targets a tax loophole benefiting \n     credit default swaps, which I call the CDS loophole.\n       A CDS in simple terms is a financial bet about whether a \n     company, a loan, a bond, a mortgage backed security, or some \n     other financial instrument or arrangement will default or \n     experience some other defined ``credit event'' during a \n     specified period of time. The CDS buyer bets that the default \n     or other credit event will happen, while the CDS seller bets \n     it won't. The CDS buyer typically makes a series of payments \n     to the seller over a specified period of time in exchange for \n     a promise that, if a default or other credit event takes \n     place during the covered period, the seller will make a \n     bigger payoff to the buyer. In some cases, CDS buyers and \n     sellers also agree to make payments to each other over the \n     course of the covered period as the CDS rises or falls in \n     value according to whether a credit event looks more or less \n     likely.\n       Five years ago, few people outside of financial circles had \n     ever heard of a credit default swap, but we all learned more \n     than we wanted to during the financial crisis when CDS \n     disasters brought down storied financial firms and almost \n     pushed the U.S. financial system over the cliff. We found out \n     there is now a $30 trillion CDS market worldwide, and that \n     virtually all U.S. financial players engage in CDS \n     transactions. And credit default swaps continue to play a \n     role in financial crises around the world, from Greece to \n     Ireland to Portugal.\n       Well it turns out there's a tax angle which promotes not \n     only CDS gambling, but also offshore finagling. That's \n     because U.S. tax regulations currently allow CDS payments \n     that are sent from the United States to someone offshore to \n     be treated as non-taxable, non-U.S. source income. Let me \n     repeat that. CDS payments sent from the United States are now \n     deemed non-U.S. source income to the recipient for tax \n     purposes. That's because current regs deem the ``source'' of \n     the CDS payment to be where the payment ends up--exactly the \n     opposite of the normal definition of the word ``source.''\n       Well, you can imagine the use that some hedge funds that \n     operate here in the United States, but are incorporated \n     offshore and maintain post office boxes and bank accounts in \n     tax havens, may be making of that tax loophole. They can tell \n     their CDS counterparties to send any CDS payments to their \n     offshore post box or bank account, tell Uncle Sam that those \n     payments are legally considered non-U.S. source income, and \n     bank the CDS payments as foreign income immune to U.S. tax. \n     Hedge funds are likely far from alone in sheltering their CDS \n     income from taxation by sending it offshore. Banks, \n     securities firms, other financial firms, and a lot of \n     commercial firms may be doing the same thing.\n       Our bill would shut down that offshore game simply by \n     recognizing reality--that CDS payments sent from the United \n     States are U.S. source income subject to taxation.\n     Section 106--Foreign Subsidiary Deposits Loophole\n       Section 106 of the bill would take on another type of \n     offshore trickery, closing what I call the foreign subsidiary \n     deposits loophole.\n       Right now, U.S. corporations report holding substantial \n     funds offshore, in the range of $1 trillion in accumulated \n     undistributed earnings. Some of that cash is the result of \n     legitimate foreign business operations, such as plants, \n     stores, or restaurant chains located in other countries. Some \n     of it is the result of transfer pricing arrangements that \n     moved the funds out of the United States with varying degrees \n     of legitimacy. But regardless of how or why the funds are \n     outside of the United States, U.S. corporations generally do \n     not pay taxes on them, invoking tax code provisions that \n     allow them to defer taxation of foreign income as long as \n     those funds are not brought back--repatriated--to the United \n     States.\n       But we need to look closer at the corporations claiming \n     that their funds are offshore. In some cases, those so-called \n     offshore funds are apparently being held in U.S. dollars in \n     U.S. bank and securities accounts located right here in the \n     United States.\n       One easy way for that to happen is for a U.S. corporation \n     to direct its foreign subsidiary to deposit its foreign \n     earnings at a foreign bank, let's say in the Cayman Islands, \n     and ask the Cayman bank to convert any foreign currency into \n     U.S. dollars. The Cayman bank typically complies by opening a \n     U.S. dollar account at a U.S. bank. When one bank opens an \n     account at another bank, the account is generally referred to \n     as a correspondent account.\n       So the Cayman bank opens a correspondent account at a U.S. \n     bank, deposits the funds belonging to the foreign subsidiary \n     of the U.S. corporation, converts the funds into U.S. \n     dollars, and perhaps even invests those dollars in an \n     overnight or money market account or certificate of deposit \n     to earn interest on the money. The U.S. corporation or its \n     foreign subsidiary could even direct the Cayman bank to \n     invest the U.S. dollars in U.S. securities, which the Cayman \n     bank could do by opening a correspondent account at a U.S. \n     securities firm, depositing the corporate dollars, and \n     directing those dollars to be used to buy stocks or bonds. \n     Again, the correspondent account would be in the name of the \n     Cayman bank rather than in the name of the U.S. corporation \n     or its foreign subsidiary, although the funds involved are \n     beneficially owned by the corporate client.\n       The end result is that the U.S. corporation's offshore \n     funds aren't really offshore at all. They are sitting in a \n     U.S. bank or securities firm right here in the United States. \n     The U.S. corporation is getting the benefit of using U.S. \n     dollars, the safest currency in the world. It is also getting \n     the benefit of using U.S. financial institutions, sending \n     funds\n\n[[Page S4523]]\n\n     through U.S. wire transfer networks, and investing in U.S. \n     financial markets, all without paying a dime of income taxes.\n       Our bill would put an end to the fiction that corporate \n     funds deposited in U.S. financial accounts somehow still \n     qualify as offshore funds that have not been repatriated to \n     the United States. Instead, the bill would recognize the \n     reality that the funds are in the United States and are no \n     longer immune to taxation. It would do so by treating any \n     funds that have been deposited by or on behalf of a foreign \n     subsidiary in an account physically located in the United \n     States as a taxable distribution by that foreign subsidiary \n     to its U.S. parent.\n       If U.S. corporations want to defer U.S. taxation on their \n     foreign income by keeping that income offshore, then they \n     should have to actually keep those funds outside of the \n     United States. If they bring that income here to the United \n     States to seek the protections and benefits of having it \n     deposited in U.S. currency at U.S. financial institutions, \n     then those deposits should be treated as repatriated and \n     subject to the same taxes that other domestic corporations \n     pay.\n     Section 201--Country-by-Country Reporting\n       Section 201 of the bill would tackle the problem of \n     offshore secrecy that currently surrounds most multinational \n     corporations by requiring them to provide basic information \n     on a country-by-country basis to the investing public and \n     government authorities.\n       Many multinationals today are complex businesses with \n     sprawling operations that cross multiple international \n     boundaries. In many cases, no one outside of the corporations \n     themselves knows much about what a particular corporation is \n     doing on a per country basis or how its country-specific \n     activities fit into the corporation's overall performance, \n     planning, and operations.\n       The lack of country-specific information deprives investors \n     of key data to analyze a multinational's financial health, \n     exposure to individual countries' problems, and worldwide \n     operations. There is also a lack of information to evaluate \n     tax revenues on a country-specific basis to combat tax \n     evasion, financial fraud, and corruption by government \n     officials.\n       The lack of country-specific information also impedes \n     efficient tax administration, leaving tax authorities unable \n     to effectively analyze transfer pricing arrangements, foreign \n     tax credits, business arrangements that attempt to play one \n     country off another to avoid taxation, and illicit tactics to \n     move profits to tax havens.\n       The bill would assist investors and tax administrators by \n     requiring corporations that are registered with the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission to provide basic \n     information concerning their operations on a country-by-\n     country basis. This basic information would be the \n     approximate number of their employees per country, total \n     amount of sales and purchases involving related and third \n     parties, total amount of financing arrangements with related \n     and third parties; and the total amount of tax obligations \n     and actual tax payments made on a per country basis. This \n     information would have to be furnished to the SEC as part of \n     the corporation's existing SEC filings.\n       The bill requires disclosure of basic data that most \n     multinational corporations would already have. The data \n     wouldn't be burdensome to collect; it's just information that \n     isn't routinely released by many multinationals. It's time to \n     end the secrecy that now enables too many multinationals to \n     run circles around tax administrators.\n       In the case of the United States, the value of country-by-\n     country data becomes apparent after reading a recent article \n     by Professor Kimberly Clausing who estimated that, in 2008 \n     alone, ``the income shifting of multinational firms reduced \n     U.S. government corporate tax revenue by about $90 billion,'' \n     which was ``approximately 30 percent of corporate tax \n     revenues.'' Think about that. Incoming shifting--in which \n     multinationals use various tactics to shift income to tax \n     havens to escape U.S. taxes--is responsible for $90 billion \n     in unpaid taxes in a single year. Over ten years, that \n     translates into $900 billion--nearly a trillion dollars. It \n     is unacceptable to allow that magnitude of nonpayment of \n     corporate taxes to continue year after year in light of the \n     mounting deficits facing this country.\n       IRS data shows that the overall share of federal taxes paid \n     by U.S. corporations has fallen dramatically, from 32% in \n     1952, to about 9% in 2009, the last year in which data is \n     available. A 2008 report by the Government Accountability \n     Office found that, over an eight-year period, about 1.2 \n     million U.S. controlled corporations, or 67% of the corporate \n     tax returns filed, paid no federal corporate income tax at \n     all, despite total gross receipts of $2.1 trillion. At the \n     same time corporations are dodging payment of U.S. taxes, \n     corporate misconduct is continuing to drain the U.S. treasury \n     of billions upon billions of taxpayer dollars to combat \n     mortgage fraud, oil spills, bank bailouts, and more.\n       Corporate nonpayment of tax involves a host of issues, but \n     transfer pricing and offshore tax dodging by multinationals \n     is a big part of the problem. Section 201 of the bill would \n     take the necessary first step to stop multinational \n     corporations from continuing to dodge payment of U.S. taxes \n     through offshore trickery by requiring them to disclose basic \n     corporate data on a country-by-country basis.\n     Section 202--$1 Million Penalty for Hiding Offshore Stock \n         Holdings\n       In addition to tax abuses, the 2006 Subcommittee \n     investigation into the Wyly case history uncovered a host of \n     troubling transactions involving U.S. securities held by the \n     58 offshore trusts and corporations associated with the two \n     Wyly brothers. Over the course of a number of years, the \n     Wylys had obtained about $190 million in stock options as \n     compensation from three U.S. publicly traded corporations at \n     which they were directors and major shareholders. Over time, \n     the Wylys transferred these stock options to the network of \n     offshore entities they had established.\n       The investigation found that, for years, the Wylys had \n     generally failed to report the offshore entities' stock \n     holdings or transactions in their filings with the Securities \n     and Exchange Commission (SEC). They did not report these \n     stock holdings on the ground that the 58 offshore trusts and \n     corporations functioned as independent entities, even though \n     the Wylys continued to direct the entities' investment \n     activities. The public companies where the Wylys were \n     corporate insiders also failed to include in their SEC \n     filings information about the company shares held by the \n     offshore entities, even though the companies knew of their \n     close relationship to the Wylys, that the Wylys had provided \n     the offshore entities with significant stock options, and \n     that the offshore entities held large blocks of the company \n     stock. On other occasions, the public companies and various \n     financial institutions failed to treat the shares held by the \n     offshore entities as affiliated stock, even though they were \n     aware of the offshore entities' close association with the \n     Wylys. The investigation found that, because both the Wylys \n     and the public companies had failed to disclose the holdings \n     of the offshore entities, for 13 years federal regulators had \n     been unaware of those stock holdings and the relationships \n     between the offshore entities and the Wyly brothers.\n       Corporate insiders and public companies are already \n     obligated by current law to disclose stock holdings and \n     transactions of offshore entities affiliated with a company \n     director, officer, or major shareholder. In fact, in 2010, \n     the SEC filed a civil complaint against the Wylys in \n     connection with their hidden offshore holdings and alleged \n     insider trading. Current penalties, however, appear \n     insufficient to ensure compliance in light of the low \n     likelihood that U.S. authorities will learn of transactions \n     that take place in an offshore jurisdiction. To address this \n     problem, Section 202 of the bill would establish a new \n     monetary penalty of up to $1 million for persons who \n     knowingly fail to disclose offshore stock holdings and \n     transactions in violation of U.S. securities laws.\n     Sections 203 and 204--Anti-Money Laundering Programs\n       The Subcommittee's 2006 investigation showed that the Wyly \n     brothers used two hedge funds and a private equity fund \n     controlled by them to funnel millions of untaxed offshore \n     dollars into U.S. investments. Other Subcommittee \n     investigations provide extensive evidence of the role played \n     by U.S. formation agents in assisting U.S. persons to set \n     up offshore structures as well as U.S. shell companies \n     later used in illicit activities, including money \n     laundering, terrorism, tax evasion, and other misconduct. \n     Because hedge funds, private equity funds, and formation \n     agents are as vulnerable as other financial institutions \n     to money launderers seeking entry into the U.S. financial \n     system, the bill contains two provisions aimed at ensuring \n     that these groups know their clients and do not accept or \n     transmit suspect funds into the U.S. financial system.\n       Currently, many unregistered investment companies, such as \n     hedge funds and private equity funds, transmit substantial \n     offshore funds into the United States, yet are not required \n     by law to have anti-money laundering programs, including \n     Know-Your-Customer due diligence procedures and procedures to \n     file suspicious activity reports. There is no reason why this \n     sector of our financial services industry should continue to \n     serve as a gateway into the U.S. financial system for \n     substantial funds that could be connected to tax evasion, \n     terrorist financing, money laundering, or other misconduct.\n       Nine years ago, in 2002, the Treasury Department proposed \n     anti-money laundering regulations for these companies, but \n     never finalized them. In 2008, the Department withdrew them \n     with no explanation. Section 203 of the bill would require \n     Treasury to issue final anti-money laundering regulations for \n     unregistered investment companies within 180 days of the \n     enactment of the bill. Treasury would be free to draw upon \n     its 2002 proposal, but the bill would also require the final \n     regulations to direct hedge funds and private equity funds to \n     exercise due diligence before accepting offshore funds and to \n     comply with the same procedures as other financial \n     institutions if asked by federal regulators to produce \n     records kept offshore.\n       In addition, Section 204 of the bill would add formation \n     agents to the list of persons with anti-money laundering \n     obligations. For the first time, those engaged in the \n     business of forming corporations and other entities, both \n     offshore and in the 50 States, would be responsible for \n     knowing who their clients were and avoiding suspect funds. \n     The bill also directs Treasury to develop anti-money \n     laundering regulations for this group. Treasury's key anti-\n     money laundering agency, the Financial Crimes Enforcement \n     Network, testified before the Subcommittee in 2006, that it \n     was considering drafting such regulations\n\n[[Page S4524]]\n\n     but five years later has yet to do so. Section 204 also \n     creates an exemption for government personnel and for \n     attorneys who use paid formation agents when forming entities \n     for their clients. Since paid formation agents would already \n     be subject to anti-money laundering obligations under the \n     bill, there would be no reason to simultaneously subject \n     attorneys using their services to the same anti-money \n     laundering requirements.\n       We expect and intend that, as in the case of all other \n     entities required to institute anti-money laundering \n     programs, the regulations issued in response to this bill \n     would instruct hedge funds, private equity funds, and \n     formation agents to adopt risk-based procedures that would \n     concentrate their due diligence efforts on clients that pose \n     the highest risk of money laundering.\n     Section 205--IRS John Doe Summons\n       Section 205 of the bill focuses on an important tool used \n     by the IRS in recent years to uncover taxpayers involved in \n     offshore tax schemes, known as John Doe summons. Section 205 \n     would make three technical changes to make the use of John \n     Doe summons more effective in offshore and other complex \n     investigations.\n       A John Doe summons is an administrative IRS summons used to \n     request information in cases where the identity of a taxpayer \n     is unknown. In cases involving a known taxpayer, the IRS may \n     issue a summons to a third party to obtain information about \n     the U.S. taxpayer, but must also notify the taxpayer who then \n     has 20 days to petition a court to quash the summons to the \n     third party. With a John Doe summons, however, IRS does not \n     have the taxpayer's name and does not know where to send the \n     taxpayer notice, so the statute substitutes a procedure in \n     which the IRS must instead apply to a court for advance \n     permission to serve the summons on the third party. To obtain \n     approval of the summons, the IRS must show the court, in \n     public filings to be resolved in open court, that: (1) the \n     summons relates to a particular person or ascertainable class \n     of persons, (2) there is a reasonable basis for concluding \n     that there is a tax compliance issue involving that person or \n     class of persons, and (3) the information sought is not \n     readily available from other sources.\n       In recent years, the IRS has used John Doe summonses to try \n     to obtain information about taxpayers operating in offshore \n     secrecy jurisdictions. For example, the IRS obtained court \n     approval to serve a John Doe summons on a Swiss bank, UBS AG, \n     to obtain the names of tens of thousands of U.S. clients who \n     opened UBS accounts in Switzerland without disclosing those \n     accounts to the IRS. This landmark effort to overcome Swiss \n     secrecy laws not only led to the bank's turning over \n     thousands of U.S. client names to the United States, but also \n     to abandon the country's longtime stance of using its secrecy \n     rules to protect U.S. tax evaders. In earlier years, the IRS \n     obtained court approval to issue John Doe summonses to credit \n     card associations, credit card processors, and credit card \n     merchants, to collect information about taxpayers using \n     credit cards issued by offshore banks. This information led \n     to many successful cases in which the IRS identified funds \n     hidden offshore and recovered unpaid taxes.\n       Currently, however, use of the John Doe summons process is \n     time consuming and expensive. For each John Doe summons \n     involving an offshore secrecy jurisdiction, the IRS has had \n     to establish in court that the involvement of accounts and \n     transactions in offshore secrecy jurisdictions meant there \n     was a significant likelihood of tax compliance problems. To \n     relieve the IRS of the need to make this same proof over and \n     over in court after court, the bill would provide that, in \n     any John Doe summons proceeding involving a class defined in \n     terms of a correspondent or payable through account at a non-\n     FATCA institution, the court may presume that the case raises \n     tax compliance issues. This presumption would then eliminate \n     the need for the IRS to repeatedly establish in court the \n     obvious fact that accounts at non-FATCA institutions raise \n     tax compliance issues.\n       Finally, the bill would streamline the John Doe summons \n     approval process in large ``project'' investigations where \n     the IRS anticipates issuing multiple summonses to definable \n     classes of third parties, such as banks or credit card \n     associations, to obtain information related to particular \n     taxpayers. Right now, for each summons issued in connection \n     with a project, the IRS has to obtain the approval of a \n     court, often having to repeatedly establish the same facts \n     before multiple judges in multiple courts. This repetitive \n     exercise wastes IRS, Justice Department, and court resources, \n     and fragments oversight of the overall IRS investigative \n     effort.\n       To streamline this process and strengthen court oversight \n     of IRS use of John Doe summons, the bill would authorize the \n     IRS to present an investigative project, as a whole, to a \n     single judge to obtain approval for issuing multiple \n     summonses related to that project. In such cases, the court \n     would retain jurisdiction over the case after approval is \n     granted, to exercise ongoing oversight of IRS issuance of \n     summonses under the project. To further strengthen court \n     oversight, the IRS would be required to file a publicly \n     available report with the court on at least an annual basis \n     describing the summonses issued under the project. The court \n     would retain authority to restrict the use of further \n     summonses at any point during the project. To evaluate the \n     effectiveness of this approach, the bill would also direct \n     the Government Accountability Office to report on the use of \n     the provision after five years.\n     Section 206--FBAR Investigations and Suspicious Activity \n         Reports\n       Section 206 of the bill would make several amendments to \n     strengthen the ability of the IRS to enforce the Foreign Bank \n     Account Report (FBAR) requirements and clarify the right of \n     access by IRS civil enforcement authorities to Suspicious \n     Activity Reports.\n       Under present law, a person controlling a foreign financial \n     account with over $10,000 is required to check a box on his \n     or her income tax return and, under Title 31, also file an \n     FBAR form with the IRS. Treasury has delegated to the IRS \n     responsibility for investigating FBAR violations and \n     assessing FBAR penalties. Because the FBAR enforcement \n     jurisdiction derives from Title 31, however, the IRS has set \n     up a complex process for when its personnel may use tax \n     return information when acting in its role as FBAR enforcer. \n     The tax disclosure law, in Section 6103(b)(4) of the tax \n     code, permits the use of tax information only for the \n     administration of the internal revenue laws or ``related \n     statutes.'' To implement this statutory requirement, the IRS \n     currently requires its personnel to determine, at a \n     managerial level and on a case by case basis, that the Title \n     31 FBAR law is a ``related statute.'' Not only does this \n     necessitate a repetitive determination in every FBAR case \n     before an IRS agent can look at the potential non-filer's \n     income tax return to determine if filer checked the FBAR box, \n     but it also prevents the IRS from comparing FBAR filing \n     records to bulk data on foreign accounts received from tax \n     treaty partners to find non-filers.\n       One of the stated purposes for the FBAR filing requirement \n     is that such reports ``have a high degree of usefulness in . \n     . . tax . . . investigations or proceedings.'' 31 U.S.C. \n     5311. If one of the reasons for requiring taxpayers to file \n     FBARs is to use the information for tax purposes, and if the \n     IRS has been charged with FBAR enforcement because of the \n     FBARs' close connection to tax administration, common sense \n     dictates that the FBAR statute should be viewed as a \n     ``related statute'' as for tax disclosure purposes. Section \n     206(a) of the bill would make that clear by adding a \n     provision to Section 6103(b) of the tax code deeming FBAR-\n     related statutes to be ``related statutes,'' thereby allowing \n     IRS personnel to make routine use of tax return information \n     when working on FBAR matters.\n       The second change that would be made by Section 206 is an \n     amendment to simplify the calculation of FBAR penalties. \n     Currently the penalty is determined in part by the balance in \n     the foreign bank account at the time of the ``violation.'' \n     The violation has been interpreted to have occurred on the \n     due date of the FBAR return, which is June 30 of the year \n     following the year to which the report relates. The statute's \n     use of this specific June 30th date can lead to strange \n     results if money is withdrawn from the foreign account after \n     the reporting period closed but before the return due date. \n     To eliminate this unintended problem, Section 206(b) of the \n     bill would instead calculate the penalty using the highest \n     balance in the account during the covered reporting period.\n       The third part of section 206 relates to Suspicious \n     Activity Reports or SARs, which financial institutions are \n     required to file with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Center \n     (FinCEN) of the Treasury Department when they encounter \n     suspicious transactions. FinCEN is required to share this \n     information with law enforcement, but currently does not \n     permit IRS civil investigators access to the information, \n     even though IRS civil investigators are federal law \n     enforcement officials. Sharing SAR information with civil IRS \n     investigators would likely prove very useful in tax \n     investigations and would not increase the risk of disclosure \n     of SAR information, since IRS civil personnel operate under \n     the same tough disclosure rules as IRS criminal \n     investigators. In some cases, IRS civil agents are now \n     issuing an IRS summons to a financial institution to get \n     access, for a production fee, to the very same information \n     the financial institution has already filed with Treasury in \n     a SAR. Section 206(c) of the bill would end that inefficient \n     and costly practice by making it clear that ``law \n     enforcement'' includes civil tax law enforcement.\n     Title III on Abusive Tax Shelters\n       Until now, I've been talking about what the bill would do \n     to combat offshore tax abuses. Now I want to turn to the \n     final title of the bill which offers measures to do combat \n     abusive tax shelters and their promoters who use both \n     domestic and offshore means to achieve their ends.\n       Abusive tax shelters are complicated transactions promoted \n     to provide tax benefits unintended by the tax code. They are \n     very different from legitimate tax shelters, such as \n     deducting the interest paid on a home mortgage or \n     Congressionally approved tax deductions for building \n     affordable housing. Some abusive tax shelters involve \n     complicated domestic transactions; others make use of \n     offshore shenanigans. All abusive tax shelters are marked by \n     one characteristic: there is no real economic or business \n     rationale other than tax avoidance. As Judge Learned Hand \n     wrote in Gregory v. Helvering, they are ``entered upon for no \n     other motive but to escape taxation.''\n       Abusive tax shelters are usually tough to prosecute. Crimes \n     such as terrorism and\n\n[[Page S4525]]\n\n     murder produce instant recognition of the immorality \n     involved. Abusive tax shelters, by contrast, are often \n     ``MEGOs,'' meaning ``My Eyes Glaze Over.'' Those who cook up \n     these concoctions count on their complexity to escape \n     scrutiny and public ire. But regardless of how complicated or \n     eye-glazing, the hawking of abusive tax shelters by tax \n     professionals like accountants, bankers, investment advisers, \n     and lawyers to thousands of people like late-night, cut-rate \n     T.V. bargains is scandalous, and we need to stop it.\n       My Subcommittee has spent years examining the design, sale, \n     and implementation of abusive tax shelters. Our first hearing \n     on this topic in recent years was held in January 2002, when \n     the Subcommittee examined an abusive tax shelter purchased by \n     Enron. In November  2003, the Subcommittee held two days of \n     hearings and released a staff report that pulled back the \n     curtain on how even some respected accounting firms, \n     banks, investment advisors, and law firms had become \n     engines pushing the design and sale of abusive tax \n     shelters to corporations and individuals across this \n     country. In February 2005, the Subcommittee issued a \n     bipartisan report that provided further details on the \n     role these professional firms played in the proliferation \n     of these abusive shelters. Our Subcommittee report was \n     endorsed by the full Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs in April 2005.\n       In 2006, the Subcommittee released a report and held a \n     hearing showing how financial and legal professionals \n     designed and sold an abusive tax shelter known as the POINT \n     Strategy, which depended upon secrecy laws and practices in \n     the Isle of Man to conceal the phony nature of securities \n     trades that lay at the center of this tax shelter \n     transaction. In 2008, the Subcommittee released a staff \n     report and held a hearing on how financial firms have \n     designed and sold so-called dividend enhancement transactions \n     to help offshore hedge funds and others escape payment of \n     U.S. taxes on U.S. stock dividends.\n       The Subcommittee investigations have found that many \n     abusive tax shelters are not dreamed up by the taxpayers who \n     use them. Instead, they are devised by tax professionals who \n     then sell the tax shelter to clients for a fee. In fact, over \n     the years we've found U.S. tax advisors cooking up one \n     complex scheme after another, packaging them up as generic \n     ``tax products'' with boiler-plate legal and tax opinion \n     letters, and then undertaking elaborate marketing schemes to \n     peddle these products to literally thousands of persons \n     across the country. In return, these tax shelter promoters \n     were getting hundreds of millions of dollars in fees, while \n     diverting billions of dollars in tax revenues from the U.S. \n     Treasury each year.\n       For example, one shelter investigated by the Subcommittee \n     and featured in the 2003 hearings became part of an IRS \n     settlement effort involving a set of abusive tax shelters \n     known as ``Son of Boss.'' Following our hearing, more than \n     1,200 taxpayers admitted wrongdoing and agreed to pay back \n     taxes, interest and penalties totaling more than $3.7 \n     billion. That's billions of dollars the IRS collected on just \n     one type of tax shelter, demonstrating both the depth of the \n     problem and the potential for progress. The POINT shelter \n     featured in our 2006 hearing involved another $300 million in \n     tax loss on transactions conducted by just six taxpayers. The \n     offshore dividend tax scams we examined in 2008 meant \n     additional billions of dollars in unpaid taxes over a ten \n     year period.\n       Title III of the bill contains a number of measures to curb \n     abusive tax shelters. It would strengthen the penalties \n     imposed on those who aid or abet tax evasion. Several \n     provisions would deter bank participation in abusive tax \n     shelter activities by requiring regulators to develop new \n     examination procedures to detect and stop such activities. \n     Others would end outdated communication barriers between the \n     IRS and other federal enforcement agencies such as the SEC, \n     bank regulators, and the Public Company Accounting Oversight \n     Board, to allow the exchange of information relating to tax \n     evasion cases. The bill also provides for increased \n     disclosure of tax shelter information to Congress. In \n     addition, the bill would simplify and clarify an existing \n     prohibition on the payment of fees linked to tax benefits; \n     and authorize Treasury to issue tougher standards for tax \n     shelter opinion letters.\n       Let me be more specific about these key provisions to curb \n     abusive tax shelters.\n     Sections 301 and 302--Strengthening Tax Shelter Penalties\n       Sections 301 and 302 of the bill would strengthen two very \n     important penalties that the IRS can use in its fight against \n     the professionals who make complex abusive shelters possible. \n     When we started investigating abusive tax shelters, the \n     penalty for promoting these scams, as set forth in Section \n     6700 of the tax code, was the lesser of $1,000 or 100 percent \n     of the promoter's gross income derived from the prohibited \n     activity. That meant in most cases the maximum fine was just \n     $1,000.\n       We've investigated abusive tax shelters that sold for \n     $100,000 or $250,000 apiece, and some that sold for as much \n     as $5 million apiece. We also saw instances in which the same \n     cookie-cutter tax opinion letter was sold to 100 or even 200 \n     clients. Given the huge profits, the $1,000 fine was \n     laughable.\n       The Senate acknowledged that in 2004, when it adopted the \n     Levin-Coleman amendment to the JOBS Act, S. 1637, raising the \n     Section 6700 penalty on abusive tax shelter promoters to 100 \n     percent of the fees earned by the promoter from the abusive \n     shelter. A 100 percent penalty would have ensured that the \n     abusive tax shelter hucksters would not get to keep a single \n     penny of their ill-gotten gains. That figure, however, was \n     cut in half during the conference on the JOBS Act, with the \n     result being that the current Section 6700 penalty can now \n     reach, but not exceed, 50 percent of the fees earned by a \n     promoter of an abusive tax shelter.\n       While a 50 percent penalty is an obvious improvement over \n     $1,000, this penalty still is inadequate and makes no sense. \n     Why should anyone who pushes an illegal tax shelter that robs \n     our Treasury of needed revenues get to keep half of their \n     ill-gotten gains? What deterrent effect is created by a \n     penalty that allows promoters to keep half of their fees if \n     caught, and all of their fees if they are not caught?\n       Effective penalties should make sure that the peddler of an \n     abusive tax shelter is deprived of every penny of profit \n     earned from selling or implementing the shelter and then is \n     fined on top of that. Section 301 of this bill would do just \n     that by increasing the penalty on tax shelter promoters to an \n     amount equal to up to 150 percent of the promoters' gross \n     income from the prohibited activity.\n       Section 302 of the bill would address a second weak tax \n     code penalty which currently is supposed to deter and punish \n     those who knowingly help taxpayers understate their taxes to \n     the IRS. Aside from tax shelter ``promoters,'' there are many \n     other types of professional firms that aid and abet tax \n     evasion by helping taxpayers carry out abusive tax schemes. \n     For example, law firms are often asked to write ``opinion \n     letters'' to help taxpayers head off IRS inquiries and fines \n     that might otherwise apply to their use of an abusive \n     shelter. Currently, under Section 6701 of the tax code, these \n     aiders and abettors face a maximum penalty of only $1,000, or \n     $10,000 if the offender is a corporation. When law firms are \n     getting $50,000 for issuing cookie-cutter opinion letters, a \n     $1,000 fine provides no deterrent effect whatsoever. A $1,000 \n     fine is like getting a jaywalking ticket for robbing a bank.\n       Section 302 of the bill would strengthen Section 6701 of \n     the tax code by subjecting aiders and abettors to a maximum \n     fine of up to 150 percent of the aider and abettor's gross \n     income from the prohibited activity. This penalty would apply \n     to all aiders and abettors, not just tax return preparers.\n       Again, the Senate has recognized the need to toughen this \n     critical penalty. In the 2004 JOBS Act, Senator Coleman and I \n     successfully increased this fine to 100 percent of the gross \n     income derived from the prohibited activity. Unfortunately, \n     the conference report completely omitted this change, \n     allowing many aiders and abettors to continue to profit \n     without penalty from their wrongdoing.\n       If further justification for toughening these penalties is \n     needed, one document uncovered by our investigation shows the \n     cold calculation engaged in by a tax advisor facing low \n     fines. A senior tax professional at accounting giant KPMG \n     compared possible tax shelter fees with possible tax shelter \n     penalties if the firm were caught promoting an illegal tax \n     shelter. This senior tax professional wrote to his colleagues \n     the following: ``[O]ur average deal would result in KPMG fees \n     of $360,000 with a maximum penalty exposure of only \n     $31,000.'' He then recommended the obvious: going forward \n     with sales of the abusive tax shelter on a cost-benefit \n     basis.\n     Section 303--Fees Contingent upon Obtaining Tax Benefits\n       Another finding of the Subcommittee investigations is that \n     some tax practitioners are circumventing current state and \n     federal constraints on charging tax service fees that are \n     dependent on the amount of promised tax benefits. \n     Traditionally, accounting firms charged flat fees or hourly \n     fees for their tax services. In the 1990s, however, they \n     began charging ``value added'' fees based on, in the words of \n     one accounting firm's manual, ``the value of the services \n     provided, as opposed to the time required to perform the \n     services.'' In addition, some firms began charging \n     ``contingent fees'' that were calculated according to the \n     size of the paper ``loss'' that could be produced for a \n     client and used to offset the client's taxable income--the \n     greater the so-called loss, the greater the fee.\n       In response, many states prohibited accounting firms from \n     charging contingent fees for tax work to avoid creating \n     incentives for these firms to devise ways to shelter \n     substantial sums. The SEC and the American Institute of \n     Certified Public Accountants also issued rules restricting \n     contingent fees, allowing them in only limited circumstances. \n     The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board issued a \n     similar rule prohibiting public accounting firms from \n     charging contingent fees for tax services provided to the \n     public companies they audit. Each of these federal, state, \n     and professional ethics rules seeks to limit the use of \n     contingent fees under certain, limited circumstances.\n       The Subcommittee investigation found several instances of \n     tax shelter fees that were linked to the amount of a \n     taxpayer's projected paper losses which could be used to \n     shelter income from taxation. For example, in four tax \n     shelters examined by the Subcommittee in 2003, documents \n     showed that the fees were equal to a percentage of the paper \n     loss to be generated by the transaction. In one case, the \n     fees were typically set at 7 percent of the transaction's \n     generated ``tax loss'' that clients could use to\n\n[[Page S4526]]\n\n     reduce other taxable income. In another, the fee was only 3.5 \n     percent of the loss, but the losses were large enough to \n     generate a fee of over $53 million on a single transaction. \n     In other words, the greater the loss that could be concocted \n     for the taxpayer or ``investor,'' the greater the profit for \n     the tax promoter. Think about that--greater the loss, the \n     greater the fee. How's that for turning capitalism on its \n     head?\n       In addition, evidence indicated that, in at least one \n     instance, a tax advisor was willing to deliberately \n     manipulate the way it handled certain tax products to \n     circumvent contingent fee prohibitions. An internal document \n     at an accounting firm related to a specific tax shelter, for \n     example, identified the states that prohibited contingent \n     fees. Then, rather than prohibit the tax shelter transactions \n     in those states or require an alternative fee structure, the \n     memorandum directed the firm's tax professionals to make sure \n     the engagement letter was signed, the engagement was managed, \n     and the bulk of services was performed ``in a jurisdiction \n     that does not prohibit contingency fees.''\n       Right now, the prohibitions on contingent fees are complex \n     and must be evaluated in the context of a patchwork of \n     federal, state, and professional ethics rules. Section 303 of \n     the bill would establish a single enforceable rule, \n     applicable nationwide, that would prohibit tax practitioners \n     from charging fees calculated according to a projected or \n     actual amount of tax savings or paper losses.\n     Section 304--Deterring Participation in Abusive Tax Shelter \n         Activities\n       Section 304 of the bill targets financial institutions that \n     offer financing or securities transactions to advance abusive \n     tax shelters disguised as investment opportunities. Tax \n     shelter schemes lack the economic risks and rewards \n     associated with true investments. But to make these phony \n     transactions look legitimate, some abusive tax shelters make \n     use of significant amounts of money in low risk schemes \n     mischaracterized as real investments. The financing or \n     securities transactions called for by these schemes are often \n     supplied by a bank, securities firm, or other financial \n     institution and used to generate paper losses that the \n     taxpayer can then use to shelter income from taxation.\n       Currently the tax code prohibits financial institutions \n     from providing products or services that aid or abet tax \n     evasion or that promote or implement abusive tax shelters. \n     The agencies that oversee these financial institutions on a \n     daily basis, however, are experts in banking and securities \n     law and generally lack the expertise to spot abusive tax \n     shelter activity. Section 304 would crack down on financial \n     institutions' illegal tax shelter activities by requiring \n     federal bank regulators and the SEC to work with the IRS to \n     develop examination techniques to detect such abusive \n     activities and put an end to them.\n       These examination techniques are intended to be part of \n     routine regulatory examinations, with regulators reporting \n     suspect activity or potential violations to the IRS. The \n     agencies would also be required to prepare a joint report to \n     Congress in 2013 on preventing the participation of financial \n     institutions in tax evasion or tax shelter activities.\n     Section 305--Ending Communication Barriers between \n         Enforcement Agencies\n       During hearings before the Permanent Subcommittee on \n     Investigations on tax shelters in November 2003, IRS \n     Commissioner Mark Everson testified that his agency was \n     barred by Section 6103 of the tax code from communicating \n     information to other federal agencies that would assist those \n     agencies in their law enforcement duties. He pointed out that \n     the IRS was barred from providing tax return information to \n     the SEC, federal bank regulators, and the Public Company \n     Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)--even, for example, when \n     that information might assist the SEC in evaluating whether \n     an abusive tax shelter resulted in deceptive accounting in a \n     public company's financial statements, might help the Federal \n     Reserve determine whether a bank selling tax products to its \n     clients had violated the law against promoting abusive tax \n     shelters, or help the PCAOB judge whether an accounting firm \n     had impaired its independence by selling tax shelters to its \n     audit clients.\n       Another example demonstrates how harmful these information \n     barriers are to legitimate law enforcement efforts. In 2004, \n     the IRS offered a settlement initiative to companies and \n     corporate executives who participated in an abusive tax \n     shelter involving the transfer of stock options to family-\n     controlled entities. Over a hundred corporations and \n     executives responded with admissions of wrongdoing. In \n     addition to tax violations, their misconduct may be linked to \n     securities law violations and improprieties by corporate \n     auditors or banks, but the IRS told the Subcommittee that it \n     was barred by law from sharing the names of the wrongdoers \n     with the SEC, banking regulators, or PCAOB. The same is true \n     for the offshore dividend tax shelters exposed in the \n     Subcommittee's 2008 hearing. The IRS knows who the offending \n     banks and investment firms are that designed and sold \n     questionable dividend enhancement transactions to offshore \n     hedge funds and others, but it is barred by Section 6103 of \n     the tax code from providing detailed information or documents \n     to the SEC or banking regulators who oversee the relevant \n     financial institutions.\n       These communication barriers are outdated, inefficient, and \n     ill-suited to stopping the tax schemes now affecting public \n     companies, banks, investment firms, and accounting firms. To \n     address this problem, Section 305 of this bill would \n     authorize the Treasury Secretary, with appropriate privacy \n     safeguards, to disclose to the SEC, federal banking agencies, \n     and the PCAOB, upon request, tax return information related \n     to abusive tax shelters, inappropriate tax avoidance, or tax \n     evasion. The agencies could then use this information only \n     for law enforcement purposes, such as preventing accounting \n     firms, investment firms, or banks from promoting abusive tax \n     shelters, or detecting accounting fraud in the financial \n     statements of public companies.\n     Section 306--Increased Disclosure of Tax Shelter Information \n         to Congress\n       The bill would also provide for increased disclosure of tax \n     shelter information to Congress. Section 306 would make it \n     clear that companies providing tax return preparation \n     services to taxpayers cannot refuse to comply with a \n     Congressional document subpoena by citing Section 7216, which \n     prohibits tax return preparers from disclosing taxpayer \n     information to third parties. Several accounting and law \n     firms raised this claim in response to document subpoenas \n     issued by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, \n     contending they were barred by the nondisclosure provision in \n     Section 7216 from producing documents related to the sale of \n     abusive tax shelters to clients.\n       The accounting and law firms maintained this position \n     despite an analysis provided by the Senate legal counsel \n     showing that the nondisclosure provision was never intended \n     to create a privilege or to override a Senate subpoena, as \n     demonstrated in federal regulations interpreting the \n     provision. This bill would codify the existing regulations \n     interpreting Section 7216 and make it clear that \n     Congressional document subpoenas must be honored.\n       Section 306 would also ensure Congress has access to \n     information about decisions by Treasury related to an \n     organization's tax exempt status. A 2003 decision by the D.C. \n     Circuit Court of Appeals, Tax Analysts v. IRS, struck down \n     certain IRS regulations and held that the IRS must disclose \n     letters denying or revoking an organization's tax exempt \n     status. Despite this court decision, the IRS has been \n     reluctant to disclose such information, not only to the \n     public, but also to Congress, including in response to \n     requests by the Subcommittee.\n       For example, in 2005, the IRS revoked the tax exempt status \n     of four credit counseling firms, and, despite the Tax \n     Analysts case, claimed that it could not disclose to the \n     Subcommittee the names of the four firms or the reasons for \n     revoking their tax exemption. Section 306 would make it clear \n     that, upon receipt of a request from a Congressional \n     committee or subcommittee, the IRS must disclose documents, \n     other than a tax return, related to the agency's \n     determination to grant, deny, revoke or restore an \n     organization's exemption from taxation.\n     Section 307--Tax Shelter Opinion Letters\n       The final provision in the bill would address issues \n     related to opinion letters issued by law firms and others in \n     support of complex tax schemes. The Treasury Department has \n     already issued a set of standards for tax practitioners who \n     provide opinion letters on the tax implications of potential \n     tax shelters under Circular 230. Section 308 of the bill \n     would not only provide the express statutory authority which \n     is currently lacking for these standards, but also strengthen \n     them.\n       The public has traditionally relied on tax opinion letters \n     to obtain informed and trustworthy advice about whether a \n     tax-motivated transaction meets the requirements of the law. \n     The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has found that, \n     in too many cases, tax opinion letters no longer contain \n     disinterested and reliable tax advice, even when issued by \n     supposedly reputable accounting or law firms. Instead, some \n     tax opinion letters have become marketing tools used by tax \n     shelter promoters and their allies to sell clients on their \n     latest tax products. In many of these cases, financial \n     interests and biases were concealed, unreasonable factual \n     assumptions were used to justify dubious legal conclusions, \n     and taxpayers were misled about the risk that the proposed \n     transaction would later be designated an illegal tax shelter. \n     Reforms are essential to address these abuses and restore the \n     integrity of tax opinion letters.\n       The Circular 230 standards should be strengthened by \n     addressing a wider spectrum of tax shelter opinion letter \n     problems, including preventing concealed collaboration among \n     supposedly independent letter writers; avoiding conflicts of \n     interest that would impair auditor independence; ensuring \n     appropriate fee charges; preventing practitioners and firms \n     from aiding and abetting the understatement of tax liability \n     by clients; and banning the promotion of potentially abusive \n     tax shelters. By authorizing Treasury to address each of \n     these areas, a beefed-up Circular 230 could help reduce the \n     ongoing abusive practices related to tax shelter opinion \n     letters.\n       Conclusion. Tax evasion eats at the fabric of society, not \n     only by widening deficits and starving health care, \n     education, and other needed government services of resources, \n     but also by undermining public trust--making honest folks \n     feel like they are being taken advantage of when they pay \n     their fair share. While the eyes of some people may glaze \n     over when tax havens and tax shelters are discussed, \n     unscrupulous taxpayers and tax professionals see illicit \n     dollar signs. Our\n\n[[Page S4527]]\n\n     commitment to crack down on their abuses must be as strong as \n     their determination to get away with ripping off Uncle Sam \n     and honest American taxpayers.\n       We can fight back against offshore tax abuses and abusive \n     tax shelters if we summon the political will. The Stop Tax \n     Haven Abuse Act, which is the product of years of work, \n     offers the tools needed to tear down tax haven secrecy walls \n     in favour of transparency, cooperation, and tax compliance.

A bill to establish Coltsville National Historical Park in \nthe State of Connecticut, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nColtsville National Historical Park Act, and express my strong support \nfor the designation of the Coltsville Historical District in Hartford, \nConnecticut as a National Park. I thank my colleague Senator Blumenthal \nfor joining me as an original cosponsor of this legislation, and also \nwish to thank my longtime friend and colleague, Congressman John \nLarson, who recently introduced an identical version of this bill in \nthe House.\n  In 1990, I had the privilege of introducing and successfully fighting \nfor the legislation that established the Weir Farm National Historic \nSite as Connecticut's first and, as yet, only contribution to the \nNational Park System. Over two decades later, I am honored to strive \nfor the same outcome for Coltsville.\n  Located on the banks of the Connecticut River in Hartford, Coltsville \nis at the heart of a cluster of historical landmarks of great \nsignificance for Connecticut and our entire Nation. A newly established \nnational park in Coltsville would span more than 200 acres and beckon \ntourists to such Hartford destinations as the homes of Mark Twain and \nHarriet Beecher Stowe, as well as to the great events organized by \nRiverfront Recapture, along our beautiful waterfront.\n  Coltsville's past is as compelling as its future possibilities. \nSamuel Colt, born in Hartford, was first famous for developing the \nrevolving-breech pistol, which became one of the standard small arms of \nthe world in the last half of the nineteenth century. Production of \nthat firearm helped build a model town on the banks of the Connecticut \nRiver, including the Colt Armory, workers' housing, Colt Park, the \nChurch of the Good Shepherd, and the Colt family home, known as \n``Armsmear.'' At its peak during the twentieth century, the factory at \nColtsville employed over 10,000 people and made a significant \ncontribution to the country's war effort.\n  But the legacy of the Colt operation goes well beyond the \nmanufacturing of guns. Colt himself invented a submarine battery used \nin harbor defense, a submarine telegraph cable, and other innovations. \nThe success of Samuel and Elizabeth Colt's precision firearms business \nled to other industrial advancements in Connecticut and throughout New \nEngland, including the manufacture of sewing machines and typewriters. \nUltimately, the spirit of innovation fostered at Coltsville was crucial \nto establishing Connecticut's proud tradition of manufacturing \neverything from small arms to jet engines, and even the submarines that \nour servicemembers use to defend our freedoms.\n  The early industrial innovators represented the same pioneering \nspirit of American ingenuity that we see today in defense, information, \nand biotechnology firms. Today, we sometimes take this innovation for \ngranted. In Samuel Colt's day, every ingenious development was a grand \nachievement and a small revelation.\n  The industrial revolution transformed our nation culturally and \neconomically like no other force ever has. People moved into the \ncities. Living standards rose. The middle class grew and economic \ngrowth intensified.\n  Unfortunately, Hartford has not been immune to the economic hardships \nthe country is facing. That is why Coltsville must be a beacon to our \nnation of what once was and can be again, the center of industry, \ninnovation, and prosperity. Just as Coltsville did for Hartford during \nthe Industrial Revolution, the designation of a National Park will \nserve as a catalyst for growth in a struggling city.\n  I believe that memorializing Sam and Elizabeth Colt and their \nmovement is particularly important as Americans struggle to emerge from \na deep recession. The way we are going to revitalize our economy is to \ninvest in people, to invest in and inspire innovation that will pioneer \nnew industries that will create millions of new jobs. Coltsville is a \nhistoric landmark and a living reminder of the extraordinary advances \nin technology and innovation that have been America's story for over \n400 years.\n  I thank Senator Blumenthal and Congressman Larson for their work and \ndedication to advance Coltsville's status as a National Historical \nPark. I reaffirm my strong support today for recognizing these values, \nand I look forward to working cooperatively with my colleagues in \nmaking it happen.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S4528]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1347\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
