It is my honor and \nprivilege to welcome him to our Chamber this morning as one of \nDelaware's strongest and finest faith leaders.\n  Reverend Gerdts leads the congregation at First and Central \nPresbyterian Church in Wilmington. Each time I join with him on Sunday \nmornings, I am uplifted by the stirring music, I am challenged by his \npassionate sermons, and I leave engaged for the week, rooted in my \nfaith and moved forward by his words and by his leadership.\n  But Reverend Gerdts' leadership extends far beyond the walls of his \nchurch. It touches those most in need in our community. The church \nliterally opens its doors every Saturday, welcoming in homeless \nDelawareans as well as welcoming in schoolchildren who need smaller \nclass sizes and better instruction to succeed.\n  I have had the pleasure of knowing Reverend Gerdts for more than a \ndozen years. In my own service in county government I knew him as chair \nof the Diversity Commission, and he helped lead the charge for equality \nand civil unions in Delaware last year. He has made a real and lasting \ncontribution to our community. He and his wonderful wife Walle are part \nof what makes Delaware a great place.\n  As he shared with us in his prayer, he is exactly the sort of person \nwho, through a listening heart, has become a powerful and effective \nservant leader of faith in my home community.\n  My thanks to the Chaplain for allowing guest Chaplains, and my thanks \nto Rev. Doug Gerdts for his friendship, his faith, and his leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Delaware has been such a \ngreat addition to the Senate. He is well respected on both sides of the \naisle, and he is a man of spiritual quality. Among his other \nattributes, he has a divinity degree from Yale University. Without \nelaborating, I am just so pleased he is my friend and a Member of the \nSenate.\n\n[[Page S6476]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6476-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, this month I join more than 52 million \nLatinos in Nevada and across the country to celebrate Hispanic Heritage \nMonth.\n  Each year Hispanic Heritage Month is an opportunity to honor the \ncontributions of a population that is so important to our national \nidentity--a community that has contributed to our country's progress \nfor centuries.\n  We see those contributions in every facet of our society: on the \nbattlefield and in the boardroom, in the courtroom and the classroom, \nat the art gallery and in the recording studio, and on the playing \nfield. In Nevada Hispanic influence is evident in the name of our \nState--Nevada, snowcapped Las Vegas, and the meadows.\n  Today, more than one-quarter of Nevada's population is Hispanic. \nNationwide, Latinos are expected to make up 60 percent of the \npopulation growth in the coming decades. To ensure our country thrives, \nwe need to make sure its Hispanic population thrives as well.\n  That is why President Obama and Democrats in Congress have fought for \nthe policies that are making the Hispanic community stronger and more \nprosperous. Despite opposition, we have made progress on economic and \neducational issues that are important to Latinos and to all Americans. \nThe Recovery Act, which included tax cuts for working families and \nimprovements in unemployment insurance, kept more than 2 million \nHispanics out of poverty.\n  Unlike Governor Romney, we know Americans who access the employment \nbenefits they have earned while working are not ``victims'' who are \nunwilling to take ``personal responsibility'' for their lives. \n``Victims'' is Mitt Romney's word; ``personal responsibility'' are his \nwords.\n  Democrats secured tax credits for more than 8 million Hispanic \nchildren and their families. Mitt Romney, on the other hand, believes \ntax credits for working parents struggling to make ends meet are a hand \nout, not a hand up.\n  Democrats fought to give small business loans to almost 9,000 \nHispanic-owned businesses. Under a Romney administration, loans for \nsmall businesses would be a thing of the past--one more remnant of the \ndependency culture he loathes.\n  Mitt Romney was caught on tape telling wealthy donors he would be \nwinning this election if he was Latino. That is what he said. But we \nknow Mitt Romney's problem isn't that he is not Hispanic; his problem \nis that he opposes the commonsense policies that are good for Hispanic \nfamilies.\n  Republicans have been paying lipservice to concerned Hispanic \nfamilies in the months leading up to election day. Democrats are \nhelping Hispanic families tackle the challenges they face every day.\n  To us, Hispanic Heritage Month isn't just about recognizing the \nincredible contributions Hispanic Americans make to our Nation; it is \nalso about building a brighter future for Hispanic Americans in our \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6476-4", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we all understand there is an election \ngoing on around here in a few months, but I would like to remind my \ncolleagues on the other side that we also have a job to do right now. \nWe have multiple crisis-level issues to deal with. Yet our Democratic \nfriends don't seem to want to do a thing. Never before--never before--\nhas a President and a Senate done so little to confront challenges so \ngreat.\n  We have a $16 trillion debt. Democrats haven't bothered to pass a \nbudget in 3 years. Every single American will get hit with a massive \ntax hike in just 3 months if we don't act to prevent it.\n  Democrats are saying we shouldn't do anything about it; just go off \nthe cliff. Go off the cliff, and let's see what happens. The defense \nbudget is about to suffer automatic cuts that the President's own \nDefense Secretary--the Defense Secretary in this administration--has \ndescribed as devastating. But Democrats can't be bothered to figure out \na way to avoid them.\n  The Middle East is in turmoil. We remain at war in Afghanistan and \nwith al-Qaida, and Senate Democrats have not even bothered to pass the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  Gas prices have more than doubled over the past 4 years--doubled in \njust 4 years. Democrats responded by conspiring with the President to \nmake sure a domestic pipeline didn't get built. They just let the debt \ngrow, let taxes go up, let the defense cuts stand, and let gas prices \nget higher and higher. They don't pass a budget, don't pass any \nspending bills, don't do anything that involves making tough choices; \njust sit around and kill time in the hopes that the voters will focus \non the other guys instead.\n  Look, our constituents didn't send us here to watch the clock or to \noffer running commentary on the Senate floor. They sent us here to make \na difference. We have jobs to do. It is about time we did them. In \nthese very challenging times, Americans deserve leadership. Never \nbefore--never before--has a President and a Senate majority party done \nso little when our challenges were so great. There is no excuse for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6476-6", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, some say the reason for a do-nothing \nSenate--or the cure for it--is that we need to change the rules. I say \nwe need a change in behavior, and I wish to offer a single example.\n  We have a big spending and borrowing problem: 42 cents out of every \ndollar we are borrowing. We are headed off a fiscal cliff. The minority \nleader has described that.\n  The Australian Foreign Minister has said the United States of America \nis\n\n[[Page S6477]]\n\none budget deal away from restoring its global preeminence, so one \nwould think we would have a budget. Then one would think we would deal \nwith the appropriations bills which are the basic work of the Senate.\n  I and others on both sides of the aisle came to the floor earlier \nthis year to compliment the majority and minority leaders for their \ndecision to bring all 12 appropriations bills to the floor. The \ncommittee did its work; 11 of the 12 have been reported to the floor. \nThe House did its work; 11 of the 12 were reported to the floor, and 6 \nwere passed. But the majority leader said we are not going to consider \nany appropriations bills--no appropriations bills.\n  Being elected to the Senate and not being allowed to vote on \nappropriations bills is like being invited to join the Grand Ole Opry \nand not being allowed to sing. We need a Republican majority. If we \nhave one we can have a budget, and if we have one we will bring \nappropriations bills to the floor. We will debate them, we will amend \nthem, we will vote on them, and we will do our jobs.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, there is no question that the premier issue \nfor most Americans is jobs and the economy. It is the issue that is on \nthe minds of all Americans. They are pocketbook issues that impact \nmiddle-class Americans all across the country.\n  For the past 3\\1/2\\ years, the President and the Democrats here in \nthe Senate have failed to provide the leadership America needs to make \na stronger middle class. Middle-class Americans continue to face a \nbleak economic picture on this President's watch. We have seen gas \nprices more than double--the highest level in September that we have \never seen for the month of September. Middle-class income is down by \nnearly $4,000 since the President took office. Just last week, a Kaiser \nFamily Foundation study came out indicating worker health insurance \ncosts have increased by 29 percent since the President took office. The \nPresident promised to lower health care costs by $2,500 per family. \nInstead, average family premiums have increased by over $3,000 since he \ntook office.\n  Republicans have solutions to grow the economy and to help the middle \nclass, strengthen the middle class. We support commonsense solutions \nsuch as increasing domestic energy, reforming our Tax Code, and \nstopping the job-killing regulations that are killing our small \nbusinesses. We hope to have the opportunity to work on those solutions \nfor America's future.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the President, the administration, and the \nSenate majority have failed to govern during a crucial time for our \nNation. There is a willingness to kick our problems down the road, with \nthe hopes that the next election will suddenly inspire action. Rome \nburned while Nero fiddled. We have had enough fiddling.\n  The President's answer to jobs and the economy was to have his failed \nbudget. Three times it was voted on without a single vote in favor--not \neven a single Democrat in favor.\n  Over 23 million Americans are unemployed or underemployed. Government \nregulations and redtape stunt business growth. That is not leadership, \nthat is being asleep at the wheel. Their answer to jobs is a bill with \na good title and a poison pill that comes right to the floor, and it is \nset up so the poison pill cannot be amended out, and then they wonder \nwhy the bill does not pass. That is politics. That is not legislating.\n  What is their plan for America? We have yet to see one. The lack of a \nbudget shows they do not have a plan, and inaction remains the status \nquo. Republicans are prepared to lead today and in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, when I talk to employers in my State \nabout what Washington could do to get people back to work, they \ninevitably point to the flood of excessive regulation as a major \nbarrier. Many of us have offered proposals to reform the regulatory \nprocess. Even the President's own Jobs Council has put forth ideas such \nas strengthening cost-benefit analysis. This just makes common sense. \nBut, regrettably, the Senate has failed to act. Meanwhile, the burden \nof Federal regulation grows ever larger. Right now, Federal agencies \nare at work on 2,700 new rules. These rules will go on top of a pile of \nregulations measuring millions of pages. If we want to put people back \nto work, we have to cut the redtape that is strangling our job \ncreators.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, if you look at any objective measure, \nwhether it is unemployment numbers, gas prices, middle-class income, \ncollege tuition, manufacturing production, home values, and the list \ngoes on and on, we are clearly not headed in the right direction. So \nwhat is the cause of this? The primary cause is lack of leadership \ncoming from the administration and from the leadership in the Senate. \nThe administration's policies have led to the worst recovery since \nWorld War II.\n  Over 23 million people are unemployed or underemployed. One of the \nmain reasons they cannot find work is the economic uncertainty \nWashington has created, stopping the hiring process. Our businesses are \nfrozen. As a former small business owner, I understand firsthand how \neconomic uncertainty hampers business growth. If you do not know what \nyour taxes are going to be, if you do not know what your energy costs \nare going to be, if you do not know what your health costs are going to \nbe, the last thing in the world you are going to do is hire a bunch of \npeople.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, the No. 1 job of this Congress domestically \nshould have been more private sector jobs. The President's long-held \nview of redistribution as a goal for the government is not going to \naccomplish that. What is going to accomplish that is more opportunity, \nmore independence, as my friend from Arkansas just said, more \ncertainty, more American energy.\n  These problems are big, but they are not necessarily that \ncomplicated. We just have to have the willpower to deal with them. This \nCongress has not done that. This Senate, more importantly, has not done \nthat. The House has passed bills. The House has passed a budget. The \nHouse has passed appropriations bills. The House has passed bills to \nget regulation under control. The Senate has not.\n  I hope when we get back here--we should stay and do those things, but \nwhen we get back, we need to be focused on the No. 1 job for the \ncountry today, which is more American jobs.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, President Obama, when you took office \nalmost 4 years ago, you promised to create jobs and reduce our deficit. \nYet 4 years later we have fewer Americans working than in the last 30 \nyears and we have historic debt and deficits. Now you say raising taxes \nwill solve our problems. But those who create jobs disagree.\n  Yesterday a businessman from South Carolina came to Washington to \npresent a very simple proposition. He had built his business from his \ngarage to 150 workers, putting every dime he could back into his \nbusiness. His plan was to add 25 workers next year if we keep taxes the \nsame but to do nothing if we follow your plan to raise taxes.\n  Mr. President, if you really want to create jobs, help our economy, \nand reduce our deficit, stop threatening to raise taxes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, we have just heard from a number of my \ncolleagues about issues with our jobs and the economy. We have heard \nabout the $16 trillion deficit. Unemployment has been over 8 percent \nfor over 43 months. These are unprecedented problems. We have again \nlearned a lesson we have learned time and time again in America: You \ncannot tax and regulate your way to prosperity.\n  Republicans in the Senate have provided an alternative. As this chart \nshows, this is the Republican Senate jobs plan. All 47 Republican \nSenators have supported it. We have introduced legislation that \nincorporates these\n\n[[Page S6478]]\n\nideas, and yet we have not gotten a hearing on the Senate floor.\n  It is pretty simple. We believe we ought to live within our means. \nFiscal discipline is part of getting the economy back on track. \nReforming the Tax Code to spur economic growth--we know we can create \nmillions of new jobs in this country by getting the Tax Code \nstraightened out. The economic situation will not be improved in this \ncountry until we deal with regulatory relief. My colleagues have talked \nabout that. Our ideas include having a more competitive force, changing \nthe worker retraining program in this country, improving education to \nhave a competitive workforce, increasing exports to create more jobs \nbut also to level the playing field, powering America's economy by \nusing the energy in the ground in America, and, finally, commonsense \napproaches to health care to get the costs down. These are the \nsolutions that Republicans have offered that have not gotten a fair \nhearing on this floor for us to begin to turn this economy around and \nget America back on track.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues in expressing my \ndisappointment in President Obama, in his failure to provide real \nleadership when our Nation needed it the most. While his failures can \nbe observed across the board, when it comes to taxes and the impending \nfiscal cliff, the President has put our entire economy in jeopardy in \norder to serve his own political interests.\n  At the end of this year, the bipartisan tax relief signed into law \nnot only by President Bush but by President Obama as well is set to \nexpire. Virtually every taxpayer in America will see their taxes go up \nif Congress and the President do not act to steer us away from this \nfiscal cliff. Objective analysts, including the CBO, have stated that \nif we were to let the tax relief expire under current economic \nconditions, it would likely lead to another recession. Yet, rather than \nworking with the Republicans to extend the tax relief and to aid our \nrecovery, the President has once again sought to divide the American \npeople by using the top marginal tax rate as political football.\n  In 2010 the President acknowledged that raising taxes in the midst of \na weak economic recovery was bad policy. That is why at that time he \nsigned into law the full extension of the 2001 and 2003 tax relief. \nAside from the fact that the economy is in worse shape now than it was \nthen, the only thing that has changed between 2010 and 2012 is that the \nPresident is now facing the voters, and that means appealing to his \nbase, which is committed to raising taxes. The President has put class \nwarfare and his own political future ahead of the immediate and long-\nterm interests of our economy. This is the high-water mark of failed \nleadership for this administration. Our country is at a moment of deep \neconomic uncertainty, and America's citizens and taxpayers deserve more \nthan the President's decision to prioritize electoral politics over \nsound fiscal policy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, as the Chairs of the debt commission--\nSimpson and Bowles--told the Budget Committee, this Nation has never \nfaced a more predictable financial crisis. I would say this Nation has \nnever faced a more difficult financial challenge. We have deep, \nsystemic demographic problems. They need to be addressed. Yet today \nmarks the 1,240th day since the Democratic leadership in the Senate \nadopted a budget. For 3 years, in a time of financial crisis, the \nSenate's Democratic majority has failed to comply with the U.S. Code \nthat requires us to bring up a budget and bring it to the floor of the \nU.S. Senate.\n  Politico observed on May 15:\n\n       Democratic leaders have defiantly refused to lay out their \n     own vision for how to deal with federal debt and spending.\n\n  I believe that is a colossal failure of leadership, a failure of \nfundamental responsibility, and puts them in a position, in my opinion, \nof being unable to ask to be returned to leadership in this Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as the distinguished ranking member of the \nBudget Committee pointed out, it has been more than 3 years since the \ndemocratically controlled Senate has passed a budget. That should be a \nnational scandal. During the same time, we have considered the \nPresident's proposed budgets, which have been voted down unanimously--\nthat is, Republicans and Democrats both realize that the President's \nproposed budgets are unserious attempts to solve some of our most \nserious challenges. The President could not get a single vote from his \nown political party for his own plan because it does not include \nserious efforts to preserve and protect Social Security and Medicare \nand put us on a sound fiscal path without job-killing tax increases.\n  When Republicans regain the majority in the Senate, we will pass a \nbudget, we will reduce the deficit, we will tackle our long-term debt, \nand we will help grow the American economy by getting our boot off the \nneck of the small businesses and the job creators in our country.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, this year we will spend over $3.5 \ntrillion, 60 percent of which is taxpayer money, 40 percent is \nborrowed. Over the next 10 years we will spend $45 trillion. We have \nnot had a budget in this body for 1,240 days. Not only is this \ndysfunctional--and America looks at us as a dysfunctional body--it is \nan embarrassment. The fact is that we are one fiscal reform package \naway from being able to focus on being a great nation again. Yet many \naround the world look at us as a nation in decline, which affects \neverything from people hiring and producing jobs in this country to the \nactivities we see overseas as they relate to our foreign relations.\n  What we need in this Nation is new leadership in November that has \nthe courage and the will to address the most major issue this Nation \nfaces, which is fiscal reform. With that, we will put this malaise in \nthe rearview mirror and again be able to focus on being a great nation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, for 3 consecutive fiscal years, the \nleadership in the Senate majority party has consciously decided not to \nbring a budget to the floor of the Senate. Do you know what the result \nhas been? We have spent $10.6 trillion and increased our debt over $4 \ntrillion, while the American people have cut their debt, cut their \nspending, and gotten their house in order during our worst recession \nsince the Great Depression.\n  It is time that the leadership of the Senate took a lesson from the \nAmerican people. Let's get back to the business of America. Let's get a \nbudget to the floor. Let's balance our budget.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, think about it--$5 trillion of new debt \nunder this President. So when he submits a budget plan, what happens to \nit? On the floor of this Senate, the President's budget plan did not \nget a single vote. No Republican, no Democrat, no Independent supported \nthe President. What happened on the House side? The same identical \nthing--no Republican, no Democrat, no Independent supported the \nPresident's plan. Many are working on this. Simpson-Bowles is a good \nexample. Many of my colleagues have been working to find a way forward \non our budget issues. And what happens on the floor of the Senate? No \nbudget. Four years, no budget.\n  When Republicans come to the majority, we will pass a budget, we will \nwork to balance our budget. That is where we are headed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Mr. President, in 1987, our total Federal \ndebt stood at $2.3 trillion. It took us 200 years as a Nation to incur \n$2.3 trillion in debt. Last year, with the debt ceiling debate, we \nincreased our debt limit by a little more than $2 trillion. We will \nblow through that limit in less than 2 years. The President of the \nUnited States has put forward four budgets. He has yet to submit any \nproposals to save either Social Security or Medicare. We are facing the \nmost predictable financial crisis in our Nation and our President \nrefuses to lead, this Senate refuses to lead. America hungers for \nleadership.\n\n[[Page S6479]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, it is bad enough that this Senate's \nLeadership, led by the Democrats, has not passed a budget in 3\\1/2\\ \nyears. What is even worse than that is the fact they have not offered a \nbudget in this Congress. They have not voted for or supported a single \nbudget in this Congress. We have had, of course, one budget voted on in \nthe Senate during this Congress, written by a Democrat. That was the \nPresident's plan, which received zero votes from his own party, zero \nvotes from the Republican Party last year and this year.\n  If we are able to come to the table, if we are to come to a \ncompromise, we have to have offers on both sides. We have to have a \nplan on both sides. So all the calls for civility, all the calls for a \ncompromise fall on deaf ears unless or until we have two willing \nparties at the table with proposals they are willing to offer.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the American people are asking two big \nquestions: Why has the Senate not acted to stop the $4\\1/2\\ trillion \ntax hike that will occur on January 12 unless we act; and, second, why \nhas the Senate not voted to replace the across-the-board defense cuts \nthat will devastate our national security? The unfortunate answer is \nbecause Senate Democrats and the Obama administration are too afraid to \ntackle, let alone vote on, the tough issues in an election year.\n  For Americans outside the Beltway, the consequences are very serious. \nThe Congressional Budget Office tells us that failure to avoid this \nfiscal cliff will shrink the economy next year and push unemployment \nabove 9 percent. That means 2 million jobs will be lost and we will be \nback in recession.\n  The House has acted. Election year or not, there is no excuse for the \nSenate to not follow the House's action, its lead, to avoid the job-\nkilling consequence of this fiscal cliff.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, it is astounding to me that after putting \nthe Nation through the self-inflicted travesty of last year's debt \nceiling debacle that we are facing another manufactured crisis this \nyear. With a fiscal cliff that never would have existed if the Senate \nhad remained in session, had fewer recesses, and maximized every \nlegislative day, based on the job we were elected to do, as I have \nargued virtually throughout this entire Congress.\n  According to a recent study, illustrated by this chart, deferring \nlast year's debt ceiling to the eleventh hour in August produced the \nhighest level of policy uncertainty of any event that occurred over the \nlast 20 years. That includes 9/11, the financial crisis, the fall of \nLehman, and the Iraq war.\n  We have now heard from CBO as well as Fed Chairman Bernanke. Both \nhave indicated we could trigger another recession next year if we fail \nto address the fiscal cliff. Yet here we are in the Senate in September \nscheduled to adjourn sometime this week for nearly 2 months after just \nreturning from a 5-week break. When I was running for reelection in \n2000 when the Republicans were in the majority, we had our last vote on \nNovember 1 and did not adjourn until November 3, a few days before the \nelection.\n  I call on the majority leader to have us remain in session to lay the \ngroundwork for a bipartisan solutions on these monumental issues. I \nhave urged this in a letter I sent last April, because it is absolutely \npivotal for this country. If we had not had the policy uncertainty of \n2006 through 2011, we would have 2\\1/2\\ million more jobs in America \ntoday.\n  The Senate has wasted years, 2 precious years in the life of America \nwith intransigence and inaction. America deserves better.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the problems in front of our country are \nnot unsolvable. As a matter of fact, every one of them is solvable. Our \ncountry has a history of doing hard things. What we lack is leadership \nto call us to do those hard things. We find ourselves at a point in \ntime when the greatest threat to our Nation is our debt and our \neconomy. We are risking our future, not only our future economically, \nbut our future of liberty. What we have had, I would remind my \ncolleagues, is a history in the Senate of doing hard things. Under the \nleadership of Senator Reid, the Senate has not attempted to do hard \nthings. What it has attempted to do is abandon the tasks that should be \nin front of us.\n  America deserves better. It deserves better leadership. It deserves \nleadership based on bringing this country together rather than dividing \nthis country. Not having a fiscal plan to solve the greatest issues in \nfront of our country is an absolute failure of leadership. Where is the \nSenate majority leader's, where is the President's plan to solve our \nproblems?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, the fact is our economy could be booming \nright now, should be booming right now. The history of this country is \nthat after a serious recession, the economy comes roaring back. That is \nexactly what should be happening right now. In fact, our economy should \nbe creating more jobs than there are people to fill them. But that is \nnot what is happening because of the failed leadership of the \nDemocratic majority in control of this body and the President of the \nUnited States.\n  Our economy cannot come back the way it should as long as the threat \nof a complete fiscal disaster looms over it. As long as everybody who \nmight even be contemplating launching a new business or expanding an \nexisting business knows this government is running trillion dollar \ndeficits as far as the eye can see with no willingness to address this, \nthen people will not make that investment. They will not expand their \nbusiness. They will not hire that next worker.\n\n  It is long past time that the Democratic leadership in this body \naccepts its responsibility to address this problem, pass a budget, get \nour fiscal house in order so this economy can grow again and Americans \ncan get back to work.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, 2 years ago we extended the 2010 tax rates. \nOver a year ago, we passed the Budget Control Act, which will trigger \nsequestration unless we pass a budget reduction plan. The point is we \nhave known about the fiscal cliff for a long time, and there has been \nno shortage of warnings about the dire economic consequences of doing \nnothing. But that is, in fact, what this body has done, nothing. So let \nme say this. There is a reason President Obama and my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle are targeting the Romney plan and the Ryan plan \nand the Republican plan. It is because they do not have a plan. They do \nnot even have an excuse for what this body has not done.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, we talk about plans and budgets. The \nreality is these bigger concepts that we discuss in our Nation's \ncapital have real consequences on the everyday lives of Americans. I \nspoke a few weeks ago to a Rotary club in Junction City, KS, and the \nlocal CPA was in the audience. We got to questions and answers, and he \nsaid: Senator, I have a question for you. This is a softball. What is \nthe estate tax rate going to be next year?\n  It is embarrassing not to be able to answer the simple questions \nabout what is going to happen in people's lives. People are having to \nmake decisions. That certified public accountant, that lawyer, that \nfinancial planner needs to be able to explain to that farmer in Kansas, \nto that rancher, to that small business owner what the Tax Code is \ngoing to look like.\n  We are facing a point in time in which we have no opportunities to \ntell someone what the Tax Code is going to be in 3 months. That is \nembarrassing. When people ask me what is necessary to get Washington, \nDC, to work together for us to solve the country's problems and move \nforward, the answer is we desperately need leadership, someone who \nshows us the way, encourages us to come together. It has been lacking. \nIt is embarrassing to me for the nearly 2 years I have been a Member of \nthe Senate not to see that leadership exhibited in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n[[Page S6480]]\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this week my home State of Mississippi \nreceived the sobering news that its economy had slipped back into \nrecession. Frankly, I'm concerned that my State might be a harbinger \nfor the rest of the country.\n  Despite national efforts to create new jobs and opportunities, our \neconomy is not getting significantly better. It is a problem in most \nStates. Unemployment has remained over 8 percent for more than 3 years \ndespite spending nearly a trillion dollars with the President's 2009 \nstimulus package.\n  Investments and small business growth have languished with a weak \neconomy and with tax policies and Federal regulations that seem to have \nmade matters worse. The course we are on is simply not good enough. We \nurge the Senate to make a strong stand. Let's get together. Let's push \na simple, easy-to-follow game plan for economic recovery.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, last night I came to the floor to object \nto a 1-hour debate on a measure that would have had Draconian effects \non our relations with countries in the Middle East. I am not opposed to \nthat measure or debating it. But I said I would think it would be \nimportant to have an amendment. The majority leader of the Senate said: \nThe day of amendments here is over. The majority leader of the Senate \nsaid: The day of amendments in this body is over.\n  Is there a more telling description of how this body has deteriorated \nand degenerated over the years?\n  I see my friend from Maine here. It is a far cry from the day we \nfirst came, when other majority leaders would allow debate, amendments, \nand carry out the functions the people ask us to, and that is with \nvigorous debate and discussion. The day of amendments in this body is \nover.\n  So as we debated a bill for veterans jobs programs, of which six are \nalready existing, the majority leader, for the first time in 50 years--\nfor the first time in 50 years in this body--we are not taking up the \nDefense authorization bill. We are in a war. We continue to have \nattacks on American citizens. America's national security is at risk. \nAnd we cannot even do enough for the men and women who are serving to \npass legislation that is so vital to their future and their ability to \ndefend this Nation? Shameful.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, our troops are fighting and being attacked \nin Afghanistan. Iran marches toward the capability of having a nuclear \nweapon. Terrorists have been murdering our diplomats. Innocent \ncivilians are being murdered in Syria by a despotic regime. The world \nis a dangerous place.\n  President Obama, stop leading from behind. President Obama, lead this \neffort. Right now our military faces devastating cuts about which your \nown Secretary of Defense has said we would be shooting ourselves in the \nhead, that we would be undermining our national security for \ngenerations. We have heard what is happening in the world. Lead. Be the \nCommander in Chief. Your leadership has been absent. You have been AWOL \non this critical issue and our troops and our Nation deserve better.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, lucky you to be presiding today.\n  We live in interesting times. You can receive a Nobel Peace Prize for \nnot being somebody else. Now, 4 years later almost after the Nobel \nPeace Prize has been awarded, where do we stand as a Nation? In case \nyou have not heard, bin Laden is dead. That is good. That is a great \naccomplishment. The President should take pride in that. We should all \ncelebrate the death of that evil man. But that is not foreign policy. \nIs anybody deterred from attacking America's interest in the Middle \nEast because bin Laden is dead? Is anybody saying: I better not go over \nthe wall of that Embassy in Egypt because we killed bin Laden? There is \nno coherent foreign policy at a time when we need one.\n\n  Four years later, after a charm offensive and an apology tour that \nhas not worked, our enemies are on steroids and our friends are unsure \nabout who we are. I will make a prediction: If this continues, the \nworld is going to devolve into chaos, because at a time when we need to \nbe certain, we are unsure. The Iranians are not taking anything we say \nseriously and the Russians and the Chinese have corrupted the U.N. So \nmuch for restarting.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to state the Senate's lack of \nleadership in addressing sequestration will have long-term effects on \nour Nation's robust intelligence community which had to be rebuilt \nafter 9/11. These budget cuts will make it very difficult for the \nintelligence community to keep Americans safe in future years.\n  America hungers for leadership and, unfortunately, the Senate lacks \nleadership from the majority on these issues that affect the safety of \nall Americans.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise to urge the Senate to fully \ninvestigate the circumstances regarding the attack upon our U.S. \nconsulate in Benghazi and the torture and killing of our Ambassador, \nthe deaths of three American patriots and the following attacks and \ndeaths involving marines in Afghanistan.\n  Americans are watching a conflagration of an estimated one-half \nmillion jihadists in over 30 countries, burning portraits of our \nPresident, American flags, and threatening attacks upon our consulates \nand embassies while shouting ``Death to America.'' No, Mr. President \nand my colleagues, the war against terrorism is not over. We find out \nnow, 10 days later, that al-Qaida was involved in the planned attack in \nBenghazi, and dangerous protests continue in Pakistan and throughout \nthe Muslim world.\n  This morning, the Commandant of our Marine Corps informed the Capitol \nHill marines there are 153 marine units at the ready to protect U.S. \nconsulates and embassies at the direction of the State Department. They \nshould be deployed, and he believes the current danger may well last \ndecades.\n  The sobering truth hurts. Was there actionable intelligence prior to \nthis attack? If there was not, why not, especially given recent \nintelligence reports, press reports and testimony by Matthew Olsen, \nNational Counterterrorism Center Director.\n  We are on a merry-go-round of excuses with this administration. There \nis no strong horse or weak horse. It is a merry-go-round that has to \nstop.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, today we have heard a lot about the \nfinancial condition of this country, and certainly that is foremost on \nthe minds of everyone. It is in the forefront. But in addition, there \nare national security issues in the world, and, unfortunately, they \nhave been pushed to the back page because of the condition of this \ncountry. But I wish to talk for a minute about the national security of \nthe United States. It is something we need to focus on no matter what \nis happening domestically.\n  I wish to focus on one small part of our national security. \nCertainly, we have issues going on in 30 different countries, and a \nnumber of those have our embassies under siege. We have had an \nambassador killed in recent weeks. This is a foreign policy that is in \nshambles. In the Middle East, it is a foreign policy of apology, it is \na foreign policy of appeasement, it is a foreign policy of dithering \nand looking the other way. This cannot go on.\n  Iran continues down a course which is going to force a confrontation \nwith Israel. Israel is the most reliable ally America has--certainly in \nthe region and perhaps in the world. We need a President who will stand \nand be clear and be firm about what is going to happen if Iran keeps \ngoing down the road it is going. That is not happening. It needs to \nhappen.\n  We need to change foreign policy from a policy of apology to a policy \nof leadership.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the events of this past week are a very \nclear and direct reminder to us of the need to choose to end our \nNation's dependence on imported oil. I will remind my colleagues this \nis our choice. It is\n\n[[Page S6481]]\n\nwithin our power to free ourselves from reliance on OPEC oil.\n  In these past few months, I have had an opportunity to visit our oil \nresources in the Gulf of Mexico, in North Dakota with Bakken shale, up \nin Alaska with the offshore as well as ANWR, and National Petroleum \nReserve out in the Marcellus shale. We have learned one thing for sure: \nThere is no scarcity of resources in this country. Technological \nbreakthroughs allow us to access these resources in a safe and reliable \nmanner.\n  This administration may talk a good game on oil production, but words \nand actions are entirely different. Our problems result from a federal \ngovernment that has actions and inactions that indefinitely delay, if \nnot prohibit, in many cases, access to our energy resources.\n  We are not running out of energy. What we are running out of are \nexcuses for continued reliance on OPEC.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, just yesterday, the White House went out \nand applauded the fact that Saudi Arabia is producing more oil. The \nPresident goes to Brazil and tells the President of Brazil we want to \nbe their No. 1 customer. This is at the same time this White House is \nblocking American energy projects and American energy jobs.\n  Held hostage by environmental extremists, this President continues to \nblock and cause people to lose jobs in the United States. Earlier this \nweek, the No. 3 coal producer in the country announced the layoff of \n1,200 workers. So not only are Americans who are working in American \nenergy losing their jobs, the President's policies continue to block \nnew jobs from being created. The President continues to stand in \nblockade of the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would bring back thousands \nof good-paying, family-wage jobs. Yet the President says no.\n  Harry Reid, the majority leader, stands at that desk and he blocks \nover a dozen bills passed by the House of Representatives that are good \nAmerican energy jobs that will put people back to work.\n  Republicans stand ready to produce more American energy, which will \nput people back to work, will stimulate our economy, and will help \nlower energy costs for American families. The American people deserve \nbetter than they are getting from the Democratic majority in the Senate \nand from the Democratic President of the United States.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, the price of gasoline at the pump is \ndouble what it was 4 years ago. The majority in this Senate has done \nnothing to address that problem, and this administration has done \nnothing to address that problem. In fact, we are moving in the wrong \ndirection.\n  The President's 5-year lease plan for offshore leases is half what \nthe previous plan was. Production in the gulf is down following his \nimposed moratorium and it is beginning to go down further. It has gone \nfrom 1.55 million barrels a day in 2010 to 1.32 in 2011, and it is \nstill headed down to 1.23 in this year. Two years before the \nmoratorium, the Energy Information Administration, where all these \nnumbers come from, said it would be 1.76 million barrels a day this \nyear.\n  We are the most energy rich country in the world, but this Senate \nmajority, this administration will not allow us to access our own \nresources for our own good.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, look at what is going on in the Middle \nEast. We have more than 20 countries demonstrating with anti-American \nprotests. Look at countries such as Egypt, Libya, Syria, and Yemen. \nLook at what is going on in Iraq. Yet at the same time we continue to \nimport our energy from the Middle East. So look at what is going on in \nthe Middle East at the same time we are dependent on them for our \nenergy, when we can produce that energy right here at home and work \nwith our closest friend and ally in the world--Canada--and when we can \ncreate American jobs.\n  This is an opportunity. We can produce more energy in this country. \nWe can create jobs. We can get this economy going, and we don't have to \nbe dependent on the Middle East. It just takes the will to move forward \nwith the energy plan we have proposed, but we need an administration \nthat will work with us to advance that energy plan.\n  Gas prices, which affect every working person, every consumer, every \nfamily, every business in this country, for the month of September are \nthe highest they have ever been for any month of September. What does \nthat do to American pocketbooks?\n  This is an opportunity. This is an opportunity we need to reach out \nand grab with both hands. The only question I can ask is: Why aren't \nwe? Why isn't this Senate acting on that right now and why isn't this \nadministration working with us? Why do veterans have to come back from \nthe Middle East and go to Canada to get a job to work on something such \nas the Keystone Pipeline? Because the administration is blocking it in \nthis country. The question I have is: Why?\n  We need to get going on this right now. The American people deserve \nthat.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, Americans have endured 4 years of the worst \nrecession in the last 70 years in this country. We have 23 million \nAmericans either unemployed or underemployed, and millions more have \nsimply given up finding a job. What is the President's response in the \nface of all this? Reject every plan presented by Republicans and, \ninstead, spend $5 trillion of borrowed money leading--so-called \nleading--our country into decline and ultimately into bankruptcy.\n  What is the Democratically led Senate's response? Avoid all efforts \nto formulate a plan to address this problem and to vote and debate on \nthat plan on one of the most critical--if not the most critical--issues \nfacing this country in its history. The American public is desperate \nfor new leadership, both from the White House and from the Senate--\nleadership that is absolutely necessary if we are to restore our Nation \nto growth and prosperity and get our people back to work.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, yesterday the New York Times said this: \n``The 112th Congress is set to enter the Congressional record books as \nthe least productive body in a generation.''\n  This is true, and the responsibility falls squarely at the feet of \nthe Democratic Senate leadership. The Senate has taken just 193 \nrecorded votes this year. The Senate has been more than 3 years since \npassing a budget. The majority leader has shut off the right to amend a \nrecord number of times. The majority leader has filled the amendment \ntree a record 66 times--more than his 6 predecessors in the Senate who \ndid it a total of 40 times. The majority leader has shut off the right \nto debate. He calls up a bill, he files cloture on it, and then he has \nthe audacity to call that a filibuster.\n  In short, the Democrats have failed to pass a budget, have failed to \ndo a single appropriations bill, and have failed to consider a Defense \nauthorization bill when we have troops in harm's way. America needs new \nleadership.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, a number of our colleagues have already \nspoken about the huge problems we face and the President's complete \nfailure to lead. We have a $16 trillion debt, millions out of work, the \nbiggest tax hike in history looming, and our military faces crippling \nacross-the-board cuts.\n  The Nation and the world need strong American leadership and robust \npolitical institutions to meet these challenges. But the President, \nwith a lot of help from the Democratically controlled Senate, has \ndeliberately chosen inaction. Why?\n  Over the past 2 years, the Democratic Senate has seen itself as an \nextension of the President's reelection campaign rather than a forum \nfor solving the Nation's problems. Everything it has and hasn't done is \nmeant to help the President, not the American people. So our problems \nhave only gotten worse. And the Senate has of course completely broken \ndown as an institution, as described by the Senator from Mississippi.\n\n[[Page S6482]]\n\n  Democrats haven't passed a budget in more than 3 years despite the \nfact that, as Senator Sessions pointed out, the law literally requires \nit. It doesn't say, Don't pass a budget if it is hard; don't pass a \nbudget if you have to negotiate with the House; don't pass a budget if \nyou have to vote. It says, Pass a budget.\n  We haven't passed a single appropriations bill, I say to my friend, \nthe senior Senator from Mississippi. Apparently all these people on the \nAppropriations Committee are completely irrelevant. Senator Alexander \npointed out they did their work but are never going to bring up a \nsingle bill.\n  By the way, it is not just the Appropriations Committee. All Senators \nare on committees. Does any Senator remember the last time they \nactually marked up a bill? Most committees are not marking up bills and \nnot offering amendments. So I guess the new rule is: No amendments in \ncommittee and no amendments on the floor.\n  There are a lot of Senators around here of both parties wondering \nwhat their job is. I was elected by the people of my State. What is \nthis job I have? I am on committees that don't do anything. Nobody \nvotes on amendments. All the legislation we have, if we have any, is \nwritten in the majority leader's office.\n  Senator Isakson or Senator Enzi pointed out that all we do is vote on \nbills that have fancy titles and a poison pill and, of course, only one \nvote. Because you know, if you get on the bill, there won't be any \namendments. So a lot of Members wonder why they are here. They fought \nhard for these jobs, defeated intelligent, well-funded opponents, got \nhere ready to go to work, and nothing happens. And it is not just 1 \nweek or a month or 6 months, but 2 years.\n  As Senator McCain pointed out, no Defense authorization bill. We had \nmanaged to get around to doing that, no matter what our differences \nwere, for half a century. This Democratically controlled Senate gives \ndo-nothing Congresses a bad name. It is a complete disgrace. Never \nbefore has a Senate and a President done less to address such great \nchallenges that we have.\n  I know I can speak for every single member of the Republican \nConference in the Senate. Regardless of our philosophical differences \nwith our friends on the other side, we take our jobs seriously. We \nthink the people who sent us here expected us to function, and we \nintend to do so.\n  So if the American people decide they want to make a change, the \ncommitment I make to them is the Republican Conference is going to pass \na budget. It may be hard; we may have to twist a few arms; there may be \nsome people who don't want to do it. We may have to do it on a partisan \nbasis if our friends on the other side don't want to join with us. But \nthe law doesn't say, Don't do it if it is hard. It says, Do it.\n  The Appropriations Committee deals with the discretionary budget of \nthe U.S. Government. It ought to be allowed to do its job. Not \neverybody is going to vote for every bill, but we are going to \nfunction.\n  We owe it to the American people to do, at the very least, the basic \nwork of government. Of course, we have problems beyond the basic work \nof government. Certainly we were going to have differences after the \n2010 election--which could best be described as a national restraining \norder.\n  The American people took a look at what this government did under \nthis President's leadership over the first 2 years, and they said, We \nhave had enough of that. They flipped the House of Representatives and \nmade us a more robust minority in the Senate. They understood we \nweren't going to do any more of what we did the first 2 years. They \nwere not interested in any more of that. But that is not an excuse for \nnot doing anything. They said, We don't want to do any more of all this \nnew stuff that was done in 2009 and 2010, the massive spending and debt \nand the takeover of health care and the nationalization of the student \nloan bills.\n  But they didn't send us here to do nothing. They assumed we would at \nleast do the things we ought to be able to agree on--the basic work of \ngovernment. It is embarrassing.\n  For the sake of this institution and for the sake of our country, we \nneed to straighten out this place. We need an attitude change. This is \nnot about the rules. The rules have remained largely the same over the \nyears. This is about us. And this problem can be fixed. All we have to \ndo is decide to operate differently. No matter who is up or who is \ndown, there are basic things this institution owes the American people; \nthat is, to get the basic work of government done.\n  So the pledge we make to the American people, if they decide they \nwant to try new leadership in the Senate, is we will do these things \neven if they are hard.\n  Beyond the basics, let me say to our friends on the other side, we \nhave big problems we are never going to be able to solve without some \nbipartisan commitment to do it. We are drowning in a sea of debt. We \nknow we cannot save this country unless we make the entitlement \nprograms fit the demographics of our country.\n  We have a lot of other problems. We have taxes, we have sequester. \nBut the way I tend to think of that is those are the chairs on the \nTitanic. You can rearrange the chairs--figure out the tax problems, \nfigure out the sequester problems--but the ship is still going down \nunless we make our entitlement programs meet and fit the demographics \nof our country. We probably won't be able to do that one party only. It \nis time for some statesmen to show up.\n  We have had an election every 2 years since 1788, right on schedule. \nAt any point in American history, people could have said, Oh, we can't \ndo that; there is an election coming up. There is always an election \ncoming up in America. That is what we do. The fact that we have an \nelection coming up is not an excuse for not tackling the tough \nproblems.\n  So no matter what the American people decide this November, no matter \nwhat they decide, the problems are there. And our commitment to the \nAmerican people is, if we are in the majority, we will do the basic \nwork of government; and our hand will be out to our colleagues on the \nother side and whoever the President of the United States is.\n  It is time to tackle the biggest problems in the country, the most \npredictable crisis in American history.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, has the Republicans' time expired?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republicans have 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6482-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6482-S6488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SELF-CREATED RESULTS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I haven't been able to watch all the \nspeeches by my friends on the other side of the aisle, but I have \nwatched enough to understand what is going on. This has been a \nremarkable show of hubris or arrogance from the Republican side of the \naisle.\n  One after another, the Republicans have stood to complain about how \nthe Senate hasn't gotten a lot done. The Presiding Officer has been one \nof the leaders in having a more effective Senate, because my friend, \nthe Presiding Officer, has watched what the Republicans have done. We \nare going to do something about it. The Presiding Officer knows that, I \nknow that.\n  What they have done is the very definition of chutzpah. The nerve. \nWhat nerve. They are complaining about a result that they themselves \ncreated. They have created the fact that we haven't gotten anything \ndone. They are good at it. A bill that would allow veterans to get \njobs, they stopped it on a technicality. They have conducted filibuster \nafter filibuster, blocking one bill after another, and then they \ncomplain the Senate can't pass anything when they are the ones holding \nthings up. The record is pretty detailed and deep, and I am not going \nto cover it all today because, really, it is significant.\n  I said here yesterday, I have been the leader for 6 years. I may be \noff 1 or 2, but I have had to file motions to overcome 382 filibusters \nin 6 years. I know the Senate has changed a little bit since Lyndon \nJohnson was the majority leader, but during the 6 years he was the \nmajority leader, he had to file cloture once. To think that they are \nhere complaining we are not getting\n\n[[Page S6483]]\n\nanything done when they are the ones who caused it? And we start from \nthis point.\n  I have to say, I appreciate the Republican leader being so candid and \nhonest with the American people when he stood at the beginning of this \nCongress and said his No. 1 goal was to stop President Obama from being \nreelected. That is what he said. And they have legislated accordingly, \nstopping us from doing the most important things for this country. \nMeasures to create jobs, they have stopped. Measures to stop jobs from \nbeing lost, they have stopped. They have done it so many times.\n  How about this: We have lost approximately 1 million teachers, \nfirefighters, and police officers because of Republicans stopping us \nfrom get things done, really hurting State and local government. So we \nover here thought it would be a good idea that we stop these \nsignificant layoffs of teachers, firefighters, and police officers. We \nwant to make sure it is paid for and we agree it should be paid for. So \nwe said, Okay, no more layoffs of teachers, firefighters, and police \nofficers, and we are going to pay for it. How are we going to pay for \nit? Anyone making more than $1 million a year would have to pay a \nsurtax of three-tenths of 1 percent. Every Republican voted against \nthat.\n  The Veterans Jobs bill I just talked about. The cyber security bill. \nThe Pentagon has said the most important issue facing this country is \ncyber security. The National Security Agency: The most issue facing \nthis country? Cyber security. We know, they know, the Republicans know, \nbecause they were down at the same demonstration I had of our \nintelligence agency showing what would happen if a cyber security \nattack took place in the Northeast just dealing with the power grid. We \nknow it can happen.\n  I have heard Senator Feinstein, the chairman of our Intelligence \nCommittee, say several times it is not a question of if, it is a \nquestion of when. The Republicans blocked a cyber security bill, \nstopped it.\n  They have conducted filibuster after filibuster, blocking one bill \nafter another. They blocked a bill to stop outsourcing jobs--more than \nonce.\n  On all these TV ads that you see, we thought it would be kind of a \ngood idea that the American people knew who was paying for these ads. \nBut, no, twice they said let's keep them secret--Crossroads USA or \nwhatever name they have there, all these names that sound so good. But \nI think we would be better served if people knew the ads were being \npaid by the Koch brothers or Sheldon Adelson from Las Vegas or Simmons \nfrom Texas who is boasting about giving $34 million to defeat President \nObama. And that is what the Republican leader wants.\n  On the passage of several small business jobs bills, one July 12, \njust a month or two ago; the motion to proceed to paycheck fairness, \nviolence against women--they stopped us from going to conference on \nthat. On April 16 they blocked a motion to proceed to a bill to reduce \nthe deficit by imposing a minimum tax rate on high-income taxpayers, \nthe Buffett rule, Warren Buffett. He wants to make sure he pays a tax \nrate comparable to his secretary's. That is what we wanted. They \ndefeated that.\n  They blocked many bills dealing with unnecessary tax subsidies for \nthese large oil companies. They have held up hundreds of measures out \nof the Energy Committee--hundreds. It used to be we would pass those \njust matter-of-factly.\n  Senator Stabenow had an amendment to decrease taxes on American \nbusinesses. She wanted to do that by extending expiring energy tax \ncredits for energy that has created hundreds of jobs in America.\n  They blocked the nomination for weeks and weeks of Richard Cordray to \nbe the Director of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. They \nblocked judge after judge. They blocked a motion to proceed to a bill \nto put workers back on the job while rebuilding and modernizing \nAmerican infrastructure. It creates jobs.\n  They blocked motions to proceed to a bill to keep teachers and first \nresponders--in addition to the one I just talked about--and other ones. \nThey blocked a bill to reauthorize the Economic Development \nAdministration. This has been something we have done for 25, 30 years. \nThey blocked it.\n  We wanted to reduce the deficit by doing something about these \noutlandish subsidies we give Big Oil--blocked it. We were trying to do \na bill to create jobs. We spent weeks because they wanted to dictate \nwhat women could do dealing with contraception.\n  Then they have this little--this little deal with the House \nRepublicans. If we work and are able once in a while to get something \ndone over here, such as a postal bill to save our postal system, then \nthe Republicans block it in the House. The farm bill--reduces the debt \nby $23 billion--they have this deal with the House and now they blocked \nthat. China currency? The same thing; they blocked it over in the \nHouse.\n  The record is very clear. The party of trying to defeat President \nObama has done everything they can to make the economy look as bad as \nit can because they think if the economy is really bad, it is going to \nhelp them defeat President Obama.\n  The middle class--we know how they feel about the middle class. That \nwas exemplified by statements that came out in the last few days by the \nPresidential nominee.\n  This morning, as I said, I wasn't able to listen to everything, but I \nlistened to enough. One party stands for obstruction and the rich. The \nbig lie--listen to this: How many times did we have the Republicans \ncome to this floor and say: They have not passed a budget?\n  I have served in this Congress for 30 years, and I have admired two \npeople very much for their knowledge of certain things. One person I \nhave admired dealing with the finances of this country more than anyone \nelse is someone with whom I came to the Senate 26 years ago, Kent \nConrad. Kent Conrad has come here and time and time again said: Yes, we \ndid not pass a budget resolution because we did not need to. We passed \na law. That is why the CR is going forward. We passed a law that set \nnumbers for us.\n  It is a big lie for them to come here and say we have not passed a \nbudget. It is a lie. It is untruthful.\n  My friend with whom we have served in Congress, we came the same day, \nthe senior Senator from Arizona, I have said before, and I will say it \nagain: I admire him. I admire his service to our country. But for him \nto come and say that the Senate is not working well because of the \nDemocrats, that is one of the big lies.\n  We have tried to legislate. They are holding up virtually everything \nwe try to do, including the Defense authorization bill. I have been \nwaiting for months for them to come to me with an agreement. This is \npart of the big game they are playing to try to make us look bad when \nthey are the cause of it. They are the reason we have not done this \nlegislation. We can't. We have spent weeks on matters that we would \nhave done before in a matter of an hour or 20 minutes.\n  Republicans are complaining about a result that they themselves \ncaused. The Defense authorization bill--we are going to come back after \nthe election, and we will get that done with their help.\n  Here is the issue with Republicans, here is why suddenly they are all \nupset. They have been upset for some time, but really this week has \nbeen something that would upset nearly everyone because--we thought the \nOlympics were over, but yesterday we saw it in full go.\n  We had Republicans running to break marathon records, sprint records \nto get away from their Presidential nominee because it makes it a \nlittle hard for them to have somebody running for President \nrepresenting their party who says: I only have to worry about half the \npeople in this country.\n  We are going to continue to work to the best we can to move forward \nwith the legislation we believe is important. We are going to come back \nafter the election, during the lameduck. Hopefully, they will decide at \nthat time maybe they have something better to do than try to make the \nPresident of the United States look bad.\n  We are a very fortunate country. We have a two-party system that is \nthe envy of the rest of the world. These parliamentary governments, \nthey work for months and weeks and sometimes longer than that to try to \nform a government. We don't have to do that. We are a government of \nlaws, and we have a system that works pretty well.\n\n[[Page S6484]]\n\n  But we know, based on some academic work that has been done--it is \nnot just me talking. We have two of the foremost experts who have \nwatched this country for more than 40 years--Thomas Mann from the \nBrookings Institute and Norm Ornstein from the conservative Enterprise \nInstitute--who have said the problem with the government today is the \nRepublicans. They said they have been here for 40 years and have never \nseen anything like it. I haven't seen anything like it, and I have been \nhere 30 years.\n\n  We used to work together. When I came to the Senate we had Republican \nSenators and Democratic Senators. We joined hands and we got things \ndone. But now, because they are being led by someone who believes the \nmost important thing to do is to defeat Obama, we are getting nothing \ndone and they are following him like lemmings off the cliff.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, one of the greatest orators in the history \nof English-speaking people was Winston Churchill. I can't tell you how \nmany times I have read and reread his speeches and heard his great \nefforts to summon the courage of the British people during World War \nII.\n  In one respect the speech earlier this morning by Senator McConnell \nwas Churchillian, in the tradition of Winston Churchill, because they \nonce said to Winston Churchill: What do you think history will have to \nsay about you? He said:\n\n       I'm not worried about what history has to say about me \n     because I'm going to write the history.\n\n  This morning Senator McConnell decided to write the history of the \nSenate session. Unfortunately, his version was a little bit different \nthan the memory of most of us in terms of what has actually happened.\n  This we do remember: In the beginning of the Obama Presidency, a \nshort time after the President had been sworn in and asked to try to \ntake this failing economy and put it back on its feet, when we were \nlosing 750,000 jobs a month, when businesses were failing, when \nAmerican families were losing one-third of the value of their savings, \nwhen the stock market was plummeting, when we ran the risk of a global \nfiscal crisis, when we were sending $800 billion to the biggest banks \nin America to save them from their own greed and stupidity--at that \ntime the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, said: ``My highest \npriority is to make sure that Barack Obama is a one-term President.'' \nHis highest priority.\n  That is a fact. That is on the record. That is on tape if you want to \nsee it. And he lived up to that in terms of his own ambition as the \nRepublican leader.\n  When the President came up with a stimulus bill to turn this economy \naround, we had three Republicans who would join us, three of them. What \nhappened to those three Republicans?\n  One of them, Senator Specter of Pennsylvania, was then threatened \nwith defeat in the Republican primary for joining in a bipartisan \neffort to save the economy. He switched parties, came over to the \nDemocratic side, and said: It isn't the Republican Party I remember. \nAnother, Senator Snowe of Maine, announced her retirement a few months \nback and said: I can't take the partisanship and division. The third, \nSenator Collins, still survives. Those three were the only three who \nwould stand up with the President to try to get this economy back on \ntrack.\n  When it came to health care reform, after months of effort by Senator \nBaucus to bring in Republicans to craft the bill, Senator Grassley, who \nwas leading the effort on the Republican side, went back to Iowa in \nAugust, had a town meeting and said: I am finished. No more bipartisan \nnegotiation on health care reform. And they would not give us a single \nvote, not one vote to pass health care reform.\n  The same thing was true when it came to Wall Street reform to put in \noversight to avoid another fiscal crisis generated by the perfidy of \ngreed on Wall Street.\n  Time and time again the Republicans refused to stand with us. To my \nleft is Senator Conrad of North Dakota. He has been our chairman of the \nBudget Committee. He put in a sincere, bipartisan, good-faith effort to \ndeal with the deficit--with Senator Judd Gregg, a Republican of New \nHampshire, a man who commanded respect on his side of the aisle, as \nSenator Conrad does as well. They came up with a notion. Here is what \nit was.\n  We would create a commission that would investigate the deficit \ncrisis, and if 14 of the 18 members of the commission voted to go \nforward it would come immediately to the floor for a vote.\n  We had a lot of Senators who were cosponsoring that. Democrats and \nRepublicans finally said that will break the logjam. Then we called it \non the floor. I ask Senator Conrad, does my memory serve me correctly \nthat the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, who was a cosponsor of \nthis deficit commission, along with six other Republican Senators, \nchanged their votes on the floor and defeated the very bill they had \ncosponsored to deal with our Nation's deficit?\n  The Senator didn't hear that this morning, did he? All the speeches \nfrom the other side about dealing with the deficit. Perhaps Senator \nMcConnell and those six other Senators, those remaining, would like to \nexplain why they reversed course and said no; they didn't want to be \npart of the effort. But it happened. It happened for certain.\n  As Senator Reid came to the Senate floor and explained, they have \nbroken all records in the Senate for filibusters. Boy, I tell you what: \nIf you have a cable TV at home and you have C-SPAN on it and you turn \non the Senate, I know a lot of people across America are calling into \nthe cable channel providers and asking for a refund. Why in the world \ndo we have this channel where nothing happens except an occasional \nmention of a Senator's name during a quorum call? Does anyone know why? \nThere were 382 filibusters on the Republican side; 382 delays in the \nSenate. What sort of issues are they filibustering? I just saw one this \nweek. It was a veterans jobs bill. A veterans jobs bill was the subject \nof a 2-week filibuster. It was a bill which should have passed by voice \nvote. If every Senator who went back home for a Fourth of July parade, \ngrabbed the flag and walked down the middle of the street and said how \nmuch they loved the veterans would have voted for it, we would have \npassed it. Instead, they filibustered it. It was one of 382 \nfilibusters.\n\n  I am glad Senator Conrad is here to explain this whole budget \nresolution issue. He can do it better than anyone. I will tell the \nSenator I took a look this morning at the 30 Senators on the Republican \nside who got up to speak and about 10 of them talked about the fact \nthat there was no budget, that we didn't have a budget this year, and \nwe don't have a budget next year. I then looked at the votes on the \nBudget Control Act. Those same 10 Senators voted for the Budget Control \nAct, a law which controls the budget for 2 years.\n  I am calling for an official investigation by the attending physician \nto see if there is something in the coffee urn in the Republican \ncloakroom causing amnesia so that these Senators would come to the \nfloor and forget they voted for the Budget Control Act and make \nspeeches like they didn't or never heard of it.\n  Let me say something about entitlements. Senator McConnell spoke to \nthe issue of entitlements. He is right; it is an important part of what \nwe need to do to right this ship to deal with our deficit. It would \nhave been part of the conversation for the Conrad-Gregg commission, \nwhich seven Republican Senators torpedoed, including the Republican \nmajority leader. We can go through the bills, as the majority leader \nhas, and talk about the efforts we have made.\n  We have passed bills on a bipartisan basis. We passed a postal reform \nbill to ensure that the best postal service in the world survives. We \npassed it with a bipartisan vote--dead in the House.\n  We passed a transportation bill. Senator Boxer and Inhofe put it \ntogether. It was a strong bipartisan vote to build the infrastructure \nof America. It passed in the Senate. It died in the House.\n  We passed a farm bill with Senator Stabenow of Michigan and Senator \nRoberts of Kansas. It was a bipartisan farm bill that gave us a good \narchitecture for the future of farm programs and reduced the deficit by \n$23 billion. We passed it on a bipartisan basis in the Senate. It died \nin the House of Representatives. The tea party faction in the House \nwill not allow it to go forward.\n\n[[Page S6485]]\n\n  Senator Reid also made the point earlier. What was the first \nRepublican amendment on the Transportation bill? Think about this for a \nsecond. It was the first Republican amendment on the Transportation \nbill. They wouldn't let us move forward to that bill unless we \nconsidered an amendment which would reduce the opportunity for women \nacross America to have access to family planning. That was on the \nTransportation bill. Now they are arguing that we are finding ways to \nslow down the Senate? The Blunt amendment was defeated, but it is an \nindication of the political gamesmanship that has gone on at the \nexpense of the important bills such as the Transportation bill.\n  The last point I wish to make is this: We know that if we are going \nto thrive in this country, the middle-class working families in this \ncountry need a chance.\n  The Senators on this side of the aisle, as well as President Obama, \nwant to give working and middle-income families a tax break. We passed \na bill so they will have a tax reduction to help them as they struggle \nfrom paycheck to paycheck. We sent it over to the House of \nRepresentatives, where it is never going to be taken up for a vote. \nThat is the sad reality.\n  So as the Republicans came to the floor this morning and gave us this \ngrand vision of when they were in control, they tried to rewrite \nhistory. Maybe Churchill is capable of doing that, but I would say the \nRepublican Senators failed to meet that challenge this morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. First, I thank my colleagues, Senator Reid, our leader, \nand Senator Durbin for their kind words. I very much appreciate those \nkind words. I also must say I am a little taken aback by what I heard \nearlier on the floor from some of my Republican colleagues because it \ntruly does represent an attempt to rewrite history, the history I have \nlived in my 26 years in the Senate.\n  I announced a little more than a year and a half ago that I would not \nseek reelection, so I don't have a political ox to gore. But I am here \nto report what I have seen after 26 years of service. Let me start by \nsaying our Republican colleagues at the leadership level decided early \non that their strategy to be successful was to stop things from passing \nin the Senate. It is very clear that has been their strategy. That is \nwhy we have seen more than 380 filibusters in this body, which is \ncompletely unprecedented in the history of the Senate.\n  The Republican leader made it very clear years ago that his highest \npriority was to defeat for reelection President Obama. He did not say \nhis top priority was to solve the problems of the country. He did not \nsay his top priority was to get our economy back on track. He did not \nsay his top priority was to address the deficits and debt of the \nNation. He did not say his top priority was to improve the security \nposition of the United States. He said his top priority was to defeat \nPresident Obama. Shame on him. That should never be the top priority of \na leader in this body, Republican or Democratic. The top priority ought \nto be to help solve the problems the country confronts.\n  I am a little cranky because many of my colleagues know my wife and I \nhave a little dog named Dakota that is suffering from cancer. Last \nnight we were up from 12:30 until 5:30 as he was bleeding internally. \nSo I must say I am a little cranky after having been up most of the \nnight, and I got a lot crankier when I heard colleagues say things they \nknow are not true.\n\n  When they say there is no budget for the United States, they know \nthat is not true. How do I know it is not true, and that there is a \nbudget? Because I remember what we voted on, and it is in writing. It \nis a law. It is called the Budget Control Act. The Budget Control Act \npassed last year and contained the budget for 2012 and 2013. Some say \nthat is not a budget. Let's look to the language of the law itself and \nsee what it says.\n  Here is what it says: For the purpose of enforcing the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, including section 300 of that Act, and enforcing \nbudgetary points of order in prior concurrent resolutions on the \nbudget, the allocations, aggregates, and spending levels set shall \napply in the Senate in the same manner as for a concurrent resolution \non the budget.\n  What they are trying to do is mislead the American people by saying \nwe have not passed a budget resolution. What they failed to tell people \nis that instead of a budget resolution, we passed a budget law. What is \nthe difference? A resolution is purely a congressional document. It \nnever goes to the President for his signature. So instead of a \nresolution, we passed a budget law called the Budget Control Act. It \nset out spending limits not just for 2012 and 2013, it actually set out \non the discretionary side of the budget limits for 10 years.\n  In fact, the Budget Control Act, in many ways, is more extensive than \nany budget resolution could provide. It has the force of law, unlike \nthe budget resolution that is not signed by the President. It set \ndiscretionary caps on spending for 10 years instead of the 1 year \nnormally set in a budget resolution. It provided enforcement \nmechanisms, including a 2-year provision allowing budget points of \norder to be enforced. It created a reconciliation-like supercommittee \nprocess to address entitlement and tax reforms. It said if the special \ncommittee could not agree on reforming the entitlement programs and the \ntax system of the United States, there would be an additional $1.2 \ntrillion in spending cuts.\n  Let's add it up. The Budget Control Act first cut $900 billion from \nthe discretionary accounts over 10 years. Then it said if the \nsupercommittee didn't reform the tax system and entitlement system of \nthe country, there would be another $1.2 trillion cut from the \ndiscretionary accounts over the next 10 years. That is a total of $2.1 \ntrillion in spending cuts over the next 10 years. That is the biggest \npackage of spending cuts in the history of the United States. That is a \nfact.\n  The Budget Control Act set the spending limits for 2012 and 2013 and \nfurther set limits for 8 years beyond that. So when they say there is \nno budget resolution, what they fail to tell people is there is a \nbudget law.\n  It is interesting if we compare and contrast what their side \npresented as their priorities in a budget because Mr. Ryan, their \ncandidate for Vice President, came before the House of Representatives \nand laid out his budget blueprint. What does that do? First of all, it \nextends all the Bush-era tax cuts.\n  Think about this. Here we have a circumstance in which the revenue of \nour country is at or near a 60-year low. The first thing the Ryan \nbudget does is extend all the Bush-era tax cuts, even those for the \nvery highest income. Then it says that is not enough for the wealthiest \namong us. So the Ryan budget, after extending all the Bush era-tax \ncuts, goes and provides another $1 trillion of tax cuts for the \nwealthiest among us.\n  I have nothing against wealthy people. I hope all Americans have the \nopportunity to become wealthy; that would be my fondest hope. That was \nwhy I was drawn to public service. What could I do that would \nstrengthen the economy of the United States? It has always been my top \npriority. It is what I truly believe is essential to our democracy. But \nin a circumstance in which we are borrowing 40 cents of every $1 we \nspend, and then to say the answer is more and more tax cuts for the \nvery wealthiest among us and try to pay for it by shredding the social \nsafety net that is critically important to those who are the least \nfortunate among us, frankly, I think that fails the moral test. I think \nthat fails any moral test of government.\n  The Ryan budget, which our colleagues have endorsed, would give, on \naverage, those earning over $1 million a year an additional tax \nreduction of $265,000 a year.\n  I know if I were listening to this I would say, How can it be that \nsomeone earning over $1 million can get a $265,000 tax cut, because \nthat is about all they would pay in taxes. Remember, we are talking \nabout the average for those earning over $1 million a year, so we are \ntalking about not just people who earn $1 million a year but people who \nearn hundreds of millions of dollars a year. And the average tax cut \nprovided in the Ryan budget for those folks is another $265,000 a year.\n  What does Ryan do in order to offset that massive additional tax cut \nfor the\n\n[[Page S6486]]\n\nvery wealthiest among us? Well, here is an interesting quote from a \nformer top economic adviser to Ronald Reagan, a man named Bruce \nBartlett, who was a top economic adviser to Ronald Reagan. Here is what \nhe said about the Ryan budget that our colleagues here have endorsed:\n\n       Distributionally, the Ryan plan is a monstrosity. The rich \n     would receive huge tax cuts while the social safety net would \n     be shredded to pay for them. Even as an opening bid to begin \n     budget negotiations with the Democrats, the Ryan plan cannot \n     be taken seriously. It is less of a wish list than a fairy \n     tale utterly disconnected from the real world, backed up by \n     make-believe numbers and unreasonable assumptions. Ryan's \n     plan isn't even an act of courage; it's just pandering to the \n     Tea Party. A real act of courage would have been for him to \n     admit, as all serious budget analysts know, that revenues \n     will have to rise well above 19 percent of GDP to stabilize \n     the debt.\n\n  Those are not my words. Those are the words of a top economic adviser \nto President Ronald Reagan.\n  The Ryan plan is a monstrosity.\n  If anybody seriously studies the Ryan budget they would have to \nconclude that Mr. Bartlett is correct, because Mr. Ryan cuts taxes in a \nvery dramatic way for the richest among us. Let me be clear. The first \nthing he does is extend all the Bush-era tax cuts. Then, on top of \nthat, he cuts the top rate from 35 percent to 25 percent. That provides \nover $1 trillion of additional tax cuts for the wealthiest among us. \nAnd they refuse to do anything to close the tax loopholes that are \nallowing certain wealthy people to avoid paying taxes in this country \nentirely.\n  I have shown on the floor of the Senate many times a picture of a \nfive-story building in the Cayman Islands called the Ugland House. The \nUgland House claims to be the home of 18,000 companies. A little five-\nstory building in the Cayman Islands claims to be the home of 18,000 \ncompanies. I say that is the most efficient building in the world. Can \nyou imagine 18,000 companies operating out of a little five-story \nbuilding down in the Cayman Islands?\n  All those companies claim they are doing business out of that little \nbuilding for a reason. They claim they are doing business out of that \nlittle building in the Cayman Islands because they don't want to pay \ntaxes in the United States. So here is what they do, and it is very \nclever. Through paper manipulations, they show the profits of certain \nsubsidiaries of their companies in the Cayman Islands rather than in \nthe places where they actually earned the profits. Why would they do \nthat? Because the Cayman Islands doesn't have a corporate income tax. \nSo by showing their profits in the Cayman Islands, even though in truth \nthey were never earned in the Cayman Islands--through accounting \ngimmicks they show their profits in the Cayman Islands and they aren't \ntaxed. They avoid paying here what they legitimately owe here. What \ndoes that mean? That means all the rest of us get stuck paying for \nourselves and them.\n  I said earlier the Ryan budget fails the moral test, and it is not \njust my judgment that it fails the moral test. How can one justify \ncutting taxes dramatically for the wealthiest among us and then turn \naround and shred Medicare, which is what the Ryan budget did? The Ryan \nbudget he initially proposed changed Medicare's finances over time so \nthat instead of Medicare paying 75 percent of health care costs for \nseniors who are eligible, the Ryan budget, over time, would switch that \nso Medicare would pay 32 percent. To be clear, under the Ryan plan, we \nwould wind up with a situation in which the majority of one's health \ncare costs, if one is eligible for Medicare, would be paid by that \nperson, not by Medicare. That is to make up for the massive tax cuts he \ngives the wealthiest among us.\n  Here is what the Catholic bishops said. The Catholic bishops say the \nRyan budget fails the moral test. I agree with the Catholic bishops. \nThis is what they said in the Washington Post in 2012:\n\n       A week after House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan said \n     that his Catholic faith inspired the Republicans' cost-\n     cutting budget plan, the Nation's Catholic bishops reiterated \n     their demand that the Federal budget protect the poor and \n     said the GOP measure fails to meet these moral criteria.\n\n  In any moral test that I know of in any religion, we don't take from \nthose who have the least to give it to those who have the most. I don't \nknow of any religion that practices that as an article of faith--that \nwe take from those who have the least to give to those who have the \nmost.\n  Anybody who knows me knows I am pretty conservative. I come from a \nbusiness family. I have a master's in business administration. \nThroughout my career, I have been someone who has been judged as \nfiscally conservative, someone who believes deeply in balancing \nbudgets. I was the grandfather of the Bowles-Simpson Commission; served \non it proudly. I was one of the 11 votes for its product--5 Democrats, \n5 Republicans, 1 independent.\n  By the way, when our colleagues said this morning we haven't worked \nin a bipartisan way--well, I have spent 5 years working in a bipartisan \nway trying to get our debts and deficit under control. Senator Gregg, \nthe ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, and I proposed the \nBowles-Simpson Commission. We served on it. We voted for it. I \nsubsequently served in the group of six, three Democrats, three \nRepublicans, who were given the assignment by our colleagues to come up \nwith a plan to reduce the deficit. We worked for a year and a half to \ntry to find a bipartisan solution. We have had the Biden group. We have \nhad the supercommittee, all bipartisan efforts that have gone on for \nyears to try to produce an agreement. So my friends saying there hasn't \nbeen an effort, that is not true.\n  What is true is when our friends on the other side were in charge, \nthey brought this economy to the brink of financial collapse. That is \nthe truth. Anybody who doubts it can simply go back to the end of the \nBush administration and see where the country was. The stock market was \ncollapsing. The housing market was collapsing. The financial system was \ncollapsing. That is what President Obama inherited. He did not create \nthose crises; he inherited them. At the time President Obama came into \noffice, the economy was shrinking at a rate of almost 9 percent a year. \nWe were losing 800,000 jobs a month. Now the economy is growing at a \nrate of about 2 percent a year, and we are gaining about 200,000 jobs a \nmonth. That is a dramatic turnaround.\n  So when they ask the question: Are we better off now than 4 years \nago? Undeniably, we are better off. Undeniably, we are better off. We \nhave gone from an economy shrinking at a rate of more than 8 percent to \none growing at a rate of 2 percent. We have moved from a time when we \nwere losing 800,000 jobs a month to a time when we are gaining about \n200,000 jobs a month. We have gone from a circumstance in which the \nstock market was plunging to a circumstance in which the stock market \nhas about doubled during the time of President Barack Obama. President \nObama inherited two wars, a war on terror, a financial system that was \ncollapsing, a financial system that had seen, under the previous \nPresident, the debt double; foreign holdings of U.S. debt were \ntripling; and this President has ended the slide and has us going back \nin the right direction, and with precious little help from the other \nside.\n\n  I ask the American people before they cast their votes to think back \nto the final days of the Bush administration. I will never forget as \nlong as I live being called to an emergency meeting in this building \nwith the Secretary of the Treasury of the Bush administration, the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve, the leaders, Republicans and \nDemocrats, in the House and the Senate, and being told by the Secretary \nof the Treasury and the Bush administration and the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve that if they did not act, they expected a financial \ncollapse within days--a financial collapse within days. Those were in \nthe final months of the Bush administration. That is what President \nBarack Obama inherited.\n  The hard fact is that when our colleagues were in charge of \neverything--they had the House, the Senate, and they controlled the \nWhite House--they brought this country to the brink of financial \ncollapse. That is a fact. Thank goodness this President, acting with \nthis Congress, was able to draw us back from the brink, but we have a \nlong way to go. We have a long way to go. It is going to take everybody \nworking together to pull us out of the ditch completely.\n  I have been part of major efforts for the last 5 years--bipartisan \nefforts--including Bowles-Simpson, the group of six; right now the \ngroup of six has been\n\n[[Page S6487]]\n\nexpanded to the group of eight. We have been working nonstop, hundreds \nof hours of discussions, on a bipartisan plan--four Democrats, four \nRepublicans--to be enacted when we return, to get America back on \ntrack. That is what is required here.\n  What we saw this morning from our colleagues on the other side is not \nthe answer; it is the problem. The same old tired political \ngamesmanship is not going to cut it. What we desperately need is \nRepublicans and Democrats working together to solve America's problems. \nThat is what we owe the American people. I very much hope when we \nreturn after this election that colleagues on both sides will be \nprepared to act in that spirit.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am very proud to follow Chairman \nConrad on the floor at this time. There is no person in the U.S. Senate \nwho has worked harder on a budget compromise than Senator Conrad has. \nThere is no person who has put out the hand of bipartisan friendship \nand cooperation more than Senator Conrad has. There is no person who \nhas experienced more frustration of having that hand rejected and \nslapped away than Senator Conrad has, and there is no person who has \ncontained that frustration and continued to work forward and seek \nresolution in a dignified way than Senator Conrad has.\n  The Senate Republicans who took to the floor this morning to \ncriticize Democrats for failing to pass a budget and deal with the \nimpending sequester and tax cuts expiration failed to note that Senate \nDemocrats have, in fact, passed a budget law and a bill that extends \nthe tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans and 97 percent of small \nbusinesses. It is to protect the 2 percent and the 3 percent at the top \nof the income level that Republicans have refused to allow that bill \nprotecting 98 percent of Americans and 97 percent of small businesses \nfrom tax increases from going forward.\n  Senate Democrats also support a balanced approach to replacing the \nsequester and reducing the deficit. What they didn't talk much about \nbut which is very important in this discussion is the Republican Ryan \nplan for the budget.\n  This past May, 41 of our Senate Republican colleagues voted in favor \nof a radical transformation of the America we know. And the Republican-\ncontrolled House passed this budget--a budget that would devastate the \nmiddle class. The plan would end Medicare as we know it for future \nretirees. It would reopen the Medicare prescription drug doughnut hole \nthat we closed for current retirees. It would slash investments that \nAmerica's children depend on, from Head Start to Federal college aid; \nand it would give the average million-dollar earner a new additional \ntax cut of, on average, $285,000 each in that million-dollar-plus \nearner cohort.\n  The blockade here that is preventing moving beyond the sequester is \nby Republicans, particularly in the House, refusing to proceed in any \nreasonable way and, instead, demanding these damaging radical cuts for \nthe middle class.\n  Let's look a little bit behind the curtain of campaign rhetoric and \nexamine the harm--the personal real-life, real-person harm--that the \nRyan budget would inflict on millions of middle-class families and \nretirees.\n  In what is one of the extraordinary examples of ``say one thing, but \ndo another'' rhetoric, Mr. Ryan, in his recent nomination acceptance \nspeech, said that ``the greatest of all responsibilities, is that of \nthe strong to protect the weak. The truest measure of any society is \nhow it treats those who cannot defend or care for themselves.''\n  His budget, of course, visibly does exactly the opposite. It slashes \ntaxes for the most well off, while decimating the programs on which \nstruggling families and retirees rely.\n  Do not take my word for it. Following the House passage of this Ryan \nbudget, the Conference of Catholic Bishops said:\n\n       Congress faces a difficult task to balance needs and \n     resources and allocate burdens and sacrifices.\n       Just solutions, however--\n\n  The bishops said--\n\n     must require shared sacrifice by all, including raising \n     adequate revenues, eliminating unnecessary military and other \n     spending, and fairly addressing the long-term costs of health \n     insurance and retirement programs. The House-passed budget \n     resolution fails to meet these moral criteria.\n\n  That is what the Conference of Catholic Bishops said. I will state \nagain: ``The House-passed budget resolution fails to meet these moral \ncriteria.''\n  That is not me speaking. That is the Conference of America's Catholic \nBishops.\n  So let's start our look behind the curtain, the curtain of the budget \nthat fails this moral test--that Governor Romney said was \n``marvelous,'' to use his word--let's start with the budget's tax \ntheories.\n  The Ryan budget would lower the top tax rates for both corporations \nand the highest earning individuals from 35 percent to 25 percent.\n  According to a Joint Economic Committee analysis, this would result \nin an average tax cut of $285,000 for Americans earning $1 million a \nyear and more. At the same time, middle-income taxpayers making between \n$50,000 and $100,000 would see their taxes go up--go up--by $1,300 \nbecause middle-class deductions are stripped away to pay for the high-\nend cuts.\n  Ryan would also shift, at the corporate level, to a so-called \nterritorial tax system, which would mean that companies that ship jobs \nand operations overseas would no longer have to pay any U.S. taxes on \ntheir overseas profits.\n  Democrats have tried repeatedly to offer tax incentives to companies \nthat bring jobs home to the United States. And nobody in this body has \nworked harder on bringing jobs home to the United States than the \nPresiding Officer, the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Brown.\n  Well, the Ryan plan would do exactly the opposite. It would tell big \ncorporations that if they move their business operations overseas, they \nwill never pay taxes on those again. The Ryan plan is really a jobs \nbill for China, for India, for Korea, not for America. It is an \noffshoring rewards act.\n  In addition to those upside down tax changes that harm the middle \nclass and raise their taxes to cut taxes for the highest earners in \nthis country, in addition to its inducements to offshore more jobs \ninstead of bringing them home, the Ryan budget would slash $2.9 \ntrillion from our health care programs. Beginning for workers who \nretire in 2023, Mr. Ryan would convert Medicare to a voucher system, \nwhich, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, would \nultimately add an estimated $6,000 in annual out-of-pocket costs that \nour retirees, our seniors would have to fork over.\n  It is hard to imagine how future seniors living on a fixed Social \nSecurity income will be able to maintain health care coverage with \nthese substantial increases in out-of-pocket costs that Mr. Ryan's \nbudget envisions.\n  If the Republicans are saying they will not make the deal that spares \nus the sequester unless that deal puts an end to Medicare as we know \nit, holding Medicare hostage, well, it then takes some ``brass''--to \nuse President Clinton's phrase--to say: We are for the sequester.\n  The Ryan budget does not stop there. It would repeal the Affordable \nCare Act and take away access to affordable health insurance for \nmillions of Americans of all ages. And, of course, repealing the \nAffordable Care Act hits seniors again by reopening that dreaded \nMedicare prescription drug doughnut hole that we worked so hard to \nclose and that is closed over time in the Affordable Care Act.\n  In 2011 alone, the Affordable Care Act helped nearly 15,000 people in \nmy home State of Rhode Island save an average of $554 by beginning to \nclose the doughnut hole--millions of dollars out of the pockets of \nRhode Island seniors.\n  That made a big difference for people such as Olive, who wrote to me \nfrom Woonsocket. Her husband fell into the doughnut hole last July. \nThanks to the new law, Olive and her husband received a discount on \ntheir prescription drugs. They saved $2,400. If the Ryan budget passed, \nthey would be stuck paying that full cost again: $2,400 right out of \nthe pockets of Olive and her husband and into the pockets of the drug \ncompanies. Gee, who would be for that around here?\n  In fact, under the Ryan budget, the average senior would be stuck \nwith\n\n[[Page S6488]]\n\n$4,200 in additional out-of-pocket prescription costs--a huge transfer \nof wealth from America's seniors to the big drug companies.\n  Repealing the Affordable Care Act would not just harm seniors, it \nwould also mean that insurance plans would no longer have to cover \nyoung adults up to age 26 on their parents' plans. This moves over 3 \nmillion young Americans--just getting out of college, still looking for \nthat first job that has health insurance coverage--back on to the rolls \nof the uninsured.\n  The radical Ryan budget would also hurt young people by slashing Pell \ngrants, making college less affordable. Students and graduates are \nalready struggling to pay a record trillion dollars that Americans now \nowe in outstanding student loans, and the Ryan plan would force \nstudents to take on even greater debt burdens.\n  On top of these specific cuts, the Ryan budget takes an additional $1 \ntrillion in unspecified discretionary spending cuts. Domestic \ndiscretionary funding is the money that is used to keep the government \noperating each year--FBI agents investigating cases, Border Patrol \nagents working our borders, doctors and nurses treating veterans at the \nVA, employees mailing out Social Security checks, and many other \nimportant programs and functions.\n\n  It is already at its lowest level as a share of GDP since the 1950s. \nIt is hard to imagine any Federal investment--whether it is education \nor housing or highways or law enforcement, you name it--not being \njeopardized by such Draconian cuts.\n  That is why President Reagan's--President Reagan's--former economic \nadviser said about this Ryan budget plan:\n\n       The Ryan plan is a monstrosity.\n\n  Ronald Reagan's economic advisor said: ``The Ryan plan is a \nmonstrosity.''\n\n       The rich would receive huge tax cuts while the social \n     safety net would be shredded to pay for it. . . . It is less \n     of a wish list than a fairy tale utterly disconnected from \n     the real world, backed up by make-believe numbers and \n     unreasonable assumptions.\n\n  If that is what Ronald Reagan's economic advisor thought about it, \nthink what regular people might think about it.\n\n       Ryan's plan isn't even an act of courage; it's just \n     pandering to the Tea Party.\n\n  But that is what is being held hostage on this sequester.\n  I hope when the election season is over, no matter who wins, that \nRepublicans will work with us--without insisting on a monstrosity, \nwithout insisting on the end of Medicare--on a balanced and reasonable \nplan to reduce the deficit. With a record national debt, now is no time \nfor more tax giveaways to billionaires, as Mr. Ryan proposes, but, \nrather, it is the time to ensure an America where everyone gets a fair \nshot, everyone pitches in their fair share, and we go forward as a \ncountry together, as we always have in our best days.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I caught some of the dog-and-pony show \nthat Republicans put on this morning on the floor of the Senate, and I \nthought it was pretty indicative of their approach to this entire \nCongress--all politics, no participation. Someone must have reminded \nthem this morning that they are 47 days away from an election and that \nfor the last 624 days of this Congress, they have done nothing but say \nno.\n  But I am here to say that an hour of speeches on the Senate floor \ncannot erase an entire Congress of obstruction. In fact, the \nRepublicans' show this morning reminded me of a move I have seen many \ntimes before as a former preschool teacher and as a mom who has watched \na lot of kids go through school. It reminded me how on the very last \nday of school before summer there was always one student who had not \ndone their homework all year long, and on that last day they showed up \non their best behavior, homework in hand, hoping to leave a good \nimpression. They thought maybe this last-ditch effort could help them \navoid a bad grade.\n  Unfortunately, it does not work that way.\n  So let me assure Republicans of one thing: Their record of \nobstruction and their refusal to compromise will not go away at the \neleventh hour. One-minute speeches on the day before they go to face \nvoters cannot paper over 100 filibusters. It will not change the fact \nthat almost 2 years ago the Senate minority leader revealed that his \nNo. 1 priority was--not working to get Americans back to work, it was \nnot bringing our economy back from the brink, it was not ensuring that \nAmerica remained a leader at home and abroad, no--to defeat President \nObama, it was playing politics, just as we saw this morning.\n  There has been, seemingly, no group of Americans--well, with the \nexception of millionaires and billionaires--who have been spared in the \nRepublicans' efforts to achieve their goals--not our teachers, not our \ncollege students, not our farmers, not construction workers, not first \nresponders, not even our Nation's veterans have been spared their \nefforts to destroy the work of this Congress.\n  There was no better example of that than yesterday here on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate. The Veterans Jobs Corps bill that we brought to the \nfloor included 12 provisions to help veterans find jobs.\n  Eight of them. Let me repeat that. Eight of those provisions were \nRepublican ideas. This bill was fully paid for. It was based on \nexisting grant programs that are putting Americans to work. It would \nhave allowed the veterans to serve their communities. It would have \ngiven unemployed veterans the self-esteem that a job provides. It would \nhave allowed them to support their families and help ease that \ntransition back home.\n  That bill came at a time when one in four young veterans today is out \nof work. It came at a time when our military and veteran suicide rates \nare outpacing combat deaths and when more and more, as we all know, \nveterans are coming home today. The American Legion supported it. The \nIraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America supported it. The problem was, \nit seemed, President Obama supported it. So we know from everything we \nhave seen and attempted on the Senate floor, no matter how good or bad \nof an idea, no matter which struggling American would benefit, it seems \nthat if the President supports it, you can pretty much guarantee Senate \nRepublicans will not.\n  That is the legacy the Senate Republicans are going to take home to \nvoters, the legacy that when middle-class American families needed \ntheir help the most, they refused to compromise to get things done; \nthat when Americans were hurting, they put politics before people; that \nthey set a goal of not participating, and they followed through on that \nat every single turn. No amount of snappy speeches is going to change \nthat. No last-minute appeals for leniency will change that record.\n  In fact, it is ironic that this morning all of the Republican \nSenators showed up on the floor because for the last 2 years, when the \nAmerican people have needed them the most, they have been absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate to talk \nbriefly about an amendment on which we may or may not get a vote. It is \nan amendment by my colleague, Senator Paul. It really is directly \nrelated to the issues that have happened around the world in the last \nweek and a half. We certainly watched in horror as our Ambassador, a \nfantastic and honorable American, along with three of his colleagues in \nthe American consulate in Benghazi, was murdered last week. So I wanted \nto talk briefly about that because it really is an important moment in \nour foreign policy in the region.\n  Let me begin by expressing our deep condolences for that loss. All \nthe members of the families of those folks who have died over there, \nour hearts are with them, our prayers are with them. We thank them for \ntheir brave service to our country and to the cause of freedom.\n  We have the right to be angry. The American people are angry and \nrightfully so. For years we have been investing our taxpayer dollars in \naid to that region, and yet we turn on the television and we see these \nprotests\n\n[[Page S6489]]\n\nagainst us. On one hand, every single year we send billions of dollars \nand hundreds of millions of dollars to help people in the region. We \nhelp them to stand and fight for themselves, to get rid of dictators. \nThen we turn on the television and we see people attacking our \nembassies or burning images of our President and burning our flag and \nchanting anti-American slogans. So the American people are both \nconfused and angry. How can this be happening? But I think it is \nimportant for us that while we have the right to be angry, we should \nstill remain smart in our foreign policy.\n  What I would like to talk about today is what it means to have a \nsmart foreign policy, a pro-American foreign policy in that region of \nthe world given these factors we are facing.\n  The amendment on which Senator Paul is asking for a vote would \ncondition foreign aid to three particular countries. Let me begin my \nconversation by saying that this is a complicated issue, and not all \nthese countries are the same. Let me contrast two of them, for example.\n  Let's talk about Egypt for a moment. Now, of course, the Egyptian \npeople got rid of a dictator. They had an election. It was a very close \nelection that was won by the current President, Mursi, who comes from \nthe Muslim Brotherhood. But Egypt has a well-organized security \napparatus, a well-organized and well-funded security apparatus. Egypt \nhas the capability to conduct counterterrorism in Egypt. Egypt has the \ncapability, they have the people and the resources to protect our \nEmbassy in Egypt. They have no excuse for not doing that, if they fail \nto do that, because they are able to do it.\n  What was really troubling to me about Egypt, however, was that \nPresident Mursi, rather than immediately condemning the attack against \nthe United States and the murder of our Ambassador, his first reaction \nwas to condemn a YouTube video. That is what we are talking about \nhere--a YouTube video. Anybody can make a YouTube video.\n  Now, there is a belief, by the way, in the Muslim world that because \nin their countries, if you produce a YouTube video or any movie, for \nthat matter, your government had to approve it--they think, well then \nin America, your government must have approved it as well. But that is \nnot true, and their leaders know better. The leaders of these countries \nknow better. Some of these leaders in the Egyptian Government were \neducated in this country. They know full well that anyone can make a \nYouTube video. But instead of standing and explaining that to their \npeople, they go along with this stuff. They say one thing in Arabic to \ntheir people and another thing to the rest of the world in English.\n  There is a long pattern of double-playing behavior that we should not \nstand for and should not tolerate. It is, in my mind, unacceptable that \na full 2 days went by before the Egyptian Government clearly condemned \nthe attack on Benghazi and clearly condemned these actions against \nAmerica.\n  Contrast that with Libya for a moment. Libya had an election as well \nwhere two-thirds of the Libyan people rejected the Islamists and they \nelected pro-Western, pro-modern, pro-progress leaders to their \ngovernment. But, unlike Egypt, Libya does not have the ability to \nprotect our consulate as well. They did not inherit from Qadhafi a \nwell-organized security apparatus. In fact, it was one of the reasons \nwhy I argued for a more forceful American engagement in Libya. I did \nnot want the conflict to last that long. That protracted and long \nconflict in Libya--what it did is it created more time and more space \nfor these independent militias--these are literally independent gangs \nwho got their hands on weapons and fought in this revolution against \nQadhafi, but now the central government cannot get these groups to give \nup their arms because to do so would be to give up their power. That is \nwhy having this go on for as long as it did is a terrible idea. The \nfact is, though, the Libyans do not even have control over large \nportions of the country. There are entire areas of Libya that the \ngovernment does not control.\n\n  There is an increasing body of evidence that shows that what happened \nin Benghazi was not an anti-American protest, it was not as a result of \na YouTube video; it was an orchestrated anti-American terrorist attack \nby terrorists--not by Libya, not by Libyans, by terrorists.\n  In addition to evidence that this was a terrorist attack, not a \nLibyan anti-American uprising, look at the reaction in Libya since the \nattack. I wish the media in the United States would give more coverage \nto the Libyans in the streets protesting the terrorists, holding up \nsigns apologizing.\n  Our Ambassador in Benghazi was loved by the Libyan people, especially \nthe people of Benghazi, who credited him for saving their lives when \nMuammar Qadhafi's troops were on the outskirts of the city about to \nmassacre them. I wish more attention were paid to that. I wish more \nattention were paid to the ceremonies that are happening today in \nTripoli honoring--our Under Secretary William Burns is there honoring \nthe service of Ambassador Stevens. The demonstrations in Benghazi are \ngoing to occur tomorrow honoring him as well.\n  I am not saying everyone in Libya is pro-American. I am saying we \nhave a government in Libya that is trying to do the right thing. There \nis open source reporting in the press today. Fifty American FBI agents \nare there now investigating this. Those are the actions of a \ncooperative government. They are trying to help us, but they just do \nnot have the resources to do it well. Cutting off aid to them does not \nmake sense to me.\n  On the one hand, we are demanding that they protect our embassies. \nThey are saying: We want to, but we do not have the resources to do it. \nOn the other hand, we are threatening to take away their resources.\n  So not all these countries are the same.\n  There are a lot of misconceptions floating around out there. I have \nheard some people say: You know what, maybe we were better off with \ndictators in the Middle East because they could maintain order. Let me \ntell you, that is a false choice. Here is why. These dictators were no \nfriends of America.\n  Let me give you an example of Egypt, where people now say: Well, this \nstuff did not happen when Mubarak was there. No, it happened but in a \ndifferent way. Let me tell you about the deal Mubarak and other \ndictatorial leaders in the region cut with extremists. Here is the deal \nthey cut with extremists: As long as you do not do anything against us, \nyou can do anything you want anywhere in the world. Conduct all the \nterrorism you want. Attack Americans. Blow up a train in Spain. Do \nwhatever you want, just do not do it here. Do it in your country. If \nyou do it in our country, we will cut your head off. If you do it \nsomewhere else, that is not our business.\n  That is the deal these dictators cut with extremists.\n  It was not a coincidence that there were Egyptians involved in the 9/\n11 plot. These were not Egyptians who came from poor families; they \ncame from prominent and distinguished families in Egypt, which leads me \nto the second point. These dictators allow anti-Americanism, because--\nimagine if you lived in a dictatorial country--you are not allowed to \nprotest the government. You are not allowed to protest your leaders. \nThere are only two things you are allowed to protest--America and \nIsrael. So that is what everybody does. It is almost a relief valve for \nfrustration. Then they have a state-controlled media that feeds into \nanti-Americanism. Do you know that there were media outlets in Egypt \nunder Mubarak and even now that tell the people in Egypt that in \nAmerica denying the Holocaust is a crime? Denying the Holocaust is \ndumb, it is outrageous, but it is not a crime in America. Yet they \nspread these lies, these anti-American lies through the region. Of \ncourse there are people in the region who hate us because our so-called \ndictatorial friends and allies have allowed anti-Americanism to grow \nand be fostered because it has helped them hold on to the power.\n  So these dictators are not good for the region, not good for America. \nAnd the choice should not be between dictators and democracy. The \nsecond fallacy is, well, we will just have an election and everything \nwill be better. That is not true either. Democracies can elect people \nwho do not like us too. So this is not an easy issue to confront, but \ndisengaging from the region is not the solution.\n\n[[Page S6490]]\n\n  Now, I do not have a magic solution. I have only been here in the \nSenate for about a year and a half, so these are issues I am engaging \nin for the first time over the last year, but here are my opinions \ngiven what I have learned in the first 2 years I have been here, some \npoints I would like to make.\n  The first is that we should expect more. We should expect more from \nleaders in the region. We should expect Mursi and the Muslim \nBrotherhood and others to stand up to people and say: Look, we \nunderstand you are upset about this video, but you do not have the \nright to burn down an embassy. By the way, in America the government \ndoes not control these videos. Anyone can make a YouTube video. They \nare a free society.\n  No. 2, we should expect them to say the same things in Arabic as they \nare saying in English. Do not express condolences and outrage in \nEnglish on the attack against America but in Arabic completely ignore \nit and only talk about the YouTube video.\n  We should expect more from them. They want a true partnership. They \nwant American and Western aid. They want tourists to return. They want \neconomic interchange between our two countries. We should expect more \nfrom them.\n  Here is the second point. This stuff is not happening because of a \nvideo, because people are upset. You know what, let me explain \nsomething to you. For radical Islam, our entire culture is offensive. \nThey are not just offended about a YouTube video. They are offended \nthat women serve in the Senate. They are offended that women drive. \nThey are offended that little girls get to go to school. In some of \nthese countries, converting to Christianity is punishable by death. So \nour whole culture is offensive to them, not just a YouTube video.\n  Here is the third point we have to accept. This is a critical moment \nnot just for America, this is a critical moment for the Muslim world, \nwhere they have to decide what kind of future they want for themselves. \nIs this the future they want, a future isolated from the world, a \nfuture isolated from the promises of the 21st century, or do they want \na different future? I know there are millions of people in the Muslim \nworld who do not want this future, but they are afraid to speak up. \nThey are intimidated from speaking up because of these radical forces \nthat need to be defeated.\n\n  This brings me to my last point. We need to be very clear. We will \nsupport those who want a better future, like we should have supported \nthe Green Revolution in Iran when brave young Iranians took to the \nstreets to protest a fraudulent election, and instead of taking their \nside, the President disengaged and said nothing. We will support those \nwho want a new future and a better future for their region. We are not \nasking them to abandon their religion or their beliefs, but they have \nto respect ours. We are not asking them to walk away from the Koran, \nbut they have to respect our beliefs and tolerate our beliefs as well. \nWe will support those who are willing to do that. We want to work with \nthem. It benefits no one to have violence and destruction in the \nregion. But we also have to accept the hard cold fact that there are \npeople, there are radical Islamists in that part of the world with whom \nyou can never and will never be able to reason. They are never going to \nchange their minds. They are never going to come around. They are never \ngoing to one day all of a sudden change their behavior because we \nengaged them more, because we give more speeches at their universities. \nThey are radical Islamists, violent people. It is a very clear choice: \nEither they win or we win. And the sooner we accept that, the better \noff we are going to be.\n  So we have to accept that on the one hand there are millions of \npeople in that region who want a new and better future. We will side \nwith them. We will support their aspirations. We will work with their \nhopes for civilian leadership and peace and economic prosperity. But \nfor those who are radical Islamists, whose view is they want to conquer \nand bring under their control everyone who is not who they are, we have \nto defeat them. I wish it weren't the case, but it is. And the sooner \nwe accept that, the clearer our policies are going to be.\n\n  So this is not just a critical moment for America in our foreign \npolicy; this is a critical moment for them as well, for they are going \nto have to decide. If Egypt truly wants a better future for their \npeople, one where their economy is growing and prosperous and young \npeople can fulfill their aspirations, they are going to have to \nunequivocally reject this type of stuff or they will be trapped in the \n18th century forever.\n  In Libya, they are trying to cooperate with us. They are allowing us \nto move forward. We should work with them and strengthen them, not \nabandon them.\n  And I didn't mention Pakistan, but that is important too. Let me just \nsay that I think it is outrageous that doctor is being held there. I \nbelieve every charge against him is trumped up, and I think we should \ndemand--I think it is right to condition some, if not all, of our \nforeign aid and cooperation with Pakistan on his status and on his \nrelease. So I hope Senator Paul and those who support his amendment \nwill consider, at a minimum, restructuring that amendment to recognize \nthere is a difference between Libya and Egypt and that we should take \ndifferent approaches in that regard; that we have a right to be \noutraged; that we have a right to be angry, but we should never abandon \nbeing smart.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6490-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6490-S6493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n  Corporal Darrion Terrell Hicks, Petty Officer Second Class Sean E. \n         Brazas, Lance Corporal Christopher Phoenix Jacob Levy\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, 11 years have now passed since the attacks \nof September 11, that horrific day that forever changed the world. \nAlthough we have killed Osama bin Laden, the fight against the al-Qaida \nmilitants is not over. Al-Qaida remains a threat to America, and the \nbrave men and women of our Armed Forces are still fighting every day to \nprotect our way of life.\n  Mr. President, I want us to honor and think about these men and \nwomen. There are over 77,000 U.S. servicemembers deployed in \nAfghanistan right now who remain in harm's way. These men and women \nwillingly joined the military during a time of war. They want nothing \nmore than to serve our country. They fight for our way of life so we \ndon't have to and so that our children and grandchildren will not have \nto.\n  I am going to highlight three servicemen from North Carolina who have \nmade the ultimate sacrifice. I have personally spoken with their \nfamilies, and I want to share their great love of country with you \nbecause it is so important that all Americans understand our military \nand their families who sacrifice so much for all of us.\n  From my home State of North Carolina alone there are more than 6,000 \nof our finest sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, moms and dads \ndeployed in Afghanistan. They are the men and women of the II Marine \nExpeditionary Force, 2nd Marine Division, 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing, and \n2nd Marine Logistics Group from Camp Lejeune and Cherry Point. They are \nthe men and women of the 82nd Airborne Division from Fort Bragg. They \nare the men and women from the National Guard and Reserve Units from \nNorth Carolina. And they are the thousands of other soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and marines deployed to foreign lands to stand watch over the \nworld and keep us safe.\n  Sometimes I feel as if the war is hardly an issue in the news, in \ndaily life, anywhere, except for those who are personally affected by \nit. Our focus is too often drawn to the news of the elections, of the \neconomy, of politics, of celebrities, of scandals, of the rich and \nfamous, and of the simply bizarre. We do not hear enough about the \nbrave souls who have lost their lives while trying to make the world \nsafer for the rest of us, who willingly joined the military during a \ntime of war, who want to serve our country.\n  We all need to pay respect, to honor, and to remember the very men \nand women whose commitment, dedication, and courage are what make our \ncountry safe and to respect and remember the families they left behind.\n  As we scale down our presence in Afghanistan and bring our service \nmen\n\n[[Page S6491]]\n\nand women home, we must remember every day this war is still going on, \nand it is occurring at a tremendous cost--a cost that is \ndisproportionately paid by the brave men and women who are fighting for \nthe rights and privileges we enjoy.\n  These men and women traded their youth, and they have spent years \naway from family and friends. They voluntarily put their lives on the \nline for their friends, for their loved ones, their country, and for \npeople they have never met--for me and for you. These men and women are \nthe almost 50,000 wounded in action since the start of this war. They \nare the 336 U.S. servicemembers who have died just this past year. They \nare the 54 coalition forces who died in the month of August alone. They \nare strangers to most of us, but they are the most important person in \nthe world to someone. They are selfless defenders of our freedom, many \nof whom have made the ultimate sacrifice, and many of whom are from my \nhome State of North Carolina.\n  They are people such as CPL Darrion Terrell Hicks, U.S. Army, from \nRaleigh, NC, who died July 19, 2012, just 2 months ago. Darrion was a \n2009 graduate of Broughton High School, where he was a standout student \nwho was loved and respected by all.\n  Darrion always wanted to be a soldier. It was a goal he set early on \nand something that everyone remembers about him. It was a goal he \npursued with diligence and honor. He was a model Junior ROTC student \nwho was voted Mr. Junior ROTC by his peers. Darrion is remembered as \nthe kind of young man a teacher wishes all of their students were like. \nHe was a boy you wanted your children to be friends with. He became the \nkind of man we should all be so thankful to have in this world.\n  When I was speaking with his mom Tracy, she shared with me that he \nwas the kind of boy who never gave her a problem, ever.\n  Corporal Hicks achieved his goal of becoming a soldier when he \nenlisted in the Army after graduating from high school. He loved the \nArmy, and it seemed he had found his place in life. He loved his \nfamily, and he kept in close contact with his mother. Whenever he spoke \nwith his mom, she would always tell him: ``Always pray. Be safe. I love \nyou.'' To which he would respond: ``I am going to be fine. I love you, \ntoo.''\n  This year, Darrion was serving with the 54th Engineer Battalion, 18th \nEngineer Brigade as a sapper. Sappers are responsible for clearing the \nway for others, making the way safe for those who follow. This is what \nCorporal Hicks was doing when he was killed by an enemy IED. He was \nonly 21 years old.\n  As one of his teachers at Broughton said:\n\n       When we talk about Darrion, we are not talking about a \n     teacher making an impact on a student. We're talking about a \n     student who made an impact on the teacher.\n\n  Corporal Hicks made an impact on everyone he touched, and I think we \nall have something to learn from him and the life he chose to lead.\n  There are people such as PO2 Sean E. Brazas, U.S. Navy, from \nGreensboro, NC, where I have lived for the last 30 years. Sean died on \nMay 30, 2012. Sean was your all-American boy next door. He grew up \nplaying soccer in the same traveling soccer league in which my son \nplayed, and Sean was on the swim team.\n  Sean graduated from Western Guilford High School, and he could have \ndone anything, but he wanted to do something important with his life. \nSean Brazas joined the Navy after graduation and became a dog handler. \nHe was stationed at Naval Base Kitsap in Washington State, where he met \nthe love of his life, Allie, who was also in the Navy. When Sean met \nAllie, being the southern gentleman he was, he held the door open for \nher at the post office when they first met. Putting others first was \njust how he lived his life.\n  Sean Brazas loved being a dog handler and loved being in the Navy. \nHis wife is now a 23-year-old widow with a young daughter Addison, whom \nSean nicknamed Short-stack. They were the center of his world. His life \nas a sailor, devoted husband, and loving dad was rich and full and \ntragically short.\n  Petty Officer Brazas had only been in Afghanistan a short time when \nhe died on May 30 while helping a fellow servicemember get into a \nhelicopter when their unit was ambushed. That seems to define Sean--a \nman who selflessly did what he could to help others.\n  Sean Brazas served his country proudly because he appreciated the \nrights and privileges that Americans are fortunate to enjoy. He wanted \nto make sure his daughter never had to worry about anyone telling her \nwhat books she could read or where she could go to school or what she \ncould become. He wanted his mom, dad, wife, and daughter to be safe.\n  He died a hero and now rests at Arlington with his grandfather and \nfriends who have left the world far too soon. He died a man his dad Ed \nlooked up to. Ed told me he hopes to be half the man his son was.\n  There are people such as LCpl Christopher Phoenix Jacob Levy, U.S. \nMarine Corps, from Ramseur, NC, who died September 10, 2011.\n  On 9/11, Jacob had just turned 11 years old. He had gotten a bloody \nnose at school, and his mom Amanda was called to bring him a change of \nclothes. She shared with me she was driving to his school when she \nheard on the radio of the first plane hitting the World Trade Center. \nWhen Amanda explained what had happened to Jacob that night, she said \nJacob then said he would be in the military. He was only 11 years old \nat the time.\n  Jacob joined the Junior ROTC at Eastern Randolph High School where he \nwas a standout runner and wrestler. He was also a proud active member \nof the Lumbee Tribe. That is why he has the name Phoenix, from his \nIndian heritage. It stands for immortality and renewal.\n  In 2009, Jacob fulfilled the goal he set in 2001. He enlisted in the \nMarine Corps and graduated from boot camp. He planned on being a marine \nfor 20 years, retiring, and then returning to his hometown to give back \nto the JROTC in his community. It is clear from an early age Jacob was \ndriven to be a part of something more than himself, to do his part for \nthe greater good. That was just how he lived his life.\n  Lance Corporal Levy deployed to Afghanistan with the 3rd Battalion, \n8th Marines and returned home from his first tour on Mother's Day of \n2011. However, Jacob told his mom his job was not yet done; that he \nneeded to return to his brothers in arms in Afghanistan. He then \nvolunteered to deploy again in the fall of 2011, this time with the 1st \nBattalion, 6th Marines out of Camp Lejeune. It was during this \ndeployment he was mortally wounded by a single enemy shot. He was only \n21 years old.\n  A couple of weeks before he died, Jacob spoke with his mother for the \nlast time. He told her not to worry about him. He asked for underwear \nand beef jerky. He asked her to tell everyone he loved them. Jacob left \nhis mom, dad, stepdad and two brothers.\n  Jacob's Indian name Phoenix, for immortality and renewal, has proven \na worthy namesake for him. Although his life was tragically short, he \nlives on in the lives he touched. He inspired a scholarship at his high \nschool that will go to help others, and he was an organ donor. He \nhelped save seven other people he had never met. He gave the loved ones \nof those seven strangers more time with their parent, spouse, child, or \nsibling.\n  His death resulted in an outpouring of love and support for the Levy \nfamily from the Marines of both the 3rd, 8th, and 1-6. As Jacob's \nmother told me: ``I may have lost one son, but I gained 30 others.'' To \nthis day, those young men who served with Lance Corporal Levy continue \nto remember and look after her.\n  These are the people who are paying both your share and my share of \nthe cost of freedom. These servicemembers gave their lives for us and \nfor our country. We must not forget them: Darrion Hicks, Sean Brazas, \nand Jacob Levy. We must not forget their families.\n  We must not forget the men and women still deployed in harm's way. \nThey come from our small towns, our big cities, and our rural areas. \nThey are our neighbors, they are our fellow Americans, they are our \nheroes, and they are my fellow North Carolinians. To these men and \nwomen, to their families, we owe an eternal debt of gratitude. May God \nbless them, and may God bless America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from West \nVirginia.\n\n[[Page S6492]]\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, something unusual is happening in \nCongress. Democrats and Republicans are agreeing on something; we \nappear headed toward same goal.\n  The problem is, what we are agreeing on is more business as usual in \nWashington. They want to pass yet another continuing resolution instead \nof a real budget solution. I can almost hear the people back home and \nall over this country saying, There they go again.\n  I can argue this both ways. A continuing resolution will let the \ngovernment limp along again for another 6 months. That way, we can go \nhome now and come back after election to fix the budget.\n  I haven't had anybody in West Virginia tell me that we should hurry \nhome to campaign. I have had plenty of them tell me that we need to \nstay here and do the job they hired us to do. And that means fixing the \nbudget, because our debt is piling up every day and it is choking our \neconomy.\n  These continuing resolutions are supposed to be temporary, but it \nlooks to me as though they have become a permanent way of doing \nbusiness here in Congress. And let me tell you, it is a bad way of \ndoing business. It ignores the dire circumstances of a record $16 \ntrillion of national debt that will increase close to $1 trillion a \nyear if we don't balance our annual budget, and do it soon. It makes me \nthink of the goofy kid on the cover of Mad Magazine, Alfred E. Neuman, \n``What? Me worry?''\n  I came to the Senate not quite 2 years ago, and in the time I have \nbeen here there have been 12 of these continuing resolutions. There \nwere three in December of 2010. In 2011 there were two in March, two in \nApril, two in September, one in November, and three in December. Now we \nare being asked to pass another CR to keep things going a little bit \nlonger, for 6 more months, so we can all go home--that is the problem--\nso we can all go home and worry about our elections, and we are going \nto worry about this country's growing debt later. We have got to get \nhome first.\n  Well, a baker's dozen is one too many for me. Enough is enough. I \ncan't vote for this measure to simply kick the can any farther down the \nroad. It can't go on. The people of West Virginia didn't send me here \nor send the Presiding Officer from the great State of North Carolina to \ndo that. They sent us here to help fix our budget problems with \nbipartisan commonsense solutions.\n  That is the way we did it in West Virginia when I was Governor. We \ndidn't pull these kinds of stunts on West Virginians. We stayed on the \njob until the work was done. We wouldn't leave. We stayed and worked. \nIf it was all through the night, we would stay. If it was an extra day \nor an extra week, we would stay and get our work done. We came together \nto make decisions on what was best for our State, not best for us \nindividually. It is time we do the same here in Washington.\n  We have to stop putting off what we need to do to get our fiscal \nhouse in order. It is time to cancel the flights home, it is time to \nroll up our sleeves and get down to the people's business, because we \nhave reached a dangerous point in our history--a point in which our \ndebt is threatening not just our economic standing in the world but \nalso our national security.\n  I know everybody expects that we will come back after elections in a \nlameduck session, and we are going to rush to fix all of our fiscal \nproblems at the last minute. But if Congress's past performance is any \nindication of what to expect after the election, I wouldn't expect too \nmuch. That is a shame. A lameduck session of Congress is cutting it \npretty close, because we have gotten ourselves into a real bind.\n  The so-called fiscal cliff is real. We are looking at over $5 \ntrillion of economic swing by the end of this year, December 31, coming \nup to January 1. One part of that is sequestration. I think we all \nremember the sequestration. That was a penalty we put on ourselves if \nthe supercommittee did not do their job. Well, the supercommittee \nwasn't that super. It didn't work out the way we all thought it would. \nIt means that what we have to do is take painful cuts. Because we said \nif we make the penalty strong enough and great enough, we will \ndefinitely come to the table and fix the financial problems. But we \ndidn't do it. That was a year ago. We could have been working and \nfixing all that between, but here we come down to last minute and we \nare asking for 6 more months.\n  These are the kinds of meat axe spending cuts--and I will talk about \nthat. I never did put budgets together that were across-the-board cuts. \nIf you had to cut, you looked at it. Government can do two things with \nyour money: It can spend your money or it can invest your money. We \nhave done a poor job of investing. We have done a great job of spending \nthe money. That has got to reverse and change. We can't just say, Well, \nacross-the-board cuts. We have to look and find out and put forth \npriorities based on our values. And you shouldn't cut where investments \nshould be made, but overall there will be a reduction. That can happen.\n  Some of our congressional leaders who put together the sequestering \nin order to force us are now acting as though, We really didn't mean \nit. It really wasn't sincere about we should do this. We knew we \ncouldn't do it, but it sounded good back then because we really thought \nwe would do so. Can you think what would happen to the confidence of \nthe people in this country if we don't do what we said we were going to \ndo? It is not a smart way to run this country.\n  Then they talk about cutting the defense budget. Oh, that can't be \ndone. That can't be done. We want to make sure we have the strongest \nand toughest. And every one of us here supports our military to the \nhilt. Every man and woman in uniform should have the best equipment, \nthe best training, and the best support this country can give them. But \nwhen you look at the ballooning costs of what has happened to our \nDepartment of Defense, most of the money spent on contracting, most of \nthe increases on contracting--people doing the same job making three \nand four and five times more than a man or woman in uniform? That is \nnot right. And they are telling me, We can't cut it? Oh, no. If we do \nthat, you are not strong for America.\n  Well, I have said this: The automatic cuts go into effect January 2, \nas we know. Our national security budget is still over $600 million in \n2013. That is more than we had in 2006, at the height of the Iraq war. \nIn fact, even after the automatic cuts, the United States will still \naccount for 40 percent of all military spending in the world. Forty \npercent of all the military spending is by our country. I promise you, \nwe are going to make sure that America keeps the strongest defense in \nthe world.\n  I have been in this body for 2 years. One of the most sobering \nmoments I have ever had, I am sitting on the Armed Services Committee \nlearning, as the Presiding Officer and everyone else, about the dangers \nwe face around the world and the threats to the United States of \nAmerica. The question was asked to then-Chairman ADM Mike Mullen, What \nis the greatest threat America faces? I am thinking I am going to hear \nabout all the different North Africa problems we have, Iraq, \nAfghanistan, Iran, and on and on. He didn't hesitate, he didn't waiver. \nHe said, ``The debt of this Nation is the greatest threat we face as \nAmerica.'' He wasn't worried about our military might. He wasn't \nworried about a terrorist attack. He was worried about us coming apart \nfrom within.\n\n  That was perhaps my most sobering moment since coming to the Senate. \nAnd when you have the highest ranking officer of the world's most \npowerful military that history has ever recorded, I think you should \ntake that seriously. I did. That alone should give everyone in Congress \na sense of urgency and doing something about our out-of-whack spending. \nAnd it truly is out of whack.\n  If anybody is betting that we can fix our finances in a lameduck \nsession of Congress, I will remind them that some people made the same \nbet on the supercommittee last year. That didn't work out too well.\n  In fact, we are about to leave town with a lot of unfinished work. We \nare not just unsure about our finances, and it is not just about \nfinances. The 112th Congress--and I am ashamed to say this--is one of \nthe least productive Congresses in the history of this country in terms \nof passing new laws. The Congress we are in right now, the 112th, \npassed only 173 public laws as of last month. As you recall, in our \nhistory books, President Harry Truman--who\n\n[[Page S6493]]\n\ndubbed the 80th Congress as the do-nothing Congress--passed 906 bills. \nI don't even know if he would have a definition of what we have done.\n  So a do-nothing Congress is something I am not proud of. It is clear \nto me that betting on Congress getting religion after the election is \nalso a risky gamble--a gamble with America's future, a gamble with the \nnext generation. We tried that with the supercommittee, but it failed. \nThat is the reason we are here today facing the fiscal cliff. The \nsunsetting of the Bush tax cuts, the tax extenders, the end of \nemergency unemployment benefits, sequestration, those are all meat axe \ncuts, and we know that.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says the fiscal cliff could cut the \nGDP by 4 percentage points next year and send the economy back right \ninto a recession. Look at the time we have wasted. The supercommittee \nfell apart almost 1 year ago, and yet here we are. Instead of voting on \na real and permanent solution to our financial problems, we are getting \nready to vote on yet another temporary measure that will allow us to \nleave before we have addressed a single one of these most critical \nissues.\n  What has happened since the supercommittee shut down with no \nagreement? One thing that has happened is our long-term national debt \nhas topped $16 trillion a couple weeks ago. That is a figure that is \nalmost impossible to wrap your mind around. But I think you can wrap \nyour mind around this: Each one of us who lives in this great country \nis now in debt $50,700, every man, woman, and child.\n  Sixteen trillion dollars is roughly the same as our country's entire \neconomic output for the first time in 40 years. The last time our debt \nwas 100 percent of GDP was right after World War II. We were fighting \nto save our Nation, to save a society, to save a way of life. This has \nbeen self-inflicted, and we can't keep going on this way.\n  We have reached what the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility \nand Reform called the moment of truth. The report it prepared for the \nPresident almost 2 years ago--in fact, that was the title of its \nreport, The Moment of Truth. And while the commission faced the moment \nof truth with a comprehensive bipartisan plan for reducing our debt, \nCongress has yet to do so. Now is the time. We know how to fix things. \nCongress has done it before.\n  In the early 1990s, our economy was faltering because deficits and \ndebt were freezing capital. But Congress sent a signal to the market \nthat it was capable of being fiscally responsible. And it was. The \nresult was the longest economic expansion in history: the creation of \nover 22 million jobs and unprecedented wealth in America, with every \nincome bracket rising--every income bracket, not just the chosen few.\n  The budget framework put together by Congress and the White House led \nto the first balanced budget in generations and put our country on \ntrack to be debt free this year, in 2012. If we had stayed the course, \nwe would be debt free as a United States of America right now. Let me \nrepeat that. This year we would have been debt free.\n  But we got totally off track with tax cuts, two wars, and expansion \nof the prescription drug benefits for Medicare recipients--none of \nwhich was paid for. All great ideas, but none was paid for. And the 10-\nyear $5.6 trillion surplus forecast in 2001 has become a debt of more \nthan $16 trillion. That is a $22 trillion swing in less than a decade. \nIt is unbelievable. It is mind boggling.\n  But we can get back on track if we follow a simple formula, roughly \nthe same one the Bowles-Simpson debt commission recommended. We have to \ncurtail spending, we have to have a fair revenue stream, and we have \ngot to look at cutting the fat; and, to do that, an overhaul of our tax \nsystem so it is not only more equitable for everyone but also \nencourages the kind of entrepreneurship that makes our country the \nbedrock of the global economy.\n  In America, we need a tax system where everybody pays their fair \nshare, and where American businesses are free to do what they do best: \noutproduce, and outinnovate competitors all around the world. To keep a \nbright future, we have to reform our entitlement programs so we can \npreserve the benefits. There is serious trouble ahead if we don't act.\n  Think about this. In 2016, Social Security disability is basically \ninsolvent; 2024, Medicare insolvent; 2033, Social Security will only be \nable to deliver 75 cents on the dollar, a 25-percent discount.\n  The American people are hungry for plain talk on our debt. That is \nwhy a few weeks ago in Charleston, WV, we hosted Senator Alan Simpson \nand White House Chief of Staff under Bill Clinton Erskine Bowles. They \npacked the house, and they spoke the truth. What they were saying is, \ngive the American people the facts, show them the options the way we \ndid at our fiscal summit, and they will do their part to get our \ncountry back on the right track. They always have. That is what makes \nthis country so great.\n  So don't sell the United States of America short. Don't sell the \nAmerican people short because this is an election year. They can tell \nwhen you are dealing straight with them or when you are playing \npolitics. Right now, there is no more time to play politics.\n  In fact, I got a letter yesterday from James of Clarksburg, WV, \ntalking about the summit. Here is what he said.\n\n       It is time for responsible Members of the Senate like you \n     to take to the floor and tell your fellow Senators, ``It is \n     past time for us to take responsible action to address the \n     fiscal crisis which is our responsibility to the people who \n     sent us here--because it is just that. There is no excuse for \n     delaying action until after the election.\n\n  No excuse to delay it just because of an election.\n  James got it exactly right; there is no time to waste. I am not \nnaive. I understand some of the choices we face are going to be hard \nfor some of us to make. I know Republicans don't want to talk about new \nrevenue, and I know Democrats don't want to talk about entitlement \nreform. But we need to start thinking more about the next generation \nthan of ourselves, or the next generation than the next news cycle or \nthe next flight out of Washington.\n  Millions of Americans are struggling in this tough economy, working \novertime to pay their bills, find a job, and find a way forward for \ntheir families. They are looking to us for the leadership they need. \nThey are looking to us for solutions. They are looking to us to come \ntogether and do what is best for the country in a balanced and \npractical way. They are simply looking to us to do our job, and I \nintend to do that to the best of my ability.\n  Winston Churchill once said: You can always count on Americans to do \nthe right thing--after they have tried everything else.\n  I think we have tried everything else, including kicking the can down \nthe road 12 times before. Now it is time for us to do the right thing. \nThis temporary step is the wrong thing at the wrong time. We have work \nleft to do, and we need to stay and do it. The people of America expect \nus to do better, to stand up for them, to put politics aside. The \npeople of West Virginia can be assured that I will always stand, and I \nwill continue to try to do the best that I possibly can for them and \nfor the people of this great country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan).

Madam President, this week the conservation community \nmourns the passing of a great American leader, a passionate individual, \nand an inspiration and friend to many, Russell Errol Train.\n  President Nixon first named Russell Train as Under Secretary of the \nDepartment of the Interior and then as the first Chairman of the new \nWhite House Council on Environmental Quality from 1970 to 1973. Russ \nTrain then became the Administrator of the EPA, serving there from 1973 \nto 1977. He was at the forefront of the legislation that became the \nbedrock of our country's environmental policy: the Clean Air Act, the \nSafe Drinking Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Toxic \nSubstances Control Act--laws that keep the American public safe and \nthat protect our American natural resources.\n  His desire to protect wildlife and habitat predated these years of \npublic service. He founded the Wildlife Conservation Foundation in 1959 \nand then the African Wildlife Foundation. When\n\n[[Page S6494]]\n\nthe World Wildlife Fund was established in the United States, he became \nits first President.\n  This week the World Wildlife Fund U.S. CEO Carter Roberts described \nRussell Train as ``a true national treasure and an inspiration to all \nof us who embrace conservation as their life's work.''\n  Mr. Roberts went on to say:\n\n       Undoubtedly, Russ would prefer that we not spend a lot of \n     time mourning his passing. He would want us to redouble our \n     efforts to save the animals and places we care about, to \n     solve the problems of climate change and resource scarcity, \n     and to build leadership capacity in those countries where it \n     is needed most.\n\n  So it is with his legacy in mind that I come to the Senate floor \ntoday, as I try to do every week, to discuss climate change, the \nscience behind it, and the reality of the changes we are already \nseeing. This week I will focus on how the carbon pollution that is \ncausing these climate changes is also affecting our oceans and causing \nan equally threatening problem--ocean acidification.\n  Sea water absorbs carbon dioxide; and when it does, chemical \nreactions occur that change the concentration of carbonate and hydrogen \nions in a process that lowers the pH of sea water, commonly referred to \nas ocean acidification.\n  Since the Industrial Revolution, we have burned carbon-rich fuels in \nmeasurable and ever-increasing amounts, now up to 7 to 8 gigatons each \nyear. We have raised the average parts per million of CO2 in \nour atmosphere from 280 parts to 390. By the way, the range for carbon \ndioxide in our atmosphere for the last, say, 8,000 centuries has been \n170-300 parts per million. So we are well outside of that range. \nIndeed, in the Arctic, measurements have already reached 400 parts per \nmillion.\n  The oceans of the Earth have absorbed more than 550 billion tons of \ncarbon dioxide from the atmosphere. That is approximately 30 percent of \nall of our carbon dioxide emissions. The good news is that absorbing \nall this carbon has significantly reduced the greenhouse gas levels in \nour atmosphere. The bad news is that because of all this carbon \nabsorption, the ocean pH has changed globally, representing a nearly \n30-percent increase in the acidity of the ocean. By the end of the \ncentury, ocean pH is predicted to change further, leading to a 160-\npercent increase in acidity.\n  This is where we are so far. This is what is projected. This rate of \nchange in ocean acidity is already thought to be faster than anytime in \nthe past 50 million years. A paper published in Science this year \nconcluded that the current rate of CO2 emissions could drive \nchemical changes in the ocean unparalleled in at least the last 300 \nmillion years.\n  The authors of that Science study in March warned that we may be \n``entering an unknown territory of marine ecosystem change.'' As the pH \nof sea water drops, so does the saturation of calcium carbonate, a \ncompound critical to marine life for the construction of their shells \nand skeletons. Some organisms absorb calcium and carbonate directly \nright out of the water, others out of the food they ingest, but changes \nin the concentrations of these chemicals mean the building blocks \nbecome less available to make the shells of species such as oysters, \ncrabs, lobsters, corals and the plankton that comprise the very base of \nthe food web.\n  As oceans get more acidic, it gets harder and harder for these \nimportant species to thrive, and it puts at risk the economies that \ndepend on these species.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate very much my friend from Rhode Island \nyielding, and I appreciate his focusing attention on something we do \nnot focus on nearly enough--and that is a gross understatement--and \nthat is our oceans. I admire the work he has done in so many different \nareas. We thought we had a path forward to do some good for oceans. It \ndid not work out the way Senator Whitehouse and I wanted. We will come \nback again because we have to do something about oceans. We study \neverything else but not our oceans, and most everything else depends on \nwhat happens in the ocean.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6494-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6494-S6495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we currently have 17 district judges on \nthe calendar, 14 reported by voice vote. For the people within the \nsound of my voice, what that means is they are not controversial. \nTwelve will fill judicial emergencies. These are places around the \ncountry where we have judges who are tremendously overworked on these \nimportant cases.\n  We have heard this kind of joke: What are you trying to do, make a \nFederal case out of it? What that means is the Federal system is so \ngood that people look at it as being the best there is as far as \njudicial activity.\n  I am disappointed to say my Republican friends on the other side have \ninformed me they will not agree on votes on any of these nominees. \nRepublicans can offer no reason for blocking these bipartisan consensus \ndistrict court nominees. I understand why they didn't want us to do \ncircuit courts--I understand that. I may disagree, but I understand \nthat because Democrats have set boundaries in the past, as when we \nwould no longer accept circuit court judges. But this is district court \njudges.\n  Historically, the Senate has considered district court nominees as \nlate as October in Presidential election years. In the past five \nPresidential election years, Democrats have never blocked a district \ncourt nominee from receiving a vote on the Senate floor, never. But our \nRepublican colleagues are setting new standards for obstruction, not \nonly in all the legislation but in judges.\n  For the 28 district court nominees we have considered this year, I \nfiled cloture 19 times. In other words, we have had to break a \nRepublican filibuster on 67 percent of the district judges we have \nconsidered and confirmed. President Obama's district court nominees \nhave been forced to wait 300 percent more than President Bush's \nnominees; three times more. Only two people whom the President \nnominated this year have been confirmed. The kind of qualified \nconsensus nominees who in years past would have been confirmed in a \nmatter of minutes are now taking weeks and months, languishing with no \naction. These votes should be routine.\n  There should not be a fight that delays action on important job \nmeasures. In September 2008, right before the last Presidential \nelection, Democrats confirmed 10 of President Bush's district court \nnominees in 1 day. More than half of the Nation's population, 160 \nmillion Americans, live in the part of the country where there has been \na judicial emergency declared. That means more than half the people in \nthis country seek justice from courts and judges that are strained to \nthe breaking point under a backlog so intense an emergency has been \ndeclared.\n  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, of course, knows I am here. \nHe wants to be on the Senate floor, but the time did not work. He has \ndone a remarkably good job getting the judges out. With 1 out of every \n10 Federal judgeships standing vacant, Americans can no longer wait on \nfair and speedy trials, and that is what they have to do. They cannot \nrely on them.\n  Republicans should work with Democrats to confirm consensus district \ncourt nominees now. Refusing to do so is irresponsible. The Senate \ncould act today and put highly qualified judges on the Federal bench, \njudges supported by both Democrats and Republicans.\n  I hope we can get something done before we leave. I don't want to \nfile cloture on these nominees before the end of the year. It is not \nthe way we should be working around here. We should be working \ntogether.\n  I have a consent request. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations: \nCalendar Nos. 674, 675, 676, 760, 761, 762, 818, 828, 829, 830, 832, \n833, 834, 835, 875, 876, and 877; that the nominations be confirmed; \nthe motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, \nwith no intervening action or debate and that no further motions be in \norder to any further nominations; that any statements relating to the \nnominations be printed in the Record.\n  Further, Madam President, before you rule, we have the gamut. We have \nCalifornia, Utah, Connecticut, Maryland, Florida, Oklahoma, Michigan,\n\n[[Page S6495]]\n\nNew York, and Pennsylvania. That is a classic, these two Pennsylvania \njudges.\n  During the August recess the Republican Senator from Pennsylvania \nsaid that I am the reason the two judges from Pennsylvania have not \nbeen confirmed.\n  Try that one on for logic. He actually said publicly that I was the \nreason that Matthew Brann and Edward Mannion are not being confirmed, \nthat it is my fault.\n  Madam President, I will finish this consent request: that the \nnominations be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative \nsession.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, it is quite curious that my friend \nthe majority leader is complaining about the one area I can think of \nover the last year and a half where the Senate has met historic norms. \nIn other words, we have handled judicial confirmations in this Congress \nhere in the Senate in a way that meets and in some ways exceeds \nhistoric norms. At the same time, of course, we have not done all the \nother things we have normally done in the past.\n  So far during this Presidential election year, we have confirmed 5 \ncircuit court nominees and 29 district court nominees. That is a good \nrecord for Presidential election years. Let me look at a few. In 1996 \nwe confirmed 18 district court nominees. This year we have confirmed \n29. In 2000 we confirmed 31, in 2004 we confirmed 30, and in 2008, the \nlast year of President Bush's tenure, only 24 district court nominees \nwere confirmed. In fact, in 2008 Senate Democrats treated President \nBush's nominees so badly that they were forced to confirm--as the \nmajority leader bragged about--10 nominees in September of that year \njust to try to catch up to historical norms. So rather than bragging \nabout doing 10 on 1 day, the reason they did 10 on 1 day is because \nthey were so pathetically below historic norms they had to do 10 on 1 \nday so as to not be embarrassed by the process. If they had not done \nthat, the Senate would have confirmed only 14 district court nominees \nin 2008, which is fewer than half the 29 we have already confirmed this \nyear.\n  President Obama is also faring much better overall than President \nBush did in his second term, which is the last time the Senate \nconsidered and confirmed two Supreme Court nominees. The reason I bring \nthat up is because Supreme Court nominees take a lot of time and \neffort. President Obama, of course, did have two Supreme Court nominees \nconfirmed during his first term.\n  So far the Senate has confirmed 158 of President Obama's judicial \nnominees. Compare that to President Bush's second term when the Senate \nconfirmed only 122 of his judicial nominees. President Obama has had \n158 confirmed; while President Bush had only 122 confirmed. So the \nSenate has confirmed one-third more judicial nominees than it did the \nlast time it had to process two Supreme Court nominees.\n  Not only is President Obama being treated fairly in absolute terms, \nbut the Senate is also treating him fairly relative to the number of \nnominees he has submitted. So far during President Obama's term, the \nSenate has confirmed 158 of his 205 nominees. That is a confirmation \nrate of 77 percent. By contrast, President Bush got only 74 percent of \nhis nominees during his first term.\n  The contrast is even more revealing when we compare President Obama \nto President Bush's second term. During that term, President Bush got \nonly 61 percent of his nominees confirmed. Again, President Obama got \n77 percent of his nominees confirmed versus President Bush's 61 \npercent.\n  Now we are trying to get consent agreements to process the next two \ndistrict court nominations that are in the queue, and we are hoping \nthat will come about. That is the procedure we have been following. I \nam hopeful we can achieve that. If we do, we will have confirmed 31 \ndistrict court nominees this year, which will equal the record for the \nmost district court confirmations in a Presidential election year in \nrecent memory. So whether it is looked at in terms of absolute \nconfirmations or relative confirmations, this President is being \ntreated very fairly.\n  I am happy to work with the majority leader, but we cannot allow the \nmajority to jam us here at the end of this session; therefore, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am not going to prolong this much, but I \nwould say this: No matter how we try to juggle the numbers, we still \nhave 12 emergencies. I hope my friends on the other side would at least \nlook at some of those emergencies and see if we could get some help for \nthose beleaguered judges out there and the court personnel. It wasn't \nuntil May 7 of this year that we were able to vote on our first nominee \nfor this year. They were all from last year that we did before that. I \nhope everyone understands we have 12 judicial emergencies. If some of \nthese nominations were confirmed, it would take that away and make life \nfor the court system much more fair.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, there is no way to spin the math. \nPresident Obama has been treated quite fairly every way we look at it. \nHe has certainly met the historical norms with the treatment of \nPresidents in Presidential years. I rest my case.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given \n3 minutes, the Senator from Indiana be given 3 minutes, and the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island then be able to continue his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I wanted to follow up on the Democratic \nand Republican leaders' conversation. This is not the first time we \nhave seen obstruction for obstruction's sake over noncontroversial, \nconsensus nominees to the Federal bench. It has been going on for 4 \nyears.\n  In 2008 we cleared all 10 of President Bush's district court nominees \npending on the floor by unanimous consent. Now, of course, we are being \nblocked. Well, I don't think Oliver Wendell Holmes could get unanimous \nconsent from our Republican colleagues to be a district court judge \ntoday.\n  In the Western District of New York, nominee Frank Geraci has total \nbipartisan support. His slot has been vacant for years. We need him to \nfill that judicial emergency post. His nomination has been pending on \nthe floor for more than 2 months. Why can't we confirm him today? He \npassed the Judiciary Committee unanimously with strong bipartisan \nsupport.\n  In the Southern District, another nominee, Lorna Schofield, has also \nbeen awaiting confirmation for 2 months. She also has complete and \ntotal bipartisan support. What is more, she would be the first Filipana \nconfirmed to the Federal bench. The Southern District is one of the \nbusiest benches in the country, and the judges hear among the most \nimportant cases, such as complex civil litigation, insider trading, \nterrorism. You name it, they do it. Why can't we confirm her today?\n  We hear one excuse after another for filibustering judges--recess \nappointments, funding for some area unrelated to judges, the so-called \nThurmond rule, which has never applied to district court nominees.\n  I support the majority leader's motion for unanimous consent for \nthese pending district court nominees, and I hope our colleagues will \nthink about it. Before we leave this week, I hope we can come together \nand do what we have been doing together for decades--confirm \nuncontroversial judges.\n  I yield the floor and yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, yesterday Senator Landrieu, chairman of \nthe Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee, and I entered a \ncolloquy into the Record, and I would like to explain very briefly what \nit was we were attempting to do.\n  This is essentially to clarify a provision regarding cyber security \nthat is incorporated in the continuing resolution, which we will be \ntaking up here shortly. I understand there has been\n\n[[Page S6496]]\n\nconfusion over section 137 as to whether the language that is now \nincorporated in the CR expands DHS authority or allows implementation \nof a potential Executive order pertaining to cyber security. The answer \nto that question is no, absolutely not. The provision is limited to \nfunding improvements in the Federal Network Security Program, which \nprovides security systems that monitor cyber attacks on Federal \nGovernment computer networks. It helps enhance the protection for those \nexisting networks that are in place.\n  It is important that both the House and Senate homeland security \nappropriations bills included this additional funding, and it is \nconsidered so critical, it was added to the continuing resolution so \nthat this implementation can continue without interruption. It does so \nbecause these networks are constantly under attack by individuals and \ngroups and others who could cause real problems and real harm to our \ncountry.\n  So let me be very clear on the language that has been agreed on in a \nbipartisan basis and what the colloquy said. This provision does not \nintrude upon the authorizers' jurisdiction. This provision does not \nhave anything to do with the regulation of private sector \ninfrastructure. DHS has confirmed that in writing. And this provision \ndoes not enable a new Executive order in any way. I would be the first \nto object to this language if that were the case, and I believe we have \nnow remedied any confusion that might exist over that particular \nlanguage.\n  I am hopeful that even though we were not able to ultimately pass and \nincorporate workable cyber protection language, that we can continue to \nwork together.\n  I wish to thank the chair of the Appropriations Homeland Security \nSubcommittee, Senator Landrieu, for joining me and clarifying this \nimportant provision included in the continuing resolution.\n  With that, I wish to thank my colleague from Rhode Island for \nallowing me the time, and unfortunately his good presentation was \ninterrupted. I thank my colleague for the time to clarify that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am very happy to allow my \ncolleague from Indiana the time, and I appreciate his good work on \ncyber security and hope that he and I and others can work toward a \nlegislative solution on that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6496-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6496-S6497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. My topic had been the acidification of our oceans as \na result of carbon pollution now up 30 percent in acidity and projected \nto increase 160 percent in acidity at unprecedented rates in millions \nof years. It has been 50 to 300 million years since we have seen this \nkind of dramatic change in ocean acidity. For species that use calcium \ncarbonate to create their shells and skeletons, such as oysters, crabs, \nlobsters, and the little plankton that so many other species depend on \nas the base of the food chain, it becomes harder for these species to \nthrive.\n  These unprecedented changes I am talking about in ocean acidity are \nnot happening alone, they are happening on top of dramatically changing \nocean temperature that is also driven by carbon pollution.\n  Just this week on the surface of the Earth, we experienced one of the \nhottest summers on record. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration released this statement about the northeast shelf large \nmarine ecosystem, which extends from the Gulf of Maine down to Cape \nHatteras. Here is what they said:\n\n       During the first 6 months of 2012, sea surface temperatures \n     . . . were the highest ever recorded. Above average \n     temperatures were found in all parts of the ecosystem, from \n     the ocean bottom to the sea surface and across the region . . \n     . The annual 2012 spring plankton bloom was intense, started \n     earlier and lasted longer than average. This has implications \n     for marine life from the smallest creatures to the largest \n     marine mammals, like whales. Atlantic cod continued to shift \n     northeastward from its historic distribution center.\n\n  I don't need to tell anybody in the Northeast how important the \nstability of the cod fishery is right now. That historic fishery is \nfacing significant reductions in catch limits because the population is \nnot rebounding as expected from the reduced catches that fishermen are \nalready contributing to try to solve this problem. Something is causing \nthat failure to rebound, and the unprecedented environmental changes \noccurring in the ecosystem can't be overlooked as the culprit behind \nthis unexplained phenomenon of failure to rebound.\n  NOAA cited a 2009 study published in Marine Ecology Progress Series \nthat analyzed survey data in the region from 1987 to 2007. It found \nthat about half of 36 fish stocks evaluated have been shifting \nnorthward for the past four decades, with some disappearing from U.S. \nwaters as they move farther offshore.\n  In Narragansett Bay, in my home State of Rhode Island, average water \ntemperatures have increased by 4 degrees. This amounts to an ecosystem \nshift. In fact, the bay, once dominated by bottom-dwelling fish, such \nas winter flounder, is now more populated by open-water species, such \nas squid and butterfish.\n  Let's look at winter flounder a little bit more closely. In the \n1960s, the biomass of winter flounder in Narragansett Bay was as high \nas 4,500 metric tons. By 2011, it was down to just about 900. This is \nthe total estimated biomass on the blue line. The red line is the \nlandmass. That is what the fishermen were able to catch and bring in. \nAs my colleagues can see, it went from 1,000 metric tons up to 2,000 \nmetric tons and then, over time, it sagged and returned to 2,000 metric \ntons, and now it is left to virtually zero. This was a very productive \nfishery for Rhode Island fishermen and it is now virtually gone.\n  Past overfishing had a role to play, but so too has the dramatic \ntemperature change and the stock's ability to recover is made all the \nmore difficult by ongoing temperature change as well as acidification.\n  The changes facing our oceans do not stop at higher temperatures and \ngreater acidity. I wish they did. But as average global temperatures \nrise, water expands. Water expands as it gets warmer, and new fresh \nwater pours out of the snowpack and ice sheets of Antarctica and \nGreenland. Long-term data from tide gauges in our traditional sailing \nport of Newport, RI, show an increase in average sea level of nearly 10 \ninches since 1930. At these tide gauges, measurements show that the \nrate of sea-level rise has increased in the past two decades compared \nto the rate over the last century. The increase is not just happening, \nit is speeding up. This is consistent with reports that since 1990, sea \nlevel has been rising faster than the rate predicted by scientific \nmodels used to generate the IPCC estimates.\n  Global predictions for sea-level rise range from 20 to 39 inches by \nthe year 2100, with recent studies showing that the numbers could be \neven higher than that due to greater than expected melting of glaciers \nand ice sheets.\n  Our Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council has used these \npredictions to estimate that by 2100, the sea level in Rhode Island \ncould rise approximately 2 to 5 feet. For our coastal ocean State, that \nis a dramatic threat.\n  Sea-level rise and the increase in storm surges that will accompany \nit threaten at-risk coastal areas, whose roads, powerplants, wastewater \ntreatment plants, and public facilities may need to be reinforced or \nrelocated.\n  The natural environment there--estuaries, marshes, and barrier \nislands--has a role. They act as natural filtration systems and they \nact as buffers against storms, and they are being inundated by rising \nseas. In Rhode Island, local erosion rates doubled from 1990 on to \n2006. Some of the freshwater wetlands near our coast are already \ntransforming themselves into salt marsh as a result of this inundation.\n  Our Coastal Resources Management Council has documented places such \nas a beach in South Kingstown, where 160 feet of shoreline has been \nlost to erosion since 1951 at a rate of 3 feet per year.\n  In the small but vibrant coastal community of Matunuck, beaches have \neroded 20 feet over the past 12 years. The town faces difficult \ndecisions as the only road connecting the community and its restaurants \nand businesses\n\n[[Page S6497]]\n\nis protected by less than a dozen feet of sand. The road provides \naccess for emergency vehicles and it lies on top of the water main. \nThese are not easy concerns for communities with limited resources and \nlives and livelihoods at risk.\n  Geo-engineering solutions have been theorized to keep the temperature \nof the planet in check as a result of global climate change by blocking \nin various ways the heat of the Sun. These notions may seem somewhat \nfarfetched, but even given that, they will not stop the chemical \nprocess of acidification of our oceans. Only curbing global carbon \ndioxide emissions can do that.\n  Sadly, our government in Washington these days responds more to \ndollars than to truth, and the dirty energy dollars are on the march \nthis campaign season. Over the weekend, the New York Times analyzed 138 \nenergy-related campaign ads aired on television. It estimated that over \n$153 million has been spent this year to promote coal, argue for more \noil and gas drilling, and to attack clean energy. With nearly 7 weeks \nto go before this Presidential election, 2012 ads promoting fossil \nfuels are nearly 150 percent higher than 4 years ago, and that is with \n7 weeks to go, the peak buying season.\n  Other disturbing details emerged from the New York Times article. \nGovernor Romney, his PAC, and the RNC have received at least $13 \nmillion in campaign contributions from fossil fuel industry executives \nor related groups. Governor Romney has accepted $3 million in \ncontributions from Oxbow, a coal company controlled by William Koch, a \nbrother of David Koch.\n  Nature could not be giving us clearer warnings. Whatever higher power \ngave us our advanced human capacity for perception, calculation, \nanalysis, deduction, and foresight has laid out before us more than \nenough information to make the right decisions. These God-given human \ncapacities provide us everything we need to act responsibly if only we \nwill.\n  But the polluting special interests appear to rule here. The party of \nTheodore Roosevelt, the great conservationist; the party of President \nNixon, who founded the EPA; the party of John Chafee of Rhode Island, \nwho was instrumental in the passage of the Clean Water Act and the \nClean Air Act; and the party of Russell Train who, as I mentioned \nearlier, died this week at the age of 92 after a distinguished career \nin environmental protection in the Republican Party--that party has now \nbecome the servant and handmaiden--perhaps ``paid consort'' would be a \nbetter way to say it given the money involved--of polluting special \ninterests.\n  All of this money can alter how Congress behaves, and all of this \nmoney can influence the laws we pass, but the laws of nature are not \nsubject to repeal no matter how much special interest money flows into \ncampaign coffers. The laws of chemistry don't care about the \nfilibuster. The laws of physics don't care how Senators vote. Nature \nwill work its will and one day there will be an accounting.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill).

Madam President, this week the leader of the \nRepublican Party--their candidate for President--was seen in a video \nspeaking at a fundraising meeting with wealthy campaign donors in \nFlorida. In the privacy of the event, Mitt Romney spilled to the donors \nthere what he really thinks about nearly half of the American people. \nThat is almost 150 million people. He disparagingly said 47 percent of \nAmericans support President Obama simply because they do not owe \nFederal income taxes or they are getting benefits from a government \nprogram.\n  Just to make sure there is no misquote here, this is Mitt Romney's \nstatement. He said:\n\n       There are 47 percent who are with him--\n\n  ``Him'' being President Obama\n\n     who are dependent on government, who believe that they are \n     victims. . . . my job--\n\n  Mitt Romney says--\n\n     is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them \n     that they should take personal responsibility and care for \n     their lives.\n\n  This is coming from the leader of the Republican Party, a man who is \nrunning to represent every American--all 310 million--from the Nation's \nhighest office. These comments are disturbing coming from anybody, but \ncoming from him they are a disgrace. In plain English, he says that if \nyou do not pay Federal income tax or you receive a government benefit, \nthen you do not take responsibility personally for your life.\n  So who are these 47 percent for whom Mitt Romney and his Republican \nfriends feel such contempt? They are parents who work hard every day to \ngive their families a better future. They are seniors who helped build \nthis country and now depend on Social Security to keep food on the \ntable. They are veterans who risked their lives in Iraq or Afghanistan. \nAs it says on this chart, ``Who Mitt Romney Says Doesn't `Take Personal \nResponsibility And Care For Their Lives.' '' Working families with \nchildren, senior citizens, veterans. Mitt Romney seems to think they \nare a bunch of lazies just taking money from the wealthy. So today I \nwant to take a closer look at some of these Americans who Mitt Romney \nsays do not take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\n  Let's first look at working families. He says:\n\n       I'll never convince them that they should take personal \n     responsibility and care for their lives.\n\n  What kind of contemptuous statement is that? We are talking about \nnearly 150 million people.\n  Millions of parents across the country work long hours, struggling to \nput food on the table and clothes on their children's back. A family of \nfour making as much as $46,000 a year often will not owe any Federal \nincome taxes. So these families would be part of the 47 percent of \nAmericans whom Mitt Romney accuses of being lazy and irresponsible. \nThese families deserve our support, not our scorn. They did not ask \nanybody for a handout, and they certainly do not deserve Romney's \ncondemnation.\n  Let's now look at another group of Americans who by Mitt Romney's \ndefinition are victims who do not take responsibility for their lives: \nsenior citizens.\n  More than half of those who do not pay Federal income or payroll \ntaxes are senior citizens on fixed incomes. He says, ``I will never \nconvince them that they should take personal responsibility and care \nfor their lives.'' People showing some age, they ought to take personal \nresponsibility for their lives. Romney seems to think that because \nthese seniors depend on Social Security they are not willing to take \npersonal responsibility for their lives. Mitt Romney has no business \nlecturing these people, these Americans about personal responsibility.\n  These seniors worked, paid taxes their whole lives, fought to defend \nour Nation's freedom, and built the greatest middle class the world has \never known. It is Mitt Romney who needs a lesson from them about \npersonal responsibility.\n  Let's look at another group of Americans that Romney has dismissed, \ntroops and veterans. When we send our troops into harm's way, their \ncombat pay is not taxed. When veterans come back injured, physically \nand emotionally, we don't ask them to pay taxes on their disability \nbenefits. Should they pay taxes on these benefits in order to be \nhonorable in Mitt Romney's eyes?\n  I believe they have already given their country more than their \nshare. If you look at this picture, it tells you so much. In that hug a \nreturning veteran gets, glad to see his family, they are glad to see \nhim standing straight, able to communicate. Romney says, ``I can never \nconvince them that they should take personal responsibility and care \nfor their lives.'' Imagine that, for him to make statements such as \nthat to include veterans. We give our veterans government benefits that \nthey earn through their service. They get education benefits tax free \nunder a new GI bill. Many receive health care from the VA and some get \nhousing assistance.\n\n[[Page S6498]]\n\nNever convince them that they should take personal responsibility and \ncare for their lives?\n  What would Mitt Romney say to veterans who do not owe Federal income \ntaxes or receive a government benefit? We have seen the tape. He says: \nThey are victims who could never be convinced to take personal \nresponsibility for their lives. Mitt Romney must have known many who \nserved in Vietnam during his period of maturity. Did he think of them \nwho served in Vietnam as not doing their share, not taking personal \nresponsibility?\n  I am a veteran. I take offense at that. These men and women risked \neverything fighting for our freedoms and our rights, and we ought to do \neverything we can to support them. These heroes know a great deal more \nthan Mitt Romney about personal responsibility and sacrifice. Mitt \nRomney was simply saying what many in today's Republican Party truly \nbelieve. He has pulled back the curtain on their agenda. He has \nrevealed the stark choice facing the American people. America deserves \nbetter than a Presidential candidate who dismisses the contribution \nthat half--47 percent, to be more precise--of our fellow Americans \nmake--they get derision and disrespect. That is hardly appropriate for \na Presidential candidate to be saying.\n  He, after all, seeks the job that puts him in charge of the whole 310 \nmillion people in America. And yet he has the audacity to say these \npeople are not worthy of honor, worthy of thanks, worthy of their \ncontribution to this country? All this time it was thought that Mitt \nRomney just did not get it. But it turns out worse than that. He just \ndoes not care. He knows what he is saying, and he says it deliberately. \nHe just does not care.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6498-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6498-S6499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I wanted to come to the floor today to \nspeak on a different subject, which is to demonstrate my support for \nthe Sportsmen's package compiled by Senator Tester from Montana. I know \nthe bill was discussed on the floor last night and the request to pass \nthis package of bipartisan bills was objected to, which is horribly \nunfortunate. I hope we are going to have the opportunity to vote on the \nmeasure before we leave town.\n  Sportsmen and women are an essential part of the fabric of our \ncountry, the fabric of my home State of Colorado. This community \nsupports millions of jobs and contributes billions of dollars annually \nto our economy, and they are often the drivers of our most important \nconservation initiatives across our rich landscape.\n  While serving on the Senate Agriculture Committee, I have enjoyed \nworking with sportsmen to craft a revamped conservation title in the \nfarm bill. Some people forget that the farm bill conservation title is \nthe largest single legislative vehicle for the programs and resources \nthat help us conserve private land all across this country, all across \nthe western United States. It enhances vital wildlife habitat across \nthe country. Sportsmen have always played a vital role in crafting that \nbipartisan title. That was exactly the way they participated this time \nas well.\n  While it is not the reason I am here today--I want to talk about \nSenator Tester's bill--I do want to take the chance to say once again \nthat in my view the House of Representatives ought to pass the 5-year \nfarm bill. We passed a bipartisan bill out of this Senate with well \nover 70 votes, Democrats and Republicans. On the committee we worked \ntogether for over 2 years to create the only bipartisan deficit \nreduction that has happened in this Congress in either the House or the \nSenate. We got rid of direct payments for producers, which was an \nimportant reform. We strengthened the conservation title, as I was \nsaying earlier. There is absolutely no reason the House should not pass \nthis bill.\n  Over the break, I traveled 2,500 miles around the State of Colorado, \nrural communities all over my State, and no one wanted to know what was \ngoing on in the Presidential election. No one wanted to talk about \nanything except why can't the farm bill get passed? There has never \nbeen a time in modern history that a committee in the House, in this \ncase the House Agriculture Committee, passed out a bill in a bipartisan \nway and it cannot even get to the floor for a vote. That has never \nhappened before. Something is wrong over there.\n  I can tell you that my farmers and ranchers in Colorado who are going \nthrough the worst drought in a generation want people to knock the \npolitics off and pass this bill. Bipartisan, it is real deficit \nreduction, and it is a good bill. We are doing an incredible \ndisservice, as I said to our farmers and ranchers, and also our \nsportsmen by failing to act on this bipartisan legislation.\n  There was a time in my life when I had the chance to live in Montana \nfor a brief time, Senator Tester's home State, and I thought of myself \nas a sportsman then. I used to fish a lot, chopped a lot of wood out \nthere. These days I spend a lot more time on airplanes and chasing my \nthree daughters to soccer games, but some day I will get back there. \nThat brings me to the importance of the package, this package for our \nNation's sportswomen and men. The provisions in Senator Tester's bill \nrepresent some of the best bipartisan ideas out there to promote \nhunting, fishing, and recreational access, bills from both sides of the \naisle that have been hanging around here for a long time and now need \nto get passed. The measure would require that 1.5 percent of annual \nLand and Water Conservation Funds go to provide public access to lands \nfor hunting and for fishing. I am a huge supporter of the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund. This provision builds on the fine legacy of \nthat program.\n\n  The bill also contains a provision that is homegrown from our \nsportsmen in Colorado. Section 103 provides certainty and parity for \nAmerica's bow hunters, that they can cross National Park Service land \nwith their bows to legally hunt nearby lands outside the park \nboundaries. This access is provided to hunters with firearms but not to \nhunters with bows.\n  I started working on this issue over 2 years ago when a Colorado bow \nhunter encountered a problem. After 14 years of trying, this particular \nhunter had finally drawn a license to hunt elk in the premium game unit \nin northwest Colorado. He scouted the unit, found the area he wanted to \nhunt and he was all set to go until Federal officials told him he could \nnot cross a narrow strip, a very narrow strip, of Park Service land to \nhunt the BLM land next to it. This is despite the fact that hunters \nwith loaded firearms can cross Park Service land legally and without \napplying for a permit.\n  The problem with this particular hunter is what brought this issue to \nmy office. But the broader point of the provision is to provide access \nfor our sportsmen and women. We know that we lose thousands of acres of \nland every day to development, some of it important wildlife habitat. \nWe need to provide all Americans reasonable access to the land that we \nhave set aside for preservation and wildlife habitat, bow hunters \nincluded.\n  That is why I was pleased to increase funding for the Voluntary \nPublic Access Program when we marked up the farm bill. That is why I am \nproud to have worked with Senator Tester to include this provision in \nhis package that I hope we will be voting on soon.\n  The bow hunting provision was carefully tailored to ensure that \nhunting of wildlife within Park Service boundaries remains illegal. Yet \nthe measure still provides reasonable access, which is so important to \nthe sportsmen in Colorado and across the country.\n  I have received a letter of support for the Bennet-Tester bow hunting \nfrom Colorado stakeholder groups across the spectrum, including the \nColorado Wildlife Federation, the Rocky Mountain Bighorn Sheep Society, \nPheasants Forever, and the Bull Moose Sportsmen's Alliance, and the \nlist goes on. I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 December 7, 2011.\n     Hon. Michael Bennet,\n     Senator of Colorado, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bennet: The Credit Card Accountability \n     Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, PL 111-24, \n     permitted concealed carry in the National Parks System\n\n[[Page S6499]]\n\n     and National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS). NPS regulations \n     to implement the concealed carry provisions of PL 111-24 \n     became effective on February 10, 2010 and included all \n     firearms legal in the jurisdiction in which the park was \n     located. Park Service regulations continue to exclude bow and \n     arrows in the National Parks. In some locations this \n     effectively limits bowhunter access to hunt other adjacent \n     BLM, USFS or private lands that are otherwise open to hunting \n     and can now be legally accessed through NPS or NWRS lands by \n     firearms hunters.\n       36 CFR 2.4 d 4 allows the possibly of permitting for such \n     access through NPS lands where it is otherwise impossible or \n     impractical to make other access except through NPS lands. In \n     2009 one such request for permitting for Dinosaur National \n     Monument was denied by the Park Superintendent, effectively \n     denying practical bowhunter access to some BLM and state \n     school lands. Firearms hunters may now access these lands \n     across NPS lands without any requirement for permitting.\n       Similar access issues occur in several of Colorado's game \n     management units bounding on Dinosaur National Monument. \n     These situations likely occur at many National Parks and \n     National Monuments both in Colorado and other states. \n     Attempts to rectify this situation through an administrative \n     rule making process in the Department of the Interior have \n     been denied.\n       The undersigned sportsmen, representing several major \n     sportsmen's groups and retailers in Colorado request that, \n     barring any change in the DOI stance, legislative action be \n     taken to give bowhunters with archery equipment equal rights \n     in crossing NPS and NWRS as that enjoyed by those carrying \n     firearms.\n           Sincerely,\n         Tim Mauck & Gaspar Perricone, Co-founders, Bull Moose \n           Sportsmen's Alliance; Ivan James, Vice-Chairman for \n           Legislation, Colorado Bowhunters Association; Robert \n           Ong, President, Rocky Mountain Bighorn Sheep Society; \n           John Smeltzer, President, Colorado Wildlife Federation; \n           Dean Derby, President, Colorado Traditional Archery \n           Society; Bob Hewson, Executive Director, Colorado Youth \n           Outdoors; Robert Hix, Colorado Regional Director, \n           Pheasants Forever, Inc.; Joel Webster, Director--Center \n           for Western Lands, Theodore Roosevelt Conservation \n           Partnership; John & Kathy Tidwell, Owners, Bear Creek \n           Archery Inc; Michael Lewellen, President, Colorado \n           National Wild Turkey Federation; John Gale & David \n           Lien, Co-Chairs, Colorado Back Country Hunters and \n           Anglers.\n\n  Mr. BENNET. The overall sporstmen's package from Senator Tester is \nalso widely supported, ranging from the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation \nPartnership to the Boone and Crocket Club to the National Rifle \nAssociation. The Tester bill represent a bipartisan package of \ncommonsense bills that will benefit our Nation's sports men and women. \nI want to thank Senator Tester for his leadership on behalf of the West \nand urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  I will simply close by saying it is my fervent hope that once this \nelection is over, some 45 days from now, we will come back to this \nChamber, Republicans and Democrats together, and work to avoid surfing \nover this fiscal cliff that will be so damaging to this economy.\n  People at home know something that people here have not yet figured \nout, which is even if you believe you are always right on your side or \nhad a monopoly of wisdom on your side--which I do not, but some people \nseem to--even if you believed it, we cannot accomplish this meaningful \ndeficit reduction without doing it in a bipartisan way. It is \nimpossible to do it without doing it in a bipartisan way.\n  People at home actually want to see it bipartisan, frankly, because \nthey do not believe in either party's go-it-alone strategy when it \ncomes to the debt and deficit. So my hope is this election will clear \nthe air, we will get back to work, and that before January we will have \nsomething convincing to say to the American public on this subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I see no colleagues have come to the \nfloor, so I want to speak on one additional topic. I will be brief, \nbecause I understand we likely won't have an opportunity to address \nthis issue before we leave town.\n  My colleague Senator Mark Udall and I have been working to provide \nresources for the USDA's Emergency Watershed Protection Program, also \nknown as EWP. The reason we have been doing this is that EWP resources \nhelp communities recover from wildfires, specifically watersheds that, \nafter being burned, are unstable and risk harm to critical drinking \nwater infrastructure and sometimes jeopardize human lives.\n  As many in this Chamber know, we had a number of devastating \nwildfires in Colorado this summer. In the communities of Fort Collins \nand Colorado Springs in particular, they are having trouble protecting \ntheir vital drinking water infrastructure as their watersheds recover. \nDespite a letter Senator Udall and I authored to the appropriators, the \nHouse version of the continuing resolution did not contain this \ncritical funding. That means the Senate won't be able to vote to help \nthese communities recover. And while we are disappointed, we are going \nto continue to fight for these resources.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6499-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6499-S6500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I see we have been joined by the Chair \nof the Agriculture Committee, Senator Stabenow. She has just arrived, \nbut I wanted to report to her that before she arrived I was talking \nabout the need to pass a farm bill and the fact that, over the break, I \nhad traveled 2,500 miles around the State of Colorado--in rural parts \nof our State on the west slope and on the eastern plains--and nobody \nwanted to talk about anything except why we can't get a farm bill \npassed. It makes no sense to them. They know it was completely \nbipartisan here in the Senate, and they know it is the only bipartisan \npiece of legislation with deficit reduction any committee of either \nChamber has been able to accomplish.\n  In the case of Colorado farmers and ranchers, we are going through \nthe worst drought we have had in a generation, and they want to know \nwhy Washington, DC, has a completely different set of priorities than \nthey have.\n  There is still time for the House to pass this bill. This is the \nfirst time in modern history a House Ag Committee has passed out a \nbill--in this case a bipartisan bill, though not as good, I don't \nthink, as ours, but a step forward--that hasn't come to the floor for a \nvote. They cannot even get a vote.\n  So while the Senator is here, I wanted to thank her, and I would also \nsay to the ranking member of the committee if he were here, for their \nextraordinary bipartisan effort over the last 2 years that resulted in \na very fine bill. I also think their work sets a model for the way we \nshould be approaching our work in this Chamber.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, first, I did come to the floor to talk \nabout the urgency of the farm bill, but I also want to thank my friend \nand colleague from Colorado, who chairs our conservation subcommittee, \nfor the tremendous piece of work on the conservation title in the farm \nbill. I thank him for all of that effort and also say to him I \nunderstand what is happening in Colorado. As he and I know, we passed \ndisaster assistance--a permanent livestock disaster assistance \nprogram--in our farm bill, along with help for food growers in Michigan \nand other places.\n  We are totally committed in the short run to helping those who have \nthe riskiest business in the world, which is farming and ranching in \nthis country, but we also know what they want is the economic certainty \nof a 5-year farm bill. So I thank my friend for all of his efforts and \nin coming to the floor.\n  I want to say, for the record, there are 10 days until September 30--\n10 days until the farm bill expires and 16 million people in this \ncountry who rely on agriculture for their jobs or their livelihood are \nput in limbo. That is the reality of where we are.\n  We worked so hard, on a bipartisan basis in the Senate, to pass a \nfarm bill,\n\n[[Page S6500]]\n\nand we did that as quickly as we could so the House would have time to \nact and we could actually get things done in the summer before we got \ninvolved in what would be happening in the fall, with all of the \ncritically important end-of-the-year issues that have to be addressed. \nSo we passed a bill in June, as we all know, on a bipartisan basis. It \ntook a lot of work.\n  I continually thank everyone who was willing to hang in there with us \nto get this done--my ranking member, Senator Roberts, and our two \nleaders for giving us the time to do this. We worked hard and we got it \ndone and we sent it to the House. Then the House committee went to work \nand they passed out a bipartisan bill. Never before, that I can \nremember--and I have been around here a while; this is my fourth farm \nbill--have we seen a situation where a bipartisan bill came out of \ncommittee and yet the House wouldn't take it up. They wouldn't take it \nup in July, the beginning of August, and wouldn't agree to allow us to \nnegotiate differences over the August break to come up with a way to \nget this done by the end of this month.\n  So here we are. The House is leaving today. The Senate is leaving \neither today or tomorrow or the next day, and there are 10 days left on \nthe clock to provide economic certainty for 16 million men and women \nwhose livelihoods come from agriculture. Many of these men and women \nwatched as their crops withered under the hot summer Sun this year, as \ndays and weeks went by without a drop of rain in the worst drought in \n50 years. Yet House Republicans are planning to leave without finishing \ntheir work on our farm bill. That is absolutely stunning to me.\n  The work we did in the Senate passed on a strong bipartisan vote. As \nI said before, the committee in the House put forward their bill on a \nstrong bipartisan vote. If nothing happens, in 10 days we begin to see \na transition over the next few months to what is called permanent law, \nwhich goes back to the 1940s.\n  We had over 90 different groups that came in last week. We had \nhundreds of farmers from around the country--farmers who got off their \ntractors, took their time at their own expense to fly in and say: Hey, \nwait a minute, When there is a job to do, you have to get it done. When \nthe crops are ready to harvest, you don't wait a month. You have to do \nwhat you have to do when it needs to be done.\n  That is exactly where we are right now. They just need to do it. I am \nconfident the chairman and the ranking member, working in a bipartisan \nway, could do this in 1 day. I really believe they could do this in 1 \nday. It is not as if there is a lot of other substantive work going on \nin the House. So 1 day. If they decided today: Okay, we are going to \nget this done before we leave, they would create a situation so our \nfarmers, who are planning for next year, who have to go in and sit down \nwith their banker, will know how to plan and what tools they have \navailable. These are people who have been hit hard, have been \ndevastated by disasters.\n  In every single one of the counties in Michigan, 83 out of 83 \ncounties, there has been a disaster declaration. They are looking at us \nand saying: Thank you for what the Senate did, but why won't the House \nact? And, frankly, I don't know why the House won't act. But they \nshould, because they are leaving an awful lot of people hanging.\n  We know the consequences of not acting are that we begin to unravel a \nset of policies that need to be in place for production agriculture, \nfor conservation, for local food systems, for energy, and for \nnutrition. We know also if we step up and do what we worked so hard to \ndo in the Senate we will get the added plus of $23 billion in deficit \nreduction. The only thing that has passed the Senate that has \nbipartisan deficit reduction is our farm bill.\n  We know we need to make reforms. That is why we eliminated four \ndifferent subsidies, moved to a risk-based, market-based system, based \non crop insurance providing tools for farmers to make sure they can \nmake their own planning decisions, not plant for government programs, \nbut make their own planning decisions and then have tools to support \nthem and to manage the risks that come. We certainly know now, because \nwe have seen this year, what kind of devastating risks may come for our \nfarmers and ranchers across the country.\n  I have gone through so many times what is in our farm bill that I \nwill not do that now, except to say we have more reform--in fact, the \nWall Street Journal said there is more reform in this farm bill than \nany in decades. We are proud of that. We have more in deficit reduction \nthan in anything else we have passed. We have policies for the future. \nWe have listened to farmers who said crop insurance is the most \nimportant thing for them in being able to manage their risk. We have \nfocused on local food systems, providing schools with the ability to \npurchase locally and support their local farmers. There are energy \nopportunities for the future and bio-based manufacturing, where we \ntruly can make things and grow things and grow the economy and grow the \nmiddle class of this country. There is rural development, where \nmillions of Americans live--for small towns, such as Clare, where I \ngrew up--with the ability to fund infrastructure--water, sewer, \nInternet--and have a business loan financed, and all those things that \ngo into rural development. We provide for telemedicine to create a \nquality of life and health for seniors and families.\n  All those things are involved in what we call the farm bill. All of \nthose things were passed in the Senate. We did what I believe the \nAmerican public wants us to do, and I certainly know people in Michigan \nwant us to do--to make tough decisions, to evaluate what works and what \ndoesn't work and to cut out the duplication. We eliminated over 100 \ndifferent programs and authorizations and we streamlined. That is what \nfolks want us to do, and we did it. Now it is time for the House to do \ntheir job.\n  The reality is, even though there are 10 days until the end of the \nmonth, the Speaker said they are going home with no action. So the real \nnumber is zero. We are out of time for farmers and ranchers and their \nfamilies, and, frankly, for all of us. If we are fortunate enough to \nhave lunch or breakfast today, we ought to care about the farm bill and \nthe people who provide us with the safest, most affordable, and \nabundant food in the world. That is what we do in this bill. We are \nproud of it. And the House of Representatives should be ashamed of \nthemselves for leaving town without supporting rural America.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for the last several days I have been \ntelling everyone that we needed to do a couple of things before we \nleave. We have to do the CR, and we have to do the sportsmen's package.\n  Mr. President, just a second on the sportsmen's package. If we flip \nthrough the dictionary and find the word ``bipartisan,'' part of that \ndefinition would be Tester's sportsmen's package because it is a \nRepublican and Democratic bill. It involves hunters, fishermen, and \nother sportsmen, including offroad vehicles. It is a very good piece of \nlegislation for a group of people who are totally unrecognized most of \nthe time. We are going to do those two things before we leave.\n  In order to bring us to that result, I will fill the tree and file \ncloture on the CR. Unless we get consent, the cloture vote on the CR \nwill occur sometime after midnight on Saturday, at 1 a.m. or \nthereabouts. Once we invoke cloture on the CR, the 30 hours postcloture \nwill run until 7:30 a.m. on Sunday, give or take an hour. We would vote \nat that time to pass the CR. Immediately thereafter we will vote to \ninvoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the sportsmen's package.\n  So here is where that leaves us: We file cloture on the CR and the \nmotion to proceed to the sportsmen's package. That sets up two votes \nfor very early Sunday morning in addition to tomorrow night, Saturday \nmorning at 1 a.m. or thereabouts. We can do those votes now and finish \neverything today or we can wait. The choice is clear. We end up in the \nsame place Sunday morning or we can get there today.\n  I have had some Senators come to me and say, well, we are not going \nto vote on the sportsmen's package. Well, yes, they are. We have that \nset up. There is a clear path. The problem with the rest of the stuff \nis not our problem; it is the Republicans' problem.\n  I worked something out in good faith with Rand Paul. He in good faith \nworked something out with me. I am not here to be a cheerleader for \nRand Paul; I am here to tell everyone what happened. Now, if the \nRepublicans don't want to vote on that, I think it would be too bad \nbecause Rand Paul, after all of this time--whether anyone agrees with \nwhat he wants to do or not--he and I in good faith worked something \nout.\n  We had a number of Senators come here, including the senior Senator \nfrom Arizona to name one, who said we need more time on that. I have no \nproblem with that. Yesterday when he said he wanted more time, I said \njust take the hour because Senator Paul has been here talking about \nthis for weeks and weeks. We have heard a lot from him, and he said: I \nhave talked a lot on this--and I am paraphrasing--and 15 minutes would \nbe enough for me. I thought I was being generous by setting up an hour \nrather than 15 minutes. If the senior Senator from Arizona wants more \ntime, I don't care. I really don't care.\n  Also, I had some conversations with Lindsey Graham. He and Senator \nLieberman have been pushing very hard on a containment resolution that \ndeals with Iran. It is another bipartisan piece of legislation. Eighty \nSenators are cosponsors of it. The other 20, I bet, like it also. If \nnot, the majority of the 20 do. It is something we overwhelmingly need \nto do. I think it would be good in that we are trying to work things \nout in Iraq, which is not stable at this time--at least not the way we \nwant it to be. It would be nice if America had an ambassador to go to \nIraq. That has been held up.\n  With all the problems we see with Pakistan, I think it would be a \ngood idea if we had an American ambassador to Pakistan. That has been \nheld up for a long time.\n  Again, to his credit, Senator Paul said have a vote on the \ncontainment resolution and have a vote on the two ambassadors. He is \nnot standing in the way of that.\n  Momentarily, I am going to file cloture and procedurally block any \nother amendments on the continuing resolution. We will vote on that \nwhenever the Republicans want, but no later than Saturday morning at a \ntime we will decide. When I say ``we decide,'' it is a statutory clock, \nand that is when it runs out. Following that, we will have a vote on \nfinal passage of the CR and a motion to proceed to Tester's sportsmen's \npackage. That is what we have to complete. For people to try to get out \ntheir stuff is just unfair.\n  I have seen newspaper accounts of Republican Senators who love the \nTester legislation. I didn't ask them; I read it in the paper. They \nthink it is good because it is good. It is bipartisan. It does \nsomething we have been trying to do for a long time; that is, a lot of \nthese little bills have been held up--hundreds of them. Tester and the \npeople who support this legislation have joined together 20 of these \nlittle bills into this one piece of legislation. It really is the right \nthing to do. I hope we can get this done.\n  Remember the choice--I repeat for the third time--is very clear. We \ncan quickly complete everything tonight or we can come back here \nSaturday morning in the middle of the night sometime and early Sunday \nmorning. We will be at the same place. Those votes are going to take \nplace. It is up to the Republicans and what they want to do with \nSenator Paul and the unanimous consent request they objected to \nyesterday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6501-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6501-S6502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         MAKING CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2013\n\n  Mr. REID.

The President pro tempore.\n\n\n                             H.J. Res. 117\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today, as we near the end of the current \nfiscal year, the Senate is considering H.J. Res. 117, a continuing \nresolution to ensure that the Federal Government will remain \nfunctioning through March of next year in the absence of regular \nappropriations. Last Thursday, the House passed this measure by a vote \nof 329 to 91.\n  This bill provides total discretionary spending of $1.047 trillion. \nThis is the funding level the Senate Appropriations Committee \nrecommended on an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 27 to 2 and the level \nagreed to last year in the Budget Control Act, but this bill is $19 \nbillion more than what was approved by the House in the Paul Ryan \nbudget. I am encouraged the House has finally repudiated its own \nbudget. I am only sorry it has taken them this long to come to their \nsenses. One of the primary reasons Congress now faces this CR is that \nthe House broke this agreement on spending.\n  I want my colleagues to know I support this measure even though it is \nfar from perfect. In fact, I would say it is not a good bill, but \npassing it is much better than allowing the government to shut down \nover a lack of funding.\n  Continuing resolutions are not new. As some of my colleagues are \naware, I have served in this Senate for 49 years and 9 months. During \nmy tenure, this Congress has completed its work and enacted all of its \nspending bills without needing a continuing resolution on only three \noccasions. In 49 years, three times. This is not a record we should be \nproud of, but it demonstrates how difficult it is to agree on funding \nfor each of the thousands of Federal programs that the Appropriations \nCommittee reviews annually. However, never before in history has the \nCongress passed a stopgap resolution in September to fund the entire \ngovernment for half the coming fiscal year. It is unfortunate that it \nhas come to this.\n  Seven months ago, as we began this legislative session, the mood was \nquite different. There was broad support for acting on appropriations \nbills. Several Members on both sides of the aisle came to the floor to \nspeak about restoring regular order and passing all 12 appropriations \nbills. Both the Republican and Democratic leaders spoke in favor of \nconsidering all of these bills. The Appropriations Committee was urged \nto conduct a budget review as quickly as possible and report bills to \nthe Senate for consideration, and our subcommittees embraced this \nchallenge. We shortened our hearing schedule, conducted thousands of \nmeetings with executive branch officials and the public, and began to \nmark up bills shortly after receiving our allocation from the Budget \nCommittee.\n  In most years the Senate Appropriations Committee begins its markups \nin June. This year the committee reported its first two bills in April \nand had nine bills ready for floor consideration by the end of June.\n  By July the committee had reported out 11 bills, 9 of which were \nrecommended with strong bipartisan votes, and by that I mean 30 to 0 or \n29 to 1. Despite the work of the committee, none of those bills have \nbeen considered by the Senate. The decision by the House to break faith \nwith the Senate and the administration on funding levels and the \ninclusion of outrageous legislative policy riders in their bills \ndrained the enthusiasm for acting on those measures. But the real \nculprit thwarting the efforts of the committee was a handful of my \ncolleagues who insisted on delaying the business of the Senate.\n  We have heard our distinguished majority leader cite the statistics. \nIn 382 instances in the past 6 years he has been forced to file cloture \nto break filibusters. It is becoming very clear filibusters are \ncrippling the Senate. This year, this Senate has been in session for \n105 days. By my count, on 31 of those days the Senate has done nothing \nbut consider motions to proceed, as we are doing with this motion, or \nto invoke cloture. That means nearly 30 percent of the Senate's time \nthis year has been completely wasted.\n  Moreover, the Senate has only voted on amendments and legislation on \n21 of those days that we were in session. On 21 out of 105 days, we \nactually legislated and worked. The rest of the time was spent on a \nbacklog of nominations or breaking filibusters.\n  I have never experienced anything like this in my many years in the \nSenate. It is true that for some time the use of filibusters has been \nincreasing, but this year it has truly exploded. I do not oppose \nfilibusters. I believe the filibuster is one of the most critical tools \nSenators have to protect the rights of our constituents. This \nis especially\n\n[[Page S6503]]\n\ntrue for small States, such as Hawaii, which are at a disadvantage in \nthe House of Representatives compared to States with very large \ndelegations. In fact, the first speech I delivered in the Senate was in \ndefense of the filibuster. I supported the filibuster. Times were \ndifferent then.\n\n  For example, I waited until April of that year before speaking on the \nSenate floor, and I spoke on the filibuster. When I delivered my maiden \nspeech, legendary Senators such as Everett Dirksen, Richard Russell, \nMike Mansfield, and John Stennis were all in attendance. Truly, times \nhave changed, but the most striking difference between then and now is \nthat a filibuster was used very rarely in those early days and only for \nmatters of extreme importance to Members and their States.\n  I did not agree with those who used the filibuster in the 1960s to \ntry to stop civil rights legislation. I disagreed with those who used \nthe filibuster against health care reform in 2010. But in both cases I \ndefended the right to do so.\n  This year the Senate has been held up, delayed, and rendered \nineffective for at least 30 percent of its time by the abuse of the \nfilibuster. These filibusters were not to highlight important policy \ndifferences, nor were they to protect a Senator's constituents. \nInstead, in virtually every case it was simply to thwart the ability of \nthe Senate to function.\n  So today is a sad day. The Senate is forced to take up a 6-month \ncontinuing resolution instead of acting upon regular appropriations \nbills. The bipartisan zeal for regular order last spring has been \ncrushed by dilatory tactics of a few Members who have wasted the \nSenate's time. At some point, this body needs to alter either its \nbehavior or its rules.\n  In addition to discretionary funding, this resolution also provides \n$99 billion for overseas contingencies as requested and necessary for \nthe coming year. Further, it continues funding at current levels to pay \nfor disasters under FEMA and to fight fraud, waste, and abuse in the \nSocial Security Program. Each of these is consistent with the \nauthorities included in the Budget Control Act.\n  In addition, the bill before the Senate provides only the bare \nminimum that is necessary to maintain the functions of our Federal \nGovernment. The administration sought approximately 78 proposals to \nensure that critical programs and authorities could be continued for \nthe next 6 months. This bill includes only about half of them because \nthe House was unwilling to allow more.\n  Provisions deemed essential by the Secretary of Defense to preserve \nauthorities for ongoing programs in support of our efforts in \nAfghanistan and in Iraq are not in this measure. Special provisions to \nallow the Department of Defense to award contracts for critical \nprograms were denied. Additional funding to activate new Federal \nprisons that currently sit empty was not included.\n  This bill denies necessary authorities for dozens of programs. In \nsome cases, the administration will find cumbersome work-arounds. For \nothers it will have to slow down work on ongoing programs, and this \nincreases costs and brings about inefficiency. Many programs will \nsimply have to cease activity and await additional action on \nappropriations bills.\n  We urged the House to include many of the provisions requested by the \nadministration, but they refused. The bill would have been far better \nhad more of these requirements been met. Yet I would point out that the \nHouse has not played favorites. No department was granted the \nauthorities it required. The Defense Department has not been singled \nout for special help by House Republicans. If anything, it has been \ntreated more harshly than many other agencies.\n  So I support this bill because opposing it is not a responsible \nalternative. No one should be interested in delaying or defeating this \nbill. We simply cannot afford to shut down government operations.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this bill which will \npreserve our government. It is lean and it is stripped down, but it \ncontains the funding and minimal authorities essential to ensure that \nthe services provided for all Americans can be continued over the \ncoming months.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, this continuing resolution results from \nan agreement reached between the President and the congressional \nleadership for a 6-month, clean CR that adheres to the fiscal year 2013 \nspending levels set out in the Budget Control Act.\n  The continuing resolution does not make reductions in programs for \nwhich the President requested less money in fiscal year 2013, nor does \nit make cuts that have been proposed by the Congress. Neither does the \nresolution increase funding for programs Congress or the administration \ndeemed to be high priorities, with a few exceptions. The continuing \nresolution does not contain any new oversight provisions to guide \nagencies, nor does it include any new riders to limit the activities of \nthe executive branch. In short, it puts the portion of government that \nwe call discretionary on automatic pilot. Enactment of this resolution \nwill, for the time being, avoid a disruptive government-shutdown fight.\n  The resolution represents a lost opportunity. We have lost the \nopportunity to provide agencies with at least some certainty about \nfunding for this fiscal year. We have lost the opportunity to make \ninformed judgments about which programs are effective and deserving of \nadditional resources and which programs should be reformed or \nterminated. Contracts will not be let in a timely and efficient manner, \nand acquisition and construction costs will rise with delay. The morale \nof the Federal workforce will suffer. Perhaps most importantly, we have \nlost a chance to supplant the looming sequester.\n  Elections have consequences, as they most certainly should, but \nelections should not have the consequence of rendering Congress \nunwilling or incapable of performing its most fundamental duties in the \ntimes leading up to those elections. In my view, the thoughtful and \ndutiful appropriation of funds for our national defense and other \ngovernment operations is such a fundamental duty.\n  I deeply regret that the majority leader chose not to call up a \nsingle appropriations bill. Chairman Inouye has shown impressive \nleadership of our committee in reporting 11 of the 12 bills out of our \ncommittee. Most were reported on a broad bipartisan basis. The chairmen \nand ranking members of the subcommittees have put a lot of time and \nthought into the bills. The staffs have worked very hard producing this \nlegislation. The other body has also produced a bill. It has passed \nseven of the appropriations bills in the other body and I suspect would \nhave passed the others had there been any sign of movement in the \nSenate.\n  We can only speculate as to why none of the bills have been \nconsidered here in the Senate. Other issues were deemed more pressing \nor expedient for one reason or another. Perhaps votes on amendments to \nspending bills were deemed to be politically perilous, whatever the \nreasons.\n  At a time when addressing our Nation's fiscal situation is so central \nto our duty as Senators, it seems more imperative than ever that \nMembers of this body have an opportunity to offer amendments to shape \nthe spending bills. Our problems are sufficiently large that it will \nrequire all of our good ideas to make the day-to-day operations of \ngovernment as efficient and effective as possible. This might mean we \nhave to take votes on difficult amendments. But would that really be so \ntraumatic?\n  As a result of our inaction, we are compelled to pass this continuing \nresolution to fund the government. I would have preferred a shorter \nterm CR in order to motivate action on the appropriations bills, but 6 \nmonths is what has been agreed to.\n  Proponents of this 6-month CR argue that the prospect of a government \nshutdown should be taken off the table so that we can focus on the \ncomplex issues facing us in the coming months. But do those issues look \nany more simple now that we are about to pass this CR?\n  All manner of taxes are scheduled to go up on January 1. Medicare \nreimbursement rates will be cut dramatically. The debt ceiling looms. \nAnd due\n\n[[Page S6504]]\n\nto the inability of the supercommittee to propose a debt reduction \npackage, we are facing a budget sequester that very few people seem to \nthink is a good idea.\n  Perhaps passage of this CR will help us address these pressing \nmatters. I hope that it will. But I am not so sure it changes things \nthat much.\n  Regardless of who wins what in the upcoming election, we have a great \ndeal of unfinished business to resolve in the coming months.\n  None of my colleagues likely relish the prospect of voting in March--\nup or down--on either a trillion-dollar omnibus bill or a trillion-\ndollar full-year CR. Yet that is where we are headed if we continue to \ndo nothing.\n  Appropriations bills are not simply opportunities to spend more \nmoney. They provide regular opportunities for effective oversight of \nFederal agencies. And when we take the time to bring them to the Senate \nfloor, they provide regular opportunities for the elected \nrepresentatives of all the people to shape, as well as fund the \noperations of the Federal Government. I hope the Senate will not \ncontinue to deny the people that opportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I believe the record should show how \nmuch we appreciate the work of the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi, the vice chairman of the committee, Thad Cochran. We have \ndemonstrated to our colleagues that bipartisanship works in this \nSenate. All they have to do is watch us operate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                       Remembering Jennifer Green\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise today with great sadness to inform \nthe Senate that Jennifer Green, a valued member of my staff and a \ncherished member of the Senate family, passed away last weekend after a \nbrief illness. It is a comfort to all who knew Jennifer that she spent \nher last hours in a room filled with the family she cherished so \ndeeply, but no room on Earth would have been large enough to hold all \nthose who mourn her, who have been touched and made better by \nJennifer's beautiful smile, big heart, and easy friendship. She is \nsorely missed in my office, throughout the Senate, and even across the \ncountry.\n  Jennifer worked in my office for the past 14 years, but she served \nthe Senate for nearly a quarter century, starting with the Sergeant at \nArms when she was just 20 years old. Jennifer was often the first face \nvisitors to my office would see. She did more than just arrange Capitol \ntours or point them to the nearest DC attraction; she worked out a \nbotched hotel reservation, found a glass of water to soothe an \noverheated toddler, listened to worries about a failing farm, a sick \ngrandparent, or a threatened job.\n  Many of my constituents arrive in the office a little overwhelmed by \nWashington, perhaps a little angry at Congress, but after meeting \nJennifer, they left knowing they had a friend here. Jennifer put a \nhuman, caring face on the Senate--a service to this institution that \naffected the way hundreds, and probably thousands, of Wisconsinites \nviewed their government.\n  Of course, no one, not visitor or staff, could leave the office \nwithout an update on Jennifer's family, especially her beloved mother \nBeatrice Spicer, her father Floyd Spicer, her brothers and sisters, and \nher son Lorenzo Green. She was so proud of this fine young man, as we \nall are. Through Jennifer, we got to watch a mischievous little boy \ngrow to a talented and strong man serving our country as a member of \nthe U.S. Coast Guard. She made sure everyone got a good look at the \nhandsome--and big--framed picture she kept in her cubicle of Lorenzo in \nuniform.\n  Jennifer made us all feel as if we were part of her wonderful family. \nShe was always the first to ask to see the picture of a new baby, quick \nto drive a colleague to the doctor or listen to a staffer who lost a \nparent, ready to swap a recipe or dissect the Redskins' latest \nperformance. And that was not just my experience and that of my staff--\nJennifer knew just about everyone who works on the Hill. We have had a \nsteady stream of visitors stopping by the office to share memories and \nexpress their condolences. Thank you all for the comfort that has \nbrought our staff.\n  Jennifer's funeral will be held in her hometown of Princeton, WV, \nthis Saturday. I urge anyone who wants to attend or to leave a message \nfor the family through the funeral home to contact my office for \ndetails. We will also be organizing a memorial service for Jennifer \nhere in the Senate in the coming weeks, and we will make sure all \noffices get plenty of notice so that her many friends can be there.\n  Everywhere you look in the Capitol, there are plaques, pictures, and \nstatues commemorating the men and women who built this great \ninstitution, but these, like all things physical, oftentimes fade or \nare forgotten. Jennifer touched the heart of the Senate, the people who \nwork here, and the people who visit. Hers is a legacy and a \ncontribution that time cannot erase.\n  For everyone in my office and for the entire Senate, I offer my \ndeepest condolences to Jennifer's dear family. I hope you can find \ncomfort in knowing of all the good she did and the joy she brought in \nher time here. We will all miss her profoundly and hold her in our \nhearts forever.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a copy of Jennifer's obituary.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Jennifer Denise Spicer Green\n\n       Jennifer Denise Spicer Green, 46 of Lusby, MD, departed \n     this life Saturday, September 15, 2012, at Georgetown \n     University Hospital in Washington, DC. She was born February \n     23, 1966 in Princeton to the union of James F. Spicer and \n     Beatrice Spicer and was the youngest of five children. \n     Jennifer first accepted the Lord at Mt. Calvary Missionary \n     Baptist Church in Princeton and after moving to Maryland she \n     became a member of the Maple Springs Baptist Church in \n     Suitland, MD. She was a graduate of Princeton High School and \n     was a former employee at the Dairy Queen in Princeton. Her \n     first government position was doorkeeper of the Senate \n     Chamber, and she then worked as an elevator operator in the \n     Unites States Capitol in Washington, DC. Jennifer continued \n     her service as mail carrier under the Senate Sergeant at Arms \n     Office for the Senate Post Office. She then became a data \n     entry operator to U.S. Senator Paul Simon of Illinois and \n     later accepted a position as front office receptionist with \n     the Special Committee of Aging. During the changing of \n     legislature, Jennifer moved to Charlotte, NC, where she \n     worked with the American Heart Association and Gerrard Tire \n     and Automotive. Upon moving back to Maryland, Jennifer \n     accepted the position as receptionist with the Senate Finance \n     Committee and then spent the last sixteen years with the \n     office of Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin in the positions of \n     Mailroom Manager, Photographer, and Intern Supervisor. During \n     this time she also worked part time for Senator Evan Bayh of \n     Indiana, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, Senator \n     Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, and Senator Bob Casey of \n     Pennsylvania. She was preceded in death by her maternal and \n     paternal grandparents. Survivors include her loving son, \n     Lorenzo J. Green of the U.S. Coast Guard stationed in Alaska; \n     parents, Beatrice E. Burton Spicer of Princeton and James \n     ``Floyd'' Spicer of Atlanta, GA; step children, LaQuosha \n     Jackson, Willard Green, Jr., Byron Green, Latonya Green, and \n     Trea Green; three godchildren, Brittany Coleman, Mykisha \n     Avery, and Amanda Spicer; two brothers, Joey A. Spicer and \n     James ``Toby'' Spicer both of Princeton; two sisters, Cindy \n     E. Townes of New Carlton, MD and Donna M. Spicer of \n     Mooresville, NC; special cousin that was like a brother to \n     Jennifer, John ``Dexter'' Coles of Capitol Heights, MD; \n     faithful friend, Derrick Williams; and a host of aunts, \n     uncles, nephews, nieces, cousins and additional friends. \n     Funeral services will be conducted at 11:00 AM, Saturday, \n     September 22, 2012 at the George W. Seaver Chapel of Seaver \n     Funeral Home in Princeton with Bishop Romey Coles, Rev. \n     Charles Stores, Rev. Jesse Woods and Rev. Terrance Porter \n     officiating. Burial will follow at Restlawn Memorial Gardens, \n     Littlesburg Road in Bluefield. Family and friends may call at \n     the funeral home from 6:00 PM until 8:00 PM, Friday, \n     September 21, 2012 and 10:00 AM until the service hour on \n     Saturday.

I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Ryan McCoy\n\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I rise today to recognize and honor my \nfriend Ryan McCoy, a departing member of my staff. Ryan McCoy is, in \nfact, much more than just a member of my staff; he has been the energy \nbehind many of my legislative goals, and he is also a close friend. \nWhile no tribute of words could ever match the debt of gratitude he \ntruly deserves, I would like to pay tribute in the official records of \nCongress to someone who fought to make a\n\n[[Page S6505]]\n\ndifference both for the State of Utah and for our country.\n  C.S. Lewis said:\n\n       Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to \n     another: ``What! You too? I thought I was the only one.''\n\n  My friendship with Ryan McCoy, my former legislative director, was \nborn in that very way described by C.S. Lewis. We met back in 2009 when \nI was speaking to a group of Utahans about a topic near and dear to my \nheart: article I, section 8 of the Constitution. I spoke of my passion \nfor the Constitution and for the principles of limited government \nembodied therein, and my message apparently struck something of a chord \nwith Ryan, who had recently taken a greater interest in finding ways to \nrestore those same principles. We spent several hours after the speech \ntalking about what the Constitution meant to both of us. I had not \nalways thought about running for office, but when Ryan suddenly \nprepared a PowerPoint presentation for me about the problems we face as \na country and about the ways in which he and I, working together, could \nmake a difference, I started thinking much more seriously about it.\n  When Ryan and I discussed later his leadership role in my office, his \nwife Kara jokingly told him that he had no idea what he was doing. But \nthe truth is that we needed to know only one thing, just one thing: \nthat we could make a difference. In the end, I believe that was our \ngreatest asset. Ryan and I shared a vision for change in Washington. We \nknew it would not come easily, but it had to come from people who \nwanted to make a difference. It had to come from people who had lived \nin difficult economic circumstances and felt the need for change as it \ntugged at their own pocketbooks and at their own individual freedoms \nbeing eroded by an ever-expanding government.\n  At a meeting a few months after we met, Ryan spoke of the common \ngoals we shared. He said that our movement would be based on a clear, \nunequivocal message that it was time to change course for our country. \nRyan and I shared this vision, and Ryan knew others would catch on to \nit. In the nearly 2 years he served as my legislative director, he \nworked hard, he worked tirelessly, he worked constantly to keep us \nfocused on these legislative goals and to keep us true to our \nprinciples.\n  It is safe to say that I would not be here today without the hard \nwork and dedication of Ryan McCoy. Once here, I would never have been \nable to do many of the things I have done without Ryan McCoy's expert \nassistance. Ryan will be remembered in my office as a respected leader \nand as a man who truly loves his country.\n  Too often in the hustle and bustle of Washington, we tend to take our \nstaff members for granted. It is when they leave that we truly see the \nimpact they have had and the wide breadth of influence they had while \nthey were here.\n  As much as we will miss Ryan, we will also miss his wife Kara and her \nshared enthusiasm every bit as much. I thank Kara. She and Ryan have \nbecome an important part of my life, an important part of my family, an \nimportant part of my office family.\n  In addition to thanking Kara, I also want to thank Ryan and Kara's \nchildren, Connor, Tate, Gage, and McCall, for loaning their dad to me \nfor these few years. Kara once told me that during a particularly busy \ntime in the Senate, one of their children--I do not remember which \none--actually came to her and asked her where their dad had gone and \nwhether or when he might be returning. I appreciate their sacrifice, \nand I hope they will grow up knowing their father is a true hero of \nmine--and always will be--one who works tirelessly for his country and \nfor their future. I wish them the best back in Utah, and on behalf of \nmyself, Sharon, and my entire staff, I extend my love and sincere \nappreciation to each of them.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                        Tax and Economic Policy\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, two enormous challenges will await us \nwhen we return from recess. Our economy is still not yet fully \nrecovered from a devastating recession, and the prospects for our \nmiddle class and for those aspiring to be in the middle class or to get \nback into the middle class remain uncertain. Meanwhile, our budget \nremains sorely out of balance, and our long-term debt crisis is putting \nour Nation's fiscal future at risk. These two challenges are, of \ncourse, linked. We cannot hope to solve our long-term debt problem \nunless we get our economy growing again, and we cannot hope to rebuild \nour prosperity unless we resolve our budget problems.\n  So we will have big decisions to make when we come back, but in the \nmeantime the American people will be wrestling with the same issues: \nWhat should we do to grow our economy and reduce our debt? What are the \nright investments to make?\n  How should we pay for them? What sacrifices must be made in the name \nof fiscal responsibility? Who is going to make them? That is the debate \nour Nation will have over the next 6 weeks. Those are the questions we \nmust be prepared to answer when we return. So before I go home to \nMinnesota to share my thoughts with my constituents, I wanted to take a \nfew moments to share them with my colleagues.\n  My view of what we should do in response to these challenges is based \nupon what we have done in response to similar challenges in the past. \nWe are not the first Congress or the first generation to struggle with \nthese issues. At the end of 2011, our national debt had reached 100 \npercent of our gross domestic product. That is frightening. But after \nWorld War II, our debt was 121 percent of GDP.\n  To be fair, we had something to show for it. We had won World War II \nand the world was a very different place in 1945 than it is today. But \nthe point is that we were tested. How did we respond? Well, we invested \nin the things we believed would grow the economy. We invested in \neducation, things such as the GI bill, which helped my mother-in-law, \nwidowed at age 29, go to college.\n  We invested in Pell grants which helped my wife Franni and her three \nsisters go to college. We invested in infrastructure. We built 40,000 \nmiles of highways in the 1950s. We invested in innovation and we won \nthe space race which, in turn, led to the creation of whole new \nindustries such as personal computers and telecommunications.\n  Those investments paid off and our economy experienced three decades \nof incredible growth, growth that flowed to the top, to the middle, and \nto the bottom. Between 1947 and 1977, wages for the top fifth, the top \nfifth of workers, grew by 99 percent, and wages for those in the bottom \nfifth rose by 116 percent. I know that is hard to believe. The wages of \nthe bottom fifth grew more than those of the top fifth. But that \nhappened.\n  Even though we remained a Nation in which many kids like my wife \nFranni grew up in poverty, we had enough to invest in a strong safety \nnet that helped those kids like Franni and her sisters and her brother \nwork their way into the middle class. We bounced back from World War II \nto build an economy with a middle class that was strong, secure, and \naccessible to almost everyone.\n  Thanks in large part to the growth generated by that thriving middle \nclass, we were able to lower our national debt to about 31 percent by \n1981; so 121 percent at the end of World War II, to 1981, about 31 \npercent. Since then our economy has had some good times and some bad \ntimes. We have raised taxes and we have lowered taxes. We have had \nsurpluses and we have had deficits.\n  As this chart shows, our debt relative to GDP has gone up and down. \nWe have seen the results of a variety of approaches to the issues we \nface today. In the 1980 election, Ronald Reagan was elected on a \nplatform that appealed to concerns that the government taxed too much \nand spent too much. His approach was later called ``starving the \nbeast.'' Here is how he explained it. This is a quote. This is \nPresident Reagan.\n\n       There are always those who told us that taxes could not be \n     cut until spending was reduced. Well, you know, we can \n     lecture our children about extravagance until we run out of \n     voice and breath or we can cure their extravagance by simply \n     reducing their allowance.\n\n  Cutting taxes, cutting revenue to the government. When Reagan took \noffice, he fulfilled his campaign promise and signed into law a huge \ntax cut, and on cue we began to amass enormous deficits almost \nimmediately. In fact, President Reagan's Budget Director at the\n\n[[Page S6506]]\n\ntime, David Stockman, has explained that 1981 was when the era of large \npermanent deficits began.\n  The deficits were so bad in his first year, in 1981, that President \nReagan had to increase taxes in 1982, and again in 1983. In fact, he \nended up raising taxes 11 times; not because Ronald Reagan was a \nSocialist--at least I really do not think so--but, rather, because he \ncould not ignore the arithmetic.\n  Still that first tax cut was so big that over the course of his \nPresidency, our national debt nearly tripled. It did not grow rapidly \nduring the administration of George H. W. Bush. Then he handed it off \nto President Clinton. And what he handed off was at that point the \nlargest deficit in the history of our country.\n  In President Clinton's 1993 deficit reduction package, he added two \nnew tax rates, marginal tax rates, at the top end: 36 percent for \nincome above $180,000, 39.6 percent for incomes above $250,000. The \nRepublicans objected rather vehemently, arguing that asking the top 2 \npercent pay a little more would send the economy into a recession, \nwhich, of course, would be detrimental to the goal of reducing the \ndeficit.\n  The bill passed without a single Republican vote in either House. But \nthe Republicans' dire predictions turned out to be wrong, extremely \nwrong. Between 1993 and 2001, this country experienced an unprecedented \nexpansion of our economy. We created 22.7 million net new jobs. We \ndecreased the number of Americans in poverty to record lows. We \nincreased the median household income and we created more millionaires \nthan we ever had before.\n\n  Not only did President Clinton's deficit reduction plan reduce the \ndeficit, it eliminated the deficit. President Clinton was able to hand \noff to President George W. Bush a record surplus. In fact, in January \nof 2001, we were on track to completely pay off our national debt by \nthe year 2011. However, as we know, President Bush chose a different \ncourse. Whether you agree with the two wars we entered into during his \nadministration, the new entitlement program that we created, or the two \ntax cuts we passed, the fact of the matter is we did not pay for any of \nthose things. They all went on our national credit card.\n  While the two tax cuts tilted toward those at the top--they did help \nsome at the top do extremely well during the Bush administration--it is \nhard to say the things we put on that credit card created the kind of \ndurable broad-based prosperity we saw in the 1990s or that we built in \nthe 30 years after World War II, for that matter. It would be hard to \nsay, because when President Obama took office from President Bush, the \neconomy was hemorrhaging jobs at the rate of over 800,000 a month. And \nwhen the bill came for the Bush policies, we were staring at a \nprojected $1.1 trillion deficit for 2009. That was the projected \ndeficit that President Bush left for President Obama.\n  So far I have talked about President Reagan and his approach of \ncutting revenue in order to force the government to cut spending. We \nsaw what happened. We could not or did not cut enough spending to keep \nour budget in balance. We had huge deficits even when Reagan tried to \nbacktrack and raise more revenue. I have talked about President Clinton \nand his approach of raising taxes on the top 2 percent in order to \nbring the budget into balance. We saw what happened. The economy grew \nand we generated a record surplus. I have talked about President Bush \nand his approach of cutting taxes and incurring large expenses without \nworrying about the ramifications on the deficit. We saw what happened. \nDeficits ballooned and when the economy crashed, it crashed hard.\n  So what about President Obama? What has his approach been? Well, if \nyou ask some people, including unfortunately many in this Chamber, they \ntell you that President Obama's approach was to go on a massive \nspending spree. Well, it is not true. Over his 4 budget years, Federal \nspending is on track to rise from $3.52 trillion to $3.58 trillion, an \nannual increase of 0.84 percent.\n  You can hash these figures out, but here is a chart that comes from \nMarket Watch, a publication of Dow Jones which also owns the Wall \nStreet Journal, that shows Obama's increase in spending from 2010 to \n2013. These are Reagan's. These are numbers from the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office, from the Office of Management and Budget. \nYou can see the growth of Federal spending. This is lower than it was \nunder any of the Presidents I talked about.\n  Indeed, the article that ran with this chart concludes that the \ngrowth of Federal spending under President Obama is the lowest it has \nbeen since the Eisenhower administration during the wind-down from the \nKorean war. But remember that besides a $1.1 trillion deficit, \nPresident Obama inherited an economy that in the month he took office \nlost over 800,000 jobs. That was January. The next month, February, \n2009, he lost about 700,000 jobs. But that is also the month in which \nwe passed the Recovery Act. By the way, when the Recovery Act was \npassed in February of 2009, the unemployment rate was already above 8 \npercent.\n  The Recovery Act, also known as the stimulus, is what people usually \npoint to when pressed to explain why they think President Obama has \nincreased spending. But the truth is that more than one-third of the \nRecovery Act was tax cuts. The stimulus cut taxes for 95 percent of \nAmerican families. Another one-third was fiscal aid to the States, \nwhich were feeling the same budget crunch as the Federal Government \nbut, in most cases, didn't have the option of running a deficit in \ntough years. Without the Recovery Act, imagine how many more teachers \nand firefighters and police officers would have had to have been laid \noff, and imagine what that would have meant to our economy, never mind \nwhat it would have meant to our communities. But the one-third that \ngets the most attention was the one-third that went toward creating \njobs.\n  Did it work? There are a few ways to answer that question, but the \nanswer is the same every time: Yes. First, we can look at our chart and \nsee that once the Recovery Act began to be implemented we started \nlosing less jobs and then we started creating jobs. We have had 30 \nstraight months of private job creation--of growth.\n  Secondly, we can ask economists. The most reputable economists, \nincluding----\n  Mr. REID. Would my friend yield?\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Certainly.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we are going to have no more votes today--\nno more votes today. It is obvious to me what is going on. I have been \nto a few of these rodeos. It is obvious a big stall is taking place, so \none of the Senators who doesn't want to be in the debate tonight will \nnot be in the debate. He can't use the Senate as an excuse.\n  There will be no more votes today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I thank the Chair. That is too bad.\n  I was going over what happened, reviewing what happened once the \nstimulus package had been passed in February, when unemployment was \nover 8 percent. And we can see as it started taking effect we lost less \nand less jobs and have since had 30 straight months of private sector \njob growth. I said we could ask economists. Most reputable economists, \nincluding those of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, agree \nthe Recovery Act created or saved anywhere from 2.5 million to 3.5 \nmillion jobs.\n  In the words of Mark Zandi, the economic adviser to Senator John \nMcCain in his 2008 Presidential campaign, the Federal policy response \nto the financial crisis, including the stimulus, ``probably averted \nwhat could have been called the Great Depression 2.0.''\n  But we don't have to take the word of Mark Zandi. We don't have to \ntake the word of all the other reputable economists. We don't even have \nto take the word of the Congressional Budget Office, although the CBO \nsort of exists for those of us in Congress. We can ask Jamie, Cecil, \nand Sheila.\n  This is Jamie, working on the Duluth Lift Bridge a couple years back. \nThis is a picture of Cecil, who is working on a highway extension \nproject. Let's give Cecil his due. He is working on a highway extension \nproject in Brooklyn Park in the suburban Twin Cities.\n\n[[Page S6507]]\n\nThen we have Sheila. This is Sheila in front of her Bobcat working the \nnight shift on an I-94 improvement project.\n  These are people who were put back to work by the stimulus. Despite \nclaims by some that the only jobs created by the stimulus went to \ngovernment bureaucrats, we will notice Jamie, Cecil, and Sheila are \nnot, in fact, government bureaucrats. Thankfully, we do not let \ngovernment bureaucrats operate heavy machinery.\n  What can we say about the approach of President Obama so far?\n  He slowed the growth of Federal spending to its lowest level since \nEisenhower. He has cut taxes--not just in the stimulus package but many \ntimes during his first term--to the tune of more than $850 billion. \nWhen the economy was at its low point, he made investments and put \npeople back to work in the short-term and prevented things from getting \neven worse.\n  There was another road we could have taken. That approach would have \ninvolved not just cutting spending but gutting the government, and it \ndefinitely wouldn't have involved making investments to put people back \nto work.\n  We will never know whether that approach--known as austerity--would \nhave gotten us results such as the ones reflected on the previous \nchart, but we do know what happened in countries where they tried this \nalternate approach. This is a chart of European countries that went the \nausterity route. This is GDP from 2008 to 2012. This would be where \nPresident Obama became President and this is Europe and we all were \nseeing a global meltdown. These are countries that did austerity in \nEurope, and this is the United States. The evidence tells us our way \nworked. President Obama's way worked and theirs did not.\n  Of course, while we are better off than we were 4 years ago and \nbetter off than we would be if we had tried austerity instead of the \napproach taken by President Obama, which, if we look at the growth in \nspending, was pretty close to austerity, we are obviously still not \nwhere we want to be, either in terms of our economy or in terms of our \ndeficit.\n  What is the right way going forward? First, let us talk about deficit \nreduction. It is clear to me that any solution that does not include \nboth increased revenue and decreased spending simply isn't going to \nwork. The hole is too big for us to tax our way out or to cut our way \nout. We have to do both. The hole is, in fact, so big we can't even get \nout of it just by taxing and cutting. We have to grow our way out too.\n  That is why I think we need to invest in education, and \ninfrastructure, and innovation. That means early childhood education, \nwhich has a return of investment in every study--quality early \nchildhood education--of $16 for every $1 spent, and in workforce \ntraining, in roads and bridges and rural broadband, in clean energy and \nhealth care technology.\n  I don't think only government can create jobs. I know that. But I \nknow that only government can make those critical investments that will \nhelp the private sector create jobs, and I know it works when we do. It \nworked after World War II, it worked under President Clinton, and it \nworked in the Recovery Act. Those investments, however, cost money, and \nwe will not be able to afford them unless we reduce our deficits.\n  I think people who talk about cutting spending should say what \nspending they want to cut. I want to cut spending, so let me tell you \nwhat spending I want to cut.\n\n  I want to cut the billions in subsidies we give to oil companies that \nsimply don't need them. I want to let Medicare negotiate for \npharmaceuticals under Part D, just as the VA does, because prohibiting \nMedicare from doing so amounts to a subsidy for pharmaceutical \ncompanies, one that, again, they do not need. I want to make cuts in \nour military budget, because as the comprehensive defense review \nfound--begun under Secretary Gates and completed under Secretary \nPanetta--we can make hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to the \ndefense budget without compromising our fundamental security and \nmilitary interests.\n  Of course, we can't only cut the things we think are easy calls to \ncut. We are going to have to cut some things we don't want to cut. \nSpeaking personally, I have already had to vote for some of those hard \ncuts, and it was not fun. But there simply aren't enough cuts to make. \nIt is clear to me, if we are going to protect our most vulnerable \nAmericans--our children, the sick, the disabled, our seniors--and make \nthe investments that will grow our middle class and our economy, we are \ngoing to have to raise revenue.\n  Just like President Reagan--but unlike some of today's Republicans--I \nknow we don't raise revenue by cutting taxes. That is why I support \nrestoring the Bush tax cuts for the first $250,000 of income but after \nthat allowing the top marginal rate to go back to where it was under \nPresident Clinton. I know that, as they did in 1993, people will argue \nthat doing so will hurt the economy. But I am equally confident that, \nas they were in 1993, they will be wrong.\n  I know we all come to the debate about our Nation's challenges with \ndifferent philosophies and different convictions and I respect that \nmany of my colleagues feel they would be betraying their own political \ncore by asking the wealthy to pay a little more or investing taxpayer \ndollars in job creation. I didn't feel great about all the cuts I had \nto vote for over the last couple years either. But I don't think we are \ngoing to get anywhere if we are so invested in following our own \nideologies that we refuse to acknowledge the lessons of where we have \nbeen or the truth about where we are and where we are headed.\n  We are not going to get anywhere if we can't agree that, yes, the \ngovernment does have a role to play in helping the private sector \ncreate jobs; and, no, we will not cut the deficit by cutting taxes; \nand, yes, we are going to have to both raise revenue and reduce \nspending if we want to get a balanced budget; and, no, asking the \nwealthy to pay a little more will not drive us back into a recession.\n  We have debated these issues a lot this year and we haven't resolved \nthe argument. Now we are going home, and it is the American people's \ntime. It is the American people who get to have their say. I hope that \nover the next 6 weeks we lead them in a debate worthy of the challenges \nwe face--a debate rooted in the facts and mindful of our history.\n  I hope when we come back we are ready to have that kind of worthy \ndebate ourselves and then make the tough calls, as our constituents \nwill in November.\n  I wish my colleagues well over the recess, and I look forward to \ngetting back to our important work when we return.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request S. 3576\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I see my friend, the majority leader, \non the floor.\n  I am surprised they announced no more votes a little while ago. We \nare prepared to finish business today. In fact, I intend to offer \nshortly the unanimous consent agreement that the majority leader \nhimself was shopping last night. Our side of the aisle is prepared to \nfinish up the business for this particular preelection session.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 5 p.m. today, the Senate proceed to \nthe consideration of S. 3576, Senator Paul's bill regarding foreign \naid; that there be up to 2 hours of debate, equally divided between \nSenators Paul and Kerry or their designees; that upon the use or \nyielding back of that time, the Senate proceed to vote on passage of \nthe bill; that the vote on passage be subject to a 60-vote affirmative \nthreshold; that if the bill does not achieve 60 affirmative votes, it \nbe considered as having been read twice, placed on the calendar; that \nfollowing the vote on passage of that legislation, S. 3576, the Senate \nproceed to consideration of Calendar No. 418, S.J. Res. 41; that there \nbe up to 60 minutes of debate, equally divided between Senators Graham \nand Senator Paul or their designees; that upon the use or yielding back \nof that time, the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the joint \nresolution; that if the joint resolution is not passed, it be returned \nto the calendar; that following the vote on the joint resolution, the \nSenate resume consideration of H.J. Res. 117, the continuing \nresolution; that the motion to proceed be agreed to, there be up to 30 \nminutes of debate, equally divided between the\n\n[[Page S6508]]\n\ntwo leaders or their designees, with Senator Coburn controlling 15 \nminutes of the Republican time, prior to a vote on passage of the joint \nresolution; that the vote on passage be subject to a 60-vote \naffirmative threshold; that following the vote, the majority leader be \nrecognized; and, finally, that no amendments, motions or points of \norder be in order during the consideration of these measures.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object, we have had \nthe stall for several days now. I wanted to make sure that one of the \nSenators who wanted to go to a debate would be able to do that tonight. \nSo he can go now, because as I announced half an hour ago there is \nplenty of time to do the debate.\n  As I have indicated before, we are anxious to finish the business we \nhave to do this work period. I am happy to vote on the Paul amendment. \nI have said that. I am the one who arranged it so it is possible to \nvote on it. I have no regret as to having done that. I am happy to vote \non the continuing resolution, something that has 80 or more sponsors.\n  I am happy to have all these votes. In fact, we can do the debate \ntonight on the containment resolution and the Paul amendment. But \nunderstand this: We are not separating the vote on the CR and a piece \nof legislation that groups around this country have been trying to get \ndone for years. It has been held up here. As I have said before, \neverything shouldn't be a fight here.\n  The Senator from Montana, Mr. Tester, has assembled a broad package \nof bipartisan legislation that has wide-ranging support from \nRepublicans. They are noted publicly in publications here saying they \nsupport it. They will vote for it. It has the support of sportsmen \nthroughout this country. Getting to vote on this bill should not have \nto be a big fight. This is the sort of thing we ought to be able to \nsimply vote on, and we are going to do that. But we are not going to \nseparate the two. We are going to have a vote on the CR; immediately \nthereafter, we will have a vote on the motion to proceed to the \nsportsmen's bill.\n  We can get the debate out of the way tonight. We can vote tomorrow. \nIf not, we are going to vote tomorrow after midnight. That will take \ncare of one vote, and the next will be sometime Sunday morning.\n  We are not having these votes today, so everyone should understand. \nWe are not going to do that for the reasons I have already indicated. \nSo if we want to do this, we can do it early in the morning--that is \nfine with me--or we can wait until tomorrow night after midnight and \nthen come in Sunday morning.\n  So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, just so everybody in the Senate will \nunderstand, both Democrats and Republicans, I just offered the consent \nthe majority leader himself was trying to get last night.\n  Senate Republicans are prepared to finish the continuing resolution \ntoday, prepared to vote on the Rand Paul proposal today, and prepared \nto vote on the Lindsey Graham proposal today. That was acceptable to \nthe majority leader; it is not acceptable to him today. Obviously, \nsomething changed over on that side of the aisle.\n  So I just want everybody to understand that I and all the members of \nmy conference are prepared to finish the business of the Senate that \nwas before the Senate at the suggestion of the majority leader as \nrecently as last night.\n  Mr. REID. While we are educating Senators, I would like to add a \nlittle to that.\n  We are willing to vote on all these things, but we will do it \ntomorrow, not today. We want the debate to go forward. We are in very \nimportant Senate races across the country.\n  So we will vote early in the morning, get all the debate out of the \nway or we will do it tomorrow night after midnight because we are not \ngoing to separate the sportsmen's bill from the rest of the stuff for \nobvious reasons.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would only add that is a new development here that \nthe majority leader is saying.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, there has been no new development. \nEveryone--Republican staff, Democratic staff, all my caucus--has known \nfor a long time that we are going to have a vote on this sportsmen's \npackage. This is no new development.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we have a very important matter at 4 \ntoday. The Secretary of State is coming to address all of us as to what \nis going on in the Middle East and around the world. There will be \nintelligence officers here and a lot of other people. So I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate recess from 4 to 5 today to \naccommodate this very important Senators-only briefing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is my understanding we have a couple \nSenators who would like to speak before that.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. REID. I have no problem with the Senator from Texas speaking. I \nask unanimous consent that Senator Cornyn be recognized for up to 15 \nminutes; and when he completes that, the Senate go into recess for 1 \nhour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the majority leader for his courtesy.\n\n\n                     Labor Force Participation Rate\n\n  Earlier this month, we received another big job report and along with \nit a serious disappointment.\n  The numbers speak for themselves. In August, a remarkable 368,000 \nAmericans left the workforce. They gave up, bringing the labor force \nparticipation rate, as it is known, to its lowest level in more than \nthree decades.\n  Fewer people are looking for work in America than at any time in the \nlast 30 years. That is a national tragedy. The unemployment rate stayed \nabove 8 percent only because they quit counting the people who have \ngiven up. But it had been above 8 percent for the 43rd straight month. \nIf, in fact, the same number of people who were looking for work in \nJanuary of 2009 are still looking for work today, the unemployment rate \nwould be over 11 percent. That was the date President Obama took \noffice, January 20, 2009. So if the same number were looking today as \nwere looking for work then, it would be over 11 percent, to show you \nhow those numbers don't reveal the true pain and the sacrifice of \nAmerican citizens who are looking for work.\n  I don't know of anyone who could look at the August job report or the \nJune or July job numbers and feel good about the economy. I also don't \nknow how they could now support a tax increase when the economy is \ngrowing at a much slower pace, contrary to their position--including \nthe President's position--in December 2010, when the economy was \ngrowing at roughly 3 percent of GDP.\n  Beyond our borders, the Europeans are mired in a debt crisis, the \nChinese economy has slowed down dramatically, and the United States \ncontinues to face major economic headwinds. We can't afford any self-\ninflicted wounds.\n  All I am suggesting is that we maintain the current Federal tax rates \nuntil we can work together in a bipartisan way and adopt real tax \nreform. Yet the President occasionally calls that position extreme--\nironically, the same position he, himself, held in December of 2010, as \nI said just a moment ago.\n  It seems the President does not always understand or appreciate the \nstrong connection between taxes and economic incentives on small \nbusinesses and other people we are depending upon to create businesses \nor to grow existing businesses and create jobs and to put Americans \nback to work.\n  We need look no further than the 2010 health care law, the law that \nwent to the U.S. Supreme Court. Two aspects of it were found \nunconstitutional but not the tax on middle-class Americans.\n  In addition to that middle-class tax increase, the law contains a new \nexcise\n\n[[Page S6509]]\n\ntax on medical device manufacturers that will discourage companies from \nbuilding factories and creating jobs in the United States. That is not \njust my conclusion.\n  For example, Cook Medical, which has roughly 4,000 employees around \nBloomington, IN, recently announced it is canceling five new \nmanufacturing plants it had scheduled to open over the next half \ndecade. A senior official estimated the new medical device tax will \ncost his firm between $20 million and $30 million extra each year. That \nis why they are shuttering those additional five plants and killing \nthose potential new jobs.\n  Another medical device company in another part of the country--New \nYork--Welch Allyn, recently announced it will be slashing 10 percent of \nits global workforce in response to this new tax.\n  All of this is, sadly, predictable and it is common sense. \nUnfortunately, common sense doesn't seem, to most Americans, to prevail \nor to be all that common in Washington, DC, these days. But if we raise \nthe taxes on these medical devices, it is only logical, it is only \nreasonable, it is only common sense to expect that these companies will \nproduce fewer jobs and, in the process, less innovation.\n  The irony of this discussion over taxes is we now have a growing \nbipartisan consensus in Congress and in Washington, DC, about the need \nfor commonsense tax reform that would broaden the base, lower the \nrates, and help grow the economy by creating the proper incentives.\n  That was the recommendation of the President's own bipartisan fiscal \ncommission, the Simpson-Bowles Commission in December 2010--the \nPresident's own bipartisan fiscal commission--where Republicans and \nDemocrats agreed this is a good place to start in reforming our broken \nTax Code, paying down the debt, and getting our country and our economy \ngrowing again. It was also the recommendation of the Domenici-Rivlin \npanel, another bipartisan panel. Both recommended a more logical, more \nequitable, more growth-oriented Tax Code.\n  Why, we may ask, is tax reform so urgent? Earlier this month the \nWorld Economic Forum released its new ``Global Competitiveness \nReport.'' America is not alone in trying to create jobs and grow our \neconomy. We are competing with other economies and other countries \naround the world. As recently as 2008, the United States was ranked the \nmost competitive country on the planet.\n  In the latest index, we fell to seventh. We are heading in the wrong \ndirection when it comes to competing in a global economy for the jobs \nso that Americans can work and provide for their families and put food \non their tables and gain the dignity that goes along with working and \nproviding for your family.\n  Harvard Business School also surveyed 10,000 of its alumni to find \nout their views of America's competitiveness. At Harvard Business \nSchool, one of the premier business schools in the country, alarmingly \n71 percent of those who responded said America would become less \ncompetitive during the next few years. In other words, they were not \noptimistic about the direction of the country when it came to \ncompetitiveness and job creation. One of the biggest reasons for their \npessimism is the bewildering complexity of our Tax Code. A large \nmajority said the tax complexity is either ``much worse'' or ``somewhat \nworse'' in the United States than it was in other developed countries. \nThat is why Americans now spend hundreds of billions of dollars on tax \ncompliance, because of a broken, unnecessarily complex and impenetrable \nTax Code--unless you have the money to hire armies of lawyers and \naccountants to help you figure it out.\n  One more point about our Tax Code. Over time, our Tax Code has become \nlarded with special provisions and tax expenditures that represent what \nhas come to be known as crony capitalism. In other words, the Federal \nGovernment just doesn't spend money, the Federal Government has a Tax \nCode that benefits certain industries and sectors of the economy. Some \nof them we would largely agree on--such as the mortgage interest \ndeduction or the interest you pay on your home mortgage. There is broad \nsupport for that, although everyone realizes we need to get all of \nthese on the table. That is what Simpson-Bowles recommended. Let's get \n$1 trillion or more of these special tax expenditures on the table and \nlook at the ones that still make sense and the ones we should do away \nwith. As long as the Tax Code is as complicated as ours is, it is a \ndrag on the economy. It promotes a culture of corruption, where people \ncome to Congress and they lobby for special tax provisions that are not \navailable to the broad population that benefit them. It seeks \nfavoritism and rent-seeking, with companies and industries that try to \ngain competitive advantages through tax subsidies.\n  If we want businesses to spend more time in productive activity and \nless time begging the government for tax breaks, we need to fix the \nbroken Tax Code with a flatter, fairer, more transparent system which \nencourages working and saving and investing--not lobbying here in \nWashington, DC, for special breaks. If we want our tax laws to be \nrespected and understood, they need to be clearer, simpler, and more \nequitable.\n  Given how much President Obama talks about fairness of the Tax Code, \nyou would think he would be all over this. You might expect he would be \nan eager champion for tax reform. Instead, the President wants to use \nthe Tax Code as an ATM machine to subsidize particular industries and \ninterest groups while punishing others. We need to get them all on the \ntable, bring them all out into the light of day and address all of \nthese special tax provisions so we can simplify and make more fair our \ntax system, unleashing the growth potential of the entrepreneurial \nAmerican economy to create jobs and prosperity that is sadly lacking \nnow in the current environment.\n  Unfortunately, President Obama, rather than attack this issue of \ncrony capitalism, has promoted it. During the long government-run \nChrysler bankruptcy process, the company-secured bondholders received \nless for their loans--29 cents per dollar--than the United Auto Workers \npension funds. They got 40 cents on the dollar. The UAW pension funds, \nmind you, were unsecured creditors, entitled to less priority than the \nbondholders, who were entitled to the highest priority, but because of \nthe way this was manipulated, the bondholders got 29 cents on the \ndollar, the union got 40 cents on the dollar.\n  During the automobile bailouts President Obama let politics trump the \nrule of law. What do I mean by that? I believe that rather than let the \nrule of law apply, he injected politics and favoritism in the process. \nIn his energy policy, which I alluded to a moment ago, he put politics \nbefore his fiduciary responsibility to the American taxpayer. We agree \nthat the Federal Government has a role in funding, through the research \nand development tax credit and other ways, basic scientific research to \npromote innovation. But the President and Congress should not be using \nyour tax dollars to make risky, politically motivated investments that \nbenefit specific companies or industries at your expense.\n  Solyndra offers the most conspicuous example. This now bankrupt solar \nenergy firm received a $535 million loan guarantee from the Federal \nGovernment. According to the Washington Post, the Obama administration \n``remained steadfast in its support for Solyndra,'' even after being \n``warned that financial disaster might lie ahead.'' Then, as Solyndra \nwent bankrupt, the administration violated the law by making taxpayers \nsubordinate to private lenders.\n  In other words, even though the taxpayers gave a $535 million loan \nguarantee to this company that went bankrupt, the ones who ended up \ntaking it in the neck were the taxpayers rather than the private \nlenders who should have been subordinated to the taxpayers when it \ncomes to getting paid. If President Obama is as concerned as he claims \nabout dicey investments with taxpayer money, he should repudiate these \nkinds of boondoggles and let the market work to allocate capital. \nWashington should not be picking economic winners and losers.\n  Speaking of winners and losers, the Department of Health and Human \nServices granted a series of 1- and 3-\n\n[[Page S6510]]\n\nyear waivers from the annual limit requirements contained in the \nPresident's 2010 health care law. These waivers fostered the impression \nthat certain companies, unions, and institutions would be exempted and \ngiven preferential treatment.\n  The health-care law thus highlighted an inconvenient truth about big \ngovernment: Any dramatic increase in federal regulations and \nbureaucratic authority will lead to a dramatic increase in rent-seeking \nand crony capitalism.\n  Finally, a word about the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. Democrats argue that \nDodd-Frank ended ``too big to fail.'' In fact, it codified too big to \nfail, because certain companies will now formally be identified as \n``systemically important.''\n  Are we really supposed to believe that ``systemically important'' \ncompanies will be allowed to collapse? The more likely scenario is that \nthese firms will be viewed as too big to fail--both by investors and by \nfederal officials--the way Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were.\n  As University of Pennsylvania law professor David Skeel has written:\n\n       The companies that are cordoned off as systemically \n     important distort the credit markets, as a result of the \n     Fannie Mae effect. Because these institutions can raise \n     capital more cheaply than financial institutions that do not \n     enjoy implicit government protection, they have a competitive \n     advantage over smaller institutions. This may dampen \n     innovation in the financial system and lead to inefficient \n     allocation of credit to nonfinancial businesses.\n\n  In short, regardless of what Democrats may think, Dodd-Frank has \nactually strengthened the nexus between Washington and Wall Street.\n  The rise of crony capitalism under President Obama has led many \npeople to question America's commitment to free markets and the rule of \nlaw. Likewise, the President's failure to revive our economy has led to \nwidespread pessimism about America's future. I firmly believe we can \nturn things around and restore our global reputation, and I firmly \nreject the notion that our decline is inevitable. There is no reason we \ncan't rejuvenate the Great American Jobs Machine and return to \nprosperity. But it won't happen until we get much better leadership \nfrom the White House.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6510-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          State of the Economy\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 4 years ago our economy was in a free \nfall. AIG had been bailed out, and Lehman Brothers plunged into \nbankruptcy. The depth of the recession we fell into is difficult to \nunderstate.\n  With the economy contracting at nearly 9 percent in the last few \nmonths of 2008 and nearly 700,000 jobs lost every month, it is not an \nexaggeration to call the crisis we faced the worst since the Great \nDepression. Demand dried up as our financial system collapsed, families \nstruggled to pay the bills, and millions lost their homes to \nforeclosure. Our unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent nationally and \n11.4 percent in Illinois.\n  It has been a hard road back to stable economic ground, but things \nhave turned around. Private sector businesses are hiring again and have \nbeen for 30 straight months. Between July 2011 and July 2012, the \neconomy added an average of 153,000 jobs every month--about 1.8 million \njobs. Compare that to the average monthly losses of 544,000 between \nJuly 2008 and July 2009.\n  There is a lot of work still to be done. We all would like to see \nmore jobs created, but it is clear our economy is better off and we are \nbetter off than we were 4 years ago.\n  I saw many examples of our economic progress as I have traveled my \nState. The Nucor steel plant in Bourbonnais, IL, makes rebar and angle \niron that is used in construction across the country. What makes Nucor \nunique is that during the recession when many other companies were \nshedding employees, Nucor made a commitment to keep all of their full-\ntime employees. It wasn't easy. When demand slowed, the company's idle \nworkers developed new products for customers or they were actually, in \nmany cases, sent out to work in the community on service projects as \nthey waited for their company to get back into business.\n  During this time the Bourbonnais facility applied for and received \nthe Department of Labor's Voluntary Protection Program star \ncertification, recognizing their extraordinary efforts to improve \nworkplace safety. Nucor made a commitment not just to the bottom line \nbut to its workers and to the communities where they lived. It has paid \noff. Demand has returned, and the company is now firing on all \ncylinders, employing roughly 300 workers.\n  I have visited a lot of different production facilities. There was \nnothing more jaw-dropping than to stand in that steel mill and watch \nthese three poles go into a caldron of scrap metal, burst and explode \ninto flames, and then watch steel come trickling out of the bottom into \nthese forms to make rebar and angle iron.\n  Earlier this summer I also met with the CEO of Woodward, an aerospace \nand energy firm, about its possible expansion of a facility in Loves \nPark, IL. Woodward was considering two locations for expanding its \nairline turbine product line. In the end, thank goodness for us, \nWoodward picked Illinois. The company is investing more than $200 \nmillion in the facility, and it is estimated that it will add 600 new \njobs over the next 5 years.\n  There is more to the story. While growing demand led to the expansion \ndecision, it was the infrastructure and skilled workers that sealed the \ndeal for Loves Park. Loves Park and the Rockford area has been the home \nof aerospace companies for decades. Yet they made a concerted effort to \ngrow and expand the training opportunities to meet modern workforce \nneeds. Through a public-private partnership, the community has created \nan atmosphere that attracts new business investments and new jobs.\n  Illinois is about the last place--and southern Illinois certainly the \nlast place--one would expect to find a world-leading firm in oilspill \ncleanups, but if one goes to Fairfield and Carmi, IL, that is what one \nwill find. The Elastec/American Marine Company specializes in equipment \nto clean up environmental accidents, specifically oilspills. In two \nformer Wal-Mart buildings in those towns, 140 employees have developed \nnew technologies that have expanded our ability to clean up oilspills \naround the world. Just last year, the company won a $1 million X PRIZE \nfor recovering more than 2,500 gallons per minute--triple the \nindustry's previous best recovery rate in controlled conditions. This \nis in southern Illinois. Testing oilspill cleanup in southern Illinois \nis hard to imagine. Elastec's equipment was used for cleanups during \nboth Exxon Valdez and the more recent gulf spill.\n  This is American ingenuity at its best, but the business is driven by \nregulations governing the discharge of oil. Without these ``job-\nkilling'' regulations, the company, its jobs, and the technology it \nuses to clean up oilspills probably wouldn't exist.\n\n[[Page S6511]]\n\n  I also visited Akorn--not the ACORN that has been debated at length \non the floor of the Senate. Akorn, spelled with a ``k,'' is a \npharmaceutical company in Decatur, IL, which manufactures products such \nas drugstore eye drops and liquid injectables used in surgery. Akorn \nemploys 500 people in Illinois at facilities in Decatur, Lake Forest, \nSkokie, and Gurnee.\n  Since 2009 the company has been one of Chicago's and Illinois' \nfastest growing public companies. In 2011, Akorn launched a \nmultimillion-dollar expansion at its two Decatur facilities. They have \ndoubled production and added 100 jobs. They are looking to hire another \n20 to 25 people with backgrounds in finance, production, chemistry, \nmicrobiology, engineering, and business. These are highly technical, \ngood-paying jobs right in central Illinois.\n  One of my last stops in August was at the Chrysler plant in \nBelvidere. What a great story. Only 3 years ago there was a serious \nconcern that this plant was going away. At the time Chrysler was facing \nbankruptcy and the plant was building a now defunct model, the Dodge \nCaliber, and different models of the Jeep. Plant production had slowed \nto a single shift, and employment had dropped to as low as 200 people.\n  The Federal Government offered a bridge loan and helped to facilitate \na merger with Fiat. With government assistance, Chrysler has emerged \nfrom bankruptcy and is profitable. In October 2010, Chrysler announced \na nearly $700 million investment at the Belvidere plant to retool for \nthe production of a new Dodge Dart. The plant reached full production \nin July of this year, now employing 4,698 workers. If the auto industry \nhad been allowed to collapse, between 1.1 million and 3.3 million jobs \nwould have been lost between 2009 and 2011.\n  These are stories of businesses in my home State. I asked my staff to \nfind businesses that survived the recession or are expanding and hiring \npeople. I want to hear their stories and listen to the stories of all \nkinds of different businesses, large and small, expanding today--\nbusinesses that weathered the recession and are now successful. \nBusiness is picking up. These businesses are hiring people back, in \nsome cases expanding.\n  Their stories aren't unique. Across America, 30 consecutive months of \nprivate sector job growth tells us we are moving in the right \ndirection. In that time 4.6 million private sector jobs have been \ncreated. In Illinois alone 140,400 private sector jobs have been added \nsince January 2010. Manufacturing employment has rapidly grown, adding \n44,600 or 37 percent of 140,400 jobs.\n  During the last quarter of 2008, the economy was shrinking at a rate \nof nearly 9 percent. It was in free fall. During the most recent \nquarter the economy is growing on the positive side--1.7 percent. In \nMarch of 2009 the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen to 6,547. \nSince then it has nearly doubled to almost 13,000 today.\n  New home sales were up 3.6 percent in July. That is 25 percent over \nlast year. U.S. goods and services exports increased .9 percent from \nMay 2012 to June 2012 and have increased by 5.9 percent from the same \ntime period last year.\n  The American people see these facts and figures. They also feel the \nimprovement in their communities, with new businesses opening, and on \ntheir blocks, with the housing market recovering as well. We are much \nbetter off than we were 4 years ago. Now is not the time to go back to \npolicies that brought us into this recession but to move forward, \ncreating even more jobs and expanding more businesses.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the United States has led the world in \ncreating the legal framework, building the infrastructure, and \ndesigning facilities that ensure inclusion and opportunity for people \nliving with disabilities.\n  Just recently we celebrated the 22nd anniversary of the ADA--\nAmericans with Disabilities Act--by reporting a treaty out of the \nForeign Relations Committee on a strong bipartisan basis. Members of \nthis body now have an opportunity to affirm our Nation's leadership on \ndisability issues by ratifying this treaty. I hope we will do so with \nstrong bipartisan support that has always characterized the Senate's \nwork on disability issues.\n  Everyone knows the story of when Bob Dole, a disabled veteran from \nWorld War II, and Tom Harkin, his Democratic colleague from Iowa, with \na disabled member of his family, came together to create the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act. It was an extraordinary bipartisan effort. It \ndid our Nation proud. It gave to disabled people a chance to be in the \nmainstream and part of America.\n  One of the people it helped, in addition to 54 million Americans \nliving with a disability, was a fellow named Bob Greenberg. Bob \nGreenberg was the legendary sportscaster who rose to prominence at \nChicago's WBEZ radio station.\n  At the apex of his career, Bob offered color commentary for Chicago's \nmajor sporting events. He interviewed the very best athletes. He \nanalyzed the players. He rifled off stats and box scores that put the \ngame in context.\n  For his loyal and large Chicago radio audience, Bob Greenberg \ndescribed sporting events they couldn't see. Bob's story is unique \nbecause he couldn't see the games either. Bob Greenberg was blind, but \nhe never let it stop him from achieving his dreams. There is no doubt \nthat laws such as the ADA helped make Bob's road to achieving his dream \na little bit smoother. We lost Bob to cancer last summer, but we will \nnever lose the power of his life and his life's story.\n  Most of us don't give a second thought to crossing the street, \nreading the newspaper, or describing things we have seen. But for Bob \nand millions like him, our Nation's commitment to equal access for \nthose living with disabilities has literally expanded their world.\n  Now we have an opportunity to once again demonstrate our commitment \nand advance disability rights around the world by ratifying the \nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The support for \nthis treaty is broad and bipartisan.\n  I wish to thank my friend, Senator John McCain of Arizona. He is \nleading this effort with me to pass this Convention on Disabilities. He \nis a great ally. Without him we wouldn't have reached this point. I \nwish to also thank Senators John Barrasso, Tom Harkin, Tom Udall, Jerry \nMoran, and Chris Coons for their bipartisan support and dedication to \nratification.\n  This treaty is supported by 165 disabilities organizations, including \nthe most prominent, the U.S. International Council on Disabilities, and \nmany others. In addition, 21 veterans groups came and testified. They \nwere the earliest witnesses, and for obvious reasons. Disabled veterans \nknow the limits on life and how important it is to have countries such \nas the United States and countries around the world opening doors, \nliterally, for them to the future.\n  The Wounded Warrior Project supports it, as does the American Legion, \nthe Disabled American Veterans, and Veterans of Foreign Wars, and they \nare all calling on us to ratify this treaty.\n  President George H.W. Bush signed the ADA into law.\n  Former Senator Bob Dole, as I mentioned, a lifelong advocate for \ndisability rights, strongly supports this treaty. The Convention on the \nRights of Persons with Disabilities is a human rights treaty that seeks \nto ensure that people living with disabilities have the same \nopportunities as others.\n  Thanks to the ADA and similar laws, the United States has been so \nsuccessful at providing opportunities, increasing accessibility, and \nprotecting the rights of the disabled, our Nation today is in full \ncompliance with every term of the treaty I am bringing to the floor.\n  Before transmitting this treaty, the Obama administration conducted \nan exhaustive comparison of the treaty's requirements to current U.S. \nlaw. Their conclusion was that the United States does not need to pass \nany new laws or regulations in order to meet the terms of the treaty.\n  The fact that we already meet or exceed the treaty's requirements is \na testament to our Nation's bipartisan commitment to equality and \nopportunity for those living with disabilities. So why would we ratify \na treaty if it is not going to change life in the United States or put \nany new requirements on the United States?\n  Well, there are more than 5.5 million veterans living with \ndisabilities--\n\n[[Page S6512]]\n\nAmerican veterans. They and thousands of other Americans live with \ndisabilities, but they travel, study, work and serve overseas, often \nwith their families. Ratifying this treaty will help to ensure that \nthey enjoy the same accessibility and opportunity they do right here at \nhome.\n  Ratifying this treaty will give the United States a well-deserved \nseat at the international table so that the United States can provide \nits guidance and expertise and experience to other countries working to \nadopt laws, upgrade infrastructure, and modernize facilities to meet \nthe high standards we already set and met.\n  American businesses have invested time and resources to comply with \nthe ADA, the Americans with Disabilities Act. Businesses in some \ncountries are not required to comply with similar standards. Compliance \nwith the treaty levels the playing field by requiring foreign \nbusinesses to meet accessibility standards similar to those already met \nby American businesses. We also lead the world in developing accessible \nproducts and technology. As other countries comply with this treaty on \ndisability, American businesses will be able to export their expertise \nand products to the new markets serving more than 1 billion people \nliving with disabilities around the world.\n  Ratifying this treaty is not only important to the 54 million \nAmericans living with disabilities, it is important to the 10 percent \nof the world's population living with disabilities. The 650 million \npeople living with disabilities around the world are looking to the \nUnited States to join them and show leadership, as we have here at \nhome, on an international basis.\n  Not only do these people around the world courageously live with \ndisabilities, they live with many challenges and hurdles in other \ncountries that might be removed if other countries follow our lead. Let \nme tell you just a few things when it comes to disabilities around the \nworld. Ninety percent of children with disabilities in developing \ncountries do not attend school--90 percent. Less than 25 percent--45 of \nthe 193--of countries in the United Nations have passed laws that \nprohibit discrimination on the basis of a person's disability. Studies \nindicate that women and girls in developing countries are more likely \nthan men to have a disability. Women and girls with disabilities in \ndeveloping countries are more likely to be raped, forcibly sterilized, \nor physically abused.\n  This treaty will help provide the framework so countries around the \nworld can help their own citizens living with disabilities improve, \nlive productive, healthy lives. Just as we did by enacting the ADA 22 \nyears ago, ratifying this treaty will send the world a message that \npeople with disabilities deserve a level playing field.\n  While this treaty will ensure inclusion and access, it is also \nimportant to note what it will not do. The treaty will not require the \nUnited States to appropriate any new funds or resources to comply with \nits terms--not a penny. The treaty will not change any U.S. law or \ncompromise our sovereignty. The treaty will not lead to new lawsuits \nbecause its terms do not create any new rights and it cannot be \nenforced in any U.S. court. For families who choose to educate their \nchildren at home in the United States, the treaty will not change any \ncurrent rights or obligations. I was pleased that the Foreign Relations \nCommittee adopted an amendment I worked on with Senator DeMint to \nclarify that particular issue. Let me add too that leading pro-life \ngroups, such as the National Right to Life Committee, confirm that the \ntreaty does not promote, expand access, or create any right to an \nabortion. Senator McCain, in his testimony before the committee, made \nthat eminently clear. He is pro-life. This treaty has no impact on that \nissue.\n  Thanks to decades of bipartisan cooperation, our country embodies the \nworldwide gold standard for those living with disabilities. When the \nSenate ratifies the Convention on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities, we can be proud that our coworkers, friends, family \nmembers, and courageous veterans will soon enjoy the same access and \nopportunity when they travel abroad that they have come to expect here \nat home.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider Executive Calendar No. 6, Treaty Document \n112-7; that the treaty be considered as having advanced through the \nvarious parliamentary stages up to and including the presentation of \nthe resolution of ratification; that any committee declarations be \nagreed to as applicable; that any statements be printed in the Record \nas if read; further, that when the vote on the resolution of \nratification is taken, the motion to reconsider be considered made and \nlaid upon the table; that the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would like \nto take just a few moments to explain why I plan to object.\n  I have right here a letter that is signed by 36 Members of this body \nwho express the viewpoint that because of the prerogative we have as \nU.S. Senators to ratify treaties--see, two-thirds of us have to provide \nour advice and consent to ratify a treaty before it can take effect. \nThis is important, in part because article VI, section 2 tells us that \nonce ratified, the treaty becomes the supreme law of the land.\n\n  We have 36 Senators on this letter--a letter addressed to Leader \nMcConnell and Leader Reid--explaining that for various reasons we do \nnot think any treaty should come up for ratification during the \nlameduck period of the 112th Congress, and we explain that no treaty \nshould be brought up during this time period and conclude that we will \noppose efforts to consider any treaty during this time period.\n  The primary reason cited in the letter is the fact that it is very \nimportant to make sure we have a full understanding of what these \ntreaties mean. It is also important that before we undertake any \nsignificant changes to the law--law becoming supreme law of the land--\nwe need to understand the implications of these treaties fully.\n  If it is true, as 36 Members of this body concur in this letter, that \nit is too fast to move something like this or another treaty through \nduring the lameduck session of the 112th Congress, it follows a \nfortiori that it is also too fast to do it now. With regard to this \nparticular treaty, we have had exactly one--and only one--hearing on \nthis, on July 26 of this year.\n  I appreciate and respect the words of my friend, my distinguished \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Illinois, and I am pleased with the \nfact that he is comfortable with the language of the treaty. I and some \nof my colleagues are not yet comfortable with it, and I and some of my \ncolleagues are not yet convinced as to the full ramifications of the \nlanguage of this proposed treaty. I, therefore, object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to respond to my colleague, \nSenator Lee. Repeatedly he said we should not consider this in the \nlameduck session. We are not in a lameduck session. This is the regular \nsession of the Senate. We do precious little in this regular session, \nand now the Senator is saying we should not do it in the lameduck \nsession. We are not in a lameduck session.\n  And I might say that this treaty has been out there for review for \nmonths. It had a full review before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. Senator Kerry called it. The Senator was there and other \nMembers were there and had a chance to go through it page by page and \noffer amendments, which many Senators did. So to argue that this is \nsomehow being sprung on the Members of the Senate without time to \nreview it is to ignore the obvious.\n  We are not in a lameduck session. This was produced for review and \namendment in a full hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and a vote was taken.\n  It is disappointing. We had hoped to do this and do it now because \nmany of the supporters of this treaty are facing their own physical \nchallenges. One of them is our former colleague, Senator Bob Dole. \nTwenty-two years ago, he led the fight for the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. When Senator John McCain took this up, he said: I am \ngoing to call Bob Dole first. And he did.\n\n[[Page S6513]]\n\n  In his honor, I hope the Senator from Utah will reconsider his \nposition. And now, before the lameduck session, perhaps we can have \nsome communication, and perhaps there is a way we can ratify this \ntreaty in the Senate. We do precious little in the Senate. To do this, \nat least to honor Senator Dole, is not too much to ask, not to mention \nthe positive impact it will have on so many disabled people around the \nworld. I know Senator Lee is a conservative, but I also know he has a \nheart and I know he cares, as I do, about these people--children in \nother countries who have no chance in life because of a disability, \nwomen discriminated against because of disabilities. These are things \non which we should speak out.\n  We are proud to be Americans, but we are doubly proud of the values \nwe stand and fight for. This is one we should fight for.\n  I see Senator Harkin on the floor. I am going to yield. He has been, \nliterally, the leader on our side of the aisle on disability issues \ntime and time again, and I thank him for his help on this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I truly am sorry to see this happen on the \nSenate floor, I say to my good friend from Utah.\n  This has been a long time coming. The Convention on the Rights of \nPersons with Disabilities started here, started in America. It started \nwith the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. \nNinety-one Senators voted yea on that--strongly supported by \nconservatives, liberals, moderates, understanding that we had to take \nthat next step in having a broad civil rights law that covered people \nwith disabilities in our society. After that was passed and during the \n1990s, it became clear that it kind of ignited a conscience around the \nworld that we needed to do something globally about people with \ndisabilities. So really the United States sort of became the leader in \npromoting this Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities at \nthe United Nations. In fact, I have a quote I would share with my \nfriend. When President Bush signed the bill on July 26, 1990--and we \nwere all gathered at the White House--here is what he said:\n\n       This historic act is the world's first comprehensive \n     declaration of equality for people with disabilities--the \n     first. Its passage has made the United States the \n     international leader on this human rights issue.\n\n  So starting after that, our diplomats and others started working on \nthis issue, and so this convention was developed through the United \nNations. I do not know all the wherewithal of how that was done, but it \nwas done and we had great input.\n  So now the convention has come out. It was sent to us a couple of \nyears ago. Under our laws, the President, whoever it might be, has to \nsend that out to all of the departments and agencies to see whether \nthere are any conflicts of laws or did we have to change any of our \nlaws to comport with this convention. Well, that bureaucracy takes a \nwhile. That took a couple of years to wind through. I do not know when \nthe President got it back, but he sent it down to us this spring, and \nthe finding was that the administration made it clear that through all \nof this, the ratification of this convention will not require any \nchange in U.S. law and will have no fiscal impact. So it does not \nrequire any change in our laws. That makes sense because we are the \nleader in the world on disability law. We are the leader.\n  Senator McCain and I were the two leadoff witnesses when the Foreign \nRelations Committee had their hearing.\n  But we were not the only ones. Boyden Gray, who was so very helpful \nin 1990 in getting the initial ADA passed through the Congress, was \nthere. He testified. Senator Dole sent a letter. He could not show up \nin person. Former Attorney General Thornburgh testified. Steve \nBartlett, who was a Congressman from Dallas, later left the House, \nbecame mayor of Dallas, and now I think he is the executive director of \nthe Business Council here, testified and has been instrumental in not \nonly helping us pass the ADA but passing the ADA Act amendments of 2008 \nwhich the second President Bush signed into law.\n  I say this to my friend from Utah. This is not something that sort of \npopped up overnight. This has been a long time coming. A lot of effort \nhas been put into it. As I said, all the departments have said there is \nno conflict with our laws. We do not have to change anything.\n  I also say to my friend that we do want to be that city on the hill, \nthat shining city on the hill. This is one area in which the United \nStates has no equal. We have taken the lead in the world on this issue. \nCountries come to us to see how they can do something, what they can do \nfor people with disabilities. One hundred sixteen nations have already \nsigned it, and the European Union. If we do not sign it, then when \nother countries have to change their laws to comport with this \nconvention, I think we should be at the table. We should be there with \nthem, sharing with them what we have done in America to make \naccommodations better, to make education accessible to people with \ndisabilities, employment, all of those things. If we do not sign it, we \nare not going to be a part of that. Yet the rest of the countries are \nlooking to us for leadership. So we should be at the table.\n  One other thing I would say to my friend from Utah is, we are a very \nmobile people. We travel around the world a lot. More and more people \nwith disabilities are traveling, veterans with disabilities, \nnonveterans. And yet how many times have I heard from people who have \ntraveled overseas say: Gosh, I wanted to go here, I wanted to go there, \nbut because I have a disability I could not get around? It would be \nnice if other countries did this.\n  Well, other countries have now signed on to it. I was hoping we could \nvote and we could be a part of it and we could be a part of helping \nother countries to change their systems and to be more accommodating \nfor people with disabilities. Quite frankly, I must say to my friend \nfrom Utah, I am perplexed, I really am, as to why this is an issue. I \ndo not know why there is an objection. Maybe there is something I do \nnot understand. I thought I did. But maybe there is something I do not \nknow that the Senator can enlighten me on as to why we should not bring \nthis up. I suppose if someone wants to vote against it, they can. It \ntakes a two-thirds vote of the Senate to pass this.\n  I am perplexed as to why we cannot do this. It seems to be so \nbipartisan. It seems to me to be so much above the political fray. I do \nnot know the politics in this whatsoever. So I had assumed we would \nbring this up and pass it. I was not aware this was going to happen \nthis way. I was in my office when I was alerted to this. So I say, I do \nnot know why we cannot bring this up and have a small debate on it and \nvote on it.\n  I have more to say, but I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, with great respect to my distinguished \ncolleagues who are supporting this treaty and supporting a move to move \nit to the floor for a full vote right now, I understand and appreciate \nthat they may not share some of the concerns expressed in this letter, \nconcerns surrounding the fact that treaties, once ratified, become the \nlaw of the land, the supreme law of the land, concerns surrounding the \nfact that many Americans may have concerns about this, concerns that \nmay be expressed during the upcoming election season.\n  To the extent this becomes a matter of debate, it may have an impact \non the election. I think this might have been part of what motivated 36 \nSenators to sign this letter saying that neither this treaty nor any \nother treaty ought to be voted upon during the lameduck session.\n  With regard to the comment made by my friend from Illinois, the \nsenior Senator from Illinois moments earlier, I, of course, understand \nwe are not now in a lameduck session. That is my entire point. If it is \ntrue that the lameduck session is too soon to consider treaties, it \nfollows a fortiori, it is a much stronger point to make the point now \nthat it is too soon to consider this now.\n  With regard to the Law of the Sea Treaty, we have held a number of \nhearings--I cannot remember exactly how many--in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. I want to say at least three, four, maybe five, this year. \nWe have had exactly one hearing on this one. I understand that some of \nmy colleagues\n\n[[Page S6514]]\n\nmight be satisfied with the assurances provided by some lawyers within \nthe State Department to the effect that this is entirely compatible \nwith U.S. law to the effect that it would not impose any additional, \nnew, different obligations on U.S. law. I am not satisfied that that is \nthe case. I therefore object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I do not know what it would take to \nsatisfy my friend from Utah. It goes out to all of the departments. \nThey have to analyze this. They took over a year, almost 2 years, to do \nthis, to find out if there were any conflicts with laws. So if you go \nthrough all of that, and all the departments report back and they \ncannot find any conflicts of laws or any laws we have that need to be \nchanged, I do not know what would satisfy the Senator from Utah. What \ncould that possibly be? He is almost raising an impossible barrier, \nunless the Senator can inform us as to what it would be that would \nsatisfy him.\n  I do not know what else you could do other than what has been done on \nthis bill. Again, I can understand people saying they had a hearing on \nit. I think it was well attended. But as I said, this is not something \nthat sprung up overnight. This has been in the works for a number of \nyears. To think that here we are the world's leader on this issue. I \ndid not understand all the Senator said. He said something about it \ncould have an effect on the election or something like that. I have no \nidea what he is talking about. If there is truly a nonpartisan, \nbipartisan issue, it is this. We have always made it thus.\n  When we passed the Americans with Disabilities Act, it was truly \nbipartisan. When the Supreme Court made their decisions in the Sutton \ncase, the Sutton trilogy in the Toyota case in the late 1990s, early \n2000, that kind of threw a monkey wrench into the works on employment \nin terms of disability, it caused a lot of consternation in the \ndisability community and in the business community. We had to right \nthat. We had to kind of tell the Supreme Court what we meant.\n\n  Well, that was in 2001. It took us 7 years of working with \nRepublicans and Democrats and the administration, everybody. But in \n2008 we passed a bill in the Senate unanimously, passed it in the House \nunanimously. President George Bush, the second Bush, signed it into \nlaw. I was down there for it. The first President Bush who signed the \ninitial Americans with Disabilities Act was there. We were there with \nRepublicans and Democrats. It was not seen as any kind of an issue.\n  If I am not mistaken, 2008 was an election year. And yet President \nBush did not say, we cannot sign this because there is an election. \nThis has nothing do with politics. So I find it almost bizarre that the \nSenate cannot act on something so close to us as a people, something we \nhave taken such a lead on, something which means so much in terms of \nour leadership globally, that we cannot act on this.\n  Again, so many people have taken the lead. Senator Durbin and \nChairman Kerry of Foreign Relations, Senator McCain, Senator Barrasso, \nSenator Moran, Senator Lugar, Senator Udall, Senator Coons, many \nbipartisans have been working on this.\n  I admit, obviously I have a deep interest in this since I was the \nSenate author of the Americans with Disabilities Act. It has been a key \npart of my Senate career for 25 years now--25 years. One of the great \njoys was passing the Americans with Disabilities Act with such \nbipartisan support. Thanks to the ADA, our country is a better place \nfor everyone, not just for people with disabilities but for their \nfamilies, for everyone. I cited earlier what President Bush said when \nhe signed it. He said:\n\n       This historic act is the world's first comprehensive \n     declaration of equality for people with disabilities--the \n     first. Its passage has made the United States the \n     international leader on this human rights issue.\n\n  That is President Bush, 1990. The first. We were the first. We are \nthe international leader on this issue. And now, 116 other nations, the \nEuropean Union, can sign onto this but we cannot? This is truly \nbizarre.\n  Thanks to the ADA and other U.S. laws passed under the umbrella of \nthe ADA, America has shown the rest of the world how to honor the basic \nrights of children and adults with disabilities, how to integrate them \ninto society, how to remove barriers to full participation and \nactivities that we now take for granted. We can take pride in the fact \nthat our support for disability rights has inspired a global movement \nthat led the United Nations to adopt the CRPD, the Convention on the \nRights of People with Disabilities. We led that. Our legal framework \ninfluenced the substance of the convention and is informing its \nimplementation in the 116 countries that have signed and ratified it \nalong with the European Union.\n  As I said, I am grateful for the leadership on both sides of the \naisle; some Senators who were here before but not now, Senator Dole; \nsome who were here who were active in supporting the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, Senator McCain; new Senators, Senator Barrasso, \nSenator Moran, and others. President George Herbert Walker Bush, the \nfirst President Bush, has been an active supporter of the CRPD. His \nWhite House counsel Boyden Gray, his Attorney General Dick Thornburg, \nhave all been enthusiastic supporters of the Senate ratifying the CRPD. \nBy ratifying this convention, the United States will be reaffirming our \ncommitment to our citizens with disabilities.\n  As I said earlier, Americans with disabilities, including disabled \nveterans, should be able to live, travel, study, work abroad with the \nsame freedoms and access that they enjoy here in the United States.\n  As the state parties, these different countries, come together to \ngrapple with the best ways to make progress and remove barriers, we, \nAmerica, should be at the table with them, helping them learn from our \nexperience. As I said, the administration has submitted what they call \nreservations, understandings, and declarations that make clear that \nU.S. ratification of the CRPD will not require any change in U.S. law \nand will have no fiscal impact.\n  I do not know what else you can do to satisfy someone. I would say, \nif people feel that we do not want to take that leadership, then they \ncan vote against it. But at least we ought to bring it up for a debate, \ndiscussion, and vote on the Senate floor. I would say that although \nU.S. ratification will have no impact on our laws, it will not have a \nfiscal impact, my hope is that U.S. ratification will have a moral \nimpact--a moral impact.\n  My hope is we would send a signal to the rest of the world that it is \nnot okay to leave a baby with Downs syndrome by the side of the road to \ndie. It is not okay to warehouse adults with intellectual disabilities \nin institutions, chained to the bars of a cell where their only crime \nis that they have a disability. It is not okay to refuse to educate \nchildren because they are blind or deaf or they use a wheelchair. It is \nnot okay to prevent disabled people from voting or getting married or \nowning property or having children. It is not okay to rebuild the \ninfrastructures in places such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti, and other \nwar-torn or disaster-stricken areas without improving the accessibility \nof the infrastructure at the same time.\n  Former President Reagan frequently talked about America as a city on \na hill, a shining example for the world of a nation that ensures \nopportunity and freedom for all its people. Thanks to our country's \nsuccess in implementing the ADA, advancing that law's great goals of \nfull inclusion and full participation for all our citizens, America \nindeed has become a shining city on a hill for people with disabilities \naround the globe. By ratifying the CRPD, we can affirm our leadership \nin this field. We can give renewed impetus to those striving to emulate \nus. We can give them that renewed emphasis by our example and by \nsitting down with them, if we are signatory to this treaty.\n  Again, I guess I have to recognize there are some Senators who were \nnot part of the bipartisan vote to support it in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. I guess there are some who are not ready to support the \nunanimous consent request before us. My hope, since we are obviously \ncoming to a close, is that we will use the time between now and when we \ncome back in our lameduck session after the election to address any \nissues that have been raised about the CRPD. If Senators have issues \nand want them raised, let us get them out and then let us move forward, \nwhen we come back after the election,\n\n[[Page S6515]]\n\nwith a strong bipartisan vote for us to ratify the CRPD.\n  When we voted on the ADA--the Americans with Disabilities Act--in \n1990, we had 91 Senators. OK, there were nine who didn't vote for it. I \nunderstand that. But 91 Senators voted in support of that historic law.\n  My hope is, when this comes up for a vote after the election, we can \nachieve the same kind of strong bipartisan statement of support for the \nhuman rights of 1 billion people with disabilities around the world. We \nmust reaffirm our leadership on this issue and let the rest of the \nworld know we are not stepping back on this. We are going to maintain \nour support for the dignity and the rights of people with disabilities \nnot only in America but anywhere in the world.\n  I am very sorry we couldn't have brought this up. I haven't done any \nhead counts for any votes, but I think I know most of the Senators are \npeople of good will, and I believe when they look at this and think \nabout it, it is going to get an overwhelming vote of support. So I am \nsorry we couldn't bring it up, but I look forward to passing this when \nwe come back after the election.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Durbin for his \ndetermined support of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities and for his request for the Senate to approve the treaty \ntoday. I appreciate the thought that he has put into the consideration \nof this treaty and the work he has done in advancing the rights of \npersons with disabilities.\n  It has been 22 years since the landmark Americans with Disabilities \nAct knocked down barriers to employment and government services here at \nhome. Now it is time to do the same for Americans with disabilities \nwhen they travel overseas.\n  This is not an issue that pits Republicans against Democrats. The \nForeign Relations Committee approved this treaty in a strong bipartisan \nvote on July 26, the 22nd anniversary of the ADA. I am deeply grateful \nto former Majority Leader Dole and President George Herbert Walker \nBush, who have joined a bipartisan group of Senators, including \nSenators Lugar, Barrasso, Moran, Coons, Durbin, Harkin, and Udall in \nadvocating for such an important cause. Senator Kennedy would be proud \nif he could see us coming together today in support of the Convention \nas we did 2 decades ago in support of the ADA.\n  Members from both sides of the aisle worked hard to achieve this \nmoment. The questions have been answered. The only question that \nremains is whether we will be remembered for approving the Disabilities \nConvention and extending essential protections for the millions of \nAmericans with disabilities, or for finding excuses to delay and defer \nour core responsibility as Senators.\n  I have heard from countless advocates on this issue--from the Perkins \nSchool for the Blind in my home State to disabled Americans and \nveterans groups across the country, all of whom tell me that this \nConvention will make a difference in their daily lives.\n  And, believe me, it will. This Convention will extend essential \nprotections to disabled persons everywhere, including our disabled \nservicemen and women and veterans when they travel, live, study or work \noverseas. It will enshrine the principles of the ADA on the \ninternational level and provide us with a critical tool as we advocate \nfor the adoption of its standards globally.\n  We already live up to the principles of this treaty here in America. \nOur strong laws--including the ADA--are more than sufficient to allow \nus to comply with this treaty from day one. Nothing is going to change \nhere at home. But our delay in joining this treaty has an impact \nabroad.\n  For decades the world has looked to America as a leader on \ndisabilities rights. It is hard to believe but some are now questioning \nour resolve--because of the failure to ratify this treaty. That is not \nacceptable and that is not what America is about.\n  It isn't a question of time. It is a question of priorities--a \nquestion of willpower, not capacity. This treaty reflects our highest \nideals as a nation, and now is the time to act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, Senator Reid was, I think, stung this \nmorning when remarks were made about the failure of the Senate to pass \na budget or to move a single appropriations bill. For the first time in \nover 100 years, I understand, not a single appropriations bill was \nbrought to the floor. This was a decision made by the Democratic \nleadership, to not bring up even a single bill, so that we end up with \na big omnibus CR. The leadership also didn't bring up the Defense \nauthorization bill for the first time in 51 years.\n  Senator McCain explained that yesterday and the day before and he \nexpressed his frustration about it. I was disappointed this morning to \nhear comments from our budget chairman, Kent Conrad, about this \nfrustration and, I believe, truth-telling from Republicans. Senator \nReid said: ``It's a big lie for the Republicans to come here and say we \nhaven't passed a budget.''\n  Let's look at the facts. The law requires the Senate majority to \nproduce a budget, a financial plan, every single year. It is in the \ncode of the United States--a plan that covers taxes, entitlement \nspending, and debt. It is fundamental to the future of our country, and \nthat is why it is required by law, because people saw the need for it. \nThat plan must be produced and voted on in committee and brought to the \nSenate floor.\n  The Republican House put together such a plan. They moved it and \npassed it, but Senate Democrats have no plan. They have proposed \nnothing, offered nothing, put nothing on paper.\n  Senator Reid, our Nation is facing a debt crisis. Surely you agree. \nWhat is your plan? Where is your budget? What is your proposal to \nrescue the finances of this Nation? I haven't seen it, but I am just \nthe ranking Republican on the Budget Committee. The American people \nhaven't seen it. It doesn't exist. The House has a plan. Where is your \nproposal? Have you forgotten that you canceled our Budget Committee \nmarkup on this spring and refused to bring up a budget to the floor \nlast year? What do you plan to do on taxes, on entitlements, on \nwelfare, on spending, on debt? How does your majority plan to balance \nthe budget of this Nation? Do you have a plan? Surely you know the \nspending caps in the Budget Control Act are not a financial plan for \nAmerica.\n  As the magazine Politico put it: ``Democratic leaders have defiantly \nrefused to lay out their own vision for how to deal with Federal debt \nand spending.''\n  Let me say that again. Is there any problem greater for America today \nthan debt and spending? This is what Politico reported not too long \nago. ``Democratic leaders have defiantly refused to lay out their own \nversion of how to deal with Federal debt and spending.''\n  That is exactly right. It is indisputable. We have had the worst \nperformance of a Senate on financial matters in the history of the \ncountry, in my opinion. I can't imagine any Congress being less \nfulfilling of its duty.\n  Speaking on FOX News earlier this year, Chairman Conrad said:\n\n       What we need, I believe, is at least a 10-year plan. That's \n     why I am going to mark up a budget resolution the first week \n     we are back in session.\n\n  That was in April. That markup never happened.\n  This is what The Washington Free Beacon reported:\n\n       Conrad stunned observers Tuesday when he announced that he \n     would not follow through on his expressed intention to offer, \n     mark up and pass a Democratic budget resolution. Many suspect \n     that Conrad's plan was derailed at the last minute by Senator \n     Majority Leader Harry Reid and other Senate Democrats who did \n     not wish to cast politically difficult votes.\n\n  I haven't heard that disputed. There is no dispute that Senator Reid \ndecided, along with the Democratic conference, frankly, we are not \ngoing to bring up a budget. We would have to vote. We would have to lay \nout our plan and then people can look at it and say what is wrong with \nit. We would rather just spend our time attacking their plan. We don't \nwant to show our cards, provide any leadership.\n  That is what happened. Here is what the New York Times reported \nregarding Senator Conrad's canceling of the markup:\n\n       Mr. Conrad's announcement surprised Republicans and \n     Democrats who were expecting him to produce a Democratic \n     budget that, if passed by the committee, would have been the \n     first detailed deficit reduction plan in three years.\n\n\n[[Page S6516]]\n\n\n  That is the way the New York Times reported it, and I say they are \naccurate. That is the way I saw it.\n  Senator Joe Lieberman caucuses with the Democrats and he said he was \n``disappointed by the party's refusal to confront the issue,'' and said \nfurther, ``I don't think the Democrats will offer their own budget, and \nI'm disappointed in that.''\n  Senator Mark Pryor admitted: ``We've had three years with President \nObama where we're not able to get a budget resolution passed.''\n  But it gets worse. Not only have Democratic colleagues failed to do \ntheir duty, they have savagely attacked the House for producing a \nbudget and laying out a plan. Here is what Senator Conrad said today. \nSenator Conrad is a good friend, but give me a break, Senator Conrad. \nHe said the House plan ``fails any moral test of government.'' He said \nthe House plan failed the ``moral test,'' and he repeated that several \ntimes.\n\n  These comments are outrageous. They are inaccurate, but they are also \nhypocritical. I ask: What is the morality of the majority party in this \nSenate that has violated the law purposely and deliberately in order to \navoid presenting a plan to save this Nation from financial disaster? \nThey have deliberately refused to go forward. What about the families \nwho will be impacted by a debt crisis? What about our military? What \nabout our future as a nation? Where is our duty during this defining \nhour of our Republic--America's hour of need? Is there no response and \nno leadership?\n  Every Senate Democrat in every State, I think, will have to explain \nwhy they have not stood up to Senator Reid and his proposal. \nPresumably, they are all in it together. None have actually come to the \nfloor and opposed him and said they would vote to bring up a budget.\n  I know the Senator was stung a bit this morning, but it is not a lie \nto say we didn't have a budget this year, and I know it was painful to \nlisten to the litany of failures of this Congress. First, no budget in \nover 3 years--1,240 days; no appropriations bills this year--not one. \nWe failed to bring up the Defense authorization bill for the first time \nin 50 years. We have failed to confront the sequester and debate how to \nfix it. We know we are going to have to do that. Yet we are going to \nlet it wait until the end of the year, causing great turmoil at the \nDepartment of Defense. We have not dealt with the fiscal cliff.\n  All of those are fundamental things this Senate should have done and \nwe haven't done any of them. We don't even bring up the bills. We \nshould have had a great historic debate for the last 2 years over the \nfuture financial status of America because it is clearly the greatest \nthreat facing our Nation. Yet we haven't had it. We have had little \ngroups meet in secret--gangs and groups and secret committees and \nspecial committees.\n  But this is what I would say about this budget. If I were prosecuting \na case--as I used to when I was a Federal prosecutor--I would say the \ndefendant has confessed. This is what Senator Reid said back in May of \n2011: ``There is no need to have a Democratic budget, in my opinion.''\n  It is not a question of his opinion. It is the law of the United \nStates. Nobody asked his opinion. He has a duty to follow the law, I \nwould think.\n  How about this. He goes on to state: ``It would be foolish for us to \ndo a budget.''\n  Senator Reid, I think, has moved into this modern world--postmodern \nworld--where words mean about anything we want them to mean. We can \njust say it is a lie that we don't have a budget; that we produced a \nbudget and refer to the Budget Control Act, which was simply a part of \nthe compromise to raise the debt ceiling and set some spending limits \non spending in the discretionary accounts only--not all the accounts of \nthe United States. That is not a budget, and the Parliamentarian has \nalready ruled that is not a budget.\n  There is no question we don't have a budget, and we haven't had \nleadership. It has been very disappointing. And I was disappointed to \nhave my good friend Senator Conrad attack the House for having the \ngumption to lay out a plan that would change the debt course of America \nand put us on a path to prosperity. I am sorry Senator Reid has \noverreacted and declared that it is not true what we, the Republicans, \nhave asserted, that we don't have a budget, because we don't have a \nbudget. It is true.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n              Coal Ash Recycling and Oversight Act of 2012\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I rise to speak on energy legislation \nwhich is important to this country and legislation I truly believe we \ncan and, in fact, need to pass this year.\n  The U.S. House of Representatives is working on key energy \nlegislation. I think it is very likely they will pass it this evening. \nThat legislation includes a bill that is very similar to energy \nlegislation I have put forward in the Senate. The legislation I am \ntalking about is the Coal Ash Recycling and Oversight Act of 2012.\n  Simply put, this legislation sets commonsense standards for managing \nand recycling coal ash with a States-led, States-first approach.\n  We have strong bipartisan support for the bill. As I said, we need to \ntake up the bill this year and pass it. Simply put, we have the support \non a bipartisan basis to support it. We have more than a dozen \nDemocratic sponsors and more than a dozen Republican sponsors.\n  So why is it important? In simple terms, this is exactly the kind of \nenergy legislation that can help take our Nation to energy security or \nenergy independence. What I mean by that is with the right energy plan, \nwe can move this country to the point where we produce more energy than \nwe consume. Working with our closest friend and ally, Canada, we can \nproduce more energy than we consume--meaning we truly are energy \nindependent or energy secure so that we are not importing energy from \nthe Middle East.\n  And it is not just about energy, it is about jobs--good-paying jobs \nat a time when we have more than 8 percent unemployment. It is about \neconomic growth--economic growth that we need to get on top of the debt \nand the deficit. We need to find savings, but we also have to get this \neconomy growing to get on top of this deficit and our $16 trillion \nFederal debt.\n  It also is about national security. Look at what is going on across \nthe Middle East. Yet we still import energy from the Middle East. \nAmericans do not want to be dependent on importing energy from the \nMiddle East. The reality is, with the right energy plan, we can produce \nthat energy at home and be energy secure, create good jobs, and get our \neconomy growing at the same time. This is just one step, but it is one \nmore important step on that journey.\n  Let me give an example of what we are doing in my home State of North \nDakota and doing in States across the country. In North Dakota, just \nnorth of the capital Bismarck, there is a large electric power complex, \nthe Coal Creek Power Station, that is operated by Great River Energy, a \ncompany that operates from North Dakota to Minnesota. It is a large \ncomplex. It generates 1,100 megawatts of electricity, two 550-megawatt \npowerplants. It employs the latest, greatest technology. It has \nemissions controls that are state of the art.\n  This plant captures waste steam, steam that was formerly exhausted \ninto the air, and uses it to power an ethanol plant. So they are making \nrenewable transportation fuel with waste steam, very low cost, very \nefficient. It reuses the coal ash or the coal residuals that are \nproduced. It recycles those for building materials.\n  Along with a company called Headwaters, a natural resource company \nout of Utah, Great River Energy takes this coal ash and makes FlexCrete \nout of it, which is concrete they use on highways, roads, bridges, \nanywhere you would use concrete. But they also make other building \nproducts as well, such as shingles, that one would use to put on the \nroof. So this is truly a concept where we are recycling the coal ash \nand the coal residuals.\n  Formerly, coal ash was put in landfills, and the company would pay \nabout $4 million a year to landfill hundreds of thousands of tons of \ncoal ash. Now they sell it, and it is made into these building \nmaterials. They generate something like $12 million a year selling this \ncoal ash for building material. If we do the math, that is about a $16 \nmillion swing from across the $4 million a\n\n[[Page S6517]]\n\nyear to a revenue stream of $12 million a year.\n  What does that mean? That means families, small businesses, consumers \nthroughout North Dakota, Minnesota, and beyond now pay $16 million less \nfor their electricity than they did before because of this creative \nuse. This truly is American ingenuity and American innovation at work.\n  In fact, I have a couple examples of buildings that are made from \nbuilding material produced with coal ash. The first one is the National \nEnergy Center of Excellence at Bismarck State College, where we train \npeople in the energy field. So people are learning how to have a great \ncareer in all different types of energy at a facility that is made with \nthe coal ash that I am talking about. It overlooks the Missouri River. \nIt is an absolutely beautiful facility.\n  Let me give another example. This is a building under construction \nright now. This is the North Dakota Heritage Center on the capitol \ngrounds of our State capital in Bismarck. It is our heritage center, so \nit is a museum of our State history. Right now, we are doing a $50 \nmillion expansion to this facility that is being constructed with coal \nash. It is a beautiful building being constructed right now.\n  By using coal ash nationwide, we reduce energy consumption by 162 \ntrillion Btus a year. That is an energy amount that is equal to 1.7 \nmillion homes. So we save an amount of energy equal to powering 1.7 \nmillion homes.\n  Water use. We save by recycling coal ash; we save 32 billion gallons \nof water annually. That is equal to one-third of the amount of water \nused in the State of California.\n  So talk about saving energy and saving water use. This is truly a \nconcept on which those who favor renewable energy, as well as those who \nfavor traditional sources of energy, ought to be able to get together. \nThis is recycling, saving huge amounts of energy, saving huge amounts \nof water.\n  So why do I tell this story? The reason I tell this story is this: \nRight now, coal ash is regulated under subtitle D of the Resource \nConservation and Recovery Act. That is nonhazardous waste, but EPA is \nlooking at changing that to regulating it under subtitle C, which is \nthe hazardous waste section. They are looking at doing that in spite of \nthe Department of Energy, the Federal Highway Administration, State \nRegulatory Authorities, and even EPA itself acknowledging that it is \nnot a toxic waste.\n  The EPA proposed that change in regulation in June 2010. Clearly, \nthat would undermine the industry, drive up costs, and eliminate jobs \nwhen our economy can least afford them. Just to put that in \nperspective, the industry estimates that it would cost $50 billion \nannually and eliminate 300,000 American jobs. Let me go through that.\n\n  Meeting the regulatory disposal requirements under the EPA's subtitle \nC proposal would cost between $250 and $450 a ton as opposed to about \n$100 a ton under the current system. That translates into a $47-\nbillion-a-year burden on electricity generators who use coal. And, most \nimportantly, of course, who pays that bill? Their customers, families, \nand small businesses across the country. Overall, that could mean the \nloss of 300,000 American jobs.\n  That is why I brought this legislation forward with Senator Conrad, \nmy colleague in North Dakota, and also Senator Baucus of Montana and \nothers. We have more than 12 Republican sponsors on the bill and 12 \nDemocratic sponsors on the bill. So it is very much a bipartisan bill.\n  Furthermore, this bill not only preserves coal ash recycling, as I \nhave described, by preventing these byproducts from being treated as \nhazardous--and this is important: This bill establishes comprehensive \nFederal standards for coal ash disposal. Under this legislation, States \ncan set up their own permitting programs for the management and the \ndisposal of coal ash. These programs would be required to be based on \nexisting EPA regulations to protect human health and the environment. \nIf a State does not implement an acceptable permit program, then EPA \nregulates the program for that State. As a result, States and industry \nwill know where they stand under this bill, and the benchmark for what \nconstitutes a successful State program will be set in statute.\n  EPA can say, yes, the State does meet the standards or, no, the State \ndoes not meet the standards. But the EPA cannot move the goalpost. This \nis a States-first approach that provides regulatory certainty.\n  What is certain is that under this bill, coal ash disposal sites will \nbe required to meet established standards. Again, this is important. We \nare requiring that they meet established standards. These standards \ninclude groundwater detection and monitoring, liners, corrective action \nwhen environmental damage occurs, structural stability criteria, and \nthe financial assurance and recordkeeping needed to protect the public. \nSo we set stringent standards.\n  This legislation is needed to protect jobs and to help reduce the \ncost of homes, roads, and electric bills. I thank the Republicans and \nthe Democrats who have stepped forward on this bill, particularly \nSenator Conrad, my colleague in North Dakota, Senator Baucus, and \nothers. We have the bipartisan support to move this bill forward. We \nneed to be able to bring it to the floor and do it this year. It is \nabout energy for this country that we need, and it is about jobs for \nAmerican workers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                              Foreign Aid\n\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I rise today to address the legislation \nthat has been offered as an amendment that would cut off all foreign \naid to Egypt, Pakistan, and Libya.\n  As I watched our flag being shredded by a gloating mob at the walls \nof the American Embassy in Cairo, I shared with fellow Hoosiers and \nAmericans a sense of sadness and deep anger. That mob, and the one that \nled to the death of four American diplomats in Libya, including our \nAmbassador, or those who stormed our Embassy throughout the Muslim \nworld, showed us again how much contempt and disrespect those people \nhave for the United States and for Americans.\n  Many in those countries clearly still hate us. As displayed on our \ntelevisions this past week, the Arab spring is evolving into a very \nbleak winter. Events this past year, and especially this past week in \nthe Middle East and North Africa, continue to present us with enormous \nchallenges. We have mishandled them badly. No one should be deluded \nenough to see it in any other way.\n  The best judge of a policy is the results. By that measure our report \ncard is found among the ashes of the consulate in Benghazi.\n  The questions the administration and this body must answer soon is \nhow best to react to this failure and what steps offer the greatest \nchances of making things right--or, at the very least, making things \nsomewhat better. The search for answers must involve a complete \nreevaluation of the full range of American policy tools, including \nmilitary actions, diplomatic dialogue, economic measures, multilateral \nefforts, and, simply, better leadership--not leadership that leads from \nbehind.\n  Now, it is understandable to ask: Why on Earth should we send one \nmore dime to these people who hate us so much? We will soon be voting \non an amendment that codifies the instinct to cut off all assistance \nprograms to, yes, problematic countries including Libya, Egypt, and \nPakistan. Based on recent events, I agree we need to reassess the \nforeign aid we do send to these countries. However, I also believe we \nneed to avoid a shortsighted reaction and consider a broader review of \nthe purposes and the costs of foreign aid. I wish to address those two \nissues.\n\n  First of all, the costs. Foreign aid, as many do not know, is just a \nfraction of our Federal budget so we need to understand how much \nforeign aid costs taxpayers. Our foreign aid programs are less than 1 \npercent of the Federal budget and, put even more vividly, according to \nthe OECD, just 0.12 percent of our gross national income is devoted to \nforeign aid.\n  Not only is that figure about a tenth of the number of Sweden or \nNorway, but it is only a third of the figure for France and half as \nmuch as the United Kingdom. We even devote a smaller share of our \nnational wealth for foreign assistance than, of all countries, Greece.\n  I have been on this floor several times calling for Washington to get\n\n[[Page S6518]]\n\ncontrol of excessive spending and I take a back seat to no one in that \neffort. I have repeatedly said that in order to address our $16 \ntrillion national debt everything must be on the table, including \nforeign aid. But we must assess and reassess all foreign aid to \ndetermine if it is still effective and even necessary. We should cut \nwhere it makes sense to cut. But when there is a discussion about \neliminating all aid to Pakistan, Libya, and Egypt, let's be honest with \nthe American people about the true cost of all that. Together, this aid \nonly constitutes a fraction of a single percent of our Federal budget, \nand cutting it would be nothing but a gesture toward the real austerity \nrequired to deal with our $16 trillion deficit.\n  But that is not the primary reason and that is not the real question \nbefore us. The real question before us is, aside from the cost \nargument, which is minuscule, the national security reasons for why we \nshould pause and consider our next step very carefully ought to drive \nus to think this through.\n  We must keep a clear eye and recognize that sending American taxpayer \ndollars overseas is, first and foremost, a matter of strategic purposes \nand national security.\n  I want to repeat that. We must remember that the money we send \noverseas is, first and foremost, a matter of strategic purpose and \nnational security. Without that component, then we do have to reassess \nthe value and what we receive in return for foreign aid.\n  We can be sure that foreign assistance plays a role in the struggle \nfor the hearts and minds of the world's poor. Today it is also central \nto the contest for political power.\n  Other rivalries are apparent as well. China plays in the contest for \npolitical influence and access to natural resources by engaging in \nforeign assistance as defined by their own standards. Chinese \nassistance activities in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia grew \nfrom $1.5 billion in 2003 to $27.5 billion in 2006, a nearly twentyfold \nincrease in 3 years, and it continues to grow and their influence \ncontinues to grow in those countries around the world as China expands \nits reach and exerts its influence.\n  None of this means that we in the Senate should support wasteful \nforeign aid programs with little regard to solid purpose, good design, \nproper accountability, and visible standards of positive result.\n  I want to see our foreign aid program reassessed. I believe we need \nto reevaluate the way we make our foreign aid determinations. But \nrather than cutting off all foreign aid in an instinctual way after \nthese horrific scenes we have seen on television, it is important to \nstep back and assess how we go about reassessing our distribution of \nforeign aid, what our strategic purposes are, and the other criteria \nthat ought to be applied before we make a knee-jerk or too quick \ndecision.\n  To achieve our support I think these programs need to achieve three \nguidelines. First, which programs most clearly achieve our national \nsecurity interests? If they do, it is money well spent. Second, which \nbest reflect American values and encourage foreign countries to support \nand adopt those values? We need to support our friends first. And, \nthird, which programs are most effective at the least cost? We need \nclear, unambiguous standards of what effective means.\n  The consequence of no aid, though, is far greater now to the \nimmediate question before us, which is the question of how we serve \nnational security interests while at the same time ignoring the fact \nthat the recipient may not be our best friend and may not support our \nbroader purpose. In those cases--and Libya, Pakistan, and Egypt \nrecently are among them--our broader strategic interest linked to our \nnational security must have priority.\n  Let's look at Pakistan. In the case of Pakistan, I and some of my \ncolleagues are profoundly skeptical. In the State and Foreign \nOperations appropriations bill markup this year, I joined with my \ncolleague Senator Graham to cut a portion of our assistance to Pakistan \nbecause of the outrageous conviction and imprisonment of Dr. Shakil \nAfridi, the doctor who helped us locate Osama bin Laden. The cut was a \ngesture of our dissatisfaction with the regime's behavior and a signal \nmore cuts could come should that behavior not improve.\n  Yesterday I met with the Pakistan Foreign Minister and Ambassador to \nAmerica from Pakistan. Earlier, Senator Graham and I had a lengthy \ndiscussion with the Ambassador. We conveyed our dissatisfaction with \nthis decision and a number of other things that we have differences \nabout with that country. At the time, Senator Graham said at the \nhearing that it may become necessary to cut aid off altogether but that \ntime has not yet come. In my view, that time is not yet here, because \nwhat is at stake in Pakistan is so vast as to defy a brief description.\n  A radicalized and hostile Muslim country with a potent, fully \ndeveloped nuclear arsenal is the most dreadful global nightmare. We \nmust continue to employ every single tool available to us to make sure \nthat does not come to pass, despite how skeptical and pessimistic we \nmight be about the future of that country.\n  I am not arguing that our assistance packages to Pakistan have been \nwell used, or even resulted in the support we seek or that the regime \nthere has even shown much gratitude or respect in return. I am simply \nnoting in this case the stakes are huge; the assistance programs do \ngive us some leverage; and anger and despair are not a proper basis for \nus to make policy judgments, particularly when it comes to the security \nof the American people and our national interests.\n  Let's look at Egypt. Similarly, we cannot abandon Egypt despite how \nwe have come to judge the results of their elections. Those elections \nhave shown us that once again a democratic vote does not ensure \ndemocracy or stability. Elections are a necessary condition for modern \nenlightened government, but much more is required. We must be there to \nhelp the political and security environment evolve in the right \ndirection. Cutting off aid to the Egyptian military, arguably an \nessential element in Egypt's future political evolution, is bound to \nmake it far harder to achieve our strategic objectives in the entire \nregion. I believe even the Israeli Government would oppose an end to \nU.S. assistance because such a step could further radicalize the new \ngovernment, the military, and even the population itself. Aid is one of \nthe few tools we have that requires Egypt to maintain observance of the \nEgypt-Israel peace treaty.\n\n  Let's look at Libya. The issue of aid to Libya is even clearer. It is \nno coincidence that the attack on our diplomat occurred on September \n11. This attack was almost certainly generated by radical elements \nconnected to al-Qaida or similar terrorist organizations active in this \ncountry. We have seen ample confirmation that neither the Libyan \nGovernment nor the vast majority of the Libyan people supported that \nviolence in any way. What we have seen is Libya is in a fragile state \nof transition that simply must be supported and encouraged by us and \nour allies. We have seen a Libya that wants to support us, wants to go \nforward with democracy, but has yet to gain control of certain parts of \nits country and certain elements, infiltrated by terrorists and al-\nQaida, certain elements that need to be addressed in terms of Libya's \nfuture and in terms of our own national interests.\n  If we cut off aid to Libya, we risk losing the gains of that \nrevolution to the radical elements that are active there and everywhere \nelse in the region. It is impossible to see how ending our assistance \nprograms would be a responsible move for our country and for our \nallies.\n  Most of us in this body have just come from a lengthy discussion with \nour Director of National Intelligence, with Secretary Clinton, our \nSecretary of State, with top representatives from our military, from \nthe FBI, and from the administration, discussing this very question, \ngathering all the information we possibly can, making sure we have the \nfacts before we make a quick judgment about the role of Libya and the \nrole of terrorists, and what we have seen to date is the response by \nthe Libyan Government, even the firing of one of their top officials \nwho made an inappropriate remark relative to this attack.\n  In conclusion, I encourage my colleagues to pause and look at the \nlarger picture when it comes to foreign aid. Cutting off aid and \ndisengaging from these countries is exactly what the perpetrators of \nthese attacks and protesters are trying to achieve. I do not\n\n[[Page S6519]]\n\nknow if supporting the government in this volatile region and this \nrevolutionary movement will bring the results we so urgently need, but \nif we are to review the tools available to us, and I am convinced we \nmust, we should not begin by throwing out the tools we have. We need to \nsharpen those tools, better define their use, but not discard them \nprematurely.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     Mortgage Foreclosure Practices\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I rise to protest an action by the \nFederal Housing Finance Agency, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, that \npunished my State of Connecticut and four other States for effectively \nprotecting our citizens against unfair and abusive mortgage foreclosure \npractices.\n  I want to say right at the outset I am determined to fight this \naction along with my colleagues during the comment period that we have, \nto contest this very unwise, misguided, unacceptable decision. These \nagencies have just posted for 60-day comment a decision to increase \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac's guarantee fee for Connecticut and four \nother States--New Jersey, New York, Illinois, and Florida.\n  Why? Because of the protections we have in place now against those \nabusive banking tactics that have so pervaded the mortgage foreclosure \nprocess and increased the length of time that it sometimes takes for \nforeclosure. And we have a mediation process that keeps people in their \nhomes and enables settlements that actually save money. That is \nConnecticut's crime. That is the reason Connecticut and four other \nStates and our homeowners will pay more in those guarantee fees.\n  Those fees, by the way, are imposed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in \nexchange for assuming the risk that a loan will default. These entities \nguarantee investors in mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, making \nit less expensive and easier for home purchasers to obtain financing.\n  The cost of the guaranteed fund is generally passed along to the \nborrower so homeowners will pay these increased fees. They will bear \nthis burden, and it will be a burden not only on those homeowners, but \neventually on the housing market, which is in all too slow and fragile \na recovery. Also, our economy depends so vitally on the housing market.\n  I am proud of Connecticut. I am proud of every State like Connecticut \nthat protects its homeowners from robo-signing or fraudulent \naffidavits. We believe in justice and due process. We believe in giving \nhomeowners an opportunity to mediate with the banks because so often \nthe banks fail to come to the table. In effect, they give homeowners \nthe runaround. They often fail to even give them a person with whom to \nnegotiate in good faith, and mediation forces them to come to the \ntable.\n  In 80 percent of the cases where there is mediation, homeowners stay \nin their homes. That saves money for other homeowners in the \nneighborhood because their property values are maintained. It saves \nmoney for the homeowner who doesn't have to find a place to live and \nmaybe even buy another house, and it saves money for Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac. In fact, every time they avoid foreclosure, they save on \naverage at least $11,000. That is the kind of savings they ought to \nrelish, not reject. The foreclosure process around the country has \nrightly raised fears of abuses that Connecticut has sought to prevent. \nThis kind of protection ought to be rewarded, not rejected.\n  The additional time it has taken for foreclosure because of these \nprotections is a cost well worth the larger savings that are eventually \nrealized. That is the reason I have determined that I will fight this \nnew proposed guarantee fee, which increases significantly and \nsubstantially by 30 basis points for every homeowner who takes \nadvantage of a Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae loan. From the moment families \ntake out a loan, they are faced with fees and charges that we ought to \nseek to minimize so we can expand and enlarge and continue the recovery \nin our housing market while preventing unnecessary and illegal \nforeclosures. I am determined to fight this fee.\n  I will enlist help from other colleagues who have already indicated \ntheir opposition, and I believe that together we will succeed in \npersuading Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that this increase in fee is \nmisguided, unwise, and unacceptable.\n  I also want to speak separately and distinctly about the DREAM Act.\n\n\n                               DREAM Act\n\n  Last week I came to the floor to talk about the importance of the \nDREAM Act and to share the story of a Connecticut DREAMer. I am here \nagain with the story of a different DREAMer. This is another young \nperson from Connecticut. Again, I urge my colleagues to take action on \nthis critically important bill. Young people who are known as DREAMers \nare undocumented immigrants who were brought to this country at an \nearly age. Some were infants. Through no fault of their own, the \nconsequence is they are here without proper documentation. America is \ntheir home. They often know no other language. All of their life they \nhave been here. They have no memories of the country of their origin, \nwhere they were born. Our unfair and impractical immigration system \nfails to give them a path to citizenship and to stay in this country, \nthe country they know and love.\n  The DREAM Act would give these young immigrants a chance to earn \ntheir citizenship through education or military service. By earning \ntheir citizenship they can begin to give back to this country. In fact, \nthey are individuals who will continue to contribute to this country \nand give back to it.\n  Again, I wish to recognize the distinguished leadership of my \ncolleague Senator Durbin, who has been fighting tirelessly for the \npassage of the DREAM Act for over 10 years. At the State level I have \nfought for similar measures that would give rights, particularly in the \narea of education and tuition aid, to these DREAMers. We have succeeded \nin Connecticut in giving them the benefit of in-state tuition.\n  The immigrants who would benefit from the DREAM Act have already been \nhelped by an order from the President that defers their deportation for \n2 years. Although it defers their deportation, it does not permanently \ngrant them any rights. In fact, if there is a change in administration, \nthat order could be easily reversed. So the benefit is temporary and \nthe need is for a more certain, stable, and secure solution so they can \ncome out of the shadows, avoid being marginalized by our outdated \nimmigration laws, gain the kind of scholarship aid they need, seek to \nserve our country on a more permanent basis, and benefit, but also \ndischarge the obligations of citizenship in this country.\n  I want to talk today about Yusmerith Caguao. Yusmerith Caguao is a \ncollege student who grew up in Norwalk, CT. She was born in Venezuela. \nShe came to this country when she was 11 years old. She was told by her \nmom that the reason for coming here was to learn English, and the idea \nof learning a new language in a new country was immensely exciting to \nher. Her family settled in Norwalk, and she began middle school a week \nor two after arriving in America. She remembers those early days of her \nlife, but she also remembers the excitement and struggle. Arriving \nwithout any knowledge of English, she mastered this language. Her \ngrades improved over time and she kept in mind why her parents had \nbrought her to America. She was dedicated to that day when she would be \nsuccessful, when she would have visions realized and dreams achieved \nthat she could not accomplish in Venezuela.\n  She graduated from middle school with excellent grades. She was proud \nof what she had accomplished and learned, and soon after completing \nmiddle school, to her dismay, she became aware of her legal status in \nthis country. Learning that she was undocumented affected her \nperformance and her state of mind. By the time Yusmerith Caguao was in \nhigh school, she stopped trying to get perfect grades because she \nfeared that colleges would not accept her anyway.\n  At this point Yusmerith says she became depressed and felt hopeless. \nShe graduated high school. She had almost given up the idea of \nattending college, but she didn't lose hope. After she graduated from \nhigh school, she decided to continue her education in Norwalk Community \nCollege, a wonderful institution. I attended their graduation this \nyear. It is a place that does wonders and provides immense \nopportunities for people regardless of their race\n\n[[Page S6520]]\n\nor background or documentation and citizenship. It did wonders for \nYusmerith.\n  She worked at a lot of different jobs to pay for her education, from \nwaitressing in restaurants to working at a pet store and babysitting. \nShe continues to work to pay for her education.\n  Now having graduated from Norwalk Community College, Yusmerith went \non to attend Western Connecticut State University. This picture is of \nher graduation, but we are hopeful she will have another graduation. \nShe is currently pursuing a double major in accounting and finance at \nWestern State University and expects to graduate in 2014. She hopes to \nbe an accountant. She hopes to have a career where she can put her \nskills to work. She hopes to give back to this country. That hope \ndeserves recognition and realization, and that is why I stand here \nasking this body to give Yusmerith and thousands of other young people \nin Connecticut, the DREAMers, that opportunity to have a secure and \npermanent status, a path to citizenship that they will earn through \neducation or military service.\n  I am hopeful my colleagues, even in a time of tremendous \npartisanship, will see the importance of what Yusmerith and the \nDREAMers can do not only for themselves but what they can give to our \nNation and us. With her skills, talent, and dedication, this Nation \nwill be even greater. We are the greatest Nation in the history of the \nworld, but even greater with the contributions of young people such as \nYusmerith.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Nominations\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise tonight to speak about one \nsubject, but a very important subject for our country and for our \nsystem of justice, and that is the confirmation of Federal district \ncourt judges. I will focus tonight on one Federal district in \nPennsylvania, the Middle District. By way of background, I will review \nwhere we are in the Senate.\n  Earlier today Majority Leader Reid was required to ask for unanimous \nconsent in order to proceed on Senate confirmation votes for 17 \ndistrict court nominees. Of course, this is from district courts across \nthe country. As the majority leader and many of our Senate colleagues \nhave noted, the district court nominees on the Senate Calendar are \nnearly all noncontroversial and have received significant bipartisan \nsupport. The judges I will speak about tonight fit that description.\n  Historically the Senate has deferred to the nomination of the \nPresident and the support of home State Senators. Unfortunately, that \ndoesn't seem to be the case today in too many instances. Of course, not \nin every instance but too many instances. There is an old expression in \nthe law that many of us have heard, and it is very simple, but I think \nit has substantial consequences for real people. The expression is: \nJustice delayed is justice denied.\n  When we have a situation where we have two judges in the Middle \nDistrict of Pennsylvania--I should say for the record and for the \ndescription of the geography in our State we have three Federal \njudicial districts: the Eastern District, the Middle District, and the \nWestern District. When we have two district court nominees in \nPennsylvania, or in any of the other States that have judges who are \nstill pending, we can imagine the number of cases. It is not just \nhundreds but thousands of cases. In this case 17 judges could be \nhandling these cases right now across our country. That old expression, \njustice delayed is justice denied, has real significance for real \npeople out there, people who come before the district court as \nlitigants. Whether they are individuals, corporations, or whatever the \nparty, they come for basic justice and that gets very difficult when \nthere is a backlog and there are not enough judges.\n  It is especially egregious and outrageous that they are held up here \nwhen in many cases they get out of the Judiciary Committee after a long \nprocess of getting to the Judiciary Committee. Sometimes there are many \nmonths of vetting and investigation work. Often the names are available \nfor voting here in the Senate after not just getting through the \nJudiciary Committee, but part and parcel of that means in almost every \ninstance the two Senators from that State have agreed they should come \nup for a vote. Yet when it lands here on the Senate floor after \ncommittee consideration, judicial nominees are held up.\n  The ability of the Federal courts to provide justice for the American \npeople has indeed been threatened by the vacancy crisis and the \noverburdened Federal district courts. Families, communities, and small \nbusinesses are not able to get a fair hearing or have their claims \nresolved in a timely fashion. These Federal court vacancies need to be \nfilled to mature a functioning democracy and a functioning judicial \nsystem.\n  The Pennsylvania nominees to the Senate Calendar are two individuals, \nMalachy Mannion and Matthew Brann. Both are to be confirmed as U.S. \ndistrict judges for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.\n  I won't go through their backgrounds and qualifications today. We \nhave done that already. They don't need me to do that. They are through \nthe Judiciary Committee. These men are both very well qualified to be \nU.S. district judges.\n  Both of these judges would fill judicial emergency vacancies in \nPennsylvania's Middle District. Just to give my colleagues a sense of \nwhat we are talking about, the Middle District of Pennsylvania has six \nposts, six judicial slots, and these are two vacancies for those six. \nThe Middle District is the largest Federal district in Pennsylvania \ngeographically, and there are four courthouses, one of which is several \nhours' drive from the others. Because of the vacancies, the judges with \nsenior status still continue to hear cases. Three of these judges are \nat least 86 years old. Let me say that again. Three of these senior \njudges who have to do extra work because of the vacancies are at least \n86 years old.\n  Mal Mannion and Matthew Brann were both reported by voice vote out of \nthe Judiciary Committee earlier this year, and both nominees were \nsupported by Senator Toomey as well as me. Both of us came together \nthrough the process of introducing both of these nominees to the \nJudiciary Committee. They are, as I said before, through that process.\n  I strongly urge that we move forward and allow a vote on all of these \nhighly qualified, noncontroversial U.S. district court nominees, two in \nparticular in Pennsylvania.\n  I should mention that there was an article written--I won't summarize \nit here--in the Atlantic magazine just last week by Andrew Cohen that \nhighlighted some of the impacts this crisis has on real people when \nthey appear before district courts such as the Middle District of \nPennsylvania.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6520-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6520-S6525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the majority leader was required to \ntake the extraordinary step of asking for unanimous consent to secure \nSenate confirmation votes for 17 district court nominations. Before the \nAmerican people elected Barack Obama as our President, district court \nnominees were generally confirmed within a couple of weeks of being \nreported by the Judiciary Committee. This was true of those nominated \nby Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents. Deference was \ntraditionally afforded to home State Senators and district court \nnominees supported by home State Senators were almost always confirmed \nunanimously.\n  However, Senate Republicans have raised the level of partisanship so \nthat these Federal trial court nominees have now become wrapped around \nthe axle of partisanship. Despite a vacancy crisis that threatens the \nability of Federal courts to provide justice for the American people, \nSenate Republicans now refuse to allow a vote on any of the 17 pending \ndistrict court nominees, including 12 that have been declared judicial \nemergency vacancies. Senate Republicans' across-the-board obstruction \nof President Obama's judicial nominees that began with their filibuster \nof his very first nominee continues. For the first time I can recall, \neven district court nominees with support from Republican home State \nSenators face\n\n[[Page S6521]]\n\nmonths of delay if not outright opposition from the Senate Republican \nleadership and Senate Republicans.\n  The long delays and backlog we are seeing on the Federal trial courts \nand Senate Republicans' refusal to vote on so many consensus judicial \nnominees before we recess for the upcoming Presidential election are \nentirely without precedent. The Thurmond rule has never been applied to \nstop votes on consensus district court nominees. In September 2008 we \nreported and confirmed 10 of President Bush's district court nominees \nand left none on the Senate calendar as we headed into that \nPresidential election. In contrast, this year we are still waiting on \nvotes for district court nominees reported by the Judiciary Committee \nin April, June, July, and August. All but 1 of these 17 district court \nnominees was reported with significant bipartisan support, all but 3 \nnearly unanimously.\n  The partisan refusal to allow votes on consensus nominees has become \nstandard operating procedure for Senate Republicans. In each of the \nlast 2 years, Senate Republicans refused to follow the Senate's \ntraditional practice of clearing the calendar of noncontroversial \nnominees. As a result, there were 19 judicial nominees pending without \na final confirmation vote at the end of 2010 and another 19 left \nwithout a vote at the end of 2011. Due to this latest refusal to \nconsent to vote, Senate Republicans are ensuring that the Senate will \nrecess for the election without voting on 21 judicial nominees ready \nfor final Senate action. The result is that for the first time in \ndecades Federal courts are likely to have more vacancies at the end of \nthese 4 years than at the beginning of the President's term. Federal \njudicial vacancies have been at historically high levels for years, \nremaining near or above 80 for nearly the entire first term of the \nPresident. Judicial vacancies today are more than 2\\1/2\\ times as high \nas they were at this point in President Bush's first term, with nearly \n1 out of every 11 Federal judgeships currently vacant.\n  I urge Senator Toomey, Senator Kirk, Senator Rubio, Senator Coburn, \nSenator Inhofe, Senator Hatch, Senator Lee, Senator Collins, and \nSenator Snowe, all of whom have judicial nominees on the calendar ready \nfor a final Senate vote, to reason with their leadership about this \nobstruction. I ask other Republican Senators who know better to weigh \nin with their leadership. This is wrong for the country, damaging to \nthe Federal courts, and harmful for the American people looking to our \ncourts for justice.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my statement a column by Russell Wheeler entitled ``The \nCase for Confirming District Court Judges'' that appeared in Politico \non Wednesday and notes the unprecedented and destructive nature of this \nobstruction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have served in the Senate for 37 years, and I have never \nseen so many judicial nominees, reported with bipartisan support, be \ndenied a simple up-or-down vote for 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, even \n11 months. And if there was any doubt that Senate Republicans insist on \nbeing the party of no, their current decision to deny votes on these \nhighly qualified, noncontroversial district court nominees--while we \nare in the middle of a judicial vacancy crisis--shows what they stand \nfor. They care more about opposing this President than helping the \nAmerican people.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From Politico, Sept. 18, 2012]\n\n             The Case for Confirming District Court Judges\n\n                          (By Russell Wheeler)\n\n       The accepted wisdom on Congress is that the presidential \n     campaign is likely to crowd out most real work until after \n     Nov. 6, when all its focus abruptly changes to the fiscal \n     cliff.\n       There is, though, one important noncontroversial matter \n     that the Senate should take up now--as have previous Senates \n     at this time: confirming district judges.\n       A government that can't do its mundane business is surely \n     unlikely to be able to deal with more controversial problems. \n     History shows that the Senate should be able to confirm a \n     respectable number of long-standing district court \n     nominations before Election Day--certainly before \n     adjournment. If it cannot, this may signal that the past four \n     years of delayed and confrontational nominations have not \n     been an aberration but represent the new normal of district \n     court confirmations.\n       Sixty-one of the nation's 673 lifetime appointment district \n     court judgeships are vacant. President Barack Obama has \n     submitted nominees to fill 24 of the vacancies. Seventeen of \n     the 24 have cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee and are \n     awaiting final action by the full Senate.\n       As of Sept. 10, the Senate had confirmed 126 of Obama's \n     district nominees--81 percent. In comparison, President \n     George W. Bush had a 97 percent district confirmation success \n     rate in his first four years, and President Bill Clinton an \n     87 percent rate.\n       If the Senate confirms 10 of the 17 Obama nominees, this \n     would lift his four-year success rate to equal Clinton's. \n     Confirming all 17 would lift it to 91 percent.\n       Rates aside, however, even if all 17 were confirmed, Obama \n     would have made roughly 20 fewer district appointees than \n     Clinton or Bush. Obama has submitted fewer nominees.\n       Extended vacancies often mean long delays, especially in \n     civil cases. They often mean full caseloads for judges in \n     their 70s and beyond--despite statutory promises that, at \n     that age, judges who have put in substantial service are \n     entitled to scale back.\n       Filling judicial vacancies is part of the business of \n     government, and like much of that business, it is more \n     mundane than dramatic. Federal district caseloads consist \n     largely of commercial disputes and federal crimes like \n     immigration law violations--issues important to litigants and \n     collectively important to all of us. They are part of how our \n     society resolves disputes and help set the framework for \n     commercial and social intercourse.\n       But you might say, judges can't get confirmed this close to \n     a presidential election because opposition senators are \n     hoping their guy will soon be in the White House and make his \n     own nominations to those vacancies.\n       That may be true now for court of appeals nominees -- you \n     have to go back to the first Bush administration to find a \n     circuit confirmation after July of a presidential election \n     year -- but not for district courts. There's plenty of \n     precedent for late-election year confirmations.\n       In 1980, 1984 and 1992--when Presidents Jimmy Carter, \n     Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush were up for reelection--\n     the Senate each time confirmed roughly 10 district court \n     nominees between the political conventions and election day. \n     That number dropped to zero in 1996 under Clinton but shot up \n     to six in 2004 under Bush.\n       In years when the incumbent president wasn't on the ballot, \n     the Senate also confirmed district judges, including 10 in \n     September 2008--even as Obama's victory seemed increasingly \n     likely.\n       There's plenty of recent precedent for confirming at least \n     the 17 pending Obama nominees. But the past four years of \n     district confirmations haven't followed precedent.\n       Not only is the confirmation rate lower, at least for now, \n     but time from nomination to confirmation has spiked. Eight \n     percent of Clinton's district confirmations in the first four \n     years took more than 180 days, as did 27 percent of Bush's. \n     But it's now up to 67 percent for Obama.\n       The increase in time has been matched by an increase in \n     contentiousness. All of Clinton's district appointees were \n     confirmed by voice vote -- even those who merited more \n     attention, like the subsequently impeached and convicted \n     Thomas Porteous of New Orleans. All but four of Bush's \n     appointees were approved by either voice or unanimous vote. \n     Of the four, one got 20 ``no'' votes and one got 46.\n       Most of Obama's appointees have also been confirmed with \n     no, or token, opposition--even those who waited a long time. \n     But 11 received more than 20 ``no'' votes. It's hard to \n     believe, however, that the quality of Obama appointees \n     plunged so decisively compared with those of his immediate \n     predecessors.\n       So district confirmations--especially in double digits--in \n     the next several months may be iffy, and those who do get \n     confirmed will have waited considerably longer than late-year \n     confirmations in previous administrations.\n       We've come to accept, or at least recognize, as the new \n     normal that only six or seven out of every 10 circuit \n     nominees will get Senate approval. Are the district courts \n     next?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  VAWA\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to again raise my concerns \nabout and the desire to see action in the House to pass the Senate bill \nreauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. We need to continue this \ncritical funding for survivors of domestic violence.\n  In the discussions on the Senate floor, we have heard about the \nprotections offered in the Senate bill that have not been included in \nthe bill the House has pending. They are protections that would help \nwomen on college\n\n[[Page S6522]]\n\ncampuses, women on tribal lands, gay and lesbian victims, and \nimmigrants. However, it is really important for us to remember not just \nthose provisions but all of the other ways the Violence Against Women \nAct has benefited not just the victims of domestic violence but really \nall of us because domestic violence isn't just a women's issue. It \naffects all of us. It affects our entire economy. It affects our \nfamilies. The Centers for Disease Control estimates that the direct \nhealth care costs associated with domestic violence are about $4.1 \nbillion every single year. We know this is a conservative estimate \nbecause so many of the victims never come forward.\n  The protections offered by the Violence Against Women Act have proven \nto be absolutely essential in preventing abuse. Last week was the 18th \nanniversary of the original passage of VAWA, so this is a good time to \nreflect on the progress we have made.\n  Over the past 18 years, the reporting of incidents of domestic \nviolence has increased by 51 percent. At the same time, according to \nthe FBI, the number of women who have been killed by an intimate \npartner has decreased by 34 percent. So clearly it is having some \neffect. Researchers at the North Carolina School of Public Health \nestimate that VAWA saved $12.6 billion in its first 7 years alone. So \neven if one doesn't support the legislation because it does good work \nfor families, this is a bill that is also a good investment.\n  This is about telling the victims of violence that we stand with them \nbecause having safe, healthy citizens benefits all of us. We all do \nbetter when fewer women are going to the emergency room, are missing \nwork or giving up their children in order to protect those children \nfrom violence at home. We are all in this together.\n  I have had a chance as we have had this debate in the Senate to visit \na number of crisis centers in New Hampshire--centers that benefit \ndirectly from the funding in the Violence Against Women Act. Recently I \nvisited the city of Keene's Monadnock Center for Violence Prevention \nand had a chance to speak with one of the caseworkers there and with \ntwo of the survivors. Those two women told me what it was like as they \nwere trying to figure out how to leave their abusers. I asked them: \nWhat would have happened if this center wasn't here? Both of them said \nthey had nowhere else to go. One of the women said: My husband would \nhave killed me. That was how desperate she was.\n  While I was there, I also had a chance to meet some of the children \nwho were staying at the center. I wish to take a minute to talk about \nhow important this is for them, the children who were witnesses of \ndomestic violence or who, as the result of that violence, are victims \nthemselves.\n  Centers all over New Hampshire and the United States have advocacy \nprograms that are funded by VAWA that offer support groups for \nchildren. Children are particularly vulnerable and ill-equipped to deal \nwith the trauma of domestic violence. This is trauma that affects them \nfor their entire lives.\n  A study by the World Health Organization found that children raised \nin households where domestic violence occurred are more likely to have \nbehavioral problems, to drop out of school early, to experience \njuvenile delinquency. It is not surprising.\n  A child who witnesses domestic violence between parents is more \nlikely to view violence as an acceptable method of conflict resolution. \nBoys who witness domestic violence are more likely to become abusers, \nand girls who witness domestic violence are more likely to become \nvictims of domestic violence as adults. One advocate at the Bridges \nCrisis Center in Nashua, NH, works to prevent this cycle by providing \nsafety planning for children. She teaches them they can live a life \nthat is free of violence. This free preventive care for children is \nmade possible by a grant from VAWA. Our children deserve this. This is \nwhy we need to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. This is \nabout women who are in danger, about children and families who are at \nrisk.\n  One of the stories I found particularly touching when I was at \nBridges was about a young boy named Brian. The caseworker told me that \nBrian was really nervous about going back to school. He was supposed to \nbring with him a story about something fun he had done over the summer, \nbut he had been in the shelter at Bridges with his mother and it really \nhadn't been a very fun summer. So the child advocate organized a \nbarbeque in the park across the street, and everybody from the center \ncame and joined in that barbeque and gave him a happy memory that he \ncould take with him to the first day of school. This is the kind of \nhealing we need more of. We can help this continue by reauthorizing the \nViolence Against Women Act.\n  I hope that as Senators go home for the next 6 weeks, as we go back \nto our States and travel around and hear from people in our States the \nissues they are concerned about, we won't forget about the task we have \nat hand when we come back. We need to reauthorize the Violence Against \nWomen Act. We need to get the House to join with us in passing the \nSenate bill so we can include those expanded protections that are \nneeded so much by women and families across this country. I know the \nPresiding Officer joins with me in recognizing that we still have time \nto get this done this year.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Social Security\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I wish to spend a few minutes talking \nabout an issue that I believe has not gotten the attention it deserves, \nespecially in the midst of the contentious Presidential campaign we are \nwitnessing, and that is the need to discuss a program which is probably \nthe most successful social program in the modern history of the United \nStates, a program that provides dignity and security to well over 50 \nmillion Americans, and that is Social Security.\n  Just this afternoon, 29 Senators sent a letter to all of our \ncolleagues that says:\n\n       We will oppose including Social Security cuts for future or \n     current beneficiaries in any deficit reduction package.\n\n  Let's be very clear. Our country does have a serious deficit problem. \nOur deficit this year is about $1 trillion, and our national debt is \n$16 trillion. That is a serious problem. However, let's be equally \nclear in understanding that Social Security has not contributed one \nnickel to the Federal deficit. So despite what we are going to hear \ntonight on cable television or some of the speeches my colleagues will \ngive, let me reiterate: Social Security has not contributed one nickel \nto our Federal deficit.\n  In fact, the Social Security trust fund today, according to the \nSocial Security Administration, has a $2.7 trillion surplus--let me \nrepeat that: a $2.7 trillion surplus--and can pay out 100 percent of \nall benefits owed to every eligible American for the next 21 years.\n  Although many Americans now take Social Security for granted, we \nshould never underestimate the incredibly positive impact Social \nSecurity has had on our Nation. In fact, one could well argue that \nSocial Security has been the Nation's most successful social program--\ncertainly in the modern history of this country.\n  In the 77 years since Social Security was signed into law, it has \nbeen enormously successful in reducing poverty for senior citizens. \nBefore the advent of Social Security, back in the 1920s, early 1930s, \nabout half of the senior citizens in this country lived in poverty, \nsome in dismal poverty. Today, while the number is too high, the number \nof seniors living in poverty is less than 10 percent. We have gone from \n50 percent to less than 10 percent. That, to my mind, is a real success \nstory and something of which this Nation should be incredibly proud.\n  Today Social Security not only provides retirement benefits for 34 \nmillion Americans but also enables millions of people with disabilities \nand widows, widowers, and children to live in dignity and security. I \nhear in Vermont very often--and I expect the Presiding Officer hears in \nNew Hampshire--about young people who have been able to go to college, \nlive with some sense of security, despite the death of a parent, \nprecisely because of Social Security.\n\n[[Page S6523]]\n\n  Yet, despite all of these success stories, today Social Security is \non the chopping block. Millions of Americans, when asked in polls, make \nit very clear--including people all across the political spectrum--\nsaying: No, we should not cut Social Security. Millions of people \nunderstand that Social Security--and this is simply an extraordinary \nrecord--has been there in good times and in bad times. And in 77 years, \nnot one American, no matter what the state of the economy, has not \nreceived all of the benefits to which he or she is entitled. It is an \ninsurance program that has worked, and worked extraordinarily well.\n  What we are looking at right now are attacks on Social Security \ncoming from Mitt Romney, from Paul Ryan, and from virtually every \nRepublican in Congress, who are calling for major cuts in Social \nSecurity. Many of them, including Romney and Ryan, also want to begin \nthe process of privatizing Social Security and turning it over to Wall \nStreet, putting the retirement dreams of millions of Americans at risk. \nThey are also pushing to increase the retirement age to 68 or 69, \nforcing older Americans who have worked their entire lives--sometimes \nin physically demanding jobs in construction; maybe they worked in \nrestaurants being waitresses their whole lives and now some folks want \nthese people to still be working at the age of 68 or 69.\n  While virtually every Republican in Congress is pushing to cut Social \nSecurity benefits, there are also some Democrats who are considering \ncutting Social Security as part of some deficit reduction grand \nbargain. I strongly disagree with that approach, and I hope President \nObama will make it clear, as he did 4 years ago, that he also disagrees \nwith that approach.\n  Let me quote what President Obama said 4 years ago when he was \nSenator Obama running for the White House. This is what he said:\n\n       John McCain's campaign has suggested that the best answer \n     for the growing pressures on Social Security might be to cut \n     cost of living adjustments or raise the retirement age. Let \n     me be clear: I will not do either.\n\n  End of quote of Senator Barack Obama on September 6, 2008. What then-\nSenator Obama said in 2008 was exactly right, and I hope that now, in \n2012, we will hear the President reiterate that position.\n  One of the most talked about ideas, when we hear discussions about \ncutting Social Security--and nobody outside of the beltway has a clue \nabout what this means. I can tell you, I have been to many meetings in \nVermont, and I have asked Vermonters: Do you know what the chained CPI \nis? And nobody has a clue. But one of the most talked about ways to cut \nSocial Security is moving toward a so-called chained CPI, which changes \nhow cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security benefits and \nveterans benefits are calculated.\n  So what it does right now: There is a formula by which the government \ndetermines what kind of COLA--cost-of-living adjustment--seniors and \nveterans will get. It is a complicated formula. But what these guys \nwant to do is cut back, readjust that formula so that the benefits will \nbe less.\n  People who support this concept of a chained CPI, such as Alan \nSimpson, Erskine Bowles, and Wall Street billionaire Pete Peterson--and \nPeterson is one of the guys, a billionaire on Wall Street, putting in \nhuge amounts of money in order to cut Social Security and other \nimportant programs--they believe Social Security COLAs and COLAs for \nveterans benefits are too generous, and they want to cut those COLA \nbenefits.\n  Well, I will tell you something. When I talk to seniors in the State \nof Vermont and I say there are people in Washington who think their \nCOLA benefits are too generous, usually they laugh. The reason they \nlaugh is that for 2 out of the last 3 years, they have not received any \nCOLA whatsoever--nothing--while at the same time their prescription \ndrug costs and their health care costs have been soaring. And they look \nat me and say: What? Are these people crazy? If we have not gotten a \nCOLA in 2 out of the last 3 years, while our expenses have risen, how \ndo they think that COLA formula is now too generous?\n  Let's also be very clear that when we talk about this chained CPI, \nthis means not only cuts for seniors, it means cuts for veterans, and \nthat is an issue we have not talked about very much.\n  So let me talk about what the chained CPI means. It means--and they \nwant to implement this, by the way, very shortly. Romney and Ryan are \ntalking about changing Medicare, as we know, over a 10-year period, and \nI think that is a disastrous idea. But what these guys now are talking \nabout are immediate cuts in the COLA, starting as soon as they can pass \nthat legislation.\n  What it would mean is that for a senior citizen who is 65 years of \nage today, by the time that senior reaches 75, there would be a $560-a-\nyear cut compared to what they otherwise would have gotten. Some folks \nhere on Capitol Hill may not think $560 is a lot, but if you are \nstruggling on $14,000 or $15,000 a year, that is quite a hit. And \nonce that 65-year-old, in 20 years, reaches 85, that cut will be \napproximately $1,000 a year.\n\n  Now, I have a problem; in a nation that has the most unequal \ndistribution of wealth and income, where the rich are getting richer \nand their effective tax rate is the lowest in decades, some folks \naround here, pushed by Wall Street billionaires, by the way, say: Hey, \nwe have a great idea on how we could deal with deficit reduction: Let's \ntell a senior living on $15,000 a year, Social Security, that we are \ngoing to cut them by $1,000 in 20 years. I think really that is morally \ngrotesque, and it is also bad economics.\n  But this chained CPI would not only impact seniors, it would also \nimpact 3 million veterans. Three million veterans would be impacted by \nthis chained CPI. For example, a veteran who put his life on the line \nto defend this country and who was severely wounded in action and who \nhas a 100-percent service-connected disability is currently eligible to \nreceive about $32,000 a year from the VA. Under the chained CPI, this \ndisabled veteran, who started receiving VA disability benefits at age \n30, would see his benefits cut by more than $1,300 a year at age 45, \n$1,800 a year at age 55, and $2,260 a year at age 65.\n  In other words, moving toward a chained CPI would be a disgraceful \neffort to balance the budget on some of the most vulnerable people in \nthis country, including people who have suffered severe wounds and \ndisabilities in defending this country. Those are not the people upon \nwhom you balance the budget.\n  Madam President, I will conclude by reminding the American people \nthat when Bill Clinton left office in January 2001, this country had a \n$236 billion surplus, and the projections were that that surplus was \ngoing to grow every single year. But some of the same people in \nCongress right now, including Congressman Paul Ryan, who is running for \nVice President, who are so concerned about the deficit, who want to cut \nSocial Security, end Medicare as we know it, make devastating cuts in \nMedicaid and education--these very same people voted to go to war in \nIraq and Afghanistan and not pay one nickel for those wars but put them \non the credit card and increase the deficit. These same people who now \nwant to go after wounded veterans gave huge tax breaks to the \nwealthiest people in this country, adding to the deficit. They passed a \nMedicare Part D prescription drug program and forgot to pay for that as \nwell. So, to my mind, I have a real problem with folks who went to war \nwithout paying for it, gave tax breaks to billionaires without paying \nfor it, passed a Medicare Part D prescription drug program without \npaying for it, and now they say we have to cut Social Security, \nMedicare, Medicaid, education, and the needs of working families and \nlow-income people. I think that is absolute hypocrisy.\n  So our charge is that instead of listening to the Wall Street \nbillionaires who want to move to deficit reduction on the backs of the \nelderly, the children, the sick, the poor, wounded veterans, there are \nbetter ways to do deficit reduction. I hope that as a Congress we will \ncome together and say that when the wealthiest people are doing \nphenomenally well, yes, they are going to have to pay more in taxes. \nWhen a quarter of the corporations in this country pay nothing in \ntaxes, yes, they are going to have to pay their fair share of taxes. \nWhen we are losing $100 billion a year because of tax havens in the \nCayman Islands and elsewhere, we\n\n[[Page S6524]]\n\nare going to have to deal with that issue before we cut programs on \nwhich elderly people and veterans and children depend.\n  So we have a lot of work in front of us, but the bottom line is that \nI will do everything I can to make sure we do not balance the budget on \nthe backs of the elderly, the children, the sick, and the poor. That is \nimmoral, and it is also bad economic policy.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the letter signed by 29 Members of the Senate opposing cuts in \nSocial Security.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n       Dear Colleague: We are writing to inform you that we will \n     oppose including Social Security cuts for future or current \n     beneficiaries in any deficit reduction package.\n       Under long-standing Federal law, Social Security is not \n     part of the Federal budget and cannot contribute to the \n     federal deficit. This reflects Social Security's structure as \n     an independent, self-financed insurance program, in which \n     worker contributions, not general taxes, finance benefits. In \n     our view, it is essential that Social Security's status as a \n     separate entity be fully maintained.\n       Contrary to some claims, Social Security is not the cause \n     of our nation's deficit problem. Not only does the program \n     operate independently, but it is prohibited from borrowing. \n     Social Security must pay all benefits from its own trust \n     fund. If there are insufficient funds to pay out full \n     benefits, benefits are automatically reduced to the level \n     supported by the program's own revenues. Social Security \n     cannot drive up the deficit by tapping general revenues to \n     pay benefits.\n       Even though Social Security operates in a fiscally \n     responsible manner, some still advocate deep benefit cuts and \n     seem convinced that Social Security hands out lavish welfare \n     checks. But Social Security is not welfare. Seniors earned \n     their benefits by working hard and paying into the system. \n     Meanwhile, the average monthly Social Security benefit is \n     only about $1,200, quite low by international standards.\n       For all these reasons, we believe it would be a serious \n     mistake to cut Social Security benefits for current or future \n     beneficiaries as part of a deficit reduction package. To be \n     sure, Social Security has its own long-term challenges that \n     will need to be addressed in the decades ahead. But the \n     budget and Social Security are separate, and should be \n     considered separately.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views.\n           Sincerely,\n         Bernard Sanders; Harry Reid; Charles E. Schumer; Sheldon \n           Whitehouse; Sherrod Brown; Patrick Leahy; Debbie \n           Stabenow; Al Franken; Jeff Merkley; Barbara Mikulski; \n           Jack Reed; Mark Begich; Ron Wyden; Ben Cardin; Richard \n           Blumenthal; Tom Harkin; Frank R.

Inouye; Robert \n           Menendez; Kirsten Gillibrand.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the \namendment I have filed to the House continuing resolution, House Joint \nResolution 117, which we are currently considering.\n  I understand that House and Senate leadership came to an agreement \nthat seeks to keep the government running for the next 6 months and I \nwant to applaud their willingness to work in a bipartisan fashion to \nreach an agreement that avoids a government shutdown. Still, after the \nHouse passed this funding bill, I was greatly concerned that emergency \nfunding for Colorado and other states impacted by natural disasters \nthis year was left out.\n  In my state, these funds are essential to protecting and restoring \ncritical watersheds that were damaged by the most devastating wildfires \nin Colorado's history--which if left unaddressed present serious \nflooding, landslide and other risks that threaten the lives of \nresidents in our state.\n  My amendment would provide the U.S. Department of Agriculture $27.9 \nmillion in emergency funding to mitigate watershed damage through the \nEmergency Watershed Protection Program, or EWP, in areas that have been \npresidentially declared disaster areas as authorized under the Stafford \nAct.\n  As of September 18, 2012, the USDA estimated $126.7 million in \nfunding needs for EWP projects in 15 States. Of that total, $27.9 \nmillion is needed to mitigate the aftermath of presidentially declared \ndisaster areas in Louisiana, Florida, Oklahoma and Colorado, as \nauthorized under the Stafford Act. Currently, Stafford Act funds for \nEWP have been depleted and as I have noted the House Continuing \nResolution provided no emergency funds for EWP. Mr. President, the need \nfor this amendment to provide emergency funding is critical and let me \ntell you why.\n  The two most devastating Colorado fires this season, High Park and \nWaldo Canyon, burned more than 100,000 acres and led to the \ncatastrophic loss of property and regrettably loss of life. Now as \nColoradans pick up the pieces, the burned and barren areas present an \nadditional threat.\n  Without site rehabilitation and restoration, the watersheds that \nprovide municipal and agricultural water supplies are at risk from \nlandslides, flooding and erosion, which could result in serious \ninfrastructure damage, water supply disruptions and even loss of life.\n  Coloradans unfortunately have already experienced some of these \neffects. For example, in the Poudre River, which drains part of the \narea burned by the High Park fire, the ash and runoff from the fire \ncaused the water flowing into drinking water filtration plants to turn \nblack. This forced the downstream city of Fort Collins to shut off \ntheir water intakes for over 100 days and further downstream the city \nof Greeley was forced to shut off their water intakes for 36 days and \nuse only a small fraction of their normal intake for an additional 38 \ndays.\n  How much more of an emergency need do we have to show when our most \nbasic resource--drinking water--is threatened?\n  I will give you one more example. After the devastating Waldo Canyon \nFire that burned several homes in Colorado Springs and surrounding \nareas, the flood potential in the burned areas is now 20 times higher \nthan before the fire. So now folks in the burned area and others \ndownstream could see a 100-year flood from the same amount of rainfall \nthat would have caused a 5-year rainfall before the wildfires occurred. \nAlready property owners in the Colorado Springs vicinity have received \nat least four flash-flood warnings since the fire. The need for \nstabilizing this ground and restoring the burned areas on both federal \nand private land is critical to public safety, public health and the \nprevention of another disaster.\n  This is why I have filed an amendment to provide additional emergency \nfunds to the Emergency Watershed Protection Program. This program \nprovides funding and technical support to restore and stabilize soil in \ncritical watersheds in the aftermath of severe wild fires and other \nnatural disasters, such as floods and hurricanes--which are also \nimportant to many members from our coastal states.\n  I understand that there will not be an opportunity to amend the \npending bill as a result of an agreement made with the House to avoid a \ngovernment shutdown, so I will not attempt to call up my amendment. \nBut, I want to ensure that my colleagues here understand the gravity of \nthe situation faced by those who supply safe drinking water to the \npeople of Colorado, by those who store water in our reservoirs to \nirrigate, and by those who fear a rainfall could devastate their \nlivelihoods again after already experiencing significant loss from \nwildfire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, discussions continue about processing the \nbusiness we need to address before we leave. As I have said repeatedly, \nwe need to do just a couple things before we break for the elections. \nWe need to pass the CR. We need to vote on proceeding to the \nsportsmen's package.\n  To help move the CR, we have been told that the Republicans now have \ndecided they are willing to vote sometime on the Paul bill on foreign \naid and also the Iran containment resolution. As I said yesterday, we \nare willing to do that.\n  In the worst case, under the rules, the cloture vote on the CR would \noccur tomorrow night--at 1 a.m. on Saturday. Once we invoke cloture on \nthe continuing resolution, the 30 hours postcloture would run out at \nabout 7:30 or 8 o'clock in the morning Sunday, and we would vote then \nto pass the CR, which would be immediately followed by a vote on the \nsportsmen's package.\n  I am happy to continue these discussions. We are working to see if we \ncan schedule these votes to occur at a time that is more convenient to \nSenators. I\n\n[[Page S6525]]\n\nhope we can have more to report on that tomorrow. It appears at this \nstage there is no agreement on having any votes tomorrow, so we may \nhave to finish our work tomorrow, beginning tomorrow night, very late.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it has been 20 years since our Nation's \nfinal nuclear weapons test. ``Divider'' was the name appropriately \ngiven to the final test on September 23, 1992; 8 days later, President \nGeorge Bush, Sr., declared a moratorium on testing that is still in \nplace today. That last test, along with nearly 1,000 others, was \ncarried out at the Nevada National Security Site, formerly known as the \nNevada Test Site.\n  This site has a storied history; it was used intensively during the \nCold War to test nuclear weapons in our fight against tyranny and is \nremembered by all Americans for the iconic images the atomic bomb \ncontinues to invoke. Testing weapons and building our nuclear arsenal \nwas necessary, but there was a price to pay--and it was the health of \nour hard-working and patriotic Cold War veterans and the many people \nwho lived downwind of the test site.\n  Since January 11, 1951, hundreds of thousands of men and women--\nincluding miners, millers, and haulers--played a critical role in \nbuilding the nuclear deterrent that kept our Nation secure during the \nCold War and still contributes to our national security today. These \nAmerican heroes were on the front line of our national security. They \nserved valiantly to help our Nation defend itself, but their personal \nsacrifice was immense. While serving their country honorably during one \nof the most dangerous conflicts in our Nation's history, many of \nNevada's Cold War veterans sacrificed their health and well-being for \ntheir country.\n  After personally meeting with and listening to many unfortunate \nstories from brave Nevadans about illnesses they had gotten from their \nnuclear weapons work, I was pleased to help pass the bipartisan Energy \nEmployees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act in 2000, as \nwell as an expansion of the law in 2004. This important program \nprovides vital monetary compensation and medical coverage to Nevada's \ntest site workers suffering from radiation-induced cancers, beryllium \ndisease, silicosis, and other illnesses caused by toxic chemicals.\n  In 2005, I began to hear from workers and survivors saying that they \nwere being put through a seemingly endless stream of bureaucratic \nredtape only to be denied compensation in the end. I was enraged that \nworkers who had developed cancer while protecting our Nation were being \ndenied compensation simply because their employer failed to keep \naccurate records of each worker's radiation exposure.\n  While we succeeded in securing automatic compensation for workers \nduring the atmospheric testing years, those who served their Nation \nduring the underground testing years were let down by their country. I \nfought on their behalf and finally secured automatic compensation for \nthousands of workers during the underground testing years. I am proud \nthat this important program resulted in the payment of almost $500 \nmillion to 4,599 sick test site workers and their survivors. Nevada's \nCold War heroes have made immeasurable contributions to our Nation's \nsecurity, and the sacrifices they have made--to their health and their \nlives--make it impossible for us to ever adequately thank them.\n  Today, the Nevada National Security Site has taken on new roles to \naddress 21st-century threats. This includes detecting dangerous \nweapons, treaty verification, fighting terrorism and nuclear smuggling, \nand training first responders. The site can even play a role in clean \nenergy demonstration and development to meet our Nation's energy needs \nusing a resource southern Nevada has an abundance of--sunshine. I am \nalso proud of the growing nonproliferation mission at the Nevada \nNational Security Site. These critical activities are playing a vital \nrole in the Nation's arms control efforts while putting Nevadans to \nwork making our Nation more secure.\n  There are many more opportunities to utilize the Nevada National \nSecurity Site's ultrasecure location to bolster out Nation's security. \nIt is an installation whose relevance is timeless because we will \nalways need a place to test new technologies, house sensitive materials \nand equipment, train our security forces, and know for sure that \nunwanted eyes are not watching.\n  Finally, I am proud that while we work to grow and modernize the \nmission of the Nevada National Security Site, the site's storied past \nand the people behind it will never be forgotten. The National Atomic \nTesting Museum in Las Vegas is an affiliate of the Smithsonian \nInstitution and recently was named by Congress as a ``National'' \nmuseum. This important institution collects and publicly displays \nartifacts and documentation that tell the stories of how the Nevada \nTest Site helped protect our country during the Cold War.\n  I am proud to stand here today to recognize this historic day in \nNevada and America's history, marking 20 years since we have ended \nnuclear testing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6525-3", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6525-S6526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DENNIS MEYERS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man \nthat will leave a legacy of firm economic performance, solid physician \nrecruitment, and a commitment to nurture community partnerships in the \nhospitals of his area. Mr. Dennis Meyers of Clay County, KY, was named \nto the Clay County Days Wall of Fame in August 2012 for the amazing \nwork he has accomplished in his community and the community's hospital, \nManchester Memorial Hospital.\n  Dennis Meyers's spectacular working experience began as a pastor in \n1969 in Nebraska and Illinois. In 1986, he decided on a change of \ncareer. He accepted a job as a registered nurse at Hanford Hospital. \nAfter 4 successful years, Dennis transferred to San Joaquin Community \nHospital to fill the position of vice president. Dennis never stopped \ndreaming and believing. He continued his career to become chief \noperating officer and vice president of Manchester Memorial Hospital.\n  Dennis initiated numerous community-outreach programs, each serving \nas evidence to show the worth of this man and the dedication he \ndisplayed towards his community. Dennis introduced Mission in Motion, \npublic health screenings, Live It Up!, and mission-outreach programs to \nenrich the Clay County community.\n  Dennis married Susan Meyers, who also works for the hospital. They \nhave three children, who, like their father, hold nursing degrees. \nDennis urges that success come to everyone in life. He strategizes on \nhelping the community that is served by the hospital through Community \nOutreach and church programs.\n  At this time, I would like to ask my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to \njoin me in honoring Mr. Dennis Meyers as he has been named to the Clay \nCounty Days Wall of Fame. His ambition and hard work ethic has improved \nand will continue to improve the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n  A news story highlighting the accomplishments of Dennis Meyer was \nrecently published in the Manchester Enterprise.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nhonored Kentuckian who has worked to better the Commonwealth. Mr. Tess \nLipps of Clay County, KY, was named to the Clay County Days Wall of \nFame in August 2012 for the extraordinary work he has accomplished in \nhis community during his lifetime.\n  Tess Lipps was born July 8, 1947, in a section of Clay County known \nas Martin's Creek. Growing up with eight brothers and sisters, Tess and \nsiblings learned what some would call the essentials in life: integrity \nto others and faith in God. Upon graduating from Clay County High \nSchool in 1964, Tess applied these essentials to his life.\n  In 1971, Tess married Barbara Hicks. From this critical point in \nlife, Tess and Barb spent the next greater portion of their lives \nliving to serve God and their community. They became youth leaders at \nthe Manchester Pentecostal Church and taught a teenage boys' Sunday \nschool class. In 1972, the couple opened the first Christian bookstore \nin the area in which they lived, the Gospel Variety Shoppe.\n  Tess continued to accomplish and succeed in a plethora of activities. \nHe became an agent with the Commonwealth Insurance Company in 1984. \nProgressing through the ranks, he was promoted to sales manager and \nalso branch manager. He retired from this position in 2003, but his \nwork to the community did not cease.\n  In addition to serving as a board member of Agape and emcee of the \nHalleluiah Day Festivals, Tess answered his calling in life and became \npastor of the Manchester Gospel Mission Church in 2006. Tess also \nformed the Clay County Cancer Coalition and the UPWARD Soccer Program \nin Clay County, despite some doubts from others. He was told that the \ncommunity and church were too small to support such large programs. But \nTess's faith allowed him to dream the impossible, and then accomplish \nthat dream.\n  This year, 250 kids played soccer on a brandnew field in the \ncommunity. Tess and Barb have been blessed beyond measure. The wish of \nTess for the community is that all people can work together making \ngreater opportunities for future generations. Mr. Tess Lipps has served \nhis community well.\n  At this time, I would like to ask my colleagues in the Senate to join \nme in honoring Mr. Tess Lipps, an individual whose hard work and \ndedication to the community, combined with faith and persistence, has \nforever changed the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n  A news story highlighting the achievements of Tess Lipps was recently \npublished in the Manchester Enterprise.

Mr. President, William Shakespeare once said, ``Nimble \nthought can jump both sea and land.''\n  Today I wish to pay tribute to a U.S. Government agency whose \nthinking is nimble and its actions as well. The Office of the U.S. \nTrade Representative is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year.\n  For 50 years, USTR's small but elite staff has been crossing the \nglobe, over sea and land, to break down barriers to American exports, \nand they have helped develop a world linked by trade, a world governed \nby rules, to ensure a level playing field for our exporters and their \nworkers.\n  USTR has been remarkably effective at that task. Since the creation \nof the Special Trade Representative in 1962, annual U.S. trade has \ngrown from $52.1 billion to $4.8 trillion, contributing to economic \ngrowth of nearly 350 percent. USTR led the way through 20 FTA \nnegotiations, multiple GATT and WTO Rounds, and countless bilateral \ntrade negotiations in its quest to create opportunities abroad for U.S. \nbusinesses, workers, farmers and ranchers, in order to reach the 95 \npercent of global consumers who live outside the United States.\n  USTR spearheaded the effort to create the fundamental rules and \nstructures that underpin the global trading system. It successfully \nconcluded the Uruguay Round negotiations that created the World Trade \nOrganization. The WTO contributed to an explosion of trade and extended \nthe rules-based trading system to nearly every trading nation of the \nworld.\n  Throughout it all, the dedicated officials at USTR have maintained \ntheir commitment to expanding economic growth through trade, for the \nbenefit of all Americans. Through Democratic and Republican \nadministrations, USTR officials have put the interests of all Americans \nfirst. And they have accomplished so much with so little. Never larger \nthan its current strength of about 250 professionals, USTR has turned \nits small size into a virtue. USTR acts and reacts quickly, cutting \nthrough bureaucratic obstacles in the government to develop and execute \nmarket-opening strategies to break down barriers facing American \nexporters abroad.\n  As part of the Executive Office of the President, USTR is perfectly \npositioned to leverage the resources of the entire U.S. government and \nto integrate the full range of stakeholder interests on trade issues. \nAnd it is perfectly positioned, and has served well, as an effective \nand indispensable interlocutor with the U.S. Congress. USTR understands \nand respects Congress's constitutionally established role in the \nregulation of international trade. Through its close consultations with \nCapitol Hill, USTR presents to the world a trade policy that enjoys \nbroad support.\n  USTR would not be as effective and it could not perform its role if \nhoused elsewhere in the government or were it to become much larger and \nmore bureaucratic. As others have observed over the years, if USTR did \nnot exist in its current form, it would have to be reinvented.\n\n[[Page S6527]]\n\n  USTR is now hard at work on a number of initiatives that continue its \nlegacy of expanding trade for the benefit of all Americans, such as the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, \nand World Trade Organization agreements on topics from services \nliberalization to customs reform. And USTR remains hard at work \nenforcing our existing trade agreements at the WTO and elsewhere, to \nensure the United States receives the full benefit of those agreements.\n  So I would like to extend my congratulations to Ambassador Kirk, his \npredecessors, and the entire USTR team past and present for reaching \nthe 50-year milestone. I look forward to another half century of \nstellar accomplishments, and I can assure you that I will do everything \nI can to help make that possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6527-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SECOND BIG SKY HONOR FLIGHT VISIT TO D.C.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Eighty-nine World War II \nveterans from Montana will take part in the Big Sky Honor Flight and \ncome to Washington, DC, to visit their monument--the WWII Memorial.\n  Their trip is hosted by the Big Sky Honor Flight Program. The mission \nis to recognize American veterans for their sacrifices and achievements \nby flying them to Washington, DC, to see their memorials at no cost.\n  These veterans come from all parts of our great State. This is a \nspecial weekend for this group of heroes. It is also a time to give \nthanks for the courage and sacrifice of all our veterans and \nservicemembers. It is a time to reflect on the sacrifices made by those \nwho fought on the front in Europe, on the battlefields of Korea, in the \njungles of Vietnam, the deserts of Iraq, and those who are currently \nfighting in the mountains of Afghanistan. We must not forget their \nsacrifices.\n  I am so pleased I will be able to meet with these courageous \nMontanans.

Mr. President, would the Senator from South Dakota enter \ninto a colloquy to discuss concerns I have with his bill S. 1956 and a \nsuggested amendment I have filed for consideration, which is currently \nrunning through the hotline process?\n  First of all I want to thank my colleagues for their willingness to \nwork with me to address some of the concerns I have with this bill as \nit was reported out of the Commerce Committee.\n  While I have some ongoing reservations about the precedent and \npotential impacts this bill could have on our relations with our \nclosest European allies, I am willing to allow legislation to move \nforward if I may get consent to have my amendment agreed to.\n  I would like to discuss my amendment and the process which the \nlegislation prescribes the Secretary of Transportation to follow in \ndetermining whether to prohibit U.S. airlines from participating in the \nEuropean Union's carbon emissions trading scheme.\n  The second paragraph of subsection (a), section 3 of the legislation \ncontains a provision that is designed to ``hold harmless'' U.S. \nairlines from the fees, taxes or fines that they incur from the EU \nunder the emissions trading scheme.\n  While the Secretary of Transportation has discretion as to how he \nwill act to ``hold harmless'' our air carriers, it is understood that \nthese actions could possibly require some form of payment by the \nFederal Government.\n  One of my greatest concerns with the bill, which I believe the \nsponsors of the bill share with me, and I appreciate their interest in \nworking with me to address this issue, is that any payments that may \nresult from this provision not come at the expense of the American \ntaxpayer.\n  I would like to ask the Senator this question: is it correct that it \nis not his intent that any costs or remunerations triggered by this \nlegislation come at the expense of U.S. taxpayer dollars?\n  Mr. THUNE. That is correct, it has always been my intent, and it is \nshared by the Congressional Budget Office, and the Secretary of \nTransportation, who will have the primary responsibility of \nimplementing this legislation.\n  According to the CBO, ``enacting S. 1956 would have no significant \nimpact on the federal budget.''\n  I ask unanimous consent at this time to have their entire report \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   August 1, 2012.\n     Hon. John D. Rockefeller IV,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 1956, the European \n     Union Emissions Trading Scheme Prohibition Act of 2011.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Megan \n     Carroll.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Douglas W. Elmendorf.\n       Enclosure.\n     S. 1956--European Union Emissions Trading Scheme Prohibition \n         Act of 2011\n       The European Union (EU) has established the European Union \n     Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), a regulatory framework \n     related to greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, the ETS \n     covers emissions from air carriers that operate flights \n     within, to, and from EU member states. Negotiations between \n     the U.S. government and the EU about the applicability of the \n     ETS to U.S. air carriers are ongoing, and the potential \n     outcome of those negotiations is unclear.\n       S. 1956 would direct the Secretary of Transportation to \n     prohibit U.S. air carriers from participating in the ETS if \n     the Secretary believes such a prohibition to be in the public \n     interest. The bill would direct federal agencies to continue \n     negotiations in pursuit of a worldwide approach to addressing \n     aviation-related emissions and would authorize the Secretary \n     to use existing authorities to ensure that U.S. air carriers \n     are held harmless for any costs they incur if they \n     participate in the ETS.\n       CBO estimates that enacting S. 1956 would have no \n     significant impact on the federal budget. We expect that the \n     bill would not alter the scope of diplomatic efforts \n     currently underway or federal agencies' costs to participate \n     in those efforts, which are subject to appropriation. The \n     bill would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, \n     pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply.\n       S. 1956 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined \n     in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and would not \n     affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments.\n       S. 1956 would impose a private-sector mandate, as defined \n     in UMRA, if U.S. air carriers would be prohibited from \n     participating in the ETS. The cost of the mandate would \n     depend on how the prohibition is administered by the \n     Department of Transportation. Because information about how \n     the prohibition would be implemented is not available, CBO \n     has no basis for estimating the cost, if any, to U.S. air \n     carriers. Consequently, CBO cannot determine whether the cost \n     of the mandate would exceed the annual threshold established \n     in UMRA for private-sector mandates ($146 million in 2012, \n     adjusted annually for inflation).\n\n[[Page S6528]]\n\n       On September 23, 2011, CBO transmitted a cost estimate for \n     H.R. 2594, the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme \n     Prohibition Act of 2011, as ordered reported by the House \n     Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on September \n     23, 2011. The two bills are similar, and the CBO cost \n     estimates are the same.\n       The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Megan Carroll \n     (for federal costs) and Amy Petz (for the impact on the \n     private sector). The estimate was approved by Theresa Gullo, \n     Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.\n  Mr. THUNE. Additionally, at a recent Commerce Committee hearing on my \nbill, Secretary LaHood was asked if any possible action of \nimplementation could ``include the U.S. government paying EU \nauthorities directly or compensating the operators for any fines \nincurred for non-compliance with EU ETS.''\n  He responded, ``We have absolutely no intention of asking the U.S. \ntaxpayer to pay any ETS fines incurred for non-compliance with EU ETS, \ndirectly or indirectly.''\n  I appreciate Senator Cardin and Lautenberg for coming forward and \nworking with me to clarify this point, and I thank them both for \nreleasing their hold.\n  I am happy that we have been able to come to a bipartisan agreement \non my bill and look forward to final passage today in the Senate and \nhopefully soon by the House of Representatives so we can send a clear \nmessage to the EU that ETS is arbitrary, unfair, and a clear violation \nof international law.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I appreciate the Sentor clarifying his intent, and I am \nglad he shares my concern.\n  I believe my amendment helps make the intent of the legislation \nclear.\n  My amendment adds a third paragraph to subsection (a) of section 3 of \nthe bill.\n  The amendment will explicitly exclude any appropriated funds or user \nfee receipts to be expended on actions taken under the hold harmless \nclause.\n  This amendment will ensure that any taxpayer dollars, either through \nappropriations or through user fee receipts, are expressly prohibited \nfrom supporting actions resulting from the held harmless clause of the \nbill.\n  Would my colleague agree that my amendment assures that no U.S. \ntaxpayer dollars will be expended on any held harmless actions that may \nresult from this bill?\n  Mr. THUNE. Yes.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I thank the Senator for his cooperation with me on this \nimportant fiscal matter.\n  I want to make it clear to my colleagues, as this bill progresses \nforward or is reconciled with a less thoughtful House proposal, I do \nwant my colleagues to understand that should the Senate have to \nreconsider a different proposal in a conference report that I intend to \nreserve my right to object.\n  I also want my colleagues to understand that I feel that the United \nStates and countries around the globe must take actions to address the \nthreat carbon emissions pose to the global environment.\n  I think there are some legitimate concerns with the way the EU has \nproposed to take unilateral actions to reduce carbon emissions from the \naviation sector.\n  I don't fault the EU for their leadership in the face of what has \nthus far been nearly 15 years of failed multinational negotiations on \nhow we as cooperating nations should be reducing or mitigating aviation \ncarbon emissions.\n  I would like for the United States to take greater action to address \nthis problem, and in many respects I think it is unfortunate that the \nUnited States has not demonstrated the same kind of leadership that the \nnations of Europe have taken on this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6528-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6528-S6530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE IN SUDAN\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to highlight the following \nletter written by over 60 genocide scholars, including Dr. Samuel \nTotten of the University of Arkansas. Their letter urges the Obama \nadministration to do more to end the humanitarian catastrophe occurring \nin South Kordofan and Blue Nile States of Sudan.\n  Last summer I joined a group of bipartisan Senators in making a \nsimilar request of the administration. Unfortunately, humanitarian aid \nto South Kordofan and Blue Nile continues to be severely limited and \nthe violence has not ceased.\n  I applaud the authors of this letter for their continued advocacy to \nensure that another genocide does not occur in Sudan, and I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  August 31, 2012.\n     To: President Barack Obama; Secretary of State Hillary \n         Clinton; Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice; \n         Special Assistant to the President Samantha Power.\n     From: The Undersigned Genocide Scholars\n     Subject: Humanitarian Catastrophe in South Kordofan and Blue \n         Nile States of Sudan\n       Dear President Obama, Secretary of State Clinton, \n     Ambassador Rice and Special Assistant Power: On June 6, 2011, \n     the Sudanese regime, led by indicted war criminal Omar al-\n     Bashir, unleashed a wave of targeted ethnic killings against \n     the people of the Nuba Mountains in South Kordofan state, \n     Sudan. Since then this state-sponsored violence has spread to \n     engulf much of South Kordofan and Blue Nile states.\n       The continuing multiple atrocities amount to at least \n     crimes against humanity. This, in and of itself, is alarming. \n     According to the tenets of the Responsibility to Protect now \n     is the time to protect the targeted population.\n       Satellite imagery has revealed mass graves, razed \n     communities, and the indiscriminate low altitude aerial \n     bombardment of civilian areas in South Kordofan state. \n     Reliable eyewitnesses continue to report systematic \n     government shelling and bombing of refugee evacuation routes, \n     helicopter gunships hunting civilians as they flee their \n     homes and farmland to hide in caves, and a deliberate and \n     widespread blockage of humanitarian aid into South Kordofan \n     and Blue Nile states. Anecdotal evidence of perpetrators \n     screaming racist slurs as civilians are killed and raped are \n     familiar to anyone who knows what has been happening in \n     Darfur since 2003.\n       Sufficient evidence exists for us to believe the Sudanese \n     regime is attempting to annihilate those whom the government \n     suspects of supporting the Sudan People's Liberation \n     Movement-North's (SPLM-N) aims. Hence many local people are \n     automatically targeted regardless of their true political \n     affiliations.\n       Hundreds of thousands of Sudanese remain trapped in South \n     Kordofan, the victims of forced starvation, unable to farm \n     their land. This critical situation largely mirrors what the \n     same regime perpetrated in the 1990s, a case of genocide by \n     attrition.\n       Meanwhile in Blue Nile state, a scorched earth campaign by \n     government forces has forced the SPLM-N to retreat, leaving \n     tens of thousands with no protection from the perpetrators.\n       As genocide scholars we have a solemn responsibility to \n     educate the public about the horrors of the past in the hope \n     of creating a future free of such crimes. We are the keepers \n     of the chapters of human history that are difficult to \n     confront, casting a dark shadow on all of humanity. We study \n     the past to find ways to prevent such egregious actions in \n     the future. We exist to remind the world of humanity's \n     capacity to commit genocide anywhere and against any group of \n     people.\n       It is because of that responsibility that we write to you. \n     We call on you to fulfill your responsibilities as global \n     leaders when it comes to confronting mankind's most \n     terrifying of crimes.\n       Although we welcome your efforts to aid the refugees who \n     have found their way to camps in South Sudan, we must point \n     out that as world leaders you have the moral authority \n     granted by the UN's unanimous 2005 declaration of the \n     Responsibility to Protect to demand delivery of aid to those \n     inside Sudan. As guarantors of the Comprehensive Peace \n     Agreement signed that same year, moreover, you have not \n     fulfilled your legal and moral obligation to sanction \n     violators of that agreement.\n       The Sudanese regime continues to slaughter its own \n     civilians, while denying them access to aid and in defiance \n     of various international treaties and conventions it has \n     signed, not to mention the Sudanese constitution.\n       The Tripartite Agreement signed on 4 August 2012 in Addis \n     Ababa, called upon the Government of Sudan to allow \n     humanitarian access to all areas of the Nuba Mountains and \n     the Blue Nile state dependent on certain conditions. Yet the \n     Bashir regime's track record leads us to fear it will \n     interfere with aid delivery to those in most need. Seasonal \n     inaccessibility also requires extraordinary and timely \n     arrangements, such as airdrops. Hence we beseech you to take \n     the following steps immediately to ensure aid is delivered to \n     South Kordofan and Blue Nile.\n       Establish a land and air humanitarian corridor through \n     which aid can be delivered without interference or hindrance \n     from Sudanese security, military or other forces or proxies.\n       Secure arrangements with the SPLM-N for the airlifting of \n     these supplies directly into territory in their control.\n       Inform relevant Sudanese officials that, due to the urgency \n     of the catastrophe created by their actions, the United \n     States will deliver relief directly into the war-affected \n     areas underneath SPLM-N control.\n\n[[Page S6529]]\n\n       Invite relevant Sudanese officials to observe the cargo to \n     be delivered so they can verify the contents.\n       Use the most effective means possible, including airlifts, \n     to get supplies into affected areas in SPLM-N control.\n       Keep armed escort planes on standby for the protection of \n     aid delivery planes if necessary.\n       It is therefore unwise to respond to the Khartoum regime's \n     various crimes with appeasement. By allowing the NCP to \n     behave with impunity, the U.S. and the rest of the \n     international community signals a weakness that only \n     emboldens those who would flout its own international \n     agreements.\n       Furthermore, it is unwise to assume, as the international \n     community does, that Khartoum intends the best for its \n     citizens. Therefore we call on your administration to end \n     Khartoum's effective blockade of aid to South Kordofan and \n     Blue Nile. The regime will continue to kill their own people \n     if once again the United States declines to use the economic \n     and diplomatic leverage at its disposal to enforce the \n     delivery of aid into South Kordofan and Blue Nile states \n     under internationally acceptable terms.\n       We strongly urge you to act now to stave off the starvation \n     of an entire people. Nothing would speak louder to the United \n     States' concern for the protection of international human \n     rights than an immediate operation to deliver aid to the Nuba \n     Mountains people while they are still alive and able to be \n     helped.\n       If your administration chooses to stand with the victims of \n     Sudan's continuing campaign of ethnic cleansing, then history \n     will accord you respect and honor.

I ask unanimous consent that the following article \nfrom the Wall Street Journal on September 18, 2012, on the cost to \ntaxpayers for the wind production tax credit be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Puff, the Magic Drag on the Economy\n\n\n Time to let the pernicious production tax credit for wind power blow \n                                  away\n\n                  (By Lamar Alexander and Mike Pompeo)\n\n       As Congress works to reduce spending and avert a debt \n     crisis, lawmakers will have to decide which government \n     projects are truly national priorities, and which are \n     wasteful. A prime example of the latter is the production tax \n     credit for wind power. It is set to expire on Dec. 31--but \n     may be extended yet again, for the seventh time.\n       This special provision in the tax code was first enacted in \n     1992 as a temporary subsidy to enable a struggling industry \n     to become competitive. Today the provision provides a credit \n     against taxes of $22 per megawatt hour of wind energy \n     generated.\n       From 2009 to 2013, federal revenues lost to wind-power \n     developers are estimated to be $14 billion--$6 billion from \n     the production tax credit, plus $8 billion courtesy of an \n     alternative-energy subsidy in the stimulus package--according \n     to the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Treasury \n     Department. If Congress were to extend the production tax \n     credit, it would mean an additional $12 billion cost to \n     taxpayers over the next 10 years.\n       There are many reasons to let this giveaway expire, \n     including wind energy's inherent unreliability and its \n     inability to stand on its own two feet after 20 years. But \n     one of the most compelling reasons is provided in a study \n     released Sept. 14 by the NorthBridge Group, an energy \n     consultancy. The study discusses a government-created \n     economic distortion called ``negative pricing.''\n       This is how it works. Coal- and nuclear-fired plants \n     provide a reliable supply of electricity when the demand is \n     high, as on a hot summer day. They generate at lower levels \n     when the demand is low, such as at night.\n       But wind producers collect a tax credit for every kilowatt \n     hour they generate, whether utilities need the electricity or \n     not. If the wind is blowing, they keep cranking the \n     windmills.\n       Why? The NorthBridge Group's report (``Negative Electricity \n     Prices and the Production Tax Credit'') finds that government \n     largess is so great that wind producers can actually pay the \n     electrical grid to take their power when demand is low and \n     still turn a profit by collecting the credit--and they are \n     increasingly doing so. The wind pretax subsidy is actually \n     higher than the average price for electricity in many of the \n     wholesale markets tracked by the Energy Information \n     Administration.\n       This practice drives the price of electricity down in the \n     short run. Wind-energy supporters say that's a good thing. \n     But it is hazardous to the economy's health in the long run.\n       Temporarily lower energy prices driven by wind-power's \n     negative pricing will cripple clean-coal and nuclear-power \n     companies. But running coal and nuclear out of business is \n     not good for the U.S. economy. There is no way a country like \n     this one--which uses 20% to 25% of all the electricity in the \n     world--can operate with generators that turn only when the \n     wind blows.\n       The Obama administration and other advocates of wind power \n     argue that the subsidy provided by the tax credit allows the \n     wind industry to sustain American jobs. But they are jobs \n     that exist only because of the subsidy. Keeping a weak \n     technology alive that can't make it on its own won't create \n     nearly as many jobs as the private sector could create if it \n     had the kind of low-cost, reliable, clean electricity that \n     wind power simply can't generate.\n       While the cost of renewable energy has declined over the \n     years, it is still far more expensive than conventional \n     sources. And even the administration's secretary of energy, \n     Steven Chu, calls wind ``a mature technology,'' which should \n     mean it is sufficiently advanced to compete in a free market \n     without government subsidies. If wind power cannot compete on \n     its own after 20 years without costly special privileges, it \n     never will.\n\n       Mr. Alexander is a Republican senator from Tennessee.

Mr. President, I am proud to recognize all those \naffiliated with the Children's Leukemia Foundation of Michigan as they \ncelebrate 60 years of dedicated service and invaluable support for \nMichigan families. Their efforts have made a tremendous difference in \nthe lives of individuals diagnosed with leukemia or a related disorder. \nThis is important work, and we are all grateful for their efforts. An \nexciting evening has been planned to commemorate this milestone in \nBirmingham, Michigan this Saturday.\n  The Children's Leukemia Foundation of Michigan has been at the \nforefront of the battle against various blood disorders for six \ndecades, helping countless families across Michigan deal with these \ndevastating illnesses and to navigate the many important decisions they \nface as a consequence. Since its inception in the late 1940s and its \nincorporation in 1952, this organization has sought to equip patients \nand their loved ones with the resources, information, and guidance they \nneed to make informed decisions.\n  Each individual who is diagnosed with a disorder must make a number \nof important decisions about their care and circumstances. This is \nwhere the CLF steps in. The mission of the CLF is ``to provide and \npromote compassionate, personalized support to people in Michigan \naffected by Leukemia and other related disorders.'' This is \naccomplished through a comprehensive array of services for patients and \ntheir loved ones, ranging from support groups, to an online resource \nroom, to a resource kit for families and caregivers that contains \nuseful and timely information about the disorder and the road ahead.\n  The financial and emotional support the CLF provides is crucial. \nWhether it is listening to patients and caregivers, helping to defray \nthe cost of a prescription, referring an individual to the appropriate \nagency or service provider, or paying lodging for a family member, the \nCLF stands ready and willing to assist families in their time of need. \nUnderstanding that illness affects the entire family, the CLF offers \nservices such as a day of respite for family members, peer support from \nothers who share a common experience, a holiday toy program for \nchildren, and a ticket program that gives families a precious few hours \nof fun and joy. The deep concern and care this organization shows \ncertainly helps to lessen the stress on families.\n  Organizations like the CLF help to provide a measure of comfort and \nassistance to patients and their loved ones. I know my colleagues will \njoin me in thanking all those affiliated with the Children's Leukemia \nFoundation of Michigan for their hard work and tireless commitment on \nbehalf of families across Michigan. The positive impact they continue \nto have on the lives of Michiganians living with leukemia and related \ndisorders, is tremendous, and I extend my deepest appreciation for \ntheir many years of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6530-3", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6530-S6531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ROSS OGDEN\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today I wish to honor a dedicated, \ninspiring--and one of our Nation's longest serving--emergency \nresponders. Ross Ogden has quite literally given to the American Red \nCross for his entire adult life.\n  Beginning his service in 1960 as one of the youngest members of the \nGreenwich chapter of the American Red Cross, Mr. Ogden served since his \nhigh school days with his local chapter, now known as Metro New York \nNorth. Throughout his academic tenure at Swarthmore College and then \nthe University of Virginia, Mr. Ogden has helped and rescued fellow \nAmericans confronting crisis, loss, and pain. He has administered aid \nduring our most devastating national disasters, traveling around the \ncountry to join his family of Red Cross volunteers, ready to help at a \nmoment's notice. In the wake of Los Angeles' deadly earthquake in 1994, \non 9/11, and during Hurricane Katrina, Mr. Ogden risked danger to help \nothers without hesitation. He is\n\n[[Page S6531]]\n\nnow, most deservedly, the national chair for disaster services.\n  While giving on a national scale, Mr. Ogden maintains his regional \nallegiance to the Connecticut area, currently a member of the board of \ndirectors for the Red Cross' blood services in the metro north region. \nHe is passionate about maintaining a plentiful blood supply for \nAmericans in critical need, working as a blood volunteer for \nGreenwich's emergency blood coverage team.\n  Over the past years, Mr. Ogden has been formally recognized through \ntwo significant lifetime achievement awards, including the Clara Barton \nAward and the Harriman Award for Distinguished Volunteer Service, which \nis the most highly regarded, national recognition given by the Red \nCross. Appropriately, Mr. Ogden received this high honor on the \nanniversary of his 50 years of service to the Red Cross. A mentor to \nyoung volunteers and passionate about inspiring citizens and \ncommunities to volunteer for the first time, he is unwaveringly \ncommitted to the future of the American Red Cross.\n  Mr. Ogden is a role model for all who give back. I welcome my \ncolleagues in the Senate to join me in commending Mr. Ross Ogden for \nhis tremendous personal service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6531-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    125TH ANNIVERSARY OF UNITED WAY\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize United Way \nof Connecticut as they celebrate their 125th anniversary and over a \ncentury of mobilizing local communities to achieve positive change.\n  Founded in 1887 by community leaders in Denver, CO, United Way \nWorldwide is now the world's largest privately supported nonprofit \norganization. This invaluable national network--rooted in our country's \nhistory but ever-attuned to the present--brings together a diverse \ncollection of community stakeholders for a common purpose. Schools, \ngovernment agencies, businesses, labor groups, the faith community, and \nmany others have combined to promote academic achievement, financial \nstability, and healthy living. Connecticut is lucky to have 15 local \nUnited Way chapters serving communities all across the State. \nRemarkably, United Way of Connecticut has enhanced the quality of life \nfor countless citizens. Almost everyone benefits from programs \nsupported by United Way. Almost every community has critical \norganizations whose good work is supported by United Way.\n  Connecticut's United Way pioneered use of an informational database \nfor citizens. While many States and major cities have developed an \ninformation hotline in the last few years, United Way of Connecticut \nhad already created its ``2-1-1'' system in 1976. Connecticut's system \nquickly gained national recognition for its efficiency and \neffectiveness, and by the middle of the 1980s, it had become a model \nemulated by the rest of the country. In 2012 alone, this hotline was \nused over 550,000 times by constituents of all ages to find assistance \non topics ranging from health and early childcare to crisis \nintervention and disaster response. This information is offered in a \nstreamlined and user-friendly manner, and in this way, United Way and \nUnited Way of Connecticut help constituents help themselves. These \nexcellent communication methods and this attention to accessibility at \nState and local levels have enabled the incredible influence of United \nWay throughout the Nation and world.\n  Sensitive to the rise of unemployment, United Way of Connecticut has \nalso developed crucial resources that help constituents get back to \nwork. After losing a job, many are unaware of the Federal, State, and \nlocal resources at their disposal. Thankfully, local United Way \nchapters can offer support, such as assistance with unemployment \ncompensation, job training services, foreclosure prevention aid, and \nutility assistance programs. Every day, these United Way chapters are \nhelping Connecticut citizens get back on their feet.\n  Additionally, despite challenging economic times and thanks to a \nrobust partnership with local labor organizations, United Way has made \nsignificant contributions to alleviating hunger. Annually, on the \nsecond Saturday in May, the National Association of Letter Carriers and \nUnited Way of Connecticut team up with the Connecticut Food Bank for \nthe Stamp Out Hunger Food Drive. In 2012, this invaluable initiative, \nwhich has become the world's largest 1-day food drive, collected over \n70 million pounds of nonperishable food items.\n  When a citizen is struggling to comprehend a complex health insurance \nprogram, searching for answers about their child's development, or \nsimply looking for a helping hand, they know that they can count on \ntheir local United Way. The Connecticut chapters have done \nextraordinary work in educating citizens, making accessible important \ncommunity resources, and serving as a constant source of hope.

Kristen Record, physics teacher at \nFrank Scott Bunnell High School in Stratford, was awarded in 2011, and \nDavid Bosso, social studies teacher at Berlin High School, was honored \nin 2012.\n  Since 1952, the Connecticut Teacher of the Year program has \nhighlighted educators who make significant impacts in Connecticut \nclassrooms and schools. Sponsored yearly by the Connecticut State \nDepartment of Education, one teacher in each local district is \nnominated. These district educators of the year have the opportunity to \nexchange advice and strategies and partake in advisory committees, \nworkshops, conferences, and forums, serving as changemakers for public \neducation on a national level. A teacher from each State is selected \nyearly from this pool and considered for the title of National Teacher \nof the Year.\n  I applaud Ms. Record and Mr. Bosso for earning this very well \ndeserved distinction. This yearly award highlights the vital importance \nof teachers in our States who can show our future leaders how to \nembrace accountability, self-assessment, and motivation for years to \ncome. They demonstrate that the quest to learn does not end at school, \ninspire exceptional teaching, and encourage all members of a community \nto become involved as teachers, mentors, and coaches.\n  Kristen Record has been central to the Bunnell High School community \nfor 12 years as a physics teacher, mentor to colleagues, and adviser on \neducation policy. Community participation and lifelong learning are key \nprinciples of her successful teaching methodology. In addition to her \ndaily responsibilities, Ms. Record is able to take a larger view of her \nclassroom, developing updated curriculum and achievement assessments \nwhile ensuring that every student is learning effectively. She has \nworked with her school district and throughout the State to improve the \nphysics curriculum, institute electronic grading methods, create \ndigital databases, and develop more effective ways of evaluating \nteachers and forming professional standards. Additionally, she has \nvolunteered as senior class adviser, supported fellow teachers as a \nTEAM mentor, and volunteered on the Stratford Education Association's \nexecutive board. Ms. Record is regarded as a leader throughout the \nState in roles to include science education consultant for the \nConnecticut Clean Energy Fund and the Connecticut Science Center and \nhigh school director for the Connecticut Science Teachers' Association, \ndemonstrating that opportunities to bring about positive change as a \nteacher are vast and exciting. Last year, she was appointed by the \nConnecticut Commissioner of Education to the Legislative Task Force for \nSecondary School Reform. And, recognized nationally in 2009 with the \nPresidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching, \nshe serves as a model of engaged teaching around the country. Growing \nup in a family of teachers, Ms. Record has continued her legacy, \nsharing this wisdom and experience with our future leaders.\n  David Bosso earned degrees from Eastern Connecticut State University \nand the University of Hartford, and has\n\n[[Page S6532]]\n\ngiven back to the State as a social studies teacher at Berlin High \nSchool since 1998. Beloved by students, he has inspired proficiency in \ncommunication skills, analysis, and reading comprehension by comparing \ncurrent events with historical patterns. Mr. Bosso has also advised \nstudent government and coached basketball. He is a national leader for \nsocial studies, serving on the board of directors of the Connecticut \nCouncil for the Social Studies, as cochair of the Northeast Regional \nConference on the Social Studies in 2012, and a participant of this \nyear's National Council for the Social Studies' annual national \nconference. He has been published in Connecticut History and is \ncurrently working towards a doctorate in education.\n  When named 2011 Connecticut Teacher of the Year, Ms. Record \neloquently described her role and the important job of educators around \nthe world, recognizing that ``tonight, we celebrate the fact that, as a \nteacher, you never truly know where your influence will end.'' Mr. \nBosso similarly proclaimed the significant, multifaceted role of \nteachers, while speaking at the Connecticut Education Association's \nRepresentative Assembly this year, urging fellow teachers to ``never, \nnever, again use the phrase, `I am just a teacher.' '' I invite my \ncolleagues to join me in acknowledging Ms. Record and Mr. Bosso, and \nask for their continued support of our concerned, courageous teachers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6532-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONGRATULATING DOUGLAS HUTTON\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Douglas Hutton, \nrecipient of the 2011 Milken Educator Award. He is the first teacher \nfrom Glastonbury High School to have ever received this prestigious \naward and the only educator from Connecticut to be awarded last year by \nthe Milken Family Foundation.\n  Since 1985, the Milken Family Foundation--under the leadership of \neducation visionary Lowell Milken and his family--has given thousands \nof Milken Educator Awards to top innovators of elementary and secondary \neducation across the country. Whether teachers, principals, or \nspecialists, these honorees are an exclusive group of experts who \ncontribute every day to the critical debate on how we can make our \nNation's schools better spaces for learning, growth, and the sparking \nof lifelong interests. One of the Milken Family Foundation's \ninitiatives--through the Lowell Milken Center--is distinguishing \n``unsung heroes that have changed the course of history.'' And so with \nthe Milken Educator Award, we acknowledge our Nation's dedicated \neducators who are not usually spotlighted but conscientiously work to \nhelp turn ideas, thoughts, and questions into interests, passions, and \nprojects.\n  Mr. Hutton has taught physics for 19 years, serving 17 of them at \nGlastonbury High School in Glastonbury, CT. He illuminates abstract \nconcepts that are difficult to grasp, sharing his love of Stephen \nHawkins, science, and math with his students. Through practical \ndemonstrations, group projects, and experiments, he shows that problem-\nsolving is challenging but rewarding. Mr. Hutton has said that teaching \n``all comes down to seeing [the students'] eyes light up when they \nunderstand a new idea.''\n  Mr. Hutton did not apply for this award but was selected by a panel \nof education experts who, each year, seek out unsung teachers who \ndemonstrate potential for and proven success in the classroom, engage \nin national discourse on academia, and convey an ``engaging and \ninspiring presence that motivates and impacts students, colleagues, and \nthe community.''\n  The Milken Family Foundation makes education a shared national \nagenda, connecting educators with other sectors of our society. The \nfoundation's multifaceted and interdisciplinary approach brings \nbusiness, government, and philanthropic leaders together in the quest \nfor innovative, realistic, and well-tested teaching methodology. \nThrough programs administered by the Milken Family Foundation's \nNational Institute for Excellence in Teaching, NIET, such as the System \nfor Teacher and Student Advancement and the NIET Best Practices Center, \nthe Milken Educator Award regards our Nation's best early to mid-level \nteachers as policy figures who can contribute their practical knowledge \non a national stage.\n  The Milken Family Foundation and especially Douglas Hutton, now a \nmember of the Milken community, deserve thanks for restoring faith in \nour educational system. I invite my Senate colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating Mr. Hutton, who has contributed to the lives of our \nyoung people in lasting, significant ways.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6532-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING ZEV WOLFSON\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I rise in a tribute to Zev Wolfson, an \nextraordinary philanthropist and humanitarian whose great deeds are \nunknown to most people because he never sought to make them known. \nThroughout his remarkable career, Mr. Wolfson offered millions of \npeople--of all ages all around the world--the opportunity to experience \nJewish education and give back to their families, religion, and \ncommunities with dignity and pride. He dedicated his life to supporting \nand advocating for Jewish outreach projects, tirelessly devoted to the \npower and importance of faith for future generations.\n  Throughout his life, Mr. Wolfson constantly aided communities \nwherever Jewish education was endangered. He began as an advocate for \nthe Jewish nation. Walking the halls of Congress, he vigorously and \nexpertly supported programs and institutions in Israel, such as schools \nand other educational centers--many helping Jewish refugees and their \nchildren who had escaped from Arab countries. Committed to providing \nassistance on a global scale, he focused on a particular project and, \nonce it was sustainable and self-sufficient, moved to the next one.\n  Mr. Wolfson donated millions of dollars to underprivileged areas of \nthe United States and underserved areas of the world. He drew from the \npersonal pain of exile to Siberia in wartime--where he carried his \nfather's body to a place where he could have a proper Jewish funeral in \nthe freezing tundra--and then served as a father figure to millions. He \nhelped young people, students, and families to stay connected with the \nJewish nation, in lands stretching from the former Soviet Union and \nIsrael to France and the United States.\n  As deliberately and tirelessly as he advanced his good deeds, he \nconsistently avoided public recognition for them. He gave without any \nexpectation of praise or acclaim, and his anonymity was purposeful and \npersistent. His diverse and numerous initiatives--birthright programs \nin colleges around the country, vocational and religious education \nactivities around the globe, and many other programs--made Mr. Wolfson \none of his generation's most influential leaders, but he remained \nvirtually unknown. Now, I invite my colleagues to join me in according \nMr. Wolfson this measure of recognition for the millions of people \nwhose lives he touched and enhanced.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6532-3", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6532-S6533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                100TH ANNIVERSARY OF CATHOLIC CHARITIES\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 100th \nanniversary of Cleveland Catholic Charities and its mission to serve \npeople in need throughout the Catholic Diocese of Cleveland.\n  Catholic Charities was established in Cleveland in 1912 under the \ndirection of Bishop John Farrelly during a time when there were few \norganized charities in the United States. It was founded in response to \nchallenging economic conditions that existed for the poor and orphaned \nof the day. Throughout the organization's 100-year history, its work, \nprograms and family centers have touched the lives of many people \nthroughout northeast Ohio.\n  Over the years, Catholic Charities' leaders, employees, supporters \nand volunteers have cared for their neighbors and provided guidance to \naddress the social needs of our community. Their charitable mission is \ninspirational and their generous work has had great impact, helping \nmillions of people. Their efforts provide meals, shelter, emergency \nassistance, counseling services, training and employment for many \nthroughout the 8 northeast Ohio counties in the diocese.\n  On this occasion I would like to congratulate Bishop Richard Lennon,\n\n[[Page S6533]]\n\nCleveland Catholic Charities, and the Catholic community and thank them \nfor their leadership, kindness, commitment and collective effort to \nserve the community and improve the lives of those in need. It is a \nprivilege to recognize this centennial anniversary, and wish Cleveland \nCatholic Charities all the best for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6533-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO TERRANCE C.Z. EGGER\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Terrance C.Z. \nEgger for his many contributions to the news industry over the past 30 \nyears. Mr. Egger will be retiring early next year from The Plain Dealer \nin Cleveland, OH, where he has served as publisher, president, and \nchief executive officer since 2006. I would like to recognize his \naccomplishments, his contributions to journalism, and his commitment to \nthe Greater Cleveland community.\n  Terry enjoyed an early start in the news business, when as a young \nman, he started his first newspaper job as a 6-year-old paperboy. Egger \nis a native of Rock Island, IL, and became the first in his family to \nattend college. He received a bachelor's degree from Augustana College \nin Sioux Falls, SD, and a master's degree from San Diego State \nUniversity.\n  Terry began his 30-year career at a small biweekly newspaper in \nSouthern California. Before joining the Plain Dealer in 2006, he worked \nfor Copley Los Angeles Newspaper, Tucson Newspapers in Arizona, and as \npublisher and president of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.\n  He is known not only for his professional leadership, but also for \nhis civic engagement. He has faced the challenges of the news industry \nand provided steady and confident direction during a crucial time. He \nhas a reputation for being deeply committed to the mission of a daily \nnewspaper and the important role it plays in the community and in the \ndemocratic process. As an executive and manager, he is known for \nconnecting with employees on a personal level and taking great interest \nin their professional success and family lives.\n  Beyond his work in news, Terry brought with him to Cleveland a \nlongstanding commitment to civic involvement. He quickly integrated \nhimself into the Greater Cleveland community, serving as an active \nmember of several area boards including: the Greater Cleveland \nPartnership, the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, the Musical Arts \nAssociation, and the Cleveland Museum of Art. He is a member of the \nUnited Way of Greater Cleveland Board and served as the organization's \nboard chairman from 2010 to 2012.\n  Terry and his wife of more than 24 years, Renuka, have three children \nand live in Bay Village, OH. I would like to congratulate Terry on his \nmany contributions to the news industry and to the Plain Dealer and \nwish him and his family all the best for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6533-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING TAIWAN'S NATIONAL DAY\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize \nTaiwan as their National Day of Celebration, October 10, 2012, \napproaches.

Mr. President, I rise today in tribute to \na young woman from Marblehead, MA, who made us so proud during the 30th \nOlympiad. Like all our Olympians and Paralympians, judoka Kayla \nHarrison practiced for years, put in thousands of hours in training, \nsacrificed mightily and defeated countless competitors just to make \nTeam USA.\n  At 6 years of age, Kayla's mother, herself a black belt, introduced \nKayla to judo. Kayla excelled at the sport and by the time she was in \nher teens, was a two-time national champion. Yet, while this talented \nand dedicated athlete, still just a girl, was taking the judo world by \nstorm, she was doing so while suffering in silence from the pain of \nsexual abuse.\n  If Kayla had never fought again or if she simply faded away, people \nwould have understood. But with Wakefield coach Jimmy Pedro at her \nside, Kayla used martial arts to transcend the trauma, anger, and pain. \nJudo wasn't a way out, it was a way through. She went on to fight \nharder, and better, than ever. Watching Kayla compete, you get the \nsense that she is fighting at a whole different level. Kayla doesn't \njust defeat her opponents; she leaves them wondering why on Earth they \never fought her in the first place. Kayla would go on to win countless \nAmerican and international competitions, all of which led to the 2012 \nLondon Olympic games.\n  In London, Kayla and countless others inspired our Nation. For the \nmillions who themselves have suffered abuse, Kayla's gold medal was far \nmore than a point of national pride, it was the most powerful reminder \nthat there is hope. She reminded us that we can rise above any obstacle \nand that we don't have to be ruled, defined, or limited by the evil \ndone to us. In the pursuit of a gold medal, Kayla taught us that we can \nbe free.\n  Days before her first Olympic match, Kayla recorded a video in which \nshe described each step she would take, from waking and eating \nbreakfast on the morning of her first Olympic match, to her victory \nover her final competitor, and even predicting her tears of joy upon \nhearing our national anthem at her gold medal ceremony. Her commitment \nto her vision and her determination to see it through are a lesson in \ntrue perseverance.\n  We cannot understate the odds that Kayla faced in her chosen sport; \nno American man or woman had ever won an Olympic gold medal in Judo. \nYet there is the enduring image of Kayla in London, overcome with \nemotion, standing at the highest point on the podium, hearing the notes \nof the ``Star Spangled Banner.'' Kayla Harrison's immense courage, raw \ntalent, and pursuit of an audacious dream inspire us all.\n  In closing I congratulate all our Olympians and Paraympians. In a \ntime of uncertainty where there is so much focus on what separates and \ndivides us, for a few weeks in late summer Kayla Harrison and her \nfellow athletes helped us come together as a nation and showed the \nworld the best of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6533-4", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6533-S6534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO 2012 UNITED STATES OLYMPIAN ALY RAISMAN\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, heading into the summer \ngames, much of the focus was on the superstar athletes considered our \nbest hope to bring home the gold. Certainly this was the case with \nMichael Phelps, LeBron James, and Sanya Richards-Ross, who seemed \ndestined to secure gold medals for their teams. Yet, as is often the \ncase, the Olympics produced upsets and triumphs and story lines that no \none could predict. This is such a story.\n  Alexandra Raisman from Needham, MA, was the obvious choice for \ncaptain of the U.S. women's gymnastics team in the 30th Olympiad. She \nwas coached by the best, the award-winning Mihai Brestyan, who, along \nwith his wife Silvia, owns Brestyan's American Gymnastics Club in \nBurlington, MA, one of our country's top training facilities for \ngymnasts at all levels. Mihai also coached 2008 Olympic silver medalist \nand Winchester, MA native Alicia Sacramone.\n  Aly was calm under pressure, a solid performer, and could be counted \non to consistently do exceptionally well. There seemed to be a peace \nabout the\n\n[[Page S6534]]\n\nAmerican gymnastics captain; watching her was a remarkable lesson in \nfocus. ``Reliable Raisman,'' as she was called, would be USA \nGymnastics' foundation and, with the help of her teammates, would \ncompete for individual gold medals and an elusive team gold against the \nworld's best.\n  The day before the all-around team competition, Aly's teammate, the \nNo. 1 gymnast on Earth in the individual all-around, fell. A team gold \nnow hanging in the balance, her teammates covered their mouths and \nfought back tears as their coaches nervously paced. In a hushed arena, \nthe cameras and the eyes of tens of millions of TV viewers turned to \nReliable Raisman, who would now have to turn in the performance of a \nlifetime to secure gold for the American women.\n  Aly had in several previous competitions selected a modern rendition \nof ``Hava Nagila,'' the popular Jewish folk song of celebration, as the \nmusic for her anything-but-routine floor exercises. Meaning ``let's \nrejoice'' in Hebrew, the song seemed a natural choice for this young \nwoman, whose Jewish heritage is a central part of her life and family. \nAfter steady performances in the vault, beam, and uneven bars, the \nopening notes of ``Hava Nagila'' rang through the arena for her floor \nexercise. Before her routine, a TV commentator remarked that for Aly to \nsecure the gold would require an ``unreal'' performance and a tumbling \nrun that many thought ``was not possible.'' Raisman exceeded \nexpectations as she executed her tumbles and stuck her landing with a \nbrilliant smile. This near-perfect floor routine solidified the first \ngymnastics all-around gold for American women since 1996.\n  A gold medal was also on the line as Aly again drew the world's \nattention to a 12-by-12 meter mat in London for the games' final \ngymnastic event. Raisman's floor routine came on the heels of a bronze \nmedal in the individual balance beam competition providing her with a \nboost of confidence. A slow motion replay of her final tumbling run \nshowed her tears of joy beginning before she stuck her final landing as \nshe knew she would be the first American woman to win gold in the floor \nexercise.\n  In closing, Aly Raisman did more than win our Nation's first ever \nOlympic gold medal in the women's floor exercise, did more than deliver \nthe first women' gymnastics team gold for American women in 16 years; \nRaisman is an inspiration for the youth of Massachusetts that with hard \nwork and dedication to your craft, anything can be achieved.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate Aly on her historic gold medal and wish \nher all the best in the years ahead. And to all our Olympians and \nParalympians, thank you for so ably representing our Nation in the 30th \nOlympiad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6534-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING ALASKANS OLYMPIANS\n\n  Mr. BEGICH.

Mr. President, this week I submitted two resolutions: \nThe first recognizes September 15 through October 15 as Hispanic \nHeritage Month; the second designates the week of September 16 as \n``National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week'' and honors the\n\n[[Page S6535]]\n\ncritical work of Hispanic-serving Institutions across the United \nStates.\n  These resolutions celebrate the immense contributions of Hispanic \nAmericans to our great Nation and pay tribute to over 300 nonprofit \nHispanic-serving Institutions for their important role in educating and \nempowering Hispanic youth.\n  Latinos have a long and decorated history in the United States, full \nof extraordinary contributions to America's past, present, and future. \nLatinos have proudly served, helped build, and defended our country and \nhave done so for hundreds of years, honorably serving in every action \nsince before the founding of the Nation.\n  Hispanics fought alongside patriots in the American Revolution and \nrallied in the Civil War, serving bravely in both the Union and \nConfederate armies. Latinos rode in Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders \nduring the Spanish-American War, received Congressional Medals of Honor \nin both world wars, and made the ultimate sacrifice for our country in \nKorea and Vietnam. As of July 2012, over 143,000 Hispanic Americans \nwere actively serving with distinction in the U.S. Armed Forces, \nincluding 19,752 Hispanics serving in Afghanistan.\n  Just as Hispanics have defended our Nation, we have also helped shape \nand build it. That is why I also want to honor the exemplary \ninstitutions that are making vital investments in the next generation \nof Latino leaders.\n  Hispanic-serving Institutions are colleges or universities where \ntotal Hispanic enrollment constitutes a minimum of 25 percent of the \nstudent body, and they serve over half of all Hispanic students in the \nUnited States. As a product of a Hispanic-serving Institution in my \nhome State of New Jersey, my experience is a living testimony of the \nimportant role that HSIs play in providing opportunities to Hispanic \nstudents in States such as Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, \nFlorida, Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New \nYork, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington, and the Commonwealth of Puerto \nRico.\n  With these resolutions, we celebrate the contributions of all Latinos \nand the institutions that serve the Hispanic community in the United \nStates. This month, let us celebrate not only Hispanic Heritage, but \nHispanic-serving Institutions as well.\n  I am pleased with the overwhelming support these important \nresolutions have from my colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, \nparticularly Leader Reid and Senator Cornyn. This outpouring of \nbipartisan support is a strong indication of how far our community has \ncome and how important our contributions are to this country. I look \nforward to celebrating the heritage and culture of Latinos and our \nvaluable contributions to this Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6535-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CORTNEY JORDAN\n\n  Mr. HELLER.

She brought home four medals for Team USA; three silver (50m \nfreestyle, 100m freestyle, 400m freestyle) and one bronze (100m \nbackstroke).\n  Cortney had her first taste of Paralympic medal glory at the 2008 \nParalympic Games in Beijing, where she was awarded four medals; one \ngold--50m free, two silver--400m freestyle, 100m freestyle, and one \nbronze--200m IM.\n  This 21-year-old Paralympic medalist is not only a remarkable \nathlete, but a talented student and an aspiring elementary school \nteacher. Recognized for her commitment to school and community \ninvolvement, Cortney is a Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association \nTop Ten Scholar Athlete and an Academic All-American. Serving as a role \nmodel for all Nevadans, I wish Cortney continued success on her future \nendeavors.\n  On behalf of the residents of the Silver State, I am proud to \nrecognize Cortney's accomplishments.

Mr. President, I rise today, September 20, to \ncelebrate the 60th anniversary of the Denver, CO chapter of The Links, \nIncorporated, and to honor dedicated women actively working to build a \nstronger community in the greater Denver area. As the father of three \ndaughters, these women exemplify role models and are leaders in our \ncommunity in the areas of business, civic duties, mentorship, activism, \nand volunteer work.\n  Founded in 1946, The Links is one of the oldest and largest volunteer \nservice organizations committed to enriching, sustaining, and ensuring \nthe culture and economic survival of people of African descent. Their \nmembership consists of over 12,000 professional women of color in 276 \nchapters located in 42 States, the District of Columbia, and the \nCommonwealth of the Bahamas.\n  The Links focus on our five major facets: national trends and \nservices, the arts, services to youth, international trends and \nservices, and health and human services. The combined 276 chapters \ncontribute more than 500,000 documented hours of community service.\n  For over 50 years, the Denver chapter has sponsored numerous projects \nincluding support to Stovall Care Center nursing home; Cleo Parker \nRobinson Dance; the George Washington Carver Day Care Center; the East \nHigh School Community Forum; and the Marcus Garvey Center at the \nUniversity of Northern Colorado. Internationally, this chapter has also \nhelped to increase access to basic necessities such as water by \nbuilding water wells in African countries.\n  This chapter has honored and awarded scholarships to high school and \ncollege students. Our current mayor, the Honorable Michael B. Hancock, \nreceived one of these scholarships to help him attend Hastings College \nin Nebraska.\n  Since 2009, the Denver chapter has made a tradition of targeting \nprograms that aim to close the achievement gap of middle school \nstudents at Hallett Fundamental Elementary School in Denver. In \nresponse to the academic needs of youth at Hallett, they have tutored, \nmentored, donated computers, and coordinated cultural, career, health, \nand violence prevention programs.\n  As the former superintendent of Denver Public Schools and a person \ndevoted to enhancing volunteerism and commitment to community service \namong Americans of all ages, I am proud to honor the Denver chapter of \nThe Links, Incorporated.\n  Mr. President, our Nation is profoundly affected by the service of \nvolunteers. Generations of individuals from different backgrounds have \nserved each other and have focused on making our communities a better \nplace for all. Please join me in celebrating the 60th anniversary of \nDenver's chapter of The Links, Incorporated, and their commitment to \npurposeful service and transformational programs to enrich the quality \nof life for local, national, and global communities everywhere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6535-3", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6535-S6536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING KENYON MARC YOUNGSTROM\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

He was 37 years old.\n  Kenyon Youngstrom was born in Pasadena, CA and raised in Riverside. \nHe served as a U.S. Army Reservist from 1994 to 2000, attaining the \nrank of Specialist. He graduated from the California Highway Patrol \nAcademy in February 2006 and served at both CHP Headquarters and CHP's \nContra Costa Area Office.\n  Officer Youngstrom served his community with a heroism that extended \nbeyond his own life.

Mr. President, I am on the Senate floor today to \nhonor Alvin Rohrs for his 30 years of leadership and dedication to \nSIFE, Students in Free Enterprise. SIFE brings together today's \nbusiness leaders and thinkers with enterprising college students on \nevery continent who develop small businesses to solve local problems \nand create wealth and hope where there was little of either. SIFE is a \nhands-on business leadership opportunity, and Rohrs directs this unique \nbusiness gospel toward those who want to live a financially, \npersonally, and environmentally sustainable life.\n  While Rohrs has carried the title of president and CEO of SIFE, he \nhas also been known as the enabler, chief cheerleader, and director of \nSIFE over these many years. Alvin Rohrs is an educator, motivator, \nguidance counselor, spiritual leader and the wizard behind the curtain \nat SIFE, working with other captains of business and industry to bring \nnew opportunities to campuses around the globe. The list of American \nand international corporate titans that have brought their energy, \ninsight and resources to SIFE is extraordinary. Even the United States \nState Department recognizes the value of SIFE in developing ``more \neffective, socially responsible business leaders.''\n  SIFE has been a key sponsor of sustainable business practices on \nevery continent for three decades. SIFE educates students about the \nvirtues of the risk-reward system known as free enterprise. SIFE \napplies free enterprise principles to lift people out of poverty and \ngive them new opportunities for personal enrichment and service to \ntheir neighborhoods and communities. Among many examples, SIFE teams \nhave shown poor single mothers how to start their own small businesses \nthat boost their incomes and provide for their families. Farmers and \nsmall business people are given instruction about turning their ideas \ninto companies that solve problems and provide jobs in disadvantaged \nneighborhoods. It is the free market system at its best. It is SIFE. It \nis Alvin Rohrs.\n  Rohrs heads a staff of more than 60 professionals at the headquarters \nin my hometown of Springfield, MO. Dozens of staffers help with SIFE's \nefforts to spread the positive word about business development and how \nit can influence initiatives through which scores of students develop \nprojects to lift others out of despair. More than 1,600 teams on \ncollege campuses--more than 57,000 students--are active in 39 counties, \nincluding China and Russia, demonstrating the power of local business \nto solve local problems and create wealth. SIFE is a powerful force for \nenlightenment and good works.\n  Rohrs has led SIFE's development into a megaphone for the positive \npower of business in the world community. This year he reaches a \nmilestone--30 years at the helm. He has earned many awards and \naccolades for his works in the charity community and in the business \nworld. He has an unwavering belief in the work of SIFE and the message \nit carries into energizing entrepreneurs and creating new wealth.\n  I congratulate Alvin Rohrs and SIFE on their growth, accomplishments \nand good work providing the world community with personal understanding \nof free enterprise and the rewards it offers to people in all walks of \nlife and all economic ranks. My hope is that SIFE and Alvin Rohrs \ncontinue this critical work for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6536-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING JOHN FRANCIS DIGNAM\n\n Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to an extraordinary Bay State resident and patriot, John \nFrancis Dignam, who passed away on March 18, 2012, at the age of 78.\n  John Francis Dignam's life story is truly an American story. Born in \nLawrence, MA, John attended St. Mary's Grammar School and graduated \nfrom Central Catholic High School at the age of 16, in 1950. He \nattended Tilton Prep School and Holy Cross, before enlisting in the \nArmy in 1953, where he received numerous commendations. Upon his \ndischarge from the Army, John attended Northeastern University in \nBoston, and earned a degree in physics and Applied Science in 1962. He \nreturned to Northeastern many years later, and earned a degree from the \nexecutive MBA program.\n  John is best known for his work as a civil servant at the Watertown \nArsenal from 1966-1996, where he served with and led a core team of \nnational experts focused on the development of advanced materials and \nstructures to meet the highly challenging requirements of United States \nground and space-based defense systems. At the time of his retirement, \nhe served as the Chief of the Ballistic Missile Defense Materials \nProgram Office; Physical Science Administrator in the Materials \nDirectorate; and Director of the Hardened Materials Program.\n  Following the closure of Watertown Arsenal in 1996, John retired from \ngovernment service and founded a small company named Mentis Sciences. \nAt Mentis Sciences, John and his team have conducted cutting-edge \nmaterials research, engineering and manufacturing support for the \nDepartment of Defense on many high priority tactical and strategic \nmissile defense programs.\n  John Francis Dignam loved our great country, and his record of \nacademic and professional achievement is both substantial and \nimpressive. But it tells only part of the story. Alongside of his \nbeloved wife of 49 years, Rita, he was a life-long resident of \nMassachusetts who was active in his community and his church. \nThroughout his decades of service to the country, John never lost sight \nof his Massachusetts roots, and he always made time to support his \ncommunity and his church. He led others through his example. And today \nhe lays at rest along the hillside at the Immaculate Conception \nCemetery in Lawrence.\n  I am proud to rise today to honor his service to the Nation, and to \nrecognize his profound contributions to Massachusetts, the greater \nLawrence community, and his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6536-3", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6536-S6537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MOIRA McCARTHY STANFORD\n\n Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, today I wish to \nrecognize Ms. Moira McCarthy Stanford, who has contributed enormously \nand tirelessly to the cause of fighting diabetes.\n  Moira's support for diabetes research stems from her personal journey \nlearning about diabetes. Her daughter, Lauren, was diagnosed with type \n1 diabetes shortly after her sixth birthday. Type 1 diabetes is a \nchronic disorder that occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough \ninsulin to properly control the body's sugar levels. We can all agree \nthat navigating through diabetes management for both parents and \nchildren is extremely difficult, and with no cure for this disease, \nMoira's advocacy for research is essential.\n  Now, you may be familiar with the ongoing clinical trials for an \nartificial pancreas, which will dramatically improve the quality of \nlife for individuals living with diabetes. This device has the \npotential to improve diabetes control by automatically providing the \namount of insulin an individual needs to maintain healthy glucose \nlevels. I am encouraged by these developments, which Moira has strongly \nsupported. Her daughter Lauren will participate in these trials, and I \nam impressed that she is following in her mother's footsteps to help \nothers living with diabetes.\n  I would also like to mention that Moira will be riding in this year's \nJuvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's Ride to Cure Diabetes. She will \nbe bicycling 105 miles through Death Valley to raise money for the \nfoundation. An avid cycler myself, I understand the dedication required \nto train for this type event. I am also impressed that she is the \nsecond highest fundraiser in the Nation for this race. Moira has worked \ntirelessly for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, JDRF. She has \nserved as president of the JDRF and was named JDRF International \nVolunteer of the Year in 2007.\n  I would like to thank Moira McCarthy Stanford for her tremendous work\n\n[[Page S6537]]\n\non behalf of the diabetes community and the JDRF. I know that her \nfamily, her daughter, Lauren, and the people of Massachusetts are \nextremely proud of her advocacy and service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6537-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6537-S6538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO ROBERT F. GILLIGAN\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, along with my colleague Senator \nCoons, I wish to recognize a valued leader and respected public servant \nas he embarks upon his retirement following a long and distinguished \ncareer: the Honorable Robert P. Gilligan, speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives of Delaware.\n  As the longest serving house member in Delaware's history, Bob \nGilligan has devoted his career to bettering the State of Delaware. A \nnative of Wilmington, Bob went to Pennsylvania to earn his bachelor's \ndegree from St. Joseph's University and a master's degree from \nVillanova University. But, fortunately for the people of Delaware and \nspecifically those in Sherwood Park in northern Delaware, Bob soon \nreturned to the First State to begin a remarkable career in public \nservice.\n  Bob was first elected to the Delaware House of Representatives in \n1972, and he has served there with distinction for the past 40 years. \nAs representative of the 19th District, he has served as house majority \nleader from 1983-1984, house minority whip from 1985-1995, and house \nminority leader from 1995-2008. In 2008, Bob was elected by his peers \nto be the 145th general assembly speaker of the house.\n  During my time as Governor of Delaware, I had the great fortune of \nworking with Bob on a host of important issues, including education \nreform, welfare reform, and fiscal policy that led to Delaware's credit \nrating being raised to AAA for the first time in State history--a \nrating that the State still enjoys today. I have had the privilege of \nwatching Bob grow as a leader in the State house and, ultimately, as \nspeaker over the course of his 40-year tenure. During that time, what I \ncame to admire most about Bob was his ability to bring people together \nto work collaboratively. His peers on both sides of the aisle have \nnoted Bob's ability to form partnerships and ensure the house proceeds \nin a civil and orderly manner. This is a truly laudable feat made even \nmore impressive by the fact that over the past 40 years, Bob has worked \nwith 8 different Governors, 67 different State senators, 176 different \nState representatives, worked on 12 different committees, and had the \nopportunity to vote on over 15,000 House Bills.\n  Bob leaves behind a legacy of creating a more open, responsible, and \naccountable government. When he first took office as speaker in 2008, \nBob's goal was clear: He wanted to change business as usual in Dover. \nAlmost immediately, sessions began on time, committee meetings were \nscheduled at least 48 hours in advance, and agendas were made public at \nleast 24 hours prior to meeting. But the reforms didn't stop there. \nUnder Bob's new leadership, the first bill of the new general assembly \nwas his bill, House Bill 1, which made the Freedom of Information Act, \nFOIA, applicable to the general assembly, effectively opening the \nlegislature to FOIA requests. And, fittingly, as Bob closed the chapter \non his career in the house, he introduced one of his final bills, House \nBill 300, which requires stricter disclosure laws with regard to \ncampaign finance, helping to ensure that elections in Delaware races \nare conducted in a fair and transparent manner.\n  Upon his retirement, Bob described the essence of his leadership and \nreiterated his faith in Delaware's approach to good governance: ``I \nhope this place never becomes like Washington D.C. It's our state. \nYou've got to do what's right for the state. Good government and making \ngood decisions is good politics, and if you don't get elected because \nof a tough decision, you still sleep well. All the decisions I've made, \nI never lost any sleep.''\n  A man of extraordinary service, Bob is known as a hard-working and \nactive legislator. In addition to his responsibilities as speaker of \nthe house, he served on the House Administration, Ethics, House Rules, \nand Veteran Affairs Committees. Prior to his role as speaker, Bob \nserved as a member of the Joint Finance Committee and was chairman of \nthe Bond Bill Committee, the Health and Human Development Committee, \nand the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Bob's leadership and \ncommitment to serving others extends well beyond the State house. He is \na life member of the Mill Creek Fire Company; a board member of the \nBlood Bank of Delmarva; a cofounder of the Mid-County and Absalom Jones \nSenior Centers; and, a parishioner of St. John the Beloved in \nWilmington, DE. In addition to his title of ``speaker,'' Bob is also \nknown by the title of ``professor'' to many students through his role \nas an educator at Delaware Technical and Community College in Stanton.\n  Given Bob's incredible career of public service--both as an elected \nofficial and as a private citizen--I was of two minds when I heard of \nhis plans to retire. On the one hand, Delaware will sorely miss its \ndevoted public servant and leader. On the other hand, however, he will \ntake some very well-deserved time to enjoy life with his wife Jeanne, \ntheir two daughters, son-in-law, and three grandchildren, Cole, \nDelaney, and Asher. We are in Jeanne's debt for sharing her husband of \nmany years with the people of the First State.\n  I am truly honored to have worked with Bob Gilligan for many years \nand call him my friend. It is truly a privilege to pay tribute to a man \nwho has done so much for the great State of Delaware for all of these \nyears.\n Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I am honored to join my senior \nSenator, Tom Carper, as we rise today to honor the legacy of one of \nDelaware's longest serving elected officials--Speaker of the House Bob \nGilligan.\n  Speaker Gilligan has served in the Delaware House of Representatives \nfor 4 decades, elected to 20 consecutive terms by his constituents. Bob \nwas first elected in 1972 at age 29--a remarkably young age to be so \nfocused and service-minded.\n  A lot has changed in this country since 1972, but not Bob's \ncommitment to Delaware, to education, to equal rights and to making our \nState a better place to live.\n  After 40 years of service, Speaker Gilligan is retiring at the end of \nthis legislative session to spend more time with his family, including \nhis wife Jeanne, his daughters Katie and Shannon, and his son-in-law \nGavin, as well as his grandchildren, Delaney, Cole, and Asher.\n  Earlier this year, a number of us gathered at the Mill Creek Fire \nHall, where Bob is a lifetime honorary member, and celebrated 70/40--\nhis 70th birthday and his 40th year of public service. All it took was \na look at the crowd that gathered to see the real and positive impact \nSpeaker Gilligan has had on our community. He always kept his \nconstituents from his district first and foremost on his mind, even as \nhe worked on issues of broader impact to our State and even our Nation.\n  It was through Speaker Gilligan's leadership that real transparency \nand openness was brought to Delaware State government. He led the way \nfor House Bill 1--legislation in 2009 that made our State's open-\ngovernment laws apply to the General Assembly. That may sound like \nsimple fairness and good governance, but it wasn't an easy road to get \nthere. It took all of Bob's legislative acumen to get it done, and now \nall Delawareans benefit from a more accountable and open government.\n  Our State has benefitted from Bob's passion and commitment in other \nways, too. His legacy is felt in education programs and schools across \nour State, as well as at the Mid-County Senior Center, which he helped \nfound to support local seniors and provide the recreational, \neducational, and nutritional services necessary for a dignified \nretirement.\n  In these times of deep division and heated political rhetoric, Bob is \na breath of fresh air. He listens to diverse perspectives and values \nprincipled compromise. As someone who has been around long enough to \nserve as both Speaker of the House and Minority Leader for Delaware, he \nhas worked hard to find ways to bring people together.\n  Our State and our Nation could use more Bob Gilligans, and I join \nDelawareans of all political parties in thanking him for his decades of \nservice and wishing him well in his retirement.\n\n[[Page S6538]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6538-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING THE DEVEREUX FOUNDATION\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I have the honor of \nhighlighting the Devereux Foundation, a nonprofit behavioral health \norganization that supports many underserved and vulnerable communities. \nThe Devereux Foundation is based in Villanova, PA, but provides \ncritical services throughout the entire country. They are about to \ncelebrate their 100th anniversary.\n  The Devereux Foundation began as the Devereux School, which was \nestablished in 1912 by Helena Devereux. Helena Devereux was a \nPhiladelphia schoolteacher known for her success at working with \nspecial needs children. Devereux attempted an integrated, residential \ntherapy approach, where lessons were integrated into daily routines. \nThis was a radical approach for its time, but it was one based on \nHelena Devereux's firsthand experiences as a teacher. The results were \na resounding success: by 1920, 22 children out of her 30 students had \nimproved significantly.\n  By 1938, the State of Pennsylvania granted the Devereux Schools a \nnonprofit charter, and the Devereux Foundation was established. The \nfoundation expanded to the west coast in the 1940s, and in the 1950s, \nit began research and clinical training efforts. Today, the Devereux \nFoundation operates a national network of clinical, therapeutic, \neducational and employment programs that serve children, adolescents, \nand adults. Their services include, but are not limited to, residential \nand day treatment programs, foster care homes, special education day \nschools, family counseling, and prevocational training. In this role, \nthe Devereux Foundation has played a critical part in uplifting the \nneedy and assisting the vulnerable, in Pennsylvania and across the \nNation.\n  I am grateful for all of the work that Devereux and its employees \nhave done over the last century, and I am proud that Devereux, a \nnational leader in the field of behavioral health care, calls \nPennsylvania home. I have heard stories of the many individuals with \nspecial needs whom Devereux supports and nurtures. Many are children, \nand I have seen how these families struggle to find the appropriate \ncare and educational services for them. There is a line in Scripture \nthat says, ``Every child has a light.'' Devereux plays an especially \nimportant role in nurturing children who need a little more help to \nreach their full potential, a little extra to let their light shine \nout. I congratulate them on a century of hard work and wish them many \nmore years of success.\n  As we move forward with the fight to ensure that quality and \naffordable health care is accessible to all Americans, I call on us to \nrecognize and emulate the efforts of the Devereux Foundation and the \nrole they have played in bringing about positive change throughout the \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6538-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING HENRY MOORE\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I rise to honor and remember \nHenry L. Moore for his exceptional service to his community, \nCommonwealth, an country.\n  Born April 8, 1921 in Ocilla, GA, the son of Andrew and Eliza Moore, \nHenry entered the armed services on September 22, 1942. Though \noriginally from the Peach State, Henry spent his adult life living in \nPennsylvania.\n  Henry was a man of service, a man of science, and a man of faith. \nToday I wish to honor him as such.\n  As a man of service, Henry distinguished himself as one of the \nTuskegee Airmen who so faithfully served our country during one of its \ndarkest hours. Drafted in 1942, Henry graduated from the only class of \nAfrican-American airplane mechanics at Lincoln Airbase in Nebraska in \nJune 1943. After graduation he was assigned to the ground crew of the \nFifteenth Air Force 332nd Fighter group. By 1944 Henry had become a \ncrew chief working on B-25 bombers in the Mediterranean theater.\n  The Tuskegee Airmen hold a special place in American history, and \nHenry never forgot his part in it. Throughout the rest of his life, he \nremained active in the Tuskegee Airmen Inc., a nonprofit organization \ndedicated to honoring the accomplishments of African Americans in the \nU.S. Army Air Corps during WWII and introducing young people across the \nNation to the world of aviation and science through local and national \nprograms. At the time of his passing, Henry was serving his second term \nas the national parliamentarian of that organization.\n  As a man of science, Henry graduated from West Virginia State College \nwith a bachelor of science in physics and electrical engineering and \nlater with a master of science from Temple University. Following \ngraduation, Henry began a career physics and electronic engineering \nuntil retiring from government service after 26 years.\n  Henry loved science, and, following his retirement, he continued to \npass this passion on by teaching science and math, first at Roosevelt \nMiddle School and then later at Abraham Lincoln High School in the \nPhiladelphia school district.\n  As a man of faith, Henry was very active in his church. Always \ninvolved, Henry served on a number of boards and was president of both \nthe deacons and trustees. His love of music intertwined with his church \nlife as he sang in the choir and on special occasions played his \ntrumpet.\n  As Henry's family and friends mourn his loss, I pray that they will \nbe comforted by the knowledge that this great Nation will never forget \nthe service and sacrifice of Henry L. Moore. May he rest in \npeace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6538-3", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING COLONEL EUGENE SMITH\n\n Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the \nextraordinary life of Col. Eugene Smith of Wilmington, DE.\n  Gene was the eldest child of Pat and Mary Smith, and his family's \nstory is the American story. He was born in Ireland but moved to \nWilmington at age 13, where he grew up playing sports and joined the \nDelaware National Guard while he was still attending Salesianum High \nSchool. After spending some time at seminary and working at DuPont--a \ngreat Delaware tradition--Gene went on Active Duty when the National \nGuard was federalized in the early 1940s. Colonel Smith served with \nhonor in World War II and rose quickly to become a highly regarded \nmilitary investigator with the Office of Strategic Services, leading \nthe now-famous investigation into the post-war theft of over $1 million \nin jewels.\n  On Thanksgiving Day 1952, the Smiths heard the knock at the door that \nevery military family fears. Two Air Force officers brought news that a \nplane en route from Washington State to Alaska had crashed, and all 51 \nonboard were missing, including Gene.\n  The wreckage of the aircraft was spotted east of Anchorage, but by \nthe time recovery teams entered the area, it had vanished, likely \nburied by an avalanche. The crash was simply stamped ``unresolved.''\n  But America doesn't give up on our military heroes. We don't abandon \nour service men and women, no matter how long it takes. That is why I \nwas so glad to read in the News Journal that on June 10 of this year, \nthe Smith family finally got the closure they have been seeking. An \nAlaska Army National Guard team in a helicopter spotted debris on a \nglacier, and a specialized team was called in to officially identify it \nas the lost aircraft from more than 60 years ago. The remains of the \nsouls lost that day were exhumed, identified, and buried at Arlington \nNational Cemetery--the resting place for American heroes.\n  The only surviving brother of Colonel Smith, Mike Smith of \nWilmington, has carried on his family's legacy of service with honor \nand dignity, and we are proud to count him among our neighbors. I join \nall Delawareans in saluting the service and sacrifice of Col. Eugene \nSmith of Wilmington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6538-4", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6538-S6539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO ADMIRAL KIRKLAND DONALD\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, my colleague Senator Jim Risch joins \nme today in paying tribute to ADM Kirkland Donald, U.S. Navy, as he \nprepares to complete a naval career that began with his graduation from \nthe Naval Academy in 1975 and concludes with his past 8 years of \nservice as Director of the Office of Naval Reactors.\n  As Director of the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program, Admiral Donald\n\n[[Page S6539]]\n\nhas had stewardship of every aspect of the nuclear navy, from fleet \noperations and training to reactor design and ultimate disposition of \nspent nuclear fuel. The dedication required of this mission is \nextraordinary, and our Nation has benefited from Admiral Donald's \nsteadfast leadership.\n  Over the course of his career, Admiral Donald excelled as an undersea \ncommander. He served as the commanding officer of the nuclear-powered \nattack submarine USS Key West, commander of the elite Submarine \nDevelopment Squadron Twelve and Commander Submarine Force, U.S. \nAtlantic Fleet, and Allied Submarine Command, Atlantic. Other \nhighlights include tours at the Bureau of Naval Personnel, the Joint \nStaff, and as commander of all U.S. submarine forces.\n  While at Naval Reactors, he has ensured the safe operations of the \nnuclear navy. Nuclear-powered warships have safely steamed over 150 \nmillion miles and operated for more than 6,400 reactor years without an \naccident. The most recent 20 million miles and 800 reactor-years have \nbeen achieved under Admiral Donald's leadership.\n  Among his many achievements, one of the most impressive is the \nconsistent and quiet success of the Naval Reactors Facility, NRF, in \nIdaho Falls. The highly complex and scientific work done at NRF \nrequires not only a highly skilled, diligent workforce but the trust \nand confidence of the people of Idaho. As a result of Admiral Donald's \nwork, that confidence has flourished.\n  Admiral Donald has been instrumental to the future of the Navy, \nhaving overseen the highly successful construction of many Virginia-\nClass attack submarines, the final design and construction of the next-\ngeneration USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier, and the initial design \nof the Ohio-class replacement ballistic missile submarine. All three \nplatforms incorporate impressive new technologies into the nuclear \npropulsion plants that have proven to be safe and reliable for nearly \n70 years. These ships will allow the Navy to continue to protect \nAmerica and our interests around the globe and would not be possible \nwithout the steadfast leadership of Admiral Donald.\n  Admiral Donald's selfless commitment to serving our Nation has left \nus safer and better prepared to respond to threats around the world. He \nleaves a legacy of service, dedication to the Navy, and commitment to \nthe environment. With our deepest gratitude, we wish him the very best \nin retirement after an impressive and impactful career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6539-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CANONIZATION OF BL. KATERI TEKAKWITHA AND BL. MARIANNE COPE\n\n Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the \ncontribution of two great heroes, Kateri Tekakwitha and Marianne Cope. \nThese two individuals from upstate New York worked tirelessly during \ntheir lifetimes to bring faith and health to every soul they touched. \nBl. Kateri Tekakwitha and Bl. Marianne Cope have served as an \ninspiration for generations of the faithful both in America and abroad, \nand are now being recognized with the highest honor of sainthood.\n  Bl. Kateri Tekakwitha was born in 1656 to a Mohawk father and \nAlgonquin mother along the Mohawk River in upstate New York. After \nsurviving a devastating smallpox epidemic, Kateri was introduced to \nChristianity by Catholic missionaries. Despite severe disapproval by \nher tribe, Kateri was baptized into the church as Catherine and lived \nthe rest of her life caring for the sick and elderly in the Mohawk \nRiver region. She is informally known as Lily of the Mohawks and will \nbecome the patron saint of ecology, the environment, and Native \nAmericans. Although she died young, Kateri's reputation as the first \nNative American saint will live forever. Her commitment to the \nChristian faith has served as an inspiration not only to Native \nAmerican Catholics, but to all American Catholics.\n  The other beatified person, Bl. Marianne Cope, was a member of the \nSisters of St. Francis in Syracuse after growing up in Utica, NY. As \nthe eldest daughter of German immigrants, she worked in a factory to \nsupport her family and delayed answering her religious calling until \nher siblings were self-sufficient. Once she was able to commit to the \nchurch, Marianne dedicated her work to establishing a series of \nhospitals, both public and Catholic, in Syracuse and central New York. \nThese hospitals were some of the first to treat patients regardless of \nrace, religion, or nationality. Marianne was also one of the first \nhospital administrators to advocate for patients' rights and to accept \nmedical students for clinical instruction. In 1883, she moved to Hawaii \nto care for those with leprosy, a task that was declined by many other \nreligious groups. Throughout her time in Hawaii she remained a \ndedicated caretaker and symbol of hope to patients who had been exiled \nbecause of their illness.\n  These two extraordinary women will be declared saints on October 21 \nin Vatican City by Pope Benedict XVI in St. Peter's Square, marking the \nend of a long process of examination undergone by all candidates for \nsainthood. The ceremony will venerate Kateri and Marianne in the eyes \nof Catholics all over the world.\n  I would like the U.S. Senate to honor Bl. Kateri Tekakwitha and Bl. \nMarianne Cope and recognize their unparalleled commitment to faith and \ntheir unending sacrifices for the people most in need across New York \nand our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6539-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6539-S6540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SSG CHARLES ALLEN\n\n Mr. INHOFE.

He began \npracticing law in Springfield, MO, and later became the city attorney \nfor Nixa and St. Robert and the governmental relations attorney for \nBranson.\n  As Sam's practice became more successful, he never forgot his modest \nroots, or those less fortunate. In 1976, Sam was elected president of \nthe newly formed Legal Aid Association of Green County, MO, known today \nas the Legal Services of Southern Missouri, LSSM. The Legal Aid \nAssociation was created to help low income citizens whose legal needs \nwould otherwise be unmet. Under Sam's leadership, LSSM has helped \nthousands of Missourians in 43 counties.\n  On October 11, Legal Services of Southern Missouri will dedicate \ntheir new building, the ``Sam F. Hamra Center for Justice.'' It is my \nhope that this building will help LSSM provide services to Missourians \nfor many years to come.\n  In addition to his contributions to the legal community, Sam is very \nactive in many local organizations. He served on the board of the \nMissouri Sports Hall of Fame, the Springfield area Sports Hall of Fame, \nand the Springfield/Branson Transportation Study Committee. As the \nchairman of the Springfield Chamber of Commerce Building Fund, he \nraised over $300,000 for the construction of a new Chamber building.\n  Sam's dedicated service is an inspiration to all Missourians. His \nachievements and commitment to helping those in need deserves the \nhighest commemoration and I am proud to honor him today.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me in honoring and \ncongratulating Mr. Sam Hamra.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6540-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING TECHNICAL SERGEANT BRIAN BELL\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN.

He appreciated the small things in \nlife such as going to concerts with his wife, heading out on fishing or \nhiking trips and going kayaking. He took so much joy in being a \ngrandfather to his two grandchildren, James and Jocelyne.\n  Brian dedicated more than half of his life to defending our Nation, a \ndevotion matched by his loyalty to his community. People who knew Brian \nsay he was always willing to lend a helping hand when it was needed. \nHis friends and loved ones knew him as a man driven by a fierce \ndetermination to defend the freedom we hold dear as Americans. Our \ncountry is better off today because of his efforts.\n  Today and every day, Americans like Brian heed the call to defend \nthis great nation. They offer their service so we may live freely and \nsecurely. I hope that, even at this challenging time, Brian's family \ncan find comfort in knowing that we share a deep appreciation for his \nlife in the service of others.\n  Brian is survived by his loving wife Christine, daughter Natasha \nNemetz, mother Helen Sue Bickford, brother James D.

Mr. President, it is my sad duty to rise in \ntribute today to the brave service of Staff Sergeant Brandon Cullen-\nTowle. Staff Sergeant Cullen-Towle, who was known as ``CT'' to his \nfriends, died on August 25 in a motorcycle accident. He was as \ndedicated to his country as he was to his family and friends.\n  Brandon was born on April 29, 1987 in Dover, NH. He graduated from \nDover High School where he was a three-sport athlete, playing football, \nbasketball and baseball. Brandon briefly attended the University of New \nHampshire before realizing his true calling to serve our nation in the \nUnited States Air Force.\n  Brandon successfully completed his basic training at Lackland Air \nForce Base in Texas and was assigned as a Tactical Air Control Party \nMember in the 14th Air Support Operations Squadron in Pope Field, NC. \nIn this role, Brandon was responsible for calling in air strikes to \nsupport ground forces. He performed exceptionally well during his three \ntours of duty in Afghanistan; he took his responsibility seriously and \nit showed. In fact, Brandon's skill earned him a spot with the Special \nOperations Forces Tactical Air Control Party in the 21st Special \nTactics Squadron.\n  Brandon received many awards for his service, including the Order of \nthe Purple Heart, three Army Commendation Medals, the Air Force \nCommendation Medal and an Army Achievement Medal. Most impressively of \nall, President Obama and Chief of Staff of the Air Force General Norton \nSchwartz personally recognized Brandon for his courageous service \nduring a mortar attack in Afghanistan. After being injured himself in \nthe fight, Brandon saved an interpreter's life and called in an \nairstrike that successfully secured the base and neutralized the \nthreat. He demonstrated great courage and tremendous poise under \nincredible pressure.\n  Brandon is remembered by family and friends as a giving person with \nan infectious laugh and a contagious smile. Always willing to lend a \nhand to those in need, Brandon consistently put others before himself. \nHe valued his relationships and had an impact on everyone with whom he \ncame in contact; people simply gravitated toward him.\n  Our Nation can never adequately thank. this young New Hampshire son \nfor his willingness to serve his country and to protect our freedom, \nand also never fully thank his family enough for their sacrifice. I \nhope that Brandon's family knows that all Americans share a deep \nappreciation and abiding respect for his brave service.\n  Brandon is survived by his mother Laura Towle and her husband Dennis; \nhis father Brad Cullen; his stepfather, Mike Towle; two sisters, \nStephanie and Kaylee Towle; brother Kameron Towle; his significant \nother Marlena Cullen-Towle; grandparents Norma and James Hughes, Fern \nCullen, Rick and Kay Towle; and many aunts, uncles, cousins and \nfriends. This young hero will be missed by all.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Americans to please join me in honoring \nStaff Sergeant Brandon Cullen-Towle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6540-4", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6540-S6541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING SPECIALIST JARED DAVISON\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life \nand service of U.S. Army SPC Jared Davison. Specialist Davison, who \ndied unexpectedly on September 4, was a dedicated servicemember, son, \nbrother, and friend.\n  Jared was born on February 20, 1988 in Boston, MA. He graduated from \nMilford High School in 2006 and went on to attend Norwich Academy in \nVermont and then the prestigious U.S. Military Academy at West Point, \nNY. Jared served as a watercraft engineer with the 558th Transportation \nCompany, Special Troops Battalion, 7th Sustainment Brigade at Fort \nEustis in Virginia. Before his death, Jared was working toward a \npromotion to sergeant.\n  Jared first realized his passion to serve in the military on a family \ntrip\n\n[[Page S6541]]\n\nto Sequoia National Park in California. He was inspired by CPT Charles \nYoung, one of the park's first superintendents who was also one of the \nfirst black graduates of West Point. Following that trip, Jared was \ndetermined to join the military. He read every military book he could \nget his hands on and even designed his own exercise regimen to prepare \nfor the physical challenge of service.\n  Jared's enthusiasm to serve his country was matched only by his \nenthusiasm to live life to its fullest. Jared was a youth leader in his \nchurch and worked as a counselor at a summer camp in Maine. He was a \nstrong role model for the children he mentored, and those who knew him \nremember his infectious smile and the kindness and respect he showed to \neveryone he met.\n  Although Jared was naturally an exceptional student and athlete, he \nunderstood the value of hard work. His combination of natural talent \nand diligence earned him many commendations and decorations, including \nthe Army Achievement Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the \nGlobal War on Terrorism Service Medal, and the Army Service Ribbon.\n  Our Nation can never adequately thank this young son of New Hampshire \nfor his willingness to heed the call to defend the American people and \nour way of life. I hope that, even in these dark days, Jared's family \ncan find comfort knowing that his was a life well lived. He is gone, \nbut his service to this country will not be forgotten.\n  Jared is survived by his mother and father, Paula and James Davison, \nand his brother, Jeremy Davison. He will be missed.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Americans to join me in honoring the life \nand service of this brave American servicemember, U.S. Army SPC Jared \nDavison.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6541-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING ROBERT H. HARRIS\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to \nRobert H. Harris, who passed away in his home on Thursday, August 2, \n2012, at the age of 82. Bob was a highly respected attorney for whom I \nhad the deepest respect. I am grateful that I was able to call Bob a \nfriend and mourn his passing.\n  Born on June 9, 1930, in Columbus, GA, Bob spent the majority of his \nchildhood in Goodwater, AL. He graduated from Auburn University in 1951 \nand from the University of Alabama Law School where he was an \noutstanding student. Bob was first in his class and was a member of the \nLaw Review, Farrah Order of Jurisprudence, and the Order of the Coif.\n  Bob went on to graduate from the University of Virginia Judge \nAdvocate General School in 1955. He began practicing law when he was \ndischarged as a captain after serving for 3 years in the U.S. Army from \n1954 to 1957. He made significant contributions to the Decatur, AL, \nlegal community and was admired for his diligence in his profession.\n  I had the great privilege of serving with him in the Alabama Senate. \nNot only was he a well-respected and talented attorney, but he was an \nexcellent legislator as well. Bob served two terms in the State senate \nand was named Outstanding Freshman Senator, Hardest Working Senator, \nand Most Outstanding Senator. He was appointed as the chairman of the \ncommittee that revised the Code of Alabama in 1975 for the first time \nsince 1940.\n  Beyond his contributions to the legal community, he was an active \nmember of the First United Methodist Church where he taught the men's \nBible class. He was also extremely dedicated to academia and served as \na member of the Auburn University Board of Trustees for a decade. \nAdditionally, he served as the Founding Director of the First American \nBank.\n  Bob was an inspiration to me, a caring father and husband, and a \nvaluable asset to his community, his church, and to Auburn University. \nMy thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends, especially his \nwife Betty Sue Harris and his children, Laurie, Amanda, Bobbie, Robert, \nand Parks, as they mourn the loss of this admirable man.\n  I am honored to have called Bob a friend and colleague for more than \n40 years. His contributions to the Decatur legal community, his church, \nand the State of Alabama will forever be remembered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6541-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BILL SHUEY\n\n Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Bill \nShuey, Director of the International Institute of Rhode Island. Bill is \nretiring after nearly three decades of service to the Rhode Island \ncommunity.\n  I have witnessed Bill Shuey's effective and innovative leadership \nsince my days as a member of the International Institute's Board of \nDirectors in the 1980s. The Institute's mission is to provide the \neducational, legal, and social tools immigrants and refugees need to \ngain self-sufficiency and contribute to their communities--the very \nbuilding blocks of the American dream. Since taking the helm of the \nInstitute in 1984, Bill has overseen the growth of the Institute's \nbudget and highly skilled staff, as well as its relocation to a new \nhome on Elmwood Avenue in Providence. Bill and his staff have served \nimmigrants and refugees who have come to Rhode Island and southeastern \nNew England from the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Guatemala, Eritrea, \nEthiopia, Liberia, Cambodia, Burma, Laos, Bhutan, Iraq, Lebanon, \nArmenia, and many other countries.\n  Bill's father was a school principal who started an American school \nin Addis Ababa in 1966. In 2000, Bill made him proud when the \nInternational Institute founded a K-5 multilingual charter school in \nPawtucket. About 300 students now attend the school, which immerses \nstudents in Spanish, Portuguese, and English.\n  Thanks to Bill's vision, the International Institute has plans to \nexpand its services further through a merger with Dorcas Place, an \nadult education organization that focuses on literacy and language \nskills as well as job training and preparation.\n  I should mention that Bill's dedication to making a difference in the \nlives of others carries over into his private life. In addition to \nbeing a proud father, step-father, and grandfather, Bill is the foster \nparent of the son of Cambodian immigrants, who is now a student in law \nschool.\n  Through building effective partnerships between non-profits, \ngovernment, and the private sector, Bill has helped knit the fabric of \nour community in Rhode Island to connect thousands of individuals with \nthe skills they need to become productive members of Rhode Island's \nworkforce and society. Rhode Island has a long tradition of being \nenriched, culturally and economically, by immigrants who came to our \nshores with the American dream in their hearts. Bill has helped so many \nof them get a welcome start. I wish him heartfelt congratulations and \ngratitude for his years of service to the people of Rhode \nIsland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6541-3", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6541-4", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6541-5", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6541-S6542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:48 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 733.

A bill to improve quality and accountability for educator \npreparation programs; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we know that public education lays the \nfoundation for economic growth and the ongoing vitality of our \ndemocracy.\n  We also know that there is more work to be done to improve our \nschools. To achieve this goal, we need to focus on the professionals \nwho have the greatest impact on student learning at school--teachers \nand principals.\n  Last year, I introduced the Effective Teaching and Leading Act to \nsupport teachers, librarians, and principals currently on the job \nthrough a comprehensive system of induction, professional development, \nand evaluation.\n  Today, I am pleased to be introducing the Educator Preparation Reform \nAct with Representative Honda to improve how we prepare teachers, \nprincipals, and other educators so that they can be effective right \nfrom the start.\n  Our legislation builds on the success of the Teacher Quality \nPartnership Program, which I helped author. We have added a specific \nfocus on principals with the addition of a residency program for new \nprincipals.\n  Improving instruction is a team effort, with principals at the helm. \nThis bill better connects teacher preparation with principal \npreparation. The Educator Preparation Reform Act will also allow \npartnerships to develop preparation programs for other areas of \ninstructional need, such as for school librarians, counselors, or other \nacademic support professionals.\n  The bill revamps the accountability and reporting requirements for \nteacher preparation programs to provide greater transparency on key \nquality measures such as admissions standards, requirements for \nclinical practice, placement of graduates, retention in the field of \nteaching, and teacher performance, including student learning outcomes.\n  All programs, whether traditional or alternative routes to \ncertification, will report on the same measures.\n  Under this legislation, states will be required to identify at-risk \nand low performing programs and provide them with technical assistance \nand a timeline for improvement. Programs that are at-risk or low \nperforming will be restricted in their ability to offer TEACH grants. \nStates would be encouraged to close programs that do not improve.\n  The Educator Preparation Reform Act refocuses the state set-aside for \nhigher education in Title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct on activities to support the development and implementation of \nperformance assessments to measure new teachers' readiness for the \nclassroom and for technical assistance for struggling teacher \npreparation programs.\n  We have been fortunate to work with many stakeholders in developing \nthe key provisions of this legislation. Organizations that have \nendorsed the Educator Preparation Reform Act include: the Alliance for \nExcellent Education, American Association of Colleges for Teacher \nEducation, American Association of State Colleges and Universities, \nAmerican Council on Education, American Psychological Association, \nAssociation of American Universities, Association of Jesuit Colleges \nand Universities, Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, \nCouncil for Christian Colleges and Universities, First Focus Campaign \nfor Children, Higher Education Consortium for Special Education, \nHispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, National Association \nof Elementary School Principals, National Association of Independent \nColleges and Universities, National Association of Secondary School \nPrincipals, National Association of State Directors of Special \nEducation,\n\n[[Page S6549]]\n\nNational Council of Teachers of Mathematics, National Science Teachers \nAssociation, National School Boards Association Opportunity to Learn \nAction Fund, Public Education Network, Rural School and Community \nTrust, Silicon Valley Education Foundation, Teacher Education Division \nof the Council for Exceptional Children, American Association of \nColleges of Teacher Education, The Higher Education Task Force, \nNational Association of Elementary School Principals, and National \nAssociation of Secondary School Principals.\n  I look forward to working with these organizations, my colleagues, \nand others as I seek to include this legislation during the effort next \nCongress to reauthorize both the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nand the Higher Education Act. I encourage my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this legislation.\n      By Mrs. HAGAN (for herself, Mr. Kerry, and Mrs. Gillibrand):\n  S. 3583. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment to establish and carry out a community revitalization \nprogram to provide Federal grants to communities for the rehabilitation \nof critically needed parks, recreational areas, and facilities, the \ndevelopment of improved recreational programs, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to highlight the impact that \nlocal parks, greenways, and recreational opportunities have in \nneighborhoods and communities across the country.\n  Many Americans are dealing with the effects of a stagnant economy, \nthe rising cost of health care, and threats to the overall quality of \nlife in their communities. Research shows that investment in parks and \nrecreation creates jobs, attracts business, increases property values, \npositively impacts public health, promotes conservation in a non-\nregulatory fashion, and contributes to a higher quality of life for \nhard-working Americans and their families. Additionally, recreation for \ndisabled veterans has proven to be a powerful tool in the \nrehabilitation process, providing a number of significant therapeutic \nbenefits for those who have served our country. Yet, many of our most \npopulated areas are suffering from limited green space, deteriorating \ncommunity facilities, and a lack of access to safe, quality recreation \nopportunities.\n  I have seen first-hand the tremendous impact that parks, greenways, \nand recreation opportunities have had in my hometown of Greensboro, a \nthree time winner of the National Recreation and Park Association's \nGold Medal Award. North Carolina's beautiful capital city, Raleigh, \nwhich is often referred to as ``a city within a park'', has been \nrecognized over the last several years by publications such as Forbes, \nBusiness Week, and the Wall Street Journal as the best city for \nbusiness, best city for jobs, and the nation's best place to live. All \nof these accolades are due in large part to the high quality of the \nparks and recreational facilities present throughout the community and \nwere often noted when describing the criteria for making these ``best \nof'' selections.\n  For all of these reasons, today I am introducing the Community Parks \nRevitalization Act with Senator Kerry and Senator Gillibrand. The bill \nwill authorize the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to \nprovide grants and technical assistance to rehabilitate community parks \nand recreational infrastructure. This legislation would also help \ncommunities provide improved opportunities for returning veterans, \nmilitary families, and at-risk youth. Specifically, the Community Parks \nfor Revitalization Act would provide matching grants to support \nlocalities by creating jobs and leveraging private investment by \nsupporting capital projects that rehabilitate, and construct new, parks \nand recreation areas and facilities.\n  The act will combat childhood obesity by connecting youth with the \noutdoors and improving overall public health by increasing access to \nrecreational areas and facilities; by providing innovative, cost-\neffective, and non-regulatory solutions to environmental challenges; \nand by addressing the recreation needs of disabled veterans, military \nfamilies, as well as disadvantaged youth.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to please join me in supporting this \ntimely legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3583\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Community Parks \n     Revitalization Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) According to the 2010 United States Census, over 80 \n     percent of the population of the United States lives in urban \n     areas.\n       (2) Urban parks are a critical part of our Nation's urban \n     infrastructure, playing a vital role in revitalizing \n     neighborhoods, stimulating our Nation's economy, combating \n     national issues such as obesity and juvenile delinquency, and \n     protecting our environment.\n       (3) Urban parks are a catalyst for active outdoor \n     recreation, an industry which in 2010 supported 6,100,000 \n     American jobs, generated $646,000,000,000 in retail sales and \n     services across the United States, generated $39,900,000,000 \n     in Federal tax revenues, and $39,900,000,000 in State and \n     local tax revenues.\n       (4) Studies also show that approximately 20 jobs are \n     created for every $1,000,000 invested in parks and \n     conservation projects.\n       (5) Studies have found that parkland saves cities millions \n     of dollars in storm water management and air pollution \n     expenses by capturing precipitation, reducing runoff, and \n     absorbing air pollutants.\n       (6) Between 2001 and 2012, as funding for local parks and \n     recreation significantly declined, the number of adults \n     classified as overweight or obese steadily increased from 61 \n     percent to 67 percent. Similarly, during this same period, \n     the number of children and adolescents classified as \n     overweight or obese nearly tripled, going from 12 percent in \n     2001 to 33 percent in 2011.\n       (7) Physical inactivity contributes to obesity and takes a \n     toll on our Nation's economy, as the annual costs of medical \n     spending and lost productivity from individuals in the United \n     States being obese and overweight are estimated to be \n     $147,000,000,000. Access to urban parks is critical to \n     combating this issue. A study by the Centers for Disease \n     Control found that the creation of, or enhanced access to, \n     places for physical activity, such as parks, led to a 25.6 \n     percent increase in the percentage of people exercising on 3 \n     or more days a week which improves the physical and mental \n     health of our citizens.\n       (8) Access to urban parks is critical to combating obesity \n     and its residual impact on health care expenses. A study by \n     the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the \n     creation of, or enhanced access to, places for physical \n     activity, such as parks, led to a 25.6 percent increase in \n     the percentage of people exercising on 3 or more days a week, \n     which improves the physical and mental health of our \n     citizens.\n       (9) According to the Centers for Disease control and \n     Prevention, over the 25 years preceding the date of enactment \n     of this Act, rates of obesity have more than tripled among \n     adolescents ages 12 to 19 and doubled among adults ages 20 to \n     74 and children ages 6 to 11.\n       (10) Physical inactivity contributes to obesity. A study by \n     the CDC found that the creation of, or enhanced access to, \n     places for physical activity led to a 25.6 percent increase \n     in the percentage of people exercising on 3 or more days a \n     week. Physical activity can improve physical and mental \n     health. The annual costs of medical spending and lost \n     productivity from individuals in the United States being \n     obese and overweight are estimated to be $147,000,000,000.\n       (11) Urban parks also decrease juvenile delinquency by \n     providing quality after school programs. According to the \n     Juvenile Justice Bulletin, without structured, supervised \n     activities in the after school hours, youth are at greater \n     risk of being victims of crime or participating in anti-\n     social behaviors, especially during the hours of 2:00 pm to \n     6:00 pm.\n       (12) The National Youth Violence Prevention Resource Center \n     reported that students who spend no time in extracurricular \n     activities, such as those offered in after-school programs \n     through parks and recreation agencies, are 49 percent more \n     likely to have used drugs and 37 percent more likely to \n     become teen parents than are those students who spend 1 to 4 \n     hours per week in extracurricular activities.\n       (13) According to the Juvenile Justice Bulletin, without \n     structured, supervised activities in the after-school hours, \n     youth are at greater risk of being victims of crime or \n     participating in anti-social behaviors. Juveniles are at the \n     highest risk of being a victim of crime between 2:00 p.m. and \n     6:00 p.m., and the peak hour for juvenile crime is between \n     3:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m., the first hour after most students \n     are dismissed from school.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to include the Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands in \nthe California Coastal National Monument as a part of the National \nLandscape Conservation System, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the California \nCoastal National Monument Expansion Act. Congressman Mike Thompson \nrecently introduced companion legislation to this bill in the House of \nRepresentatives, and I thank him for all of the work he has done on \nadvancing this initiative. I would also like to thank Senator Dianne \nFeinstein for joining me as an original co-sponsor of this legislation.\n  The California Coastal National Monument, created by President \nClinton in 2000, stretches over 1,100 miles off California's coast and \nprotects more than 20,000 small islands, rocks, exposed reefs, and \nislands between Mexico and Oregon. My bill would incorporate 1,225 \nacres of the Stornetta Public Lands and other public lands near the \ncity of Point Arena in Mendocino County into the existing National \nMonument, creating the Monument's first onshore additions. By expanding \nthe National Monument to include the ``Point Arena-Stornetta Public \nLands,'' my bill not only preserves the area for future generations, \nbut also helps create a more cohesive bridge between the offshore \nresources and onshore public lands. Visitors will have contiguous \npublic access to the current National Monument, the proposed expansion\n\n[[Page S6553]]\n\narea, the adjacent Manchester Beach State Park, and the historic Point \nArena Lighthouse.\n  It is crucial that steps be taken to ensure the permanent \npreservation of this naturally diverse segment of the California Coast, \nwhich encompasses over two miles of coastline with natural bridges, \ntide pools, waterfalls, sinkholes and blowholes, and portions of the \nGarcia River and surrounding estuary. The area is not only recognized \nfor its breathtaking coastal formations, but also for outstanding \nnatural resources that include extensive wetlands, rumpled sand dunes, \nand rolling meadows. Adding these lands to the National Monument will \nprovide additional resources for more effective management and \nconservation program opportunities.\n  The ``Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands'' is also home to a diverse \necosystem. The Garcia River is crucial habitat for Coho and Chinook \nsalmon habitat, as well as a prime birding location for multiple bird \nspecies including the Laysan Albatross, Peregrine Falcon, Great Blue \nHeron, and many others. These lands are also the targets of restoration \nefforts that would help protect local endangered wildlife such as the \nPoint Arena Mountain Beaver, Behren's Silverspot Butterfly, and other \nspecies of concern, like the Black Oyster Catcher.\n  In Mendocino County, tourism is responsible for supporting almost \n5,000 jobs, with visitors bringing in $19 million annually in state and \nlocal taxes. Visitors come from all over the world to experience the \nbeauty and natural wonders of California's northern coast, and local \nbusinesses and nearby towns will benefit from the increased profile of \na National Monument designation. A National Monument designation will \nbring increased awareness to the recreational opportunities available \nin the area, including hiking, fishing, bird watching, nature \nphotography and wildlife watching. This designation could also attract \nincreased resources to support the needs of the area.\n  It is no wonder that the ``Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands'' are \noften referred to as the most significant parts of the Mendocino \ncoastline. These magnificent lands have tremendous natural and \nrecreational value, and it is imperative for them to be included as \npart of the California Coastal National Monument. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to pass this important legislation. The \n``Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands'' deserves National Monument \nrecognition, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \neffort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 3589. A bill to require the Comptroller of the Currency to \nestablish a pilot program to facilitate communication between borrowers \nand servicers; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Mortgage \nModification Outreach Act.\n  Despite some promising indicators in the housing market, many \nhomeowners continue to face the threat of foreclosure. In my home state \nof Rhode Island, 22.6 percent of mortgages are underwater and 7.65 \npercent of homeowners are either in the foreclosure process or at least \n90 days delinquent on their payment, a level which is higher than the \nnational average.\n  I have heard from many of my constituents about the difficulties they \nexperience when applying for loan modifications, and so the bill I am \nintroducing focuses on providing homeowners with a face and a place \nwhere they can get more help.\n  First, the bill establishes a pilot program that would allow \nhomeowners to receive information on how to reach their single point of \ncontact by simply visiting a consumer banking branch affiliated with \ntheir mortgage servicer. Second, at the same affiliated bank branch, \nthe homeowner can receive the address of a nearby location at which the \nhomeowner can, at no cost in some cases, copy, fax, scan, or send all \nthe paperwork that is required during the loan modification process. \nSimply put, my bill would enable a borrower to walk into the local bank \nbranch affiliated with their mortgage servicer and get some face to \nface help.\n  This pilot program is designed to bridge the gap that has arisen as \nstruggling homeowners have sought--unsuccessfully in too many \ninstances--to get easy answers to basic questions from their mortgage \nservicer as they navigate the loan modification process. Homeowners \nlooking for assistance should neither have to jump through countless \nhoops nor be given the runaround. They should be treated like \ncustomers.\n  There is no single solution that will help us gain traction in the \nhousing market. However, along with my other efforts, such as S. 489, \nthe Preserving Homes and Communities Act, S. 2162, the Project Rebuild \nAct, and my efforts to convert vacant foreclosed homes into rental \nproperties, this legislation represents another commonsense approach to \nhelping homeowners stay in their homes, reducing foreclosures, and \nhealing the housing market.\n  This bill is supported by the National Consumer Law Center and the \nNational Association of Realtors. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to pass this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 3602. A bill to repeal the nutrition entitlement programs and \nestablish a food stamp block grant program; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a new bill, the Food \nStamp Restoration Act. This is a bill that will completely revamp the \nFood Stamp program, which is something that is desperately needed. \nSince the beginning of the Obama administration, the number of \nAmericans on Food Stamps has increased by 46 percent. Over 46 million \nAmericans currently claim Food Stamp benefits, and this costs taxpayers \nover $80 billion per year. In 2008, just four years ago, the program \ncost $40 billion per year--it has more than doubled in cost under \nPresident Obama's leadership.\n  How on earth did we get here?\n  Many changes to the program that have ballooned its cost have been \nmade in recent years. President Obama, in his stimulus package, pushed \nreforms that both made it easier to qualify for the program and \nincreased the value of the program's benefits. When the stimulus bill \npassed, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the changes made \nto the Food Stamp program would increase the cost of it by to nearly \n$60 billion over 10 years.\n  Worse yet, the President has pursued economic, tax, and regulatory \npolicies that are anti-business. These policies have made the business \nenvironment uncertain, which makes it nearly impossible for firms to \ninvest in and expand their businesses. Businesses are doing well to \nsimply hold on to what they already have. This has kept both \nunemployment and food stamp enrollment higher than it should be.\n  Since the stimulus package, there have been a few efforts to tinker \nwith the structure and value of the Food Stamp program, but none of \nthem have amounted to much. The Senate-passed Farm Bill reduced the \ncost of the program by a paltry $4 billion over 10 years, which is less \nthan 1 percent of its total 10-year cost. That was one of the main \nreasons I voted against the Farm Bill.\n  But we have moved well beyond tinkering around the edges. If we do \nnot do anything to dramatically reform the food stamp program, it will \ncost Federal taxpayers nearly $800 billion over the next decade. This \nprogram needs to change.\n  That is why I am introducing the Food Stamp Restoration Act.\n  Today, the Food Stamp program is a mandatory program, meaning that \nCongress does not have to appropriate money every year for the Food \nStamp program to be funded. Rather, it is funded automatically. This \ndramatically reduces Congressional accountability over the program, \nleaving few opportunities to make adjustments and improvements to the \nprogram. This needs to change.\n  My bill tackles this problem head on. The Food Stamp Restoration Act \nconverts the program from a mandatory program into a discretionary one. \nIf my bill is enacted, Congress will have to decide each year how much \nmoney to spend on the Food Stamp program.\n  My bill also removes the power of designing and running the program \nfrom the Federal Government and gives it to the states. The new Food \nStamp program will be a block grant, which\n\n[[Page S6554]]\n\nmeans that States will be given nearly limitless flexibility to design \nand implement their food stamp programs in the way that best serves \ntheir people.\n  This makes sense to me. I have never thought that bureaucrats in \nWashington understood Oklahomans. But the people in Oklahoma City do. \nIf my bill is enacted, each State will receive an allotment from the \nFood Stamp appropriation that will be proportional to the number of \nindividuals living in the State with an income at or below the Federal \npoverty level. Benefits will be given to the people who need them most.\n  States will only have to meet a few requirements to qualify for the \nblock grant. First, their program will not be allowed to authorize \nbenefit spending on things like alcohol and tobacco. The program should \nonly allow benefit spending on real food. Second, all beneficiaries \nmust submit themselves to drug testing. Finally, States must implement \nwork requirements for the beneficiaries. This follows the general \nwelfare reform efforts that I have been championing since first coming \nto the Senate.\n  To give States flexibility during times of economic weakness, they \nwill be able to keep their allotment of funds for up to 5 years. This \nwill allow States to provide benefits to more people during times of \nhigher unemployment. After 5 years, if States have unused funds, the \nmoney will return to the Treasury for deficit reduction or debt \nrepayment.\n  All told, my bill will save over $300 billion for Federal taxpayers, \nand it make significant improvements to the current program by giving \nStates complete control over the design and implementation of the \nprograms within their States.\n  The Obama administration has dramatically increased the cost of this \nwelfare program, making millions more Americans reliant on federal \nassistance than necessary. The cost has doubled in just four short \nyears. I urge the Senate to consider my bill soon so that we can save \ntaxpayers $300 billion over 10 years while reducing the dependency of \nthe population on government programs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3602\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Food Stamp Restoration Act \n     of 2012''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Res. 572\n\n       Whereas the United States has overcome the stains of \n     historic State-sponsored voting discrimination, including \n     State laws that imposed voting qualifications such as \n     property ownership, religious qualifications, grandfather \n     clauses, poll taxes, and literacy tests and were designed to \n     exclude racial minorities, poorer voters, and certain \n     religious groups from voting;\n       Whereas courts have struck down these State laws because \n     the laws conflict with the Constitution of the United States;\n       Whereas Congress has continuously moved to expand the \n     franchise of voting;\n       Whereas the 13th, 14th, 15th, 19th, 23rd, 24th, and 26th \n     amendments to the Constitution of the United States are \n     intended to protect minorities, poorer voters, women, the \n     elderly, and youth from voting discrimination;\n       Whereas, in 1965, Congress enacted the Voting Rights Act of \n     1965 (42 U.S.C. 1973 et seq.) to remedy past discrimination \n     in voting and protect vulnerable citizens from practices that \n     infringe on the right to vote or elect a candidate of their \n     choice;\n       Whereas, in 1993, Congress enacted the National Voter \n     Registration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 1973gg et seq.) to \n     establish protections around the voting process, increase the \n     number of citizens who register to vote, and encourage \n     governments to protect the integrity of the electoral \n     process;\n       Whereas, in 2002, in response to the controversy \n     surrounding the 2000 presidential election, Congress enacted \n     the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (42 U.S.C. 15301 et seq.), \n     which provided new standards for voting systems, created the \n     independent Election Assistance Commission to assist with the \n     administration of Federal elections, and established minimum \n     standards for States and local governments that administer \n     Federal elections;\n       Whereas Congress has reauthorized the Voting Rights Act of \n     1965 5 times, most recently in 2006, recognizing the need for \n     continued enforcement against State practices in voting that \n     discriminate against or disenfranchise vulnerable citizens;\n       Whereas, since 2010, some States have enacted voting laws \n     that are reminiscent of historic State-sponsored voting \n     discrimination;\n       Whereas some States have already disenfranchised some young \n     people, elderly people, and former Members of Congress \n     through strict new voting laws;\n       Whereas some States continue to disenfranchise United \n     States citizens with past criminal convictions who live and \n     work in our communities;\n       Whereas Members of Congress and notable civil rights \n     organizations have studied recently-enacted State voting laws \n     and calculated that the laws will have a grave impact on \n     millions of minority, elderly, young, and poor individuals \n     who are eligible to vote and will seek to register to vote \n     and vote on election day;\n       Whereas, since March 12, 2012, 2 State courts in Wisconsin \n     have held that the Wisconsin voter identification law enacted \n     in 2011 violates the Wisconsin constitution, with one court \n     writing that ``a government that undermines the very \n     foundation of its existence--the people's inherent, pre-\n     constitutional right to vote--imperils its legitimacy as a \n     government by the people, for the people, and especially of \n     the people'';\n       Whereas Federal courts in both Florida and Washington, DC, \n     recently struck down new Florida state laws that restrict new \n     voter registration and early voting hours, with one court \n     writing that the new restrictions on voter registration \n     drives ``impose burdensome record-keeping and reporting \n     requirements that serve little if any purpose, thus rendering \n     them unconstitutional even to the extent they do not violate \n     the [National Voter Registration Act of 1993]'', and another \n     court holding, ``[W]e conclude that we cannot . . . preclear \n     Florida's early voting changes because the State has failed \n     to satisfy its burden of proving that those changes will not \n     have a retrogressive effect on minority voters. Specifically, \n     the State has not proven that the changes will be \n     nonretrogressive if the covered counties offer only the \n     minimum number of early voting hours that they are required \n     to offer under the new statute, which would constitute only \n     half the hours required under the prior law.'';\n       Whereas a Federal court in Washington, DC, recently struck \n     down a Texas voter identification law, writing that the law \n     ``imposes strict, unforgiving burdens on the poor'' and that \n     ``a disproportionately high percentage of African Americans \n     and Hispanics in Texas live in poverty'';\n       Whereas a Federal court in Ohio recently struck down a \n     State law that mandated that even in cases where poll workers \n     steer voters to the wrong polling place, provisional votes \n     cast in the wrong precinct must be discarded;\n       Whereas State representatives and political leaders in \n     States such as New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Florida have \n     made public admissions about how certain laws in their States \n     were designed to put a dent in the democratic process;\n       Whereas, without a response from Congress, millions of \n     voters in the United States may be subjected to State actions \n     that will harm the franchise;\n       Whereas the month of September 2012 would be an appropriate \n     month to commemorate a national focus on the importance of \n     every citizen being registered and empowered to vote;\n\n[[Page S6556]]\n\n       Whereas, during September 2012, each voting-eligible \n     citizen should register to vote, verify that the name, \n     address, and other personal information on record for the \n     citizen at the State or local board of elections is correct, \n     confirm that the citizen has everything in hand that will be \n     required to vote on election day, and confirm the correct \n     polling place for election day; and\n       Whereas States should abolish all restrictive voter \n     identification laws that disenfranchise vulnerable voting-\n     eligible citizens, comply with the National Voter \n     Registration Act of 1993, protect the voting rights of public \n     assistance and disability clients during an economic \n     downturn, and stop misguided, discriminatory, and inaccurate \n     purging programs that have the risk of purging eligible \n     voters: Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 2012 as the ``National Month of \n     Voter Registration'' to encourage each voting-eligible \n     citizen to register to vote, verify that the name, address, \n     and other personal information on record for the citizen at \n     the State or local board of elections is correct, confirm \n     that the citizen has everything in hand that will be required \n     to vote on election day, and confirm the correct polling \n     place for election day;\n       (2) calls on State and local election officials to conduct \n     public outreach and take affirmative steps to encourage voter \n     registration;\n       (3) encourages States to be fully compliant with the \n     National Voter Registration Act of 1993 and other Federal \n     voting rights laws as election day approaches; and\n       (4) requests that the President issue a proclamation for \n     the National Month of Voter Registration calling upon the \n     people of the United States to observe the month with \n     appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/20/senate-section/article/S6556-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 573--DESIGNATING THE THIRD WEEK OF JANUARY 2013, AS \n                     ``TEEN CANCER AWARENESS WEEK''\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. Toomey) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Res. 574\n\n       Whereas, on August 2, 2012, President of Iran Mahmoud \n     Ahmadinejad stated that ``anyone who loves freedom and \n     justice must strive for the annihilation of the Zionist \n     regime in order to pave the way for world justice and \n     freedom'';\n       Whereas, on August 17, 2012, President Ahmadinejad gave a \n     televised statement that ``the Zionist regime and the \n     Zionists are a cancerous tumor,'' and that ``the nations of \n     the region will soon finish off the usurper Zionists in the \n     Palestinian land,'' contending that ``with the grace of God \n     and help of the nations, in the new Middle East there will be \n     no trace of the Americans and Zionists'';\n       Whereas, on February 3, 2012, Supreme Leader Ayatollah \n     Khamenei told an audience that ``the Zionist regime is a real \n     cancerous tumor that should be cut and will be cut, God \n     Willing'';\n       Whereas, on August 17, 2012, leader Ayatollah Ahmad \n     Khatami, addressing worshippers at Tehran University, stated \n     that ``Zionists understand only the language of force'' and \n     claimed that ``the Zionist regime will meet destruction \n     through unity in the Islamic world'';\n       Whereas, in 2009 and 2011 speeches before the United \n     Nations General Assembly, President Ahmadinejad insulted \n     Israel, called into question its very existence, and denied \n     the fact that there was a Holocaust;\n       Whereas other leaders in Iran have made similar statements, \n     and the Government of Iran has displayed inflammatory symbols \n     that express similar intent;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran funds, trains, and supports \n     terrorist groups, including Hamas, Hezbollah, and Islamic \n     Jihad Movement in Palestine among many others, all of which \n     have murdered United States citizens, Israelis, and non-\n     Israeli Jews and are determined to destroy Israel, and \n     continues to support the Government of Syria in its continued \n     oppression, violence, and abuse of its people;\n       Whereas, on August 30, 2012, the International Atomic \n     Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that the Government of Iran has \n     doubled its capacity to enrich uranium to 20 percent purity \n     at Iran's Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant since May 2012;\n       Whereas the longstanding policy of the Iranian regime is \n     aimed at destroying the democratic State of Israel, a vital \n     ally and longstanding friend of the United States, which is \n     confirmed by statements such as those made by President \n     Ahmadinejad and Supreme Leader Khamenei demonstrating the \n     threat of a nuclear-armed Iran;\n       Whereas, 67 years ago, the United Nations was founded in \n     the wake of the Holocaust, the Nazi genocide carried out \n     during World War II that resulted in the slaughter of \n     6,000,000 Jews in Europe, in order to ``save succeeding \n     generations from the scourge of war'' and uphold and protect \n     the ``dignity and worth of the human person'';\n       Whereas Article 2, Section 4, of the United Nations \n     Charter, to which Iran has agreed as a Member State of the \n     United Nations, requires all Member States to ``refrain in \n     their international relations from the threat or use of force \n     against the territorial integrity or political independence \n     of any state'';\n       Whereas the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of \n     the Crime of Genocide, done at Paris December 9, 1948 \n     (commonly referred to as the ``Genocide Convention''), \n     defines genocide as, among other things, the act of killing \n     members of a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group \n     with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, the targeted \n     group;\n       Whereas Article 3 of the Genocide Convention prohibits \n     conspiracy to commit genocide, as well as ``direct and public \n     incitement to commit genocide'';\n       Whereas Article 4 of the Genocide Convention provides that \n     individuals committing any of the listed genocidal crimes \n     shall be punished ``whether they are constitutionally \n     responsible rulers, public officials or private \n     individuals'';\n       Whereas 142 Member States of the United Nations, including \n     Iran, have ratified or acceded to the Genocide Convention and \n     thereby pledged to prosecute those individuals who violate \n     its criteria for incitement to commit genocide, as well as \n     those individuals who commit genocide directly;\n       Whereas, on August 18, 2012, United Nations Secretary-\n     General Ban Ki-moon condemned the Government of Iran's \n     ``offensive and inflammatory statements'' and his office \n     reiterated that, ``in accordance with the United Nations \n     Charter, all members must refrain from the threat or use of \n     force against the territorial integrity or political \n     independence of any state''; and\n       Whereas, on November 9, 2006, an international coalition of \n     29 nongovernmental organizations urged the Government of Iran \n     to renounce President Ahmadinejad's call for Israel to be \n     wiped off the map:\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns, in the strongest possible terms, Supreme \n     Leader Ayatollah Khamenei and President of Iran Mahmoud \n     Ahmadinejad's offensive remarks, contemptible statements, and \n     reprehensible policies aimed at the destruction of the State \n     of Israel, and urges all United Nations Member States to do \n     the same;\n       (2) calls on the United Nations Security Council to take \n     more concerted actions against Iran for blatantly violating \n     the United Nations Charter, including by requesting that the \n     prosecutor of the International Criminal Court investigate \n     leaders in Iran for violating the Convention on the \n     Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, done at \n     Paris December 9, 1948 (commonly referred to as the \n     ``Genocide Convention''), and Article 2, Section 4, of the \n     United Nations Charter;\n       (3) further calls on all Member States of the United \n     Nations to fully implement existing United Nations Security \n     Council resolutions sanctioning Iran and to take additional \n     stronger unilateral diplomatic and economic\n\n[[Page S6557]]\n\n     measures to prevent the Government of Iran from obtaining \n     nuclear weapons, which would be both a dangerous violation of \n     the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done \n     at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered \n     into force March 5, 1970, and a potential means to the end of \n     carrying out President Ahmadinejad's threats against Israel;\n       (4) further calls on the United
