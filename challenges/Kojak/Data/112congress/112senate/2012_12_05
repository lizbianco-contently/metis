Madam President, across the country Americans are lamenting \nthe lack of progress in negotiations to avoid a massive tax increase on \nmiddle-class families, and I share that frustration. But for insight \ninto why negotiations have been difficult, consider yesterday's failure \nof the disabilities convention at the hands of the tea party. This \nshouldn't have been a battle, but extreme elements of the Republican \nParty picked a fight when there was nothing to fight about. Thirty-\neight Republicans voted against the convention, including several who \nwere on record supporting it, even cosponsored it. This treaty, already \nratified by 125 countries, would hold foreign nations to the same high \nstandard and treatment the United States already maintains for people \nwith disabilities.\n  It would safeguard American citizens traveling, working, and serving \nabroad, and that is hundreds of thousands of people right now. The \ntreaty has the support of veterans groups, disability groups from \naround the country, virtually all of them. It wouldn't cost the \ntaxpayers a single penny. It wouldn't require any changes to existing \nUnited States law, and the issue is as bipartisan as they come.\n  Here is what one Senator said about the treaty:\n\n       Protecting the rights of persons with disabilities, any \n     person's, is not a political issue. It is a human issue, \n     regardless of where in the world a disabled person strives to \n     live a normal, independent life where basic rights and \n     accessibilities are available. Disability rights and \n     protections have always been a bipartisan issue and ratifying \n     this treaty should be no different.\n\n  This wasn't some ultraliberal speaking, it was Senator John McCain, a \ndisabled veteran, a hero from the Vietnam conflict, who broke with \nextremists and tea partiers and voted to ratify the treaty.\n  The convention also has the strong support from a number of other \nleading Republicans, including George H.W. Bush, the first President \nBush. He, by the way, of course, was a World War II veteran and did \nheroic things during that war.\n  It also has the support of former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, \ncertainly a patriot. Senator Dole, a disabled veteran from World War \nII, who led the fight to pass the treaty, was here yesterday urging \nRepublican support.\n  Think about that. Robert Dole, who was grievously injured in World \nWar II, spent more than 2 years in a hospital, came to this Senate \nfloor, and the first speech he gave was on disabilities. We\n\n[[Page S7406]]\n\nneed to do something about it. He was here leading the fight to pass \nthe treaty, urging Republicans to support it.\n  A few Republicans greeted him as he was in his wheelchair here. They \ngreeted this 89-year-old war hero--I repeat, a patriot--who just last \nweek was in Walter Reed Hospital. Then one by one all but a handful of \nthem voted against the treaty, ensuring its failure. But their \nprofessed reasons for opposing it had no basis in fact--none.\n  Most Republicans acknowledged that. Some used an excuse, well, it is \na lameduck, we shouldn't be doing it in a lameduck. I mean, wow.\n  There is no justification for sending a message that every individual \naround the world who strives to lead a productive life in spite of a \ndisability does not deserve the same just treatment. There is no \njustification for telling disabled Americans, especially those who have \nsacrificed their bodies for our freedom, our veterans, that they don't \ndeserve the same protections abroad they do here at home. Yet that is \nthe message 38 of my Republican colleagues sent yesterday.\n\n\n                             Tax Increases\n\n  These are the same Republicans with whom Democrats are supposed to \nreach an agreement to protect middle-class families from a tax \nincrease. It is difficult to engage in rational negotiations when one \nside holds well-known facts and proven truths in such low esteem. \nHopefully, compromise is not out of reach, but as negotiations \ncontinue, I hope my Republican colleagues will keep in mind the oft-\nrepeated words of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan who said, You are \nentitled to your own opinion, but you are not entitled to your own \nfacts.\n  I know how high the stakes are. The days run short. There is still a \nquick, easy way out of this. The House must take up the Senate-passed \nmiddle-class tax cut. A few reasonable Republicans who are left agree \nwe need to give certainty to middle-class families now.\n  Yesterday Olympia Snowe, a very courageous legislator for more than \ntwo decades, who is retiring, said Congress should fight about tax \nrates for the top 2 percent after we have reassured the middle class. \nAmericans ``should not even be questioning that we will ultimately \nraise taxes on low- to middle-income people.'' That is her quote.\n  People are questioning this. If House Republican leaders allow a vote \non our legislation, it will pass; every Democrat will vote for it. It \nwill only take 26 Republican votes. It is a huge body, 435 Members. We \nonly need 26 Republicans for this to pass. I know there are 26 \nRepublicans who would vote for this. We have one conservative \nRepublican serving in the House who has said more than half would vote \nfor it. I believe there are 26 reasonable Republicans willing to put \ntheir promise to serve constituents ahead of their pledge to serve \nGrover Norquist.\n  So I say to my friend, John Boehner, in the House of Representatives, \nyou control matters on the floor. No one else does. You have the \nability, and you are the only one who has the ability, to put this on \nthe floor for a vote.\n  He should do that. That would be the American way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/05/senate-section/article/S7406-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I rise today to once again speak about \nthe fact that in July, July 25 of this year, the Senate passed a \nmiddle-class tax cut bill guaranteeing that the first $250,000 dollars \nof income any American has would be exempted from any tax increase. We \nall know that the vast majority--in fact 98 percent--of Americans, \nmakes less than that amount of money. We are talking about 98 percent \nof Americans receiving tax cuts under that proposal.\n  Back in July we passed this proposal, and it is now still waiting in \nthe House of Representatives. So far the House leadership has refused \nto even let the bill come up for a vote, even though we all know that \nthere is a majority of Members in the House who would vote for this and \nguarantee that as we go into Christmas, middle-class families across \nAmerica would know they would have $2,200 in their pockets, more in \ntheir pocket right now, next year, than they will have if their tax \ncuts expire. We have passed this bill, and we are urging the House of \nRepresentatives to do the right thing and to pass this bill.\n  Even Republicans in the House say they support this effort. We all \nknow that Representative Tom Cole from Oklahoma said last week, ``I \nthink we ought to take the 98 percent deal right now.'' It is a pretty \ngood deal.\n  Let us start. We know we have a large deficit reduction effort that \nneeds to take place. There is a lot of give and take that needs to take \nplace. We know what the elements are. But let us do step one, which is \nsomething overwhelmingly we agree with. The Senate has passed it on a \nbipartisan basis. There are enough votes in the House of \nRepresentatives. Let us get that piece done and not hold middle-class \nfamilies hostage to the idea that the wealthiest among us should get \nadditional tax cuts. Let us agree that 98 percent of families in \nAmerica should be secure in knowing they are not going to have $2,200 \nmore taken out of their pockets next year.\n  Now, we have just a few days to get this done. In fact, right now we \nhave 27 days until middle-class taxes go up. In 27 days, we will see \ntaxes go up for middle-class families. So this needs to get done now.\n  There are numerous House Members now agreeing with us--Republican \nHouse Members--and I commend them. In addition to Representative Cole, \nRepresentative Walter Jones from North Carolina said yesterday that he \nwould vote for the Senate's middle-class tax cut bill. Representative \nSteve LaTourette, Representative Charles Bass, Representative Mary Bono \nMack, Representative Mike Simpson, and Representative Robert Dold have \nall said the Senate plan is a responsible approach that protects \nmiddle-class families from a massive tax hike.\n  We now have a situation where the Democratic leader in the House is \nputting forward what is called a discharge petition. As our \ndistinguished Presiding Officer knows and as I know, having been House \nMembers, if a majority of the House signs a petition, that can \nessentially force a vote even if the Speaker and the Republican \nleadership don't want to bring it up.\n  I am hopeful that 218 Members on both sides of the aisle will sign \nthis petition and that we will be able to guarantee before Christmas \nthat middle-class families across this country are not going to have to \nworry about spending $2,200 more on taxes next year. We need to get \nthis done, and I am hopeful that the House Members will sign that \ndischarge petition if the Speaker does not take this up.\n  What does this $2,200 mean? It is the difference between paying the \nbills or not. It is the difference between getting ready for \nChristmas--buying the tree and the decorations and the presents. So \nmany families these days are back doing layaway, which, for me, when my \nkids were little and we were trying to budget and figure out how to do \nthings, meant picking out something back in September or in the summer \nand putting it on layaway and hoping to pay for it so the kids would \nhave the Christmas I wanted for them. Families are doing that today, \nbudgeting every single dollar to make sure they can provide the \nChristmas they want for their children. As they are budgeting all that, \nthey need to know\n\n[[Page S7407]]\n\nthey do not have to budget a tax increase starting in January, which is \nwhat will happen if the House doesn't act within the next 27 days.\n  One constituent of mine indicated to me that $2,200 was 4 months of \nher grocery bill. That is a lot of money. We are talking about 4 months \nof her family eating. We have also figured out that $2,200 would buy \n650 gallons of gas. For the average commuter, that is enough gas to get \nback and forth to work every day for 3 years. That is a lot of money--\n$2,200, 650 gallons of gas. And $2,200 will buy families in Michigan \n550 gallons of milk for their families. So we are talking about a \nsignificant amount of money for the average middle-class family, those \naspiring to get into the middle class, and those struggling across the \ncountry. This is a lot of money for the families we are talking about.\n  The Republicans in the House can stop this tax increase if they want \nto. They have 27 days to do it, 27 days to stop a tax increase on \nmiddle-class families, 27 days to stop an increase and make sure $2,200 \nmore is not taken out of the pockets of families next year.\n  Let me stress again as well that we are talking about middle-class \ntax cuts that would allow every American to get a tax cut on their \nfirst $250,000 of income. For the majority of people--98 percent of \nAmericans--that is their income, or less. They do not make more than \n$250,000 a year. But for everybody who does, it would continue to make \nsure their taxes don't go up.\n  For those above that, we would say: You know, for the last decade you \nhave had extra tax cuts, and we are going to ask you now, in the face \nof the largest deficits our country has ever seen, to do your part, to \nshare in solving the problem.\n  I know an awful lot of people who are ready to say: Absolutely. I \nwant to do my part.\n  That is what we are talking about--those wealthiest few being at the \ntable to do their part so we can solve the biggest deficit crisis we \nhave had as a country.\n  So we are talking about every American earning $250,000 or less or \nearning an income of $250,000 or less being exempt from tax increases, \nand that covers, as I said, 98 percent of Americans.\n  There is agreement on both sides of the aisle. I congratulate and \nappreciate very much Senator Snowe's comments in which she indicated we \nshould just get this done. She said Americans should not even be \nquestioning that we will ultimately raise taxes on low- to middle-\nincome people. We should take it off the table while grappling with tax \ncuts for the wealthy.\n  I couldn't agree more. We are going to miss Senator Snowe in the \nSenate. She, as usual, is right on the money in terms of the common \nsense of this situation.\n  In July the Senate passed a middle-class tax cut. I believe we now \nhave a majority in the House of Representatives, on a bipartisan basis, \nbelieves middle-class taxpayers should get tax cuts next year. The \nHouse needs to bring it up and vote on it now so we get that off the \ntable. That is step one.\n  Then, of course, we have larger issues on which we have to agree. We \nhave to sit down and come together on those issues. Last year we agreed \non $1 trillion in spending reductions. This step gets middle-class \ntaxpayers off the hook, being held as pawns, held hostage to whether \nthe wealthiest among us will get additional tax cuts next year. Let's \njust say middle-class families get $2,200 next year, they get to \ncontinue their tax cuts, and then we will go on to the next step.\n  It seems to me--and we certainly saw this as we were doing the farm \nbill--you don't have to agree on everything to do something. You start \nwith what you agree on. Everybody says they agree middle-class families \nin this country should get tax cuts next year and beyond. Then let's \njust do it. What are we waiting for? Let's do that, and then we will \nlook for the next set of issues we can agree on to solve the large \nproblems we have in terms of our fiscal situation and economic growth, \nby the way, because we will never get out of debt with 12 million \npeople out of work. So we better continue to be focused on jobs, which \nI know is a huge focus for our caucus--making sure people can lift \nthemselves out of poverty into the middle class and have the \nopportunity for good-paying jobs for themselves and their families.\n  So we have a lot of issues to talk about, but since everybody says \nthey agree middle-class taxpayers should not get a $2,200 tax increase \nnext year, why don't we just do that? We shouldn't have to run the \nclock out and get closer and closer to the holidays, closer and closer \nto Christmas, with families not knowing what they are going to have to \nbudget for next year. Let's just do it and let families know we can \nactually work together and get things done because that is really what \npeople are asking us to do.\n\n  I believe that is the message of this past election, that people want \nus to sit down and be reasonable and work together. They also sent a \nmessage through the reelection of our President, who campaigned saying \nthe wealthiest among us should be part of solving the problem and can \nafford to pay a little more to make sure we are not asking middle-class \nfamilies to bear the entire burden of resolving the deficit in our \ncountry. The President won. The public said: Yes, that makes common \nsense. Everybody ought to be participating, not just middle-class \nfamilies or senior citizens, who have been hit the hardest in the \nrecession. With everything that has happened in the last decade, they \nhave been hit the hardest or carried the brunt of it.\n  We are simply saying: You know what. Everybody ought to be in this. \nAs Americans, we all benefit from this great country, the blessings of \nthis country, and everybody ought to be part of the solution.\n  So I believe that was a very strong message. I believe it was a very \nstrong message to say people want us to work together.\n  I also know, in looking at the proposal the Speaker has given, it is \na nonstarter, saying we are taking off the table any effort that would \nstop more tax cuts for the wealthiest among us, and instead what we \nwant to focus on is closing loopholes and deductions, because that \nfalls right back to the middle class again--home mortgage deduction, \ncollege deduction, the mortgage tax relief bill I have which makes sure \nthat in a short sale or another situation where a family is coming to \nsome agreement with the bank on loan forgiveness, they do not pay taxes \non that as income. So we have a whole range of what they call tax \ndeductions they can close that fall smack-dab on the middle class, and \nthat is a nonstarter.\n  In conclusion, let me say once again that we have 27 days to stop a \ntax hike on middle-class families across America--$2,200 that will hit \npeople next year. It makes no sense. If they pass the Senate bill, they \nwill be guaranteeing that 98 percent of American people don't have a \ntax hike. We need to get it done, and I would urge in the strongest \npossible way that the Speaker bring this up right away and pass it.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from \nMichigan for her leadership on this issue--21 days until Christmas, 27 \ndays until ``cliffmas.'' That is the fiscal cliff--December 31--and \npeople are counting down. Two-thirds of Americans are watching this \ndebate on Capitol Hill because it affects every single family, every \nindividual. One has to think, could Congress possibly step back and let \ntaxes go up on working families? What are they thinking?\n  We know what working families are dealing with. Many working families \nacross America struggle paycheck to paycheck. The Pugh Institute did a \nstudy last year and asked working families how many could come up with \n$2,000 in 30 days for an emergency expenditure. It is easy to imagine \none--a car repair, a quick trip to the hospital emergency room costing \n$2,000. Only half of working families could come up with $2,000 in 30 \ndays. That shows how close to the edge many people live. And now we \nhave before us the possibility that these very same families struggling \nwith these issues are in fact going to see their taxes go up on \nDecember 31.\n  There is one person who will decide that: Speaker John Boehner, the \nRepublican Speaker of the House of Representatives. Now, why am I \nputting all this on poor John Boehner, a Congressman from Ohio, from a \nworking\n\n[[Page S7408]]\n\nfamily himself? Well, because it is within his power to call before the \nHouse of Representatives a measure that passed the Senate last July. We \npassed on a bipartisan vote a measure to protect all families making \nless than $250,000 a year from any income tax increase on December 31. \nWe sent it over to the House of Representatives in July. Speaker \nBoehner has refused to call up this measure that would protect working \nfamilies. As a result, if he does nothing, their tax bill will go up \n$2,200 next year. How do you explain that? It is not only unfair to \nthose families who are working and struggling, it is really not good \nfor this country. All of us know the issue of income inequality. How \nmany working families are falling further and further behind every \nsingle year despite their best efforts, despite their hard work? We \nalso know that many families are looking ahead and wondering how in the \nworld they are going to pay for a college education for their kids or \nmaybe even stay in their homes.\n  Those are life-and-death, day-to-day, paycheck-to-paycheck decisions \nfamilies face. And let me be even more specific. The failure of Speaker \nJohn Boehner to call this bill for a vote in the House of \nRepresentatives before December 31 endangers our economy. That is \nright. The failure to pass this bill in the House of Representatives \nbefore December 31 will endanger our economy. Why? Because we are in \nthe midst of recovery from a recession. People are getting their jobs \nback. Businesses are getting a little stronger. But if Speaker Boehner \nrefuses to call this bipartisan measure that passed the Senate and we \nsee a downturn in consumer confidence because people think their taxes \nare going up, if we see a downturn in consumer purchasing because \npeople aren't sure about that next paycheck, then we are going to see a \nstall in this economy. It will be Speaker Boehner's stall, and it is \nnot something he should take lightly.\n  This is a delicate recovery moving in the right direction, but if it \nis going to gain strength there has to be some certainty, and it should \nstart with the passage of this measure.\n  The House Republican leadership is bargaining with the President now. \nThe President said the wealthiest among us who have realized the \nAmerican dream should be willing to pay a little bit more so others get \na chance at the American dream. That is not unfair. I think many of us \nwho came from working families and have done well with our lives \nbelieve, yes; we owe it to our kids and we owe it to the next \ngeneration to give them a fighting chance. If that is going to happen, \nthen Speaker Boehner and the House Republican leadership have to take \nthis very seriously very quickly.\n  I understand the pressure the Speaker is under, and I guess my \ncolleague, Senator McCaskill of Missouri, said it very concisely and \neffectively last Sunday on one of the talk shows. She said it is a hard \npolitical choice for John Boehner. He has to decide what is more \nimportant, the survival of his speakership or the survival of this \nNation. That is a pretty stark choice but not a hard choice for a real \nleader.\n  I will say this to Speaker Boehner: If you step up and do the right \nthing for the working families across America, if you step up and do \nthe right thing for this country, Democrats will stand with you on a \nbipartisan basis to make it happen. That is the only way we are ever \ngoing to achieve the right result in this debate over the fiscal cliff.\n  So we call on Speaker Boehner: Before you go home to relax in Ohio \nfor Christmas, let families across America relax knowing that they are \nnot going to see their income tax rates go up on January 1. This is \nworth $2,200 to the average family in my home State of Illinois. And I \nsay to the Speaker, it is worth that to families across the United \nStates. For the good of this Nation, for the good of the economy, for \nthe good of these working families, for goodness' sake, pass this \nmeasure, this bipartisan measure that passed the Senate last July. Get \nthis part done. We can debate the rest, but give peace of mind to these \nworking families and middle-income families so that tomorrow they are \nnot going to see their income taxes go up.\n\n\n                        Disabilities Convention\n\n  Madam President, it was a disappointing day yesterday when the Senate \nfailed by five votes to pass the convention on disabilities. It is a \nmeasure I worked on with former California Congressman Tony Coelho, who \nhas been an outstanding advocate for the disabled in America throughout \nhis career in the Congress and Senate. But it was also an effort for \none particular friend in Illinois, Marca Bristo.\n  Marca is an exceptional person, confined to a wheelchair, but one \nwould never know it. This woman is everywhere, all the time, working \nnight and day to help the disabled in my State and around the Nation. \nShe came to me as well and said: Can you help pass this convention on \ndisabilities?\n  I said: It is going to be hard because a lot of Members just don't \nwant to take up a measure and consider something like this.\n  She said: We will put together a strong group supporting it.\n  When it was all over, virtually every veterans organization in \nAmerica supported this convention on disabilities. In addition, every \ndisabilities group also endorsed it--the chamber of commerce and so \nmany others--because 125 nations have already ratified this convention \non disabilities.\n  What is it? It is a treaty that was drawn up by President George \nHerbert Walker Bush and signed by him but needs to be ratified by the \nSenate, and we failed to do it. Years and years have passed since \nPresident Bush, and we haven't taken it up. One hundred twenty-five \nnations took it up and passed it but not the United States.\n  There was one real champion for this, and he came to the Senate floor \nyesterday. It was good to see him again--what an outstanding man and \nindividual--Senator Robert Dole. We have had our differences \npolitically, but I am an admirer of Robert Dole and what he has given \nto America.\n  A disabled veteran from World War II, he came back having been \nshattered by that war and built a life of public service that he gave \nto the people of Kansas and here in the Senate Chamber. He and his \nwife, former Senator Liddy Dole, came to the floor of the Senate before \nthe vote. They were just over here in the well. I looked at him and I \nthought: We have to do this for Bob Dole. This man speaks for disabled \nveterans and the disabled community. He was with Senator Tom Harkin, \none of the lead persons when it came to passing the Americans with \nDisabilities Act 22 years ago.\n  It was a solemn moment in the Senate, with Senator Dole sitting right \nthere in the well begging his colleagues to pass this disabilities \nconvention, maybe his last lobbying effort that he would undertake. It \nmeant so much to the Dole family and to Robert Dole, and he came to the \nfloor and we called the measure. Those who witnessed it will remember \nthat most Members came and sat in their chairs to cast a vote, which is \nrare here, and it tells the story that this was more than just an \nordinary routine vote.\n  We listened as the rollcall was made, and we watched the Senators \nstand and vote. Then toward the end, I turned to Tom Harkin sitting \nover here and said: We don't have it. We missed it.\n  We did. We failed to ratify this by five votes. We had 61 votes, and \nwe needed 66, because Senator Kirk is absent because of illness. Sixty-\nsix votes were needed to pass this.\n  There were only eight Republicans who would stand with all of the \nDemocrats to pass this convention on disabilities. Senator John McCain \nled that effort--John McCain, a person who knows the cost of war and \nthe price that is paid and who showed extraordinary political courage. \nSenator John Kerry also joined him, another Vietnam war veteran who \nstood up for these disabled veterans, for their conflict and World War \nII and Korea and so many others.\n  What a disappointment. What a disappointment that the Senate, which \non a bipartisan basis passed the Americans with Disabilities Act with \nmore than 90 votes 22 years ago, couldn't even ratify this treaty which \nwould not change a single law in America, which would not infringe on \nour freedoms in any way--that we couldn't pass that on the Senate \nfloor. What a sad testament to what has happened to the Senate in the \nlast two decades that a man like Bob Dole would witness this. I am sure \nit broke his heart. It broke mine too.\n  I went out afterwards and saw the disabled gathered in the lobby out \nhere. Many of them were crying. They\n\n[[Page S7409]]\n\ncouldn't believe it. At a time in America when we are giving the \ndisabled chances they have never had, opportunities they have deserved \nfor decades and generations, that we would turn down this convention on \ndisabilities here--it was a sad moment in the history of the Senate \nthat only eight Republicans would join every Democratic Senator in \nvoting for the ratification of this treaty on disabilities.\n  Some of these colleagues may have another chance. Maybe next year we \nwill have another go at it. I certainly hope Senator Dole will be here \nto join us and see that happy day. But yesterday was a sad day for the \nSenate and a sad day for our Nation.\n  We owe a debt of gratitude to the disabled who work so hard, to the \ndisabled veterans who testified and worked so hard for the passage of \nthis treaty, and we owe it to them and the disabled around the world to \ngive them a chance--a chance for an opportunity which has become the \nlaw in America and needs to be the law across this Nation. Whatever the \npetty political squabbles were that led to this vote yesterday, we need \nto put them behind us. It is important for us in the 21st century to \nspeak as one on a bipartisan basis for the disabled.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, in less than 1 month American taxpayers \nface the greatest tax increase in our Nation's history.\n  Two years ago the President and the Senate Democrats opted to \npostpone these tax increases for 2 years. They did so knowing that \nraising taxes in a weak economy is an unnecessary and counterproductive \njolt to the system. Forty Democrats supported doing that.\n  Since then, however, the President has been single-minded in arguing \nfor tax increases on certain wealthy taxpayers. He and his Democratic \nfriends promoted these tax hikes in the name of a so-called balanced \napproach to deficit reduction. Now, with the country fast approaching \nthe fiscal cliff, it is time to pay the piper. But as the President \nissues ultimatums about what kind of tax increases are necessary to \navert the fiscal cliff, it is worth noting that he has abandoned any \npretense of seeking a balanced approach to deficit reduction.\n  Last week's proposal from the White House amounts to little more than \na massive set of tax increases--by the way, far in excess of the tax \nhikes he ran on or anything that Senate Democrats would support, \ncoupled with new spending. Even Democrats don't support what he called \nfor. And his response to Speaker Boehner's balanced plan is raise taxes \ntoday, and next year we will come back and discuss raising taxes again.\n  The President's commitment to a balanced approach to new tax revenue \nand spending reforms has morphed postelection into new tax revenue and \nincreased spending. To cap it off, they have thrown in a fresh demand \nthat would eliminate any limit on the Federal debt.\n  The proposal outlined by Treasury Secretary Geithner last week shows \nthat, if given a chance, Democrats will never use new taxes to reduce \nthe deficit. They will instead use it to pay for larger government, \nmore public workers, and more government waste.\n  We need to have a serious conversation about our Federal debt, which \nis now over $16.3 trillion and going up every day. How do we get that \nnumber under control? The President and his Democratic friends have \nsuggested for years that they can do it on the revenue side \nspecifically by taxing the wealthy. Yet the new taxes on the rich \npromised by the President during the campaign would reduce the next 10 \nyears' of deficits by only 8 percent, assuming they didn't do any more \nspending.\n  So where is the rest of the money going to come from? We need to have \na serious conversation about spending, but so far the President, \ncongressional Democrats, and the liberal interest groups who support \nthem have refused to engage.\n  All I can say is that Republicans are here, and we are ready to talk. \nWe are ready to reach a balanced resolution that would spare the \nAmerican people from the consequences of going over the fiscal cliff.\n  I have only been here 36 years, but I have seen every President \nwilling to meet on a regular basis at budget crunch time with people on \nboth sides of the table over and over and over until they gradually \nwhittle it down to where they can agree. I haven't seen that with \nPresident Obama. I have even heard Democrats complain that he never \ntalks to them.\n  We cannot do this kind of work without very strong Presidential \neffort. That is what Presidents are for. And it can't just be laying \ndown a gauntlet or saying: You can't cross over that, drawing a line in \nthe sand. You have two programs now, and those two sides need to get \ntogether. That includes the President and whatever Democrats he cares \nto put in the equation, and also Speaker Boehner, Leader McConnell, and \nothers.\n  As we attempt to reach a meaningful resolution of this debate in the \ncoming weeks, there are three guideposts that I will keep in sight.\n  First is the cliff itself. Going over it would be the height of \nirresponsibility. According to the Congressional Budget Office, going \nover the cliff will reduce GDP to a negative one-half of 1 percent next \nyear, throwing us back into a recession and causing unemployment to \nsurge to 9.1 percent or more. But it seems increasingly clear that the \nPresident and Democrats in Congress are content to go over the cliff \nregardless of the outcome. I can't believe that is so, but I have heard \nthem say it. They think they will have an advantage if we go over the \ncliff.\n  Well, I hate to tell you, there will be no advantage to that. Leading \nDemocrats have expressed on several occasions their openness toward \ngoing over the cliff. The question is, Why? Why would the President do \nthis? Why would Democrats jeopardize the livelihoods of hundreds of \nthousands of American workers and the economic security of their \nfamilies? Why are they putting raising tax rates on a few ahead of the \nwell-being of all?\n  Republicans are working to avoid this outcome. We want to avoid \nraising tax rates because we know once they are raised they will stay \nthere or there will be another demand next year to raise them higher. \nWe have a good argument for that. We believe it hurts the economy by \nharming incentives to work, save, and invest.\n  Republicans have expressed some willingness to work with the \nPresident to raise revenue without raising tax rates, but the President \nrefuses to budge. After all, he argued during his reelection that the \ndeficit reduction math does not work otherwise.\n  This leads me to my second guidepost in this debate. It is the \nPresident's math that does not work, and his math is off in a \nmultiplicity of ways. Let's start at the beginning. Last year's deficit \nwas $1.3 trillion. Next year's deficit is likely to exceed $1 trillion \nfor a fifth year in a row.\n  So what would the President's tax hikes proposal raise in terms of \nrevenue? What would it have done to last year's $1.3 trillion deficit, \nand what would it do to reduce our debt over the long term? If all of \nthe 2001 and 2003 tax relief were to expire, it would reduce the \ndeficit by $426 billion over 1 year.\n  To put it another way, the full extension of the current bipartisan \ntax relief would cost $426 billion over 1 year.\n  Now, that is a lot of revenue. But the President and congressional \nDemocrats--or at least most of them--have no desire to see all of this \ntax relief expire. In fact, their plan, should we go over the cliff, is \nto reinstate almost all of it. They say they only want to raise taxes \non the rich.\n  So how much would it cost if we extended current tax relief for \neveryone but those making over $250,000, which some have said is the \nline for being rich? Assuming the estate tax stays where it is--a fair \nassumption, given the level of support for that policy even among \nSenate Democrats--the cost of extending all of the tax relief except \nfor those individuals would be $358 billion. And given that certain \nSenators from high-income blue States are uncomfortable designating \nfamilies making $250,000 a year as rich, it has been suggested that the \ncurrent tax relief might be extended for everyone but so-called \nmillionaires. Warren Buffett has said those earning $500,000 a year or \nmore, but others have said millionaires. And how much would that cost? \nThe 1-year cost of that tax relief would be $383 billion.\n  There are a few different ways we can look at these numbers. One way \nis to\n\n[[Page S7410]]\n\ncompare the cost of the Democrats' tax plan with that of the \nRepublicans'. The 1-year difference between the Republican proposal of \nextending all tax relief and the Democrats' proposal to raise taxes on \nthe rich is, at most, $68 billion and perhaps as low as $23 billion. \nWith the deficit over $1 trillion, is the President willing to send us \nover the cliff for as little as $23 billion in additional revenue? I \ncannot believe he is, but he is.\n  Another way to look at the numbers is to compare the cost of the \nDemocrats' actual plan with the President's stated desire to raise \nrevenue by $1.6 trillion. He cannot get that from just the rich. Even \nif he took every dollar every millionaire earns this next year, he \nprobably would have a little less than $900 billion. That may be high.\n  I look forward to some enterprising reporter getting to the bottom of \nthis one. The President says he wants to raise taxes by $1.6 trillion \nand his Treasury Secretary suggests Democrats are on board with this \nstrategy. I do not believe that for 1 minute. I don't believe his \nprogram would pass the Senate, and I don't think many Democrats would \nvote for it. I know at least 20 who will not. Yet the revenue generated \nby the proposal supported by real live Democrats seems to raise only \nbetween $353 billion and $383 billion.\n  Here is the question: Where is the President going to come up with \nanother $1.2 trillion or so in tax increases that his fellow Democrats \nwill support? We have seen three budgets the President has sent up, and \nthey have not received one vote from either Republicans or Democrats--\nnot one. Where is the President going to come up with another $1.2 \ntrillion or so in tax increases and be able to get Democrats to support \nhim? I do not mean supported by Democratic pundits; I mean supported by \nthe 20 Democratic Senators who will be facing their constituents in \n2014. The $1.6 trillion tax increase is lifted from the President's own \nbudget that has been rejected on a bipartisan vote--100 percent in both \nthe House and the Senate--and that budget received no votes at all, \nDemocrat or Republican, in either the House or the Senate. As I said, \nit is the President's numbers, the numbers Secretary Geithner sent here \nlast week to promote that do not add up.\n  The President's insistence on a $1.6 trillion tax hike that is \nneither supported by the American people nor even elected Democrats is \nnot about deficit reduction. The President and congressional Democrats \nthink they can bludgeon Republicans as an out-of-touch party of the \nrich because we support tax relief for everybody.\n  Let me say a few words in our defense. First off, and I want to say \nthis loudly and clearly: I could not care less about the financial \nwell-being of the Nation's rich. Whether Warren Buffett is able to \nmaintain his corporate jet is no concern of mine, although he is a \nfriend. The continued ability of actors and entertainment industry \nexecutives to summer at Lake Como and winter at Saint Kitts is not on \nmy list of priorities. In fact, I believe when we do finally engage in \nfundamental tax reform it is worth our while to look at how these \nsuperrich are sheltering their wealth from the full burden of income \ntaxation while the middle class continues to suffer on both the income \ntax and increasingly the alternative minimum tax, which is going to hit \nabout 28 million regular people who are not millionaires on January 1, \nif we go over the cliff.\n  Still, I, along with most of my Republican colleagues, continue to \npromote the seamless extension of current tax policy. That is because \nof the impact of increasing marginal rates on small business owners and \nthe consequent impact on job creation and economic growth. We know it \nis going to hit approximately 1 million small business owners very \nhard; most of whom put their money back into the business so they can \ngrow it and hire more people.\n  Republicans support low marginal rates because we know that by \nraising rates we hamper the efforts of investors, small business owners \nand, most importantly, the American workers they employ. Republicans \nare averse to rate hikes that would have a detrimental impact on \npeople's livelihoods. We are averse to rate hikes that would undermine \nthe prospects of fundamental tax reform that promotes fairness and \neconomic growth, and we are certainly averse to a discussion about \nincreased revenue in the absence of serious talk about spending \nreform--something that is not, except in minuscule ways, in the \nPresident's suggestions.\n  We keep hearing Republicans are dug in on the issue of taxes and that \ntheir resistance to increased revenues has been holding back the big \nbalance deal set by the President. This has to be one of the most \nmisreported stories in my memory. Many Republicans have stated openness \nto increased revenues. There is a difference between revenues and tax \nrate increases that we Republicans continue to point out. But we are \nonly willing to be open to increased revenues as part of a balanced \ndeal and only if revenue increases are coupled with entitlement \nspending reform.\n  This brings me to my third guidepost for this debate. The President \nhas shown a real stubbornness toward any reform of the spending \nprograms that are the main drivers of our deficit and debt. We hear \nconstantly about the intransigence of Republicans with their antitax \nrate increase views. Yet we do not see the same front page stories \ndocumenting the over-my-dead-body resistance of Richard Trumka, the \nhead of the AFL/CIO, and the head of the AARP toward entitlement \nspending reform which everybody knows we have to do if we are going to \nkeep Medicare going. I don't think there is anyone in this body who \ndoesn't know that within 10 years it will be broke, unless we make the \nappropriate structural reforms now.\n  The President continues to call for a balanced approach to deficit \nreduction, but in practice he is offering all tax increases and no \nspending discipline. He has offered nothing meaningful on entitlement \nreform. The proposal put forward last week by Secretary Geithner was \nembarrassing.\n  I happen to like Secretary Geithner. I stood up for him under some \ntrying circumstances on the Finance Committee before he was approved by \nthe Senate. I did it because I believe he is a hard worker. I believe \nhe is an intelligent man, and I personally like him. But, my gosh, if I \nwere the Treasury Secretary and the President gave me that plan to go \nand show it to the leader of the House, the Speaker of the House, I \nwould have said: No, Mr. President, you can't do this. This is an \ninsult. If the President said you have to do this for me, I would say I \nthink it is better for me to resign at this point.\n  It is embarrassing. I think Secretary Geithner knows it. If he does \nnot, then he is not the man whom I have always thought he was. That \nproposal did nothing to address spending, aside from wanting to \nincrease it. But that is where the Democrats are.\n  I understand the Democrats' predicament. Right after the election it \nappeared the door was open. The President seemed willing to address tax \nrevenue in a responsible manner, a manner respectful of the legitimate \nconcerns of the House majority and the 62.6 million individuals who did \nnot vote for him. But within 1 week he was read the riot act by the \nunions and the AARP, who will resist any meaningful changes to the \nretirement spending programs that are now bankrupting our country.\n  Later this week I will outline a series of entitlement changes that \ncould and should be supported on a bipartisan basis. The President told \nthe American people he wants a balanced approach. My hope is the \nPresident comes forward on his own with his own details on how he would \nfix the entitlement spending programs; I mean real details on real \nproposals with real teeth, not the window dressing in the President's \nbudget that even the Democrats reject and have rejected in the past.\n  The President has demanded a balanced approach. It is what he \npromised the American people and it is what we Republicans are prepared \nto give him. If the President wants to avoid going over the fiscal \ncliff, he can steer us away from it. The special interests and his \nliberal base will no doubt cry foul, but they will follow him if he \nwill lead, and I don't see the leadership, between you and me.\n  Not to put too fine a point on it, but if we go over the cliff, it \nwill be because the President wanted it to happen and he thinks he will \nget political points for doing it. With the Main\n\n[[Page S7411]]\n\nStreet media, it is likely they will ignore the actual facts. Even \nthough the President will never again run for any public office, he \nwill have put cheap political points ahead of a reasonable deal he \nclaims to support.\n\n  This is deeply cynical, and the President should understand that when \nthe history of this episode is written, he will be portrayed not as a \nstrong leader but one who wilted in the face of our generation's \ngreatest challenge, caving in to the special interests over the well-\nbeing of the country. When he faced the choice of tough statesmanship \nor easy accolades from his house cable news network and a dead-ender \nbase, he chose the latter.\n  I think it is time for the President to start leading and to put away \nhis campaign talking points and talk to us rather than talking from a \ntoy factory and trying to make his points. He needs to put away his \ncampaign talking points, and he needs to engage in finding a balanced \nsolution to our debt crisis. He needs to lead the country, and he needs \nto protect American small business, their workers, and their children \nfrom an increasingly dim fiscal future.\n  I am concerned about it. As I study it, the difference between the \nPresident's plan and what Senator McConnell and I have suggested, \nputting it over for 1 year and giving us 1 year to dedicate that to tax \nreform, the difference is about $23 billion. At the most, it is $68 \nbillion. We are going to go to the cliff, $23 billion? We would have to \nbe nuts, even if our illustrious media will cover it up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/05/senate-section/article/S7411-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7411-S7414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RULES OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, there has been a lot of discussion \nlately about how the Senate is not working properly. This is evident to \neven a casual observer. On the other hand, to understand how the Senate \nwas intended to work and what has gone wrong requires some knowledge of \nthe history and the rules of the Senate. I would put more emphasis upon \nthe history than the present rules of the Senate, particularly the \nhistory and purpose of the Senate expressed in the Federalist Papers by \nthe people who were advising the States at that point, the colonies, to \napprove the Constitution.\n  To many people, this subject, no doubt, seems arcane and confusing. \nThe simplistic explanation we get from the other side of the aisle--and \nit is a steady drumbeat--is that Republicans are filibustering \neverything just willy-nilly; thereby, grinding the Senate to a halt.\n  Various vague and nefarious motivations are suggested as to why \nRepublicans would do such a thing, but the point they want Americans to \ntake away is that Republicans are abusing the filibuster. This message \nhas been repeated ad nauseam by Democrats in the hope it will sink into \nthe public's consciousness by rote. In fact, the story goes that \nRepublicans have so abused the filibuster, the Democrats have no choice \nbut to take it away, even if it means violating the Senate rules in \norder to change the rules. Can you imagine a political party saying it \nis OK to ignore the rules or to change the rules?\n  In order to discuss this topic, it is very important to establish \nwhat we mean by the word ``filibuster'' and how it fits into how the \nSenate operates today and has operated historically. I hope everyone \nwill bear with me as we try to understand this because I ultimately \nwant to get down to how the proposed changes to the Senate rules \nthreaten the very principle underlying our system of government, \nparticularly the checks and balances within our system of government.\n  First, I have a legitimate question: What is a filibuster? We talk \nabout it so much that we would think it referred to a very specific \nactivity that is easily understood by everyone. It can actually refer \nto different types of activities. Of course, this leads to confusion, \nand that confusion is reflected in some of the speeches from colleagues \non the other side of the aisle, intentionally or not.\n  When most Americans think of a filibuster, they probably think of \nJimmy Stewart in the classic film ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' \nstanding and talking without stopping for an extended period of time to \ndelay proceedings and to take a lot of theater just to make a point. \nThis is the classic understanding of a filibuster. Unless all Senators \nhave agreed to waive Senate rules, it is a fact that a Senator who has \nbeen recognized to speak may retain the floor as long as he continues \nto speak. This is the basis in the Senate rules for a classic \nfilibuster, but this is not the rule some Democrats want to change.\n  When the Members of the majority party complain about how many \nfilibusters the Republicans have engaged in, they actually mean how \nmany times the Senate has voted on a motion to bring debate to a close, \nand that motion is called the cloture motion. When debate comes to an \nend, it also means no more opportunities for amendments. If Republicans \ndon't agree to end debate and force a final vote when the majority \nleader decides we should end debate and vote, he calls that a \nfilibuster. In fact, even when every single Republican votes in favor \nof ending debate, he still calls it a filibuster. It ends up in those \nstatistics that add up to numbers that are not very intellectually \nhonest. Think of Republicans voting in favor of ending debate and it is \nstill called a filibuster.\n  We just voted a day or two ago, 93 to 0, to end debate on the Defense \nauthorization bill. Is he still going to call that a filibuster as \nwell? How can he accuse Republicans of filibustering when he is the one \nwho made the cloture motion? This is a key point. When the Democrats \ntalk about Republicans launching a filibuster, it is important to note \nit is the Senate majority leader who almost exclusively makes the \nmotion to invoke cloture. I understand it takes a petition of 16, but \nnot very many Senators I know ever initiate such a petition unless the \nRepublican leader, when we are in the majority, or the Democratic \nleader, when they are in the majority, provoked that. This means the \nnumber the majority leader is so fond of quoting as a number of so-\ncalled Republican filibusters is the number of times he has attempted \nto shut down debate and block further amendments from being considered. \nAgain, we are talking about a process launched by the majority leader \nintended to shut off debate and amendments, not some process initiated \nby Republicans.\n  If every time the majority leader made the motion to close debate we \nhad been considering a bill for days or weeks with dozens of amendments \nand no end in sight, then there is a legitimacy to such a decision by \nthe majority leader in the petition for cloture. He might then have a \npoint. However, the recent history of the Senate cloture votes tells an \nentirely different story.\n\n  The majority leader has filed a motion to cut off debate in the same \nday a bill has been taken up over 220 times since he became majority \nleader. How can this be justified, considering the history of the \nSenate and given that it is a deliberative body? He certainly cannot \nclaim Republicans are delaying action with excessive debate when he \nmoves to cut off debate before that debate has ever begun. As I said, \nby forcing a final vote, a cloture motion also ultimately cuts off the \namendments.\n  The right of a Senator to offer an amendment for consideration has \nbeen enshrined in the Senate rules from the very beginning. It is true \nthat about half the cloture votes I cited were on the motion to proceed \nto consider a bill which is before the stage where amendments can be \noffered. I will say more on that point later. However, the majority \nleader has moved to cut off debate on amendments on a measure other \nthan the motion to proceed over 100 times. In my judgment, he can \nhardly claim Republicans forced his hand by offering too many \namendments when few, if any, amendments have even been considered when \nhe attempts to cut off amendments.\n  What is more, the majority leader has consistently used the tactic \ncalled filling the tree, where he offers blocker amendments that block \nany other Senator from offering their own amendments unless the \nmajority leader or somebody speaking for him agrees to set aside a \nblocker amendment so the other Senator can offer an amendment. This way \nhe is able to get in line first to put his blocker amendments in place\n\n[[Page S7412]]\n\nbecause of a tradition that the majority leader has priority to be \nrecognized by the Presiding Officer. This doesn't happen to appear \nanyplace in the rules. In fact, the rules make very clear that whatever \nSenator seeks recognition first should be recognized and that any \nSenator has a right to offer an amendment. This so-called filling the \ntree tactic was relatively rare before Senator Reid became majority \nleader, but he has made it routine.\n  Technically, some germane amendments can be considered during a short \nwindow after cloture has been invoked and before final vote. But by \nusing the blocker amendment tactic, along with a motion to invoke \ncloture, the majority leader can block any Senator from offering any \namendment while shutting off debate. That means the Senate would take a \nfinal vote on a bill without a single amendment having been offered.\n  The abuse of this tactic is at the heart of the Senate's current \ngridlock. This is confirmed by a chart--and I don't have a copy of this \nchart with me--published with a recent New York Times article. Here is \nwhat the caption said:\n\n       The use of filibusters has risen since the 1970s, \n     especially when Republicans have been in the Senate minority.\n\n  That would tend to blame Republicans, but listen to the rest of this \nquote.\n\n       But the most recent spike of Republican filibusters has \n     coincided with the Democrats' unprecedented moves to limit \n     amendments on the Senate floor.\n\n  This doesn't even tell the whole story because much of the time the \nSenate majority leader doesn't have to actually use his amendment-\nblocking tactics. He simply informs Republicans he will block \namendments or refuses to commit to allow Republican amendments before \nmaking the motion to consider a bill. In this all-too-common scenario, \nthe majority leader tells the Republicans he intends to move to \nconsider a bill and will immediately move to cut off debate on that \nmotion. By the way, if we do vote to take up this bill, we will not be \nallowed to offer any amendments. So that kind of puts everybody on this \nside of the aisle in a take-it-or-leave-it situation. Why on Earth \nwould Republicans take that deal and vote for cloture on proceeding to \na bill on which we are told we will be allowed no input, contrary to \nthe deliberative tradition of the Senate?\n\n  Just to be clear, some Democrats have proposed eliminating the \nfilibuster entirely. Others have proposals to limit it in various ways. \nMajority Leader Reid wants to start by eliminating it on the motion to \nproceed. But as we have seen, the real problem is the way Republicans \nhave been blocked from participating in the process. If we are looking \nto reform how the Senate operates, maybe we ought to start by \nconsidering doing away with the tradition that the majority leader can \nblock amendments. That is something which is already contrary to the \nletter of the Senate rules.\n  Again, there is no doubt that the Senate is not functioning properly. \nHowever, the complaints I hear from Iowans are not that the Senate is \nconsidering too many amendments and working too hard to make sure the \nlegislation we pass is worded properly. In fact, I hear quite the \nopposite. A great many Iowans have told me they are not happy with \nlegislation being rammed through the Congress without their elected \nrepresentatives even having an opportunity to read it. If Members of \nCongress don't have a chance to read a bill, we can bet the American \npublic doesn't have a chance to understand it. I suppose that is fine \nif we believe we should pass a bill first and let the American people \nfind out what is in it later, as Speaker Pelosi once famously suggested \nabout the health care reform bill. We have to pass it, she said, and \nthen we will find out what is in it. And then there is a rude awakening \nthat now in this 2,700-page health care reform bill, we are finding out \nthere are a lot of bad things in it, a lot of bad things that we warned \nthe public about and warned the Democrats about as well. However, if \none thinks, as I do, that we should be listening to those who elect us, \none would have to conclude that a more deliberative process is needed, \nnot less.\n  The rules of the House allow for quick consideration of legislation, \nbut the Senate is supposed to be different and historically has been \ndifferent. When the majority leader says the Senate is not operating \nefficiently, he means we are not approving the legislation he wants on \nthe timetable he demands. The simple historical fact is the Senate is \nnot designed for that kind of efficiency. However, for a period after \nthe 2008 elections, the Democrats had 60 Members in the Senate. That is \nenough votes to shut off debate and amendments without a single \nRepublican cooperating. Naturally, the majority party couldn't resist \nthe temptation and shut Republican voices out of every aspect of the \nlegislative process because they had the votes to do it. Not only did \nthey use their supermajority to prevent Republican amendments on the \nfloor of the Senate, but since they didn't need Republican votes to \npass a bill, they cut us out of the process of developing the \nlegislation.\n  In my experience as a former chairman and now ranking member, some of \nthe best examples of bipartisanship happen at the committee level. The \nSenate committees are where Senators of both parties often work in a \nbipartisan way to delve into the details of the legislation and iron \nout imperfections. This is how most bills are supposed to be handled.\n  I often tell people who are cynical about all the partisanship they \nsee on TV that there is a lot of bipartisan work that goes on that they \nnever see because only controversial things get on television. When a \ncommittee process is working and the Democrats and Republicans are \nworking together to get a bill and everything is going smoothly, no \njournalist is going to pay any attention to that. But that goes on in \nthe committee process, and that process can be dry and it can be \ntechnical. Senators of both parties sitting around a table discussing \nwhere to place a comma doesn't make the breaking-news alerts. \nNevertheless, the committees are where much of the hard bipartisan work \nof the Senate is done.\n  In recent years the Democratic leaders prefer to write bills behind \nclosed doors without Republican input. I suppose the health care reform \nbill is the best example of that, but there are others as well. They \nhave then used a parliamentary trick to bring them right to the Senate \nfloor. I suppose I shouldn't use the words ``parliamentary trick'' \nbecause there is a rule XIV, but that bypasses the usual committee \nprocess where we build consensus between the political parties. If \nRepublicans are shut out of having any significant input on the front \nend and are blocked from having any amendments on the back end, is it \nany wonder we don't vote for the majority leader's motion to cut off \ndebate?\n  Despite the bad blood caused by the tactics I have described, I had \nhoped and believed that after the 2010 elections, things would be \ndifferent. When Americans elected Republicans to a sizeable majority in \nthe House of Representatives--larger than any election since 1938--and \nat the same time enlarged our representation in the Senate to 47 \nMembers, I thought the majority party would recognize that they had to \nwork with Republicans. With 47 Members, it was no longer possible under \nthe Senate rules for the majority party to shut Republicans out of the \nlegislative process and still expect to ram their agenda through. So I \nnaturally assumed the Senate would resume its usual tradition of \nbipartisan cooperation involving open debate and amendments from both \nsides--in other words, the way the Senate had historically functioned.\n  The majority leader didn't see it that way and continued to shut \nRepublicans out of the process. In fact, if he had allowed an open \ndebate and amendment process on many of the bills he sought to bring \nup, we could have gotten a lot more accomplished than we have. One week \nin June last year, we passed four controversial pieces of legislation \nbecause that process worked. It involved Republicans seeking things. \nBut most of the time that doesn't happen. Sure, it would have taken \nmore time under that amendment process and the deliberative process to \nconsider each bill than the majority leader might have preferred to be \ngiven to it. He and his caucus might also have had to vote on \nRepublican proposals instead of only legislation of his choosing. But \nis there anything wrong with a Republican offering an amendment now and \nthen,\n\n[[Page S7413]]\n\neven if that amendment loses? Some Republican amendments might have \nembarrassed Democrats by forcing them to vote on issues they would \nrather avoid. Is there anything wrong with voting on some tough issues \nfrom time to time? Some Republican amendments might have attracted \nenough Democratic votes to actually pass. Perhaps that is exactly what \nthe majority leader might want to avoid. He seems to want total control \nover the agenda. Majority Leader Reid has said as much in private. He \ntold Senator McCain flatout that ``the amendment days are over.'' How \ncan he say that?\n\n  There is a longstanding tradition here in the Senate that all voices \nbe heard and that amendments get full hearing regardless of the party \nof the sponsor. For example, tax and trade policies aren't exactly \nareas of natural agreement between the two parties. Despite that fact, \nwhen I was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I helped put \ntogether several bipartisan bills. I, a Republican, worked in \npartnership with Senator Baucus, a Democrat, to produce bipartisan \nbills that we could both live with. Even when we were starting with a \nbipartisan bill, Senator Baucus wanted to make sure his fellow \nDemocrats had a chance to offer amendments, and I respected that, and \nif he were chairman, he would have respected that for us Republicans. \nIt took a lot of time and effort, but that is what we have to do in the \nSenate if we actually want to get something done rather than simply \nblame the other side if we fail.\n  The Senate has been called the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld because it was specifically designed to proceed at a measured \npace and guarantee that the rights of the minority party are protected \nfrom what political philosophers called the ``tyranny of the \nmajority.''\n  In 1788, the father of the Constitution, James Madison, wrote in \nFederalist Paper No. 10:\n\n       Complaints are everywhere heard from our most considerate \n     and virtuous citizens, equally the friends of public and \n     private faith and of public and personal liberty, that our \n     governments are too unstable, that the public good is \n     disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties, and that \n     measures are too often decided not according to the rules of \n     justice and the rights of the minor party, but by the \n     superior force of an interested and overbearing majority.\n\n  In 1788 James Madison was warning us about the superior force of an \noverbearing majority, the reason the Senate was set up to make sure the \noverbearing majority of the other body, where the majority rules, \ndidn't do stupid things.\n  Those arguing for abolishing the filibuster sometimes talk about \nmajority rule as though this is some fundamental principle. On the \ncontrary, the aim of our Constitution is to protect the individual \nrights of all Americans, not the right of the majority to impose its \nwill on an unwilling minority. In fact, James Madison was very \nconcerned about what he called factions gathering together to impose \ntheir will on others. So I wish to quote again from Federalist No. 10. \nBefore I start that quote, let me say for the benefit of people that I \nthink when he used the word ``faction,'' for the most part he was \nspeaking about political parties.\n\n       If a faction consists of less than a majority, relief is \n     supplied by the Republican principle, which enables the \n     majority to defeat its sinister views by regular vote. It may \n     clog the administration, it may convulse the society; but it \n     will be unable to execute and mask its violence under the \n     forms of the Constitution.\n       When a majority is included in a faction, the form of \n     popular government, on the other hand, enables it to \n     sacrifice to its ruling passion or interest both the public \n     good and the rights of other citizens.\n       To secure the public good and private rights against the \n     dangers of such a faction, and at the same time preserve the \n     spirit and the form of popular government, is then the great \n     object to which our inquiries are directed.\n\n  That was a long quote, so let me say that in other words, Madison is \nsaying that an important goal of the U.S. Constitution is to protect \n``the public good and the private rights'' from a temporary majority \ntrying to impose its will on the minority. This is evidenced throughout \nthe Constitution. We call it checks and balances. We see it in the \nseparation of powers between the three branches of government, and we \nsee it in our system of federalism dividing power between States and \nthe Federal Government. It also helps explain our bicameral legislative \nbranch, and, of course, what I am talking about here is the unique \nstructure of the Senate.\n  In Federalist No. 62, also usually attributed to the father of the \nConstitution, James Madison, he explains:\n\n       The necessity of a Senate is not less indicated by the \n     propensity of all single and numerous assemblies to yield to \n     the impulse of sudden and violent passions, and to be seduced \n     by factious leaders into intemperate and pernicious \n     resolutions.\n       Examples of this subject might be cited without number; and \n     from proceedings within the United States, as well as from \n     the history of other nations.\n\n  Madison wrote that in 1788, but it is still applicable in 2012.\n  So kind of repeating, the purpose of the Senate is to save us from \n``the impulse of sudden and violent passions, and to be seduced by \nfactious leaders into intemperate and pernicious resolutions.''\n  There is a place for the passions of the moment in any republican \nform of government or any democratic society, and that place for the \npassions of the moment to be reflected is in our House of \nRepresentatives. But imagine if our only legislative body were the \nHouse of Representatives. Right now, that would mean Speaker Boehner \nwould control the entire legislative agenda, and the priorities of the \nHouse Republicans would be the only legislation that would have a \nchance of passing.\n  Then, once the Democrats gained control in some future election, \nRepublicans would have virtually no ability to have their views \nconsidered.\n  This is a teeter-totter approach to governing. This teeter-totter \nwould not lead to thoughtful legislation that protects individual \nrights and balances the views of all Americans.\n  You will also note that Madison references examples from proceedings \nwithin the United States at that particular time. Many State \nlegislatures in the early days of our Republic were unicameral, with \nfrequent elections and also with weak executives. This led to many \ninstances where a temporary majority faction would gain control and \nquickly pass legislation that advantaged the majority at the expense of \nthe minority.\n  It is also the case that the Congress, under the Articles of \nConfederation, was unicameral, which caused a lot of instability as \ndescribed, again, by Madison in Federalist 62:\n\n       Every new election in the States is found to change one-\n     half of the representatives.\n       From this change of men must proceed a change of opinions; \n     and from a change of opinions, a change of measures.\n       But a continual change even of good measures is \n     inconsistent with every rule of prudence and every prospect \n     of success.\n       The remark is verified in private life, and becomes more \n     just, as well as more important, in national transactions.\n\n  The staggering of the terms of Senators was partly done to provide \nstability, preventing temporary majorities from acting hastily and \ntrampling on the rights of the minority.\n  Only one-third of the Senators are up for reelection every 2 years, \nunlike the House of Representatives, where all Members are up for \nreelection every 2 years. Because only one-third of the Senators are up \nfor reelection at once, it is less likely that one party can sweep the \nelection and gain control of the entire legislative branch of \ngovernment in one election. Here we see how the Senate was specifically \ndesigned to prevent the tyranny of the majority.\n  In Federalist Paper 66, Madison, the father of the Constitution, \ncontinues his explanation of the unique role of the Senate--the unique \nrole of the Senate--\n\n     . . . there are particular moments in public affairs when the \n     people, stimulated by some irregular passion, or some illicit \n     advantage, or misled by the artful misrepresentations of \n     interested men, may call for measures which they themselves \n     will afterwards be the most ready to lament and condemn.\n       In these critical moments, how salutary will be the \n     interference of some temperate and respectable body of \n     citizens, in order to check the misguided career, and to \n     suspend the blow meditated by the people against themselves, \n     until reason, justice, and truth can regain their authority \n     over the public mind?\n\n  Now, I want you to contrast--with these quotes from Madison--the role \nthe father of our Constitution says the Senate is intended to play to \nthe present debate going on in the Senate that the rules ought to be \nchanged and the majority leader's vision for how a newly altered Senate \nwould operate.\n\n[[Page S7414]]\n\n  One faction, the Democratic Party, would be able to ram through \nmassive pieces of legislation with little or no input from duly elected \nSenators who happen to be from another political party. And what if \nRepublicans are not happy with being shut out of the legislative \nprocess at every stage? Well, the majority leader explained to one \nfreshman Republican Senator: ``You can always vote against the bill.''\n  Not only does this take-it-or-leave-it approach effectively \ndisenfranchise all those Americans who elected Senators from the \nminority party to represent their views, it also leads to poorly \nthought out legislation. Since the proposed changes to the Senate rules \nwould make the body more like the House of Representatives, let's take \nanother look at how that Chamber operates.\n  Although the House is designed to reflect the will of the current \nmajority, the trend toward the majority party shutting out the minority \nparty in that body has increased over time. Some people trace this \ntrend to the last decade of the 19th century when the Speaker of the \nHouse was a man named Thomas Brackett Reed.\n  Then-Speaker Reed strengthened the power of the Speaker of the House \nof Representatives and sought to diminish the rights of the minority \nparty. He once used his position to unilaterally change the \ninterpretation of the quorum rule to prevent Members of the minority \nparty from blocking a measure by refusing to vote in a quorum call. \nThis incident was called the ``Battle of the Reed Rules.''\n  Then-Speaker Reed famously said: ``The best system is to have one \nparty govern and the other party watch.'' This attitude earned that \nSpeaker of the House, whose name was Reed--they called him Czar Reed.\n  Do we really want another ``Battle of the Reed Rules'' like we had \nover a century ago in the House of Representatives? Wouldn't that be \ngoing backwards?\n  Ironically, the House of Representatives under Speaker Boehner has \nactually allowed more opportunity for the minority party to affect \nlegislation than the current Senate majority leader. Senate Minority \nLeader McConnell has cited data from the Congressional Research Service \nshowing that the Democrat minority party in the House has had 214 \noccasions to affect legislation this year compared to only 67 for the \nRepublican minority in the Senate.\n  When the House of Representatives allows for more input from the \nminority party than the Senate, which is supposed to be the \ndeliberative body, it seems to me something is very wrong.\n  It is true that the cloture rule and the various different procedures \nthat are called filibusters are not found in the Constitution. But \nchanges to the Senate rules that some in the Democratic caucus are \nproposing would fundamentally transform the character of the Senate in \na way that the Founders never intended and best expressed by James \nMadison.\n  The proposed gutting of the Senate's historic rules and traditions \nthreatens to replace the principle of the rights of the minority, so \nimportant to James Madison and our other Founders, with a new principle \nthat the might of the majority makes right. The fact that the majority \nleader is contemplating doing so on a partisan basis by ignoring \nexisting Senate rules is outrageous. Can you imagine ignoring the rules \nto change the rules?\n  I know this unprecedented power grab makes even Democratic Senators \nuneasy. Other Democrats who find this proposal tempting and who have \nnot yet served in the minority will find they have a rude awakening \nonce they have to live under the new regime they might help create.\n  To all my colleagues who might be inclined to support this \nfundamental transformation of the Senate, I will repeat once more \nMadison's warning about temporary majorities in the heat of passion \nenacting legislation: `` . . . measures which they themselves will \nafterwards be the most ready to lament and condemn.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/05/senate-section/article/S7414-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7414-S7420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE FARM BILL\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I am here today to talk about the \nneed for action on a 5-year farm bill for our farmers and our rural \ncommunities. The Senator from Iowa, who just spoke, understands how \nimportant this farm bill is. I know the Acting President pro tempore, \nfrom the State of New York, understands how important this farm bill \nis.\n  This summer, farmers in the Corn Belt of our country waited, \nsometimes in vain, for rain that could either make or break an entire \nyear of work. Many of them lost their entire crop.\n  This fall, sugar beet farmers along the Red River Valley in Minnesota \nand North Dakota waited for dry weather because they needed that to \npull out the last of their crop. And right now, at this very moment, \nfarmers, ranchers, and rural communities throughout the country \ncontinue to wait. But this time they are not waiting for weather. They \nare not recovering from weather. They are waiting for a new farm bill. \nIn fact, they have waited 167 days since the Senate passed the \nbipartisan farm bill this June, and they have waited 66 days since the \n2008 farm bill expired in September.\n  Unlike the drought this summer and the hurricane that hit the State \nof the Acting President pro tempore this fall, the failure to complete \na farm bill is entirely preventable. Inaction in the House of \nRepresentatives is hurting farmers right now. Without a new farm bill, \ndairy farmers have lost their safety net. In fact, prices may go to the \n1939 levels. Talk about moving backward; that is what will happen if we \ndo not get this farm bill done.\n  Livestock producers operate without key disaster programs without \nthis farm bill, and farmers and rural communities are left guessing \nabout what rules they will operate under as they plan next year's crop.\n  These are not small things. What kind of crop insurance are they \ngoing to be qualified for? Is there going to be some kind of safety \nnet? They have absolutely no idea because we wait and we wait and we \nwait for the House of Representatives to act. They did pass a farm bill \nthrough their committee. I liked ours better, but they got it through \nthe committee. But guess what. They have not been able to bring it to \nthe floor for a vote, and our farmers and our ranchers and our people \nin our rural communities wait, and they wait, and they wait.\n  I believe there are good reasons we can finish the farm bill this \nyear. There is already a path forward to complete work on a farm bill \nand have it signed by the President at the end of this year. The farm \nbill passed in the Senate, as we all know. It passed with strong \nbipartisan support. It was approved by a vote of 64 to 35. Thanks to \nChairman Stabenow's leadership and the leadership of Ranking Member \nRoberts, we were able to get this bill through. We voted on nearly 80 \namendments. We did our job in the Senate.\n  The Senate farm bill saves money. It would reduce the deficit by $23 \nbillion over the next 10 years. That is a savings over the last farm \nbill. The Senate farm bill also makes major reforms, such as \neliminating direct payments and further focusing farm payments on our \nfamily farmers.\n  It extends disaster programs for livestock producers and it continues \ncredit provisions to help our farmers get through tough times. It \ncreates a public-private partnership to fund agricultural research to \ngive farmers the tools they need to stay competitive and feed a growing \nworld.\n  When Bill Gates comes and talks to me about the farm bill, you know \nthis farm bill is more than just about some farmers in Minnesota. It is \nabout feeding our country, it is about feeding the world, it is about \nthe research we need to do to make sure we have the most efficient \ncrops; that we are developing crops and we are developing livestock and \nvarieties of crops and farm products that can feed the world.\n  This farm bill works to eliminate fraud and waste throughout the farm \nbill to ensure these programs are efficient and targeted. Passing this \nfarm bill is important, and that is why 235 agriculture, conservation, \nresearch, and energy organizations signed a letter this November to \nleadership in the House urging that they pass a farm bill before the \nend of the year.\n  Our farmers and agricultural communities understand that tough \nbudgetary choices need to be made. That is why the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee actually came forward and said: OK, we\n\n[[Page S7415]]\n\nare going to find a way to do this very differently. We are going to \neliminate direct payments, and we are going to strengthen our crop \ninsurance. We are going to still make sure we maintain our nutrition \nprograms--something for which the Acting President pro tempore fought \nso hard as a Senator from New York--and we also made sure there were \nincredibly strong conservation programs in the bill, but we still found \na way to cut $23 billion.\n  I am also opposed to playing red light-green light with agriculture \npolicy which prevents our farmers and ranchers from making long-term \ncapital investments that help them remain competitive in today's \nmarketplace.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. It might be easy to forget as we sit in this Chamber \nall that goes into growing the most abundant, safest food supply in the \nworld. But when I travel across our State, I am impressed by the work \nand planning that goes into making each farm and ranch operate in the \nface of market failures, in the face of natural disasters, in the face \nof volatile weather. Well, guess what. This is the time when that \nplanning goes on. It goes on right now.\n  Anyone who learned in kindergarten about how we plant crops and how \nwe get things done knows that the fall and winter is the time when you \nplan ahead, and then you plant your crops, then you move ahead, and \nthen pretty soon you are harvesting them. Well, they need to know what \nthe rules of the game are to get this done.\n  Each year family farmers make tough decisions about which crops to \nplant, what equipment to purchase, and when to market their crops. \nCongress should be no less committed to completing work on the farm \nbill, which provides the safety net and certainty for farmers, for \nranchers, for rural communities. The stakes are high for Minnesota. \nAgriculture is our State's leading export, accounting for $75 billion \nin economic activity every year and supporting more than 300,000 jobs.\n  Minnesota is No. 3 in the country for hogs and soybeans. It is also \nhome to pork processors and biodiesel plants. Minnesota is No. 4 in \ncorn, and it is also home to 21 ethanol plants that produce over 1 \nbillion gallons of ethanol every single year. We are No. 1 for sugar \nbeets, we are No. 1 for sweet corn.\n  But as we all know, this is not just an issue in our State. Our \nNation's farms and ranches are responsible for a $42 billion trade \nsurplus. This is one of the jewels of our economy and our country. We \nactually are making things, producing things, and exporting to the \nworld. Why would we want to pull the rug from underneath one of our \nmost promising and successful exporting industries in this country? And \nthat is the business of farming.\n  This is so promising. We are already doing well. We can even do \nbetter. With the critical role farming plays in our country's economy, \nthere is no excuse to further delay the consideration of the farm bill. \nAgriculture is a bright spot in our economy. We cannot jeopardize the \neconomic future of rural America and of our entire country just to \nscore political points over in the House.\n  I continue to believe that the carefully crafted bill we did in the \nSenate finds a good balance between a number of priorities. I urge the \nHouse of Representatives to complete work, to work with the Senate, so \nwe can make sure as we come to the year end we have a major deal which \nwe must have on the fiscal cliff, that we also include the farm bill, \nbecause with the farm bill we save $23 billion over what we have been \nspending in the last few years. So let's get to work and get this done.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            The Fiscal Cliff\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, we all recognize the country faces many \nchallenges. Too many of our neighbors are still looking for work, and \ntoo often those with a job have not seen a raise in quite some time. \nIndeed, for many years people in Rhode Island and across the country \nhave a growing sense that there is too much focus on the powerful few \nand not on the average family playing by the rules.\n  A quality higher education seems more unaffordable each year. Working \nmen and women do not often feel the government understands their \nstruggles and the need to move the country forward. They also want us \nto begin to balance the books, just as we did under President Clinton, \nwith a sensible balanced approach, one that led to increasing wages \nacross the board, increasing productivity, increasing employment, and a \nbudget surplus before George W. Bush's policies took over.\n  Last year we took a step in balancing the books. We cut $1 trillion \nof Federal spending. We do not hear much about it, particularly from \nthe other side of the aisle. But what it means is that every \ndiscretionary program will see less funding for the next decade, which \nwill have a huge impact on my State and every State in the country.\n  If we are going to cut spending on education, research, and \ntransportation to the tune of approximately $1 trillion, I think most \nAmericans recognize that the other side of the equation has to be \nconsidered. Revenue needs to be part of a balanced plan to reduce the \ndebt. The simple fact of the matter is that virtually every expert \npanel and commentator has said clearly that in order to reduce the \ndeficit to a sustainable level, revenues have to go up. It is a matter \nof arithmetic. So the question that presents itself to us is, where \ndoes the revenue come from? I believe at the end of the day, the \nPresident's plan to continue to provide tax breaks for 98 percent of \nall Americans and let tax rates for the wealthiest return to the \nClinton-era levels is about as fair a proposal as is possible at the \nmoment. First, it recognizes that the middle class should not be the \none on the chopping block where there are other options. Second, it \nasks those making more than a quarter of a million dollars to return to \nthe same top rates we had for most of the 1990s. Third, it cuts \neveryone's taxes on the first quarter of a million dollars that you \nmake.\n  What is sometimes lost in this debate is because of our progressive \ntax system, there will be no changes to the tax rates on income up to \n$250,000. The benefits of those tax cuts which were enacted in the \nearly decades of the 2000s will still be there for 98 percent of \nAmericans, and they will still be there for those paying additional \nrevenue because of the reversal of the top two upper income tax rates. \nYet our Republican colleagues in the House seem to have adopted a \nposture of obstruction and holding the middle class hostage in order to \npreserve nearly $1 trillion in tax cuts for the top 2 percent of \nAmericans. If we do not extend these tax cuts for the middle class as \nthe President has proposed, the typical Rhode Island family of four \ncould see their taxes raised by an average of $2,200 in the year 2013. \nThis would be a setback for our very fragile economic recovery. It is \nsimply not fair to have these middle-income Rhode Islanders who are \ntrying to make ends meet in this economy be further subject to a tax \nincrease.\n  I think I listen pretty well to my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle. It seems they agree that, yes, these taxes should not go up \non 98 percent of Americans. Indeed, in July they dropped their \nfilibuster, enabling the Senate to pass the Middle Class Tax Cut Act. \nThe bill prevents taxes from going up on 98 percent of Americans and 97 \npercent of small businesses, and would cut the deficit by nearly $1 \ntrillion.\n  As I mentioned, if the House does not pass this bill, middle-class \nfamilies will see their taxes go up by an average of about $2,200. All \nthe House has to do--and they can do it very quickly under their \nprocedures--is take up the Senate-passed bill and pass it. We will put \na significant downpayment on deficit reduction. We will provide \ncertainty to 98 percent of Americans that their taxes will remain the \nsame, and we can get onto other sensible appropriate reductions and \nexpenditures and move the Nation forward.\n  It is heartening to hear some Republicans in the House such as Tom \nCole of Oklahoma and Mike Simpson of Idaho talk about accepting this \ncommonsense approach and locking in these tax rates for middle-income\n\n[[Page S7416]]\n\nAmericans. Indeed, if the House, as I suggested, had an up-or-down vote \non the Senate bill, I would suspect there would be enough Republicans \nwilling to join the House Democrats in passing a tax cut for 98 percent \nof Americans and giving the business community the certainty it needs. \nUnfortunately, we have yet to see an indication from Speaker Boehner \nthat he will let the Senate approved middle-class tax cut legislation \nhave an up-or-down vote--despite the fact that by passing this bill \nevery American, including the wealthiest, will get a tax break on the \nfirst quarter of a million dollars of income, and the Tax Code would \nbecome a bit fairer.\n  I am worried that there are too many on the other side of the aisle \nwho are willing to let taxes increase on the middle class in order to \nstop the top two marginal tax rates from returning to Clinton-era \nlevels for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. That, to me, is \nunfair. Indeed, it is an uncalled-for imposition on the vast majority \nof Americans.\n  Republicans would jeopardize our economic recovery by creating \nuncertainty around letting these tax provisions lapse for all \nAmericans. It could hamper demand, restrict commerce, and impede \nrecovery at a time when our economy is making fragile gains. Indeed, it \nwould be similar to what we are seeing in other parts of the world, \nwhere austerity measures in Europe have already caused many of their \neconomies to slip back into recession.\n  We can't do that. We have got to provide both confidence and the \nresources for consumers to go into the marketplace and continue to \nstrengthen our recovery. And I would hope to accelerate this recovery \nbecause we need more demand, more jobs, more activity, not less.\n  Unfortunately, the record of some of our colleagues on the other side \nhas suggested that when it comes to making difficult decisions on \nbehalf of the majority of Americans they balk. I have seen in this \nCongress--the other side threaten a government shutdown and the other \nside seriously consider defaulting on the debts of the United States. I \nhave seen threats to end unemployment insurance, which would harm our \neconomy and tremendously disadvantage so many Americans who are looking \nfor work. I am hopeful the House of Representatives can respond both \nthoughtfully and decisively by passing the legislation the Senate has \nalready passed and continue the tax cuts for middle-income Americans \nwhile beginning to raise revenues from those who are the wealthiest \namongst us.\n  In the spring of 2011, we were faced with the possibility of a \ngovernment shutdown. In the summer of that same year, we were faced \nwith the issue of the debt ceiling and government default. All of these \nattempts to disrupt and undercut the process of government had costs, \nreal costs to our economy, real costs to our sense and the sense of the \nAmerican people that we are effectively able to manage their affairs, \nfor the welfare not of the very few but for all Americans.\n  Republicans have also blocked the American Jobs Act. A plan that \nanalysts predicted would lead to the creation of nearly 2 million \njobs--and at a time when those new jobs were and still urgently needed. \nNow with the accumulation of all these different threats to our \neconomy, all these different dramatic moments, we are looking at \nautomatic increases in taxes if the Middle Class Tax Cut Act is not \nadopted. Failure to pass the bill could severely impede or even reverse \nthe economic recovery we have seen to date. And again, this economic \nrecovery is not as strong as we want to see it, but it is heading at \nleast in a positive direction.\n  We have to move forward decisively, with a balanced approach to \nensure that the vast majority of Americans do not see their taxes go \nup. And that revenue is raised from those who are most able to afford \nit.\n  The President has been very clear that he will be strong in resisting \novertures to extend the tax benefits for the wealthiest two percent of \nAmericans. The American people agree. They re-elected him and they \nconsistently, in just about every type of public survey, support his \nproposal.\n  Unfortunately, the Republican leadership in the House of \nRepresentatives are out of step and out of tune with the American \npublic.\n  Speaker Boehner has not proposed a sensible, balanced approach that \nmixes revenues and expenditure reductions. Instead, he once again \nraises the spectre of cuts to Medicare and Social Security benefits. \nThat is not the approach we have to take.\n  What we can do, what we should do, what we must do is simply ask the \nHouse of Representatives to take up what we have already passed here in \nthe Senate, the Middle Class Tax Cut Act, immediately. That would \nprovide the breakthrough we need to go forward, to continue to build on \nour economic recovery, and continue to respond to the legitimate needs \nof men and women all across this country. I hope House Republicans do \nthat. I know I will be here, along with my colleagues, urging them to \ndo that as quickly as possible.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the remaining time \nunder Democratic control be allocated as follows: Senator Boxer for 15 \nminutes, Senator Casey for 10 minutes, and Senator Schumer for 5 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I think we are trying to make the case \nhere today that there is a very easy way for us to climb down from this \nfiscal cliff. The Senate already passed a bill that would extend tax \ncuts to 98 percent of the American people and the House will not take \nit up. This will mean, over 10 years, about $1 trillion in savings, and \nit won't hurt the millionaires and billionaires. They have told us that \nover and over.\n  This is when the Senate passed the middle-class tax cuts, July 25, \n2012. The Republicans over in the House have been sitting on it. They \ndidn't do anything in July, August, September, October, November, and \nDecember. Here we are 6 months later and they refuse to allow a vote on \nthis for reasons that go to their internal disputes.\n  It is time for them to put country over party. It is time for them to \nput country over their ideological battles. That was a mouthful. I am \ngoing to try it again. It is time for them to put country over their \nideological battles. It is time for them to make a decision that favors \nthe American people.\n  I served in the House for 10 proud years. It was wonderful, \nfascinating, interesting. I served there when Tip O'Neill was the \nSpeaker of the House. Tip O'Neill understood the magic of 218.\n  What do I mean by that? The magic of 218 was finding 218 votes to get \nsomething done. Tip didn't care if he got it from a liberal, from a \nconservative, from a moderate, from an independent, from a whacko. It \ndidn't matter. He didn't care who you were, what you were, if you \nthought you were great or bright or not. He had to put together 218 for \nthe good of the country, and he did it when Ronald Reagan was \nPresident. He did it when there was a President who had different views \nfrom his own, and they worked together for the good of the country.\n  I look over at the House, and I don't know what I see. There are a \nfew brave voices there speaking out and saying let us do this, let us \nextend the middle-class tax cuts. But let me tell you, we have 27 days \nleft to do this before people start facing higher taxes. On average, it \nis $2,200 a family, and that is a lot of money for a middle-class \nfamily.\n  I want to be completely honest here and bring up an issue, which is \nthat I never voted for the Bush-era tax cuts--I was one of the few in \nthe minority--because I worried that it would destroy our fiscal \nresponsibility. I hate to say it now: I was right. I was right.\n  There were surpluses that Bill Clinton left us. But because George W. \nBush went in front of the microphone and said, I have political \ncapital, I am going to cut everybody's taxes, he then put two wars on \nthe credit card, and that was the end of surpluses. We went into \ndeficits, deficits as far as the eye could see, deeper and deeper in \ndebt. So you might ask then, Senator Boxer, why are you now supporting \nthose tax cuts being renewed for 98 percent of the people? The answer \nis it is a different time and a different place. We are getting out of \na recession. We can make\n\n[[Page S7417]]\n\nup the monies we need to balance this budget by going just to the top \nrate, going to the people over $250,000.\n  Remember, this plan that we passed in July gives a tax break on the \nfirst $250,000 of income, in essence giving everybody a break on that \nfirst $250,000. It is only after that that the taxes go back to the \nClinton era. Because this is a different time and place, I support \ngiving a tax break, continuing it, for 98 percent, but asking the \nwealthiest to pay their fair share for the greatest country on the face \nof this Earth.\n  My father was born into dire poverty. He was the only one of nine \nchildren born in America. He was the only one of nine children to go to \ncollege at night in your great State, City College, at night, while he \nsupported a family by day. He became a CPA. After he got his \nbachelor's, he went at night to a place called Brooklyn Law School, \nwhere he got his law degree in 5 years. I was about 10. This is \nAmerica. He was able to do that.\n  When he was a CPA, he would oversee everybody's taxes in the family. \nI was a kid and I got my first job working for a long time when I was a \ntelephone operator for Hilton Hotels one summer. I will never forget \nit. I was not good at it. I kept putting those wires into the wrong \nplaces, but I managed to get through. When I got my first paycheck, I \nwent to my dad, as I was earning minimum wage--I think it was 75 cents \nan hour, I don't know. I know I am dating myself here. It is okay. I \nsaid, ``Dad, why is it I have to pay a whole bunch of money somewhere \nelse, to the government?'' He said, ``Well, we all, when we earn money, \npay taxes. If at the end of the year we pay too much, we get a \nrefund.''\n  But he said, ``Honey, I want to tell you something. You are so \nfortunate and blessed to be a citizen of the United States of America. \nI know people will laugh at you when you say this, but people who live \nhere, who work here and have the privilege of that freedom and the \nprivilege to grab the dream, they should kiss the ground of this \ncountry every time they pay taxes.''\n  I once said that on the campaign trail, and I got booed. They said, \nShe is telling us to kiss the ground of America when we pay taxes? That \nwas how my father felt.\n  Clearly, he also believed in a progressive tax system. He was a smart \nman, and he believed that those at the bottom end shouldn't pay \nanything at all and, as you go up, you pay a little more.\n  That is what President Obama ran on. We had a huge election for the \nSenate where the Democrats picked up seats. A race for the Presidency \nthat was supposed to be Governor Romney's, according to his people, was \nPresident Obama's. This was mainly because President Obama stood up for \nthe middle class and said, When it comes to taxes, we all have to pay \nour fair share, no more, no less.\n  When you tell your friends the President wants to give a tax cut, \ntell them also it is being held up by the Republicans in Congress who \nare sitting on a bill that passed the Senate on July 25, 2012, where 98 \npercent of the American people will get their tax break continued and \nonly income over $250,000 will be taxed at the same rate when Bill \nClinton was President.\n  Let's take a look back at those days. Were they harsh for people? No. \nWe had more millionaires created, I remember in those days, than we had \nin generations. You know why? Because the middle class is strong--and \nPresident Clinton invested in the middle class; he invested in our \npeople--they get good jobs, they pay enough taxes, they go to the mall, \nthey take a trip across the country to see all the great landmarks, and \npeople across this country who have businesses do well also. That is \nwhy we see so many businesspeople, including small businesspeople, \nstanding at President Obama's side saying it is good for business to \ngive the middle class their tax breaks.\n  What are these Republicans thinking over there? If we are having an \nargument, and I tell you I will give you 98 percent of what you want \nand you walk away from me, I say you are unreasonable. Who gets 98 \npercent of what they want? No one. In an argument, usually we meet each \nother halfway--50-50. We are giving the Republicans 98 percent of what \nthey want on the tax cuts, but they are holding the 98 percent hostage \nfor their friends, the Koch brothers, Sheldon Adelson--the \nbillionaires. That is wrong, and we had an election about it.\n  This is a country of, by, and for the people, not of, by, and for the \nbillionaires. I am going to say to my Republican friends--and they are \nmy friends; I have served with them for a long time, I have worked with \nthem--what are you thinking? What are you doing?\n  Let me talk about one of the things they offered in their package. \nThis is outrageous. They want to raise the eligibility age of Medicare \nby 2 years. I cannot tell you how many people come up to me--and it \nshocks me when I hear it--and say: I am praying for my 65th birthday so \nI can get on Medicare because I have no insurance. There is a huge \nnumber of people uninsured between the ages of 55 and 65. So this is \ntheir Christmas present? This is the happy holiday gift from Speaker \nBoehner?\n  In the Speaker's tax package, not only is he giving the tax break to \nthe wealthiest, he is even cutting their taxes further but paying for \nit by raising the Medicare age. What does that do? It is surprising \njust how bad it is. When we raise the age of Medicare from 65 to 67, \nipso facto, 300,000 senior citizens go uninsured. Merry Christmas to \nall. It would increase the cost to businesses by $4.5 billion because \nthey have to keep people on their plans. Merry Christmas to you, too, \nbusinesspeople. It will increase the out-of-pocket costs for those \nbetween 65 and 66 by $3.7 billion. It would increase costs to the \nStates by $700 million, and millions--millions--would pay an average of \n$2,200 more for their health care.\n  I will use every tool at my disposal to prevent the destruction of \nMedicare. What kind of counterproposal is that? It takes my breath away \nthe pain that would be felt if this went through. I can't help \nremembering--and I am sure the Chair remembers as well--the attack \nleveled by Representative Paul Ryan, who was the Republican nominee for \nVice President--he is chairman of the House Budget Committee--against \nPresident Obama for ``cutting'' $700 billion out of Medicare, when, in \nfact, the President got savings from people who were cheaters--the \nproviders who were ripping off Medicare--and then put it back into \nMedicare and extended the life of the program by 8 years.\n  These are the same people who ran ads against Democrats--maybe they \ndid it to the Chair as well, I don't know--all across the country \nsaying Democrats voted to cut Medicare. These same people who were \ncrying these bitter tears are now suggesting destroying Medicare as we \nknow it. I can't believe it. I truly can't believe it. I wonder whom \nthey fight for? That is the basic question. Why are they here? Whom do \nthey fight for? Do they fight for the middle class? I believe we do on \nour side of the aisle. I believe President Obama does.\n  I believe, if we look at the tax package that came over from Speaker \nBoehner and all the cuts to Medicare--and by the way, the Presiding \nOfficer is a leader in protecting children--we will see there are cuts \nto child nutrition in there, major cuts. I have to say: Why do they \nhave to cut food to poor kids? Why do they have to kick people out of \nMedicare? Their answer is, if they were honest, to protect the \nbillionaires and the millionaires. Because that is what it is about. We \nknow it. It is a fact in evidence.\n  I believe we owe more to the American people. We need to find a way \nback to the fiscal responsibility and the economic growth we had when \nBill Clinton was President. I have served with five Presidents \nalready--it is amazing--in my time in this Congress, and I have seen \npeople come together in moments of crisis, such as when Social Security \nneeded to be strengthened, when Medicare needed to be strengthened, \nwhen we had deficits as far as the eye could see and we had to resolve \nthat. I have seen all that happen. We have 27 days left to see \nsomething good happen about this fiscal cliff.\n  When people say, oh, it is very complicated, don't believe it. Don't \nbelieve it. It is not complicated. There are several parts to this \nfiscal cliff. The biggest one is the Bush-era tax cuts that are \nexpiring on 100 percent of the people, and if they expire, it means \npeople will have to pay more in taxes at a time when we don't want them \nto have\n\n[[Page S7418]]\n\nto struggle. We want them to have disposable income because it is good \nfor their families, it is good for the economy, it is good for \nbusiness, and it is good for economic growth. The Bush-era tax cuts are \nexpiring on December 31. Why don't we find the common ground, get rid \nof that issue, get those tax cuts to 98 percent of the middle class who \nneed them and fight about the millionaires and the billionaires later? \nThey are OK. They are fine.\n\n  We need to do that simple step. The House must pass the Senate's bill \nwhich we passed on July 25. We did it. It is done. We don't have to \nworry about it. We did our job over here. We got the votes. So the \nHouse needs to pick it up and pass it over there.\n  I understand that Democratic Leader Pelosi has done something very \ninteresting. She has taken this bill, the same exact bill, and put it \nat the desk in the House and started what they call a discharge \npetition. What that means is, since Speaker Boehner will not bring up \nthis bill, if 218 people sign the discharge petition, there will be an \nimmediate vote on the floor. I wish to urge Republicans and Democrats \nand Independents over in the House to sign the discharge petition to \nhave a vote. We have a few days left until the end of the year--27--to \nget this done.\n  Then we can talk about the automatic spending cuts, and there are \nways to stop those. People are upset about those. Personally, I think \nwe have to make spending cuts, but I think we can soften the blow of \nthose spending cuts by bringing home the money from the wars in Iraq \nand Afghanistan to this country. That would soften the blow of those \ncuts. We also need to be making some more investments in \ninfrastructure, which we desperately need after superstorm Sandy hit \nNew York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, and Maryland. We now see \nour infrastructure has to be what we call hardened, made stronger. We \ncan do that if we invest in our people.\n  The President has offered a very clear plan that is fair that takes \nus off the fiscal cliff. We have 27 days to do the right thing. The \nSenate already passed the tax cuts for 98 percent of the people. All we \nare asking is for the House to do that, to match us, and then we can \nget back to the table and figure out a way to soften the blow of the \nautomatic spending cuts. We can look at tax reform.\n  Let me just say this about tax reform. When our colleagues complain \nabout tax rates and say: We would rather close loopholes, watch out. In \norder to raise the kind of funds needed to lower this deficit, we would \nbe looking at the two of the biggest ``deductions.'' One is for your \nmortgage and one is for charitable contributions. I would ask \nrhetorically: What billionaire do you know who has a mortgage? I don't, \nfrankly, know any. They own their own homes. They are not hurt by that. \nBut who does get hurt? The middle class.\n  So let's do the right thing. We passed the right thing on July 25, \n2012. We have 27 days left before taxes on the middle class go up. I \nknow we have the wherewithal to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to talk about where we are with \nregard to the end of the year and especially where we are with regard \nto the focus we should bring to bear on middle-income families. We have \nhad a lot of discussion in the last couple weeks, using terms such as \n``fiscal cliff'' and terms that involve tax policy. All that is \nimportant to debate, but sometimes what is lost in the midst of all \nthat is what is happening to middle-income families.\n  The sense I have, in talking to a lot of those families in \nPennsylvania, is they have been asking their representatives in \nWashington to do at least two things: No. 1 is to try to work together \nto get agreements, not just in the near term but over a long period of \ntime; and No. 2--and not in second place, because they are as fervent \nabout this as they are about No. 1--they ask me all the time to do \nsomething to create jobs at a faster pace, to put in place strategies \nthat will lead to job creation that is more accelerated.\n  The good news is we have had some progress. If we look at the numbers \nfor August, September, and October, it is right around 511,000 jobs \ncreated. That is good news and it is good progress. It is a lot better \nthan where we were in the spring. If memory serves me, in the time \nperiod of April, May, and June, we had only created about 200,000. So \nthis 3-month period with more than half a million jobs created is \nprogress.\n  But we have a long way to go, and we need to move the job-creation \npace or the pace has to be accelerated. We have in the midst of all \nthat a good bit of uncertainty. Middle-income families look at \nWashington and don't see enough progress on jobs, they don't see folks \ncoming together yet. I think we will, but until they see that, until \nthey have a sense there is something substantial that is decided that \naffects their lives, they are going to be very uncertain. I hear this \nfrom taxpayers. I also hear a lot about uncertainty from small business \nowners.\n  At the same time, the House has something they can do about it right \nnow. On July 24 we passed in the Senate a tax cut for middle-income \nfamilies, meaning we would continue tax rates for those families. That \nkind of certainty is badly needed right now. So one of the best things \nthat could happen right now is the House could vote and then the \nPresident would sign into law legislation that would provide certainty \nfor middle-income families--98 percent of American families and some 97 \npercent of small businesses. So it is time for the House to act.\n  Secondly, we have to take steps to make sure we are creating jobs at \na faster pace. As I mentioned before, I am introducing legislation \ntoday to help middle-class families and to boost hiring. The bill is \ncalled the Middle-Class and Small Business Tax Cut Act, and it would \nexpand the payroll tax cut from last year for 1 year and give employers \na tax credit for hiring.\n  The payroll tax cut we put into place last year had a number of \nbenefits. I won't go through all those today, but the Joint Economic \nCommittee--the committee of which I am the chairman--put out a fact \nsheet in the last 24 hours that highlights some of the benefits of the \npayroll tax cut. I wish to highlight a few of those.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Joint \nEconomic Committee fact sheet on the payroll tax cut dated December 4, \n2012.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Fact Sheet: Payroll Tax Cut, Joint Economic Commitee, United States \n   Congress, Senator Robert P. Casey, Jr., Chairman, December 4, 2012\n\n\n The Payroll Tax Cut Supported the Economic Recovery, Created Jobs and \n            Bolstered the Social Security Trust Fund in 2012\n\n       Last winter, Congress took action to prevent a temporary \n     two-percentage-point reduction in payroll taxes from lapsing \n     at the end of 2011, extending the tax cut through the end of \n     2012. The payroll tax cut for 2012 increased take-home pay \n     for over 120 million American households, providing tangible \n     benefits as the economy continued to recover from the Great \n     Recession. The additional money in individuals' pockets \n     contributed to increased consumer spending in 2012, \n     supporting economic recovery and job growth. Including \n     October, the private sector has added jobs nationwide for 32 \n     consecutive months. Finally, the boost in employment due to \n     the payroll tax cut, coupled with transfers from the General \n     Fund, helped to fortify the balance of the Social Security \n     Trust Fund.\n     Benefits of the Payroll Tax Cut in 2012\n       122 million households received additional take-home pay. \n     Cutting payroll taxes immediately increased the income of \n     everyone who received a paycheck. By the end of 2012, the \n     two-percentage-point payroll tax cut will give an additional \n     $1,000 to the average American family.\n       The payroll tax cut boosted consumer spending. Additional \n     take-home pay allowed working families to make purchases that \n     supported economic growth and job creation. In the third \n     quarter of 2012, real consumer spending grew 2.0 percent at \n     an annual rate, following gains of 2.4 percent and 1.5 \n     percent in the first and second quarters.\n       Middle-class families are responsible for the bulk of \n     consumer spending. The most current data show that families \n     making under $150,000 are responsible for the vast majority \n     (81.9%) of consumer spending. Moreover, families earning less \n     than $70,000 per year are responsible for nearly half (44.8%) \n     of all consumer spending.\n       The payroll tax cut targets those most likely to spend it. \n     Compared with reducing the tax rates of the highest income \n     earners, cutting payroll taxes puts more money in the hands \n     of middle- and lower-income working families. Over half of \n     the benefits of the payroll tax cut went to households \n     earning less than $100,000 annually, and 85 percent of\n\n[[Page S7419]]\n\n     the benefits went to those making less than $200,000.\n       Economic growth and job gains were stronger in 2012 due to \n     the payroll tax cut. The two-percentage-point payroll tax cut \n     for 2012 boosted economic growth nationally by an estimated \n     one-half of a percentage point in 2012. The payroll tax cut \n     also saved or created an estimated 400,000 jobs.\n       The payroll tax cut bolstered the Social Security Trust \n     Fund. The annual OASDI Trustee's report for 2012 confirms \n     that the payroll tax cut has no negative effect on the \n     balance of the Social Security Trust Fund in the short or \n     long term. All reduced revenues are recovered through \n     transfers from the Treasury General Fund.\n       Furthermore, the additional jobs generated by the payroll \n     tax cut added to the Social Security Trust Fund's balance. \n     The JEC estimates that the boost in employment driven by the \n     payroll tax cut contributed at least $1 billion in additional \n     Social Security tax withholding and payments. This assumes a \n     majority of the jobs created or saved because of the payroll \n     tax cut, as during the recovery more generally, were in \n     occupations such as food services, retail and employment \n     services. The additional Trust Fund revenue could be much \n     larger--as much as $3 billion--if those jobs were in higher-\n     wage industries such as manufacturing or professional \n     services, or if the number of additional jobs was greater \n     than previously estimated.\n\nESTIMATED BENEFITS OF THE PAYROLL TAX CUT IN 2012 FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES,\n                                BY STATE\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     Median Household\n                                     Wage and Salary    Additional Take-\n               State                   Income (2011     Home Pay from 2%\n                                        Inflation-      Payroll Tax Cut\n                                    Adjusted Dollars)       in 2012\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUnited States.....................            $51,726             $1,035\nAlabama...........................            $45,821               $916\nAlaska............................            $66,185             $1,324\nArizona...........................            $47,348               $947\nArkansas..........................            $40,729               $815\nCalifornia........................            $58,243             $1,165\nColorado..........................            $54,985             $1,100\nConnecticut.......................            $69,240             $1,385\nDelaware..........................            $58,040             $1,161\nDistrict of Columbia..............            $71,277             $1,426\nFlorida...........................            $45,821               $916\nGeorgia...........................            $48,061               $961\nHawaii............................            $61,094             $1,222\nIdaho.............................            $40,933               $819\nIllinois..........................            $56,003             $1,120\nIndiana...........................            $48,061               $961\nIowa..............................            $49,894               $998\nKansas............................            $48,875               $978\nKentucky..........................            $44,802               $896\nLouisiana.........................            $45,821               $916\nMaine.............................            $45,821               $916\nMaryland..........................            $71,277             $1,426\nMassachusetts.....................            $68,018             $1,360\nMichigan..........................            $47,959               $959\nMinnesota.........................            $57,021             $1,140\nMississippi.......................            $39,711              $794'\nMissouri..........................            $46,839               $937\nMontana...........................            $42,257               $845\nNebraska..........................            $48,875               $978\nNevada............................            $48,875               $978\nNew Hampshire.....................            $64,149             $1,283\nNew Jersey........................            $71,277             $1,426\nNew Mexico........................            $42,766               $855\nNew York..........................            $60,076             $1,202\nNorth Carolina....................            $43,886               $878\nNorth Dakota......................            $47,348               $947\nOhio..............................            $48,875               $978\nOklahoma..........................            $43,784               $876\nOregon............................            $46,635               $933\nPennsylvania......................            $52,948             $1,059\nRhode Island......................            $57,021             $1,140\nSouth Carolina....................            $42,766               $855\nSouth Dakota......................            $46,839               $937\nTennessee.........................            $42,766               $855\nTexas.............................            $50,199             $1,004\nUtah..............................            $54,985             $1,100\nVermont...........................            $52,948             $1,059\nVirginia..........................            $63,131             $1,263\nWashington........................            $58,040             $1,161\nWest Virginia.....................            $42,766               $855\nWisconsin.........................            $50,912             $1,018\nWyoming...........................            $54,985             $1,100\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Joint Economic Committee Chairman's staff calculations using\n  data from the 2011 American Community Survey micro data files.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, just a couple of points when you look at \nthe economic impact on families when they have dollars to spend. The \npayroll tax cut puts $1,000 on average in the pockets of most families \nin America. Families making under $150,000 are responsible for almost \n82 percent of consumer spending. So the reason we are creating jobs \nwith the payroll tax cut or a tax credit--the idea I mentioned before--\nis because we are giving consumers, families, and small businesses the \nopportunity to create jobs because of economic activity.\n  I mentioned the job impact of the payroll tax cut. It created or \nsaved 400,000 jobs in the last year, and it didn't in any way harm the \nSocial Security trust fund. In fact, it enhanced our ability to have \nmore payroll revenue over time because of that job creation.\n  So I think we should do both--continue the payroll tax cut as well as \nhave a tax credit for businesses so that if they hire in year one \nversus a year after the year the credit is in place, that hiring can be \ngiven credit and they can be incentivized to hire more.\n  Tomorrow our Joint Economic Committee will be engaged in a hearing on \nfiscal cliff issues. We will discuss strategies to create jobs, and we \nwill discuss the implications of the fiscal cliff and what will happen \nif we don't get some work done by the House to pass the middle-income \ntax cut that was passed here in a bipartisan fashion. So we have a lot \nof work to do, but I think one thing we have to make sure we do is to \ncontinue to focus on middle-income families, their lives, their \nstruggles, and what we can do to make sure they have more dollars in \ntheir pockets to continue economic growth.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would like to thank my great colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania. I enjoyed sharing a table last night with him and \nhis beautiful, charming, intelligent wife, whom he would be the first \nto admit he is lucky to have married, and their four great girls. I \nalso thank him for his excellent on-target remarks. We have a great \nchairman of the JEC, and every time he comes to the floor it shows.\n  Senator Olympia Snowe, Bill Kristol of the Weekly Standard, \nCongressman Mike Simpson of Idaho, David Brooks, Congresswoman Bono \nMack, Congressman Walter Jones, and the National Review, we are here to \nsay that passing the Senate's middle-class tax cut is the right thing \nto do, but you don't need to take our word for it. Two thirds of the \nAmerican public agrees with us, but you don't need to take their word \nfor it either. Just listen to the voices within Speaker Boehner's own \nparty.\n  It is clear that Speaker Boehner needed cover from his right flank \nbefore he could agree to any deal on taxes with the President. The \nSpeaker didn't have it before, but he sure has it now. When the Wall \nStreet Journal editorial page says that decoupling would not go against \nconservatives' antitax principles, that gives a whole lot of cover to \nthe Speaker. When Grover Norquist refuses to declare whether decoupling \nwould violate his group's pledge, that, too, gives a whole lot of cover \nto the Speaker. And when more and more rank-and-file Republicans come \nout publicly every day in favor of passing the Senate bill, that, too, \ngives cover to the Speaker.\n  You really have to salute Congressman Tom Cole. He was the first one \non the other side to dare speak the truth about what should be done on \ntaxes, and he has been on TV almost every day making the case to his \nparty in public. The day after Congressman Cole went public, he was \ndismissed as having a minority opinion. Well, that is not true anymore. \nHis comments sparked a trend. In addition to those Republicans who have \nspoken out publicly, there are probably dozens of other Tom Coles in \nthe House who just don't feel free to speak their mind but agree with \nhim privately.\n  Just this morning, in an appearance on cable television, the junior \nSenator from Oklahoma, an unquestioned conservative, came out on higher \ntax rates on the wealthy. He said:\n\n       Personally, I know we have to raise revenue; I don't really \n     care which way we do it. Actually, I would rather see the \n     rates go up than do it the other way, because it gives us \n     greater chance to reform the tax code and broaden the base in \n     the future.\n\n  Well, if Senator Coburn does not provide conservative cover, I don't \nknow who does.\n  The House Republican leadership is like generals hunkered away in a \nbunker who don't realize their army has already laid down their arms. \nThe Republican leaders are in search of an exit strategy, while they \nhave one in the form of a discharge petition that has been filed in the \nHouse. It is an out for the Speaker. With the discharge petition, the \nSpeaker doesn't have to outright endorse the Senate bill; all he needs \nto do is tell his Members: Sign your conscience. If you believe in the \ndischarge petition, sign it, and there will be no recrimination against \nyou.\n  If Speaker Boehner does that, I am confident the discharge petition \nwill get 218 signatures and then we will get 218 votes on the floor. We \nmay not get a majority of the majority, but we will definitely get 218 \nvotes. So we may never win over the Paul Ryans in the other Chamber, \nbut they aren't necessary--they can vote no or they can even vote \npresent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that I be given 1 additional \nminute.\n\n[[Page S7420]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Put the bill on the floor, let rank-and-file Republicans \nvote their conscience, and this bill can pass.\n  In the New York Times today, it was reported that senior aides on the \nRepublican side are considering just such a strategy to give them a \nsoft landing on this tax debate--agree to the President's offer on the \ntax, the thinking goes, and live to fight another day on spending cuts.\n  We agree that a tax hike on middle-class Americans should be taken \noff the table. Once Republicans agree to higher rates on the wealthy, \nan agreement on the other sticking points of a grand bargain can \nquickly fall into place. So let's stop with the offers and the \ncounteroffers that are leaked only to manufacture headlines in the \npress. Let's get serious and cross the biggest item of our to-do list \noff and get the Senate tax cut bill passed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the next 45 \nminutes be devoted to a colloquy between myself and my colleagues on \nthis side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/05/senate-section/article/S7420-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7420-S7422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             STEM JOBS ACT\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this last week the House of \nRepresentatives passed a bipartisan piece of legislation called the \nSTEM Jobs Act. For those who are unfamiliar with the term STEM, it \nstands for science, technology, engineering, and math--the hard \nsciences programs that we have too few graduates from in our colleges \nand universities. This bill passed in the House of Representatives with \n245 votes and was originally sponsored by my friend and colleague Lamar \nSmith of Texas. It is very similar to a piece of legislation I myself \nintroduced earlier this year.\n  The goal of this legislation is one that I think enjoys broad \nbipartisan support, and that is to help the United States retain more \nof the highly skilled immigrants who come to study at our colleges and \nuniversities. In particular, this bill would make eligible for a green \ncard those who graduate from the STEM fields who get a master's degree \nor a Ph.D. We would not add to the net number of green cards that would \nbe eligible. There are 55,000 diversity lottery visa green cards that \nwould be substituted for by these STEM green cards.\n  We all know America's immigration system is broken. Unfortunately, it \ncauses self-inflicted wounds in many respects, but particularly by \ndriving away highly skilled foreign workers who want to start \nbusinesses and create jobs right here in America. This is not about \nhiring foreign workers to perform jobs where we have qualified \nAmericans waiting in line for these jobs. The fact of the matter is, we \ndo not produce enough American-born workers to fill the job vacancies \nin these fields.\n  Many of these potential job creators and entrepreneurs attend our \ncolleges and universities. You might even say that the American \ntaxpayer helps subsidize their education because many of them received \nworld-class training at our public and private colleges and \nuniversities and then reluctantly return home to pursue their careers \nbecause they cannot get a visa or cannot get a green card here in \nAmerica. We are cultivating human capital and then sending those \nindividuals back home.\n  This is an area where there is broad support. My colleague Senator \nMoran recently wrote a ``Dear Colleague'' letter which points out that \nroughly--he cites in the letter that more than three-quarters of voters \nsupport a STEM-type visa. He quotes in this letter, dated July 20, \n2012, 87 percent of Democrats polled, 72 percent of Republicans polled, \nand 65 percent of Independents support the creation of a STEM visa. Of \ncourse if you think about it, it is common sense. Why in the world \nwould we want to subsidize the education of these students from other \ncountries, train them in these highly specialized and highly desirable \nfields, and then simply send them home?\n  I have introduced legislation over the past years that would increase \nthe number of H1B visas, which are not green cards. They are actually \ntemporary visas that would allow more of these foreign national \nstudents, trained in these STEM fields, to stay here in the United \nStates and help create jobs here in the United States. This bill \nactually goes a step further. What it does is it provides them a green \ncard, which is the first step toward a path to citizenship.\n  If you believe our current policy is a self-inflicted wound on our \neconomy, you are exactly right. We are educating brilliant students and \nthen compelling them to go to work in Shanghai or Singapore rather than \nSan Antonio or the Silicon Valley. Meanwhile, we are handing out tens \nof thousands of diversity visas to immigrants chosen by random lottery, \nwithout regard to any qualifications they may have when it comes to job \ncreation and entrepreneurship. It makes absolutely no sense.\n  I believe we need an immigration policy that serves our national \ninterests. If there is one thing that we need more than anything else \nnow, we need job creators and entrepreneurs in the United States. We \nknow in the global economy it is people with special skills in science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics who are the ones who are going \nto help us create jobs and grow the economy--not just for these \nindividuals but for the people who are hired by the startup businesses \nthey will create.\n  The STEM Jobs Act would mitigate the problem with the diversity \nlottery visa, which again does not distinguish between immigrants based \nupon the qualifications they have or their ability to create jobs or be \nentrepreneurs. It would mitigate this problem by making our immigration \nsystem more economically sensible. It would establish new visa \ncategories for 55,000 STEM graduates of American research institutions \nand would eliminate the random diversity lottery visa to offset these \nnew green cards.\n  Our competitors abroad are observing this brain drain that America is \nexperiencing and they are taking advantage of it. In a global economy \nthey are more than happy to take the best and the brightest foreign \nstudents who come and train in the United States and to encourage them \nto come to their countries and create jobs and economic growth there. \nThis relatively minor change to our immigration system could deliver a \nmajor boost to U.S. economic growth. I realize many of our colleagues \nhave different priorities when it comes to fixing our broken \nimmigration system, but the reforms contained in the STEM Jobs Act \nenjoy bipartisan support.\n  I urge my colleagues, let's show the world we can agree on this \ncommonsense, bipartisan immigration reform. Let's do something for our \neconomy and let's take this first step in solving our broken \nimmigration system.\n  Before I turn the floor over to my colleague from Kentucky, who I \nknow has some comments on this topic, let me address two issues \nquickly. I can anticipate hearing from some of our colleagues that this \ndoes not solve all of what is broken in our immigration system, and I \nconcede that is correct. But what we need more than anything is to \ndevelop some confidence-building measures for the American people to \ndemonstrate that we can come together, Republicans and Democrats alike, \nand do what needs to be done which almost everybody agrees is common \nsense and then we can follow on with other solutions on a targeted \nbasis for our broken immigration system.\n  I once believed, back in 2005, when Senator Jon Kyl from Arizona and \nI introduced something we called the Comprehensive Border Security and \nImmigration Reform Act of 2005, we should address this issue \ncomprehensively. We tried in 2007. That bill failed on the Senate floor \nwhen Senator Reid pulled the bill from the floor.\n\n  I believe now, given the temper of the times and given the skepticism \nwith which the American people view us here in Congress, the only way \nwe are going to crack this nut is to start small in targeted reforms \nsuch as the STEM Jobs Act. I believe this is the beginning and not the \nend of fixing what is broken about our immigration reform system. But \nif we cannot do this--if we cannot do this--I have next to no \nconfidence we can do the rest that needs to be done as well.\n\n[[Page S7421]]\n\n  A final point. I believe we should be family-friendly when it comes \nto our immigration system. This STEM Jobs Act takes a very important \nstep in making sure families can be unified. Under the current law, \nsomeone who has a green card is not entitled to bring their immediate \nfamily into the United States to live with them while they are waiting \nfor their eligibility for a green card. The STEM Jobs Act, though, \naddresses that by recreating the V visa, which would help us retain \nmore of the potential job creators but it would also help unify the \nimmediate families of U.S. permanent residents. Right now, the spouses \nand children of U.S. permanent residents have to wait outside, to wait \nin line for their green card, which causes families to be separated--\nsomething that none of us believes is an optimal situation. The STEM \nJobs Act would let them wait inside the United States, unified with \ntheir loved ones until they are off the waiting list, which takes \nseveral years, and thus would promote family unification. That is yet \nanother reason why this bill deserves our support.\n  I yield to my distinguished colleague from Kentucky, who I know \nsupports this approach, for any comments he would care to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. I compliment the Senator from Texas for being a leader in \nimmigration reform. There are many of us in the Republican Party who \nwish to have immigration reform. I do wish it be noted for the Record \ntoday that we can take a small step forward toward immigration reform \ntoday. This bill that would allow Ph.D.s, master's, successful \ngraduates to come into this country with a green card could be passed \ntoday. This bill is at the desk and we will ask consent from the \nmajority party today to pass this bill.\n  I will also note the President and the Members of the majority party \nwill object. The President has said he will not pass this unless he can \nget everything he wants. When I go home or when I talk to folks with \nthe media, they say: Why can't you guys get along? Why can't you do \nanything in Washington? Why is this system so horribly broken?\n  This is precisely why. We agree on this bill. I think the other side \nwill stand and say they like the concept, but they do not want to do it \nyet. They want to wait until we agree on everything. Guess what. We are \nnever going to agree on everything so we are never going to get \nimmigration reform if we cannot start agreeing to some things and \nmoving the ball forward.\n  This is the same on tax reform. This is the same on entitlement \nreform. We lurch from deadline to deadline. There will be a deadline, \nthe so-called fiscal cliff coming up, and the President has announced \nthat we do not have enough time to do entitlement reform. We don't have \nenough time to do tax reform. We don't have enough time to do \nimmigration reform.\n  When are we going to start? When is there going to be a committee \nhearing designated toward entitlement reform? I have been here 2 years. \nThere is no such committee. When will there be hearings on immigration \nreform? There will not be time. Deadlines will pass.\n  But not break things up into smaller pieces? Why have to have some \nenormous fiscal cliff or whatever that everybody has to agree to a \nthousand moving parts? We are of different persuasions, of different \nparties, of different beliefs. We are never going to agree on a \nthousand things. Why don't we start passing some things we can agree \nto? This is a small step forward. We can pass this bill today.\n  Does the Senator have an explanation that can help me understand why \nwe have to have empty partisanship, why we cannot move forward to pass \nsome small things for immigration reform?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would say in response to the Senator \nfrom Kentucky that I have been in the Senate for some time now. I have \nbeen engaged in the immigration debates for a long time. I think one of \nthe biggest challenges is we have tried to deal with this in a \ncomprehensive way that has so many moving parts it is almost impossible \nto find a majority in the Senate, much less the House, in order to \nsupport all the various components of it. That is one of the things I \nlike about this bill. It is narrow, it deals with a consensus reform--\ncommonsense reform--and it avoids a lot of the controversy associated \nwith other parts of the immigration subject. I do believe we owe it to \nthe American people not to stop here, but it is a good place to start. \nOnce we pass this legislation and people see that we have acted \nresponsibly and in America's best interests, then we can regain their \nconfidence that we can deal with other broken parts of the immigration \nsystem.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. I think another important point to make about this is we \ntruly have different philosophical differences with people on the other \nside. But what people at home ask me is when you agree with the other \nside, when the other side says we want this part of immigration reform, \nwhy can't we do it? That to me is empty partisanship. Are we afraid to \ngive Republicans credit for introducing immigration reform in the \nRepublican-controlled House? Are we afraid it might be perceived as a \nRepublican idea? That to me is empty partisanship. I routinely vote \nwith the other side on some issues that some on this side object to \nbecause I believe in the issue. This is an issue where we all should be \nable to agree on immigration reform. Yet the other side will object to \nmoving the ball forward on immigration reform. That I don't understand \nand that I see as empty partisanship, and that is the dysfunction of \nthis body when we agree on something we still cannot pass it.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, will my colleague yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield?\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 6429\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask the Senator to withhold for a moment because I do \nhave a unanimous consent request. I understand the Senator likely will \nhave an objection to that. We have other Senators who are going to \nspeak. Given the limitation on our time, what I wish to do, Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 559, H.R. 6429, that the bill \nbe read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be made and \nlaid on the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right to object, and I will object and \nexplain my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. OK.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Very simply, I heard my colleague from Kentucky say if \nwe agree on something, let's pass it. We do agree on increasing STEM \nvisas. I am offering a proposal that does that and does it in a more \nfulsome way than the proposal of my friend from Texas. But what we do \nnot do is take away other visas or add in other extraneous positions.\n  I would say the logic of my friend from Kentucky is impeccable, but \nbecause of constraints on the other side they could not pass a plain \nbill that just added STEM visas. They had to take away other visas that \nmy colleague from Texas does not like--but many people do. They had to \nadd in a few other provisions.\n  I would simply say that if my colleague from Kentucky says we should \njoin together on something we agree with, I will bet he agrees with our \nproposal as well. And I will bet he agrees with it even more than the \nother proposal because we add two things that are not in the bill of \nthe Senator from Texas. No. 1, we allow unused STEM visas to be used to \nreduce the backlog of employment green cards. There are 200,000 people \nwaiting. It may well be that the 55,000 visas in the bill of the \nSenator from Texas are not going to be used up. That is what experts \nsay. Second, we allow STEM green cards to be used by entrepreneurs, a \nbill that has been introduced by I believe Senator Coons, Senator \nMoran--bipartisan--Senator Warner as well.\n  I am going to object to this bill, not because it increases STEM \nvisas and not for some larger purpose--although I do understand that if \nwe pick off all the pieces each of us wants, we are not going to get \ncomprehensive reform, and that is why the Hispanic Caucus opposes the \nbill of the Senator from Texas but supports our bill. I understand \nthat. But if we just want to do STEM and do it in the best way possible \nwithout other provisions, because that is what we agree on, I would \nurge my friend from Kentucky, and those\n\n[[Page S7422]]\n\nMembers on the other side, to support our bill.\n\n  So I object to the Cornyn bill, and I will be offering a bill on the \nsame subject that is purer, cleaner, and more full on STEM visas than \nthe proposal that was made by my good friend from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I understand that the Senator from New \nYork has objected, and of course here we go again making the perfect \nthe enemy of the good and not moving forward on commonsense immigration \nreform in an area where there is a consensus.\n  There are several problems with the Senator's proposal. One is that \nit has not passed the House and this one has. It also has a 2-year \nsunset provision, as I understand, and there is no family unification \nprovision. Also, it doesn't eliminate the diversity lottery visa which \nallows people to get green cards without regard to the qualifications \nthat they bring to this country to create jobs and start new \nbusinesses.\n  I know we have the distinguished Senator from North Dakota here.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, if I might be recognized to offer my \nproposal? I have let my friend from Texas respond, but I have the--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Texas yield?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we have four Senators who are prepared to \nspeak, and I just want to make sure we have adequate time to speak. I \nask that any time that is used by the distinguished Senator from New \nYork not be added to or subtracted from our time. We have retained a \ntotal of 45 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Under those circumstances, I agree to yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/05/senate-section/article/S7422-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7422-S7426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 3553\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nJudiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. \n3553, the BRAINS Act, and the Senate proceed to its consideration; that \nthe bill be read a third time and passed; and that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  I will be brief because I don't want to take away from my colleagues' \ntime. What this bill does is provide more STEM visas than the previous \nbill. It provides an entrepreneurship visa which the other bill does \nnot. It does not take away existing visas, which the Senator from Texas \ndoesn't like, but many other people find popular, good, and necessary. \nThe unemployment rate for those on the diversity visas coming in is \nmuch lower than that of the national average.\n  If we want to pass a pure STEM bill without extraneous provisions \nadded by people who are anti-immigration because they don't want to see \nany net increase in immigration, I urge the support of our bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the problem \nwith the Senator's proposal is that this piece of legislation he has \nreferred to has not passed out of committee in the Senate. It has not \npassed the House. This bill, the STEM Act, has passed the House. Theirs \nhas a 2-year sunset provision; this is permanent legislation. Also, it \nhas no family unification provision that will allow the immediate \nfamily members of the green card holder to wait the time when they will \nbecome eligible for a green card in the United States as opposed to \nback in their country of origin, and it does nothing to promote merit-\nbased immigration reform. We ought to be looking at immigration reform \nfrom the standpoint of not just how it can help the immigrant but how \nit can help America create jobs and entrepreneurship.\n  For those reasons, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, at this time I yield to the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota and then, following that, the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa for any comments he cares to make.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I thank the esteemed Senator from Texas \nand the Senator from Kentucky. I see the Senator from Iowa has joined \nus as well.\n  I rise to speak in support of the STEM Act but also to respond to the \nSenator from New York. I see the Senator has left, but I also want to \nrespond to some of the points in support of the Senator from Texas.\n  The STEM Act passed the House; it was H. Res. 6429, sponsored by \nCongressman Lamar Smith. I argue that it accomplishes both of the \nthings we are talking about today. It provides us with the opportunity \nto have a greater pool of employees with training in science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics, which is what we need in this \ncountry. It also accomplishes the diversity that was referred to by the \nSenator from New York.\n  So what the Senators from Texas, Kentucky, Iowa, and myself are \nproposing is to accomplish both goals. We are saying we can have the \nstudents who have graduated with either a doctorate degree or a \nmaster's degree in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, \nwhich is what we very much need to get our economy growing. A growing \neconomy creates more employment. It also creates the revenue without \nraising taxes that we need to address our deficit and debt. So this \nlegislation accomplishes both those goals and still provides an \nincrease in diversity which is what the Senator from New York was \ntalking about.\n  The additional point is the point that the Senator from Texas very \nclearly made. This legislation passed the House. The last time I \nchecked, legislation has to pass the Senate and the House. That is a \npretty important distinction.\n  Referring back to the comments of the Senator from Kentucky, who said \nif we cannot do it all at once because of disagreements, let's start \ngetting done what we can get done, here is a bill that provides us with \npeople in the science and technology fields who can help our economy \ngrow. These are people we need very much. It will increase diversity, \njust as the Senator from New York said, and it has passed the House. \nCommon sense says let's go. Let's pass the bill.\n  So we want to join with the Senator from New York, the Senator from \nDelaware, and the other sponsors to whom he referred, but let's join on \nsomething we can actually get done, meaning a bill that passes the \nHouse as well as the Senate. I think that logic is compelling.\n  I look at my own State of North Dakota. We are doing amazing things \nin energy. As a matter of fact, we are hot on the trail of the State of \nTexas when it comes to oil development. I am telling you, we are after \nyou.\n  So what is that going to take? It is going to take continued \ndevelopment of the technologies that not only helps us produce more \nenergy, but helps us do it with good environmental stewardship. What we \nare talking about is when we have the engineers, scientists, \ntechnicians, and mathematicians who graduate from our great \nuniversities with doctorate and master's degrees, they can stay and \nhelp us here rather than help someone else in some other country that \nwould then get ahead of the United States. This will help us solve the \nfundamental challenges we face today, which is getting this economy \ngrowing so we get people back to work and creating the revenue the \nright way with economic growth to help us address our deficit and debt.\n  With that, I yield the floor to the esteemed Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nIowa for any comments he cares to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, I'm proud to speak in support of \nthe STEM Jobs Act of 2012, a bill passed by the House of \nRepresentatives last week. This bill would make available up to 55,000 \ngreen cards each year for foreign students who have received doctorates \nor master's degrees in science, technology, engineering, or math, also \nknown as STEM, from a U.S. university. The bill would not increase \noverall immigration levels, but rather, would move our immigration\n\n[[Page S7423]]\n\nsystem toward one in which we reward the best and brightest of the \nworld with the chance to remain, live, and work in this country.\n  Without a doubt, our immigration system is flawed. I have long argued \nthat we need to enhance and expand legal avenues for U.S. employers to \nhire foreign workers. While I am a champion for rooting out fraud and \nabuse from many of our visa programs, I'm also supportive of finding \nways to allow people to enter this country through legal channels.\n  It makes sense to allow foreign students who have been trained and \neducated on U.S. soil to remain here. These students have advanced \ndegrees in science, technology, engineering, and math, and this bill \nwill ensure that we keep those highly skilled and sought-after students \nhere for employers in need.\n  Our economy cannot wait. We need to enact solutions today that create \neconomic growth.\n  We also have no reason to wait for next year's likely debate on \nimmigration. Attracting and retaining high-skilled workers should not \nbe a partisan issue. The senior Senator from New York has a similar \nproposal to grant green cards to STEM students. I can only assume that \nmany people on the other side of the aisle would support this bill if \nthe majority leader gave it a chance. Nearly 30 Democrats in the House \ncrossed the aisle to help this bill pass last week.\n  Finally, as we look ahead to immigration reform, it will be important \nto consider ways our policies benefit future generations, not just \nsolve the problems of the day. Our immigration system should be \nstructured in a way to recruit people with skills in STEM fields. This \nbill is a good first step to changing our system to a merit-based one. \nEnhancing our legal immigration channels should be a top priority, and \nI am committed to working on ways to do that for all sectors of the \neconomy.\n   I hope the majority will reconsider, and allow the Senate to call up \nand pass the STEM Jobs Act and send it to the President. It would be a \nsignal to the American people that we can work together to enact needed \nimmigration reforms.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the \ndistinguished Senators from Iowa, North Dakota, and Kentucky.\n  I think what people find so maddening about Congress and Washington, \nDC, is even when we agree, we still cannot seem to get anything done. \nHow is it that we can agree on the importance of additional STEM green \ncards and still not be able to get anything done? This is not about \nwhat is perfect, but this is about what is possible given what has \nhappened in the House of Representatives.\n  We could do this today and send it to the President of the United \nStates in the next couple of days so he can sign it. The question is, \nHow many more years will pass while we have these highly qualified \nstudents who graduate from our own colleges and universities with \nmaster's degrees and Ph.D.s in science, technology, engineering, and \nmath before we finally address the problem?\n  I realize there is other legislation people would like to have \nconsidered, but this has actually passed the House of Representatives.\n  I remember the hearing we had in the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on \nImmigration of which I am the ranking member. The Senator from New York \nsaid at that time--and this would not be a surprise to him since these \nare his own words, and it is consistent with what he said on the Senate \nfloor:\n\n       If we do not enact an immigration policy that continues to \n     attract the world's best minds, we will cease to be the \n     world's economic leader.\n\n  That is why I call this a self-inflicted wound. If we agree that \nAmerican workers should get the right of first refusal, but there are \nnot sufficient American workers with the qualifications in these \nimportant fields, why in the world would we not allow the creation of \njobs and new enterprises that would come with the STEM Jobs Act that \nhas passed the House?\n  I have a series of letters: one from the chancellor of the University \nof Texas System, Texas A University System, Texas Tech University \nSystem, the University of Houston System, the University of North \nTexas, and the Texas State University System in support of STEM \nlegislation. I also have a letter from Rice University president David \nLeebron supporting this same type of legislation.\n  I have a letter dated June 25, 2012, addressed to President Obama, \nLeader Reid, Leader McConnell, Speaker Boehner and then-Leader Pelosi \nfrom the Partnership for a New American Economy signed by the \npresidents or chancellors of 42 public and private universities. I have \na letter to Congress from the Information Technology Industry Council, \nPartnership for a New American Economy, and the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce supporting STEM immigration reform such as this bill.\n  I have another letter dated November 15, 2012, to Members of Congress \nfrom the American Council on International Personnel and the Society \nfor Human Resource Management supporting this type of STEM legislation. \nI have another letter dated September 19, 2012, to Speaker Boehner, \nLeader Cantor, Whip McCarthy, Minority Leader Pelosi, and Minority Whip \nHoyer from CONNECT, a U.S. San Diego tech transfer commercialization \nenterprise.\n  I also have a letter from the president of Baylor University in \nsupport of STEM legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters I just referenced be printed \nin the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 December 4, 2012.\n\n\n  Statement on Visas for STEM Graduates from Texas Public University \n                           System Chancellors\n\n       As chancellors of the six Texas public university systems, \n     we recognize the important role the fields of science, \n     technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) play in \n     American competitiveness.\n       We understand Senator John Cornyn plans to pursue \n     legislation during the remaining days of the 112th Congress \n     aimed at providing more visas for foreign graduates of \n     American universities in the STEM fields. Industry and \n     academia, particularly in Texas, face critical shortages in \n     the availability of qualified job applicants in these fields. \n     While we are actively engaged--through education outreach and \n     engineering extension--in preparing Texas residents for \n     success in the STEM fields, we recognize the need to address \n     existing shortages in these critical fields through a pathway \n     for international students already enrolled at our \n     institutions in these disciplines.\n       The severity of this situation was highlighted in the \n     recently published National Research Council report, Ten \n     Breakthrough Actions Vital to Our Nation's Prosperity and \n     Security. The report focuses on the role research \n     universities play in protecting the future of America and \n     recommends actions that should be taken separately and \n     jointly by universities, states, and the federal government. \n     The report specifically calls on the federal government to \n     streamline the processes that impact the ability of \n     international innovators to remain in our country and \n     contribute to its prosperity.\n       We applaud Senator Cornyn for his leadership and focus on \n     this issue. We urge Congress to work toward a bipartisan \n     solution to this important component of job growth and our \n     nation's innovation agenda.\n     Francisco G.

John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn, I write on behalf of Rice University \n     to support the STAR Act and all efforts to make it easier for \n     foreign students who receive advanced degrees in the STEM \n     fields to remain in the United States and put their \n     educations and skills to work on behalf of the country. These \n     students are among the best and brightest in the world and, \n     equipped with a Rice University or other U.S. education, will \n     have much to contribute to business and job creation and \n     economic growth.\n\n[[Page S7424]]\n\n       Rice University is proud to be based in Houston, Texas, and \n     to educate leaders and generate research and knowledge that \n     contribute in major ways to the vigor of our state and \n     country. We are equally proud to have more than 10 percent of \n     our undergraduate students and about 40 percent of our \n     graduate students from other countries. The fact that we can \n     attract the best and the brightest from throughout the world \n     is a significant strength, but to lose those students after \n     graduation because of overly restrictive immigration policies \n     is a distinct weakness for our state and country. We should \n     not send that education and talent away.\n       There is a case to be made for comprehensive immigration \n     reform, but the STAR Act makes significant progress towards \n     that goal. We would be happy to contribute our faculty \n     expertise if you would find that helpful.

Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Republican Leader, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President, Majority Leader Reid, Republican Leader \n     McConnell, Speaker Boehner, and Democratic Leader Pelosi: As \n     leaders of universities educating the creators of tomorrow's \n     scientific breakthroughs, we call on you to address a \n     critical threat to America's preeminence as a global center \n     of innovation and prosperity: our inability under current \n     United States immigration policy to retain and benefit from \n     many of the top minds educated at our universities.\n       From the industrial revolution to today's information age, \n     the United States has led the world in creating the \n     inventions and ideas that drive economic prosperity. \n     America's universities are responsible for 36 percent of all \n     research in the country, including 53 percent of all basic \n     research, and they help keep America at the forefront of the \n     21st century economy. The Federal Government has recognized \n     the importance of university research by providing roughly 60 \n     percent of all academic R funding.\n       American academic research has benefited from the fact that \n     the US remains a top magnet for the world's best and \n     brightest students and graduates 16 percent of all PhDs \n     worldwide in scientific and technical fields. In 2009, \n     students on temporary visas were 45 percent of all graduate \n     students in engineering, math, computer science and physical \n     sciences--earning 43 percent of all master's degrees and 52 \n     percent of all PhDs. New research shows that in 2011, \n     foreign-born inventors were credited contributors on more \n     than 75 percent of patents issued to the top 10 patent-\n     producing universities in the United States--irrefutable \n     proof of the important role immigrants play in American \n     innovation. These inventions lead to new companies and new \n     jobs for American workers, and are an enormous boon to our \n     economy.\n       But after we have trained and educated these future job \n     creators, our antiquated immigration laws turn them away to \n     work for our competitors in other countries. Low limits on \n     visas leave immigrants with no way to stay or facing \n     untenable delays for a permanent visa. Top engineers from \n     India and China face wait times of up to 9 years to get a \n     permanent visa, and new applicants from these countries may \n     face considerably longer waits. And while we turn away these \n     American-educated, trained and funded scientists and \n     engineers, there is a growing skill gap across America's \n     industries. One quarter of US science and engineering firms \n     already report difficulty hiring, and the problem will only \n     worsen: the US is projected to face a shortfall of 230,000 \n     qualified advanced-degree workers in scientific and technical \n     fields by 2018.\n       The US cannot afford to wait to fix our immigration system. \n     Even as we send away highly skilled workers trained at \n     American universities, competing economies are welcoming \n     these scientists and engineers with streamlined visa \n     applications and creating dedicated visas to ensure that the \n     foreign students who graduate from their own universities can \n     stay and contribute to the local economy. We ask you to work \n     together to develop a bipartisan solution that ensures our \n     top international graduates have a clear path to a green \n     card, so they can stay and create new American jobs. Recent \n     polls show that there is broad, bipartisan support for this \n     reform, and that the American people want our leaders in \n     Washington to act. Now is the time to do so and ensure that \n     the US remains the world's leading home for innovators.\n           Sincerely,\n     (77 Signatures).\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 December 4, 2012.\n       To the Members of the United States Congress: The \n     Information Technology Industry Council, the Partnership for \n     a New American Economy, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \n     recently joined together to prepare a new report, released \n     last week, ``Help Wanted: The Role of Foreign Workers in the \n     Innovation Economy''. According to the report, foreign-born \n     professionals in the fields of Science, Technology, \n     Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) are complementing--not \n     displacing--their U.S. counterparts and the U.S. economy is \n     in need of more STEM talent.\n       As Congress deliberates initiatives to reform our \n     immigration system--including expanding visas for those with \n     advanced STEM degrees earned at U.S. universities--the report \n     provides evidence of critical labor force needs in America's \n     innovation economy.\n       There is universal agreement that reforming U.S. education \n     and job training to encourage more U.S. students to enter \n     STEM occupations is essential to a strong economy. Yet these \n     fixes will take years to yield results, and many of the \n     talented STEM workers who could fill the gaps in our labor \n     force are already here training in American universities. \n     Reforming American immigration laws to allow foreign-born \n     STEM students who earn advanced degrees from U.S. \n     universities to stay and work in jobs where there are no \n     available qualified American workers will fill an immediate \n     need and promote economic growth and job creation.\n       Our report analyzes data from the U.S. Census and the U.S. \n     Department of Education Integrated Post-Secondary Education \n     Data System (WEDS) to examine employment in the STEM fields. \n     The report confirms that:\n       There is full employment for U.S. STEM workers with \n     advanced degrees: While the current national unemployment \n     rate hovers around 8 percent, the unemployment rate for \n     United States citizens with PhDs in STEM fields is just 3.15 \n     percent, and 3.4 percent for those with master's degrees in \n     STEM fields. Given that the U.S. government has defined \n     ``full-employment'' to be 4 percent, this suggests a skills \n     shortage of STEM professionals with advanced degrees.\n       In many STEM occupations, unemployment is virtually non-\n     existent: Unemployment is particularly low in STEM \n     occupations such as Petroleum Engineers (0.1 percent), \n     Computer Network Architects (0.4 percent), Nuclear Engineers \n     (0.5 percent), Environmental Scientists and Geoscientists \n     (1.2 percent), Database Administrators (1.3 percent), \n     Statisticians (1.6 percent), Engineering Managers (1.6 \n     percent), and Aerospace Engineers (1.9 percent).\n       STEM fields employ a far higher proportion of foreign \n     workers than non-STEM fields: In STEM fields, 26.1 percent of \n     workers with PhDs are foreign born, as are 17.7 percent of \n     workers with master's degrees. In comparison, in non-STEM \n     fields, just 6.4 percent of doctoral workers and 5.2 percent \n     of master's workers are foreign born.\n       STEM fields with high percentages of foreign STEM workers \n     have low unemployment rates for US workers: Although nearly \n     25 percent of medical scientists are foreign born, United \n     States medical scientists enjoy an unemployment rate of just \n     3.4 percent, fully five percentage points lower than the non-\n     STEM unemployment rate (8.4 percent). Similar stories exist \n     for STEM occupations such as physical scientists and computer \n     software designers, where immigrants make up more than 20 \n     percent of the field and unemployment is just 4 percent. \n     Unemployment across all STEM occupations is just 4.3 percent, \n     and the unemployment rate is even lower in 10 of the 11 STEM \n     occupations with the largest proportion of foreign workers.\n       Foreign-born STEM workers are paid on par with US STEM \n     workers: There is no verifiable evidence that foreign-born \n     STEM workers adversely affect the wages of American workers \n     by providing a less expensive source of labor. The average \n     STEM worker actually makes slightly more than his or her \n     United States counterpart, earning on average $61 more per \n     week.\n       These findings reaffirm a December 2011 report, \n     ``Immigration and American Jobs,'' released by the American \n     Enterprise Institute and the Partnership for a New American \n     Economy, which found that every foreign graduate with an \n     advanced degree from a U.S. university who stays and works in \n     a STEM field, creates an average of 2.62 new jobs for \n     American workers.\n       We are committed to reforming our immigration system in \n     ways that advance U.S. competitiveness, innovation, and job \n     creation, and look forward to working with you to achieve \n     this important goal.\n           Sincerely,\n         Information Technology Industry Council,\n         Partnership for a New American Economy,\n         U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Council on International Personnel and Society \n           for Human Resource Management\n                                                November 15, 2012.\n       Dear Member of Congress: As you consider measures in the \n     lame-duck congressional session to restore America's fiscal \n     health and put our economy back on track, the American \n     Council on International Personnel (ACIP) and the Society for \n     Human Resource Management (SHRM) urge you to act on a key \n     high-skilled legal immigration reform that has bipartisan \n     support and the\n\n[[Page S7425]]\n\n     backing of the U.S. business community, and that will help \n     jumpstart U.S. growth and job creation: making green cards \n     available for foreign-born holders of U.S. STEM advanced \n     degrees who have a job offer.\n       Highly educated, foreign-born professionals have a long \n     history of making great contributions to our economy, and \n     this legislation will help U.S. employers to more easily \n     recruit, hire and retain these job creators and innovators. \n     The visas would be immediately available to these \n     professionals, helping them avoid the decades-long green card \n     backlog that currently plagues top talent trying to \n     contribute to our country. This legislation will help \n     reenergize America's competitiveness at an extremely critical \n     time.\n       Our organizations, now strategic affiliates, represent \n     thousands of employers across the country working hard to \n     grow America's economy. While there is much to be done in the \n     next session, this small step now will pay big dividends in \n     keeping our economy on the right track until more \n     comprehensive reforms can be enacted.\n       We encourage Congress to start building the necessary \n     consensus needed for future immigration legislation by \n     sending this bipartisan reform to the president for enactment \n     before year's end.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lynn Shotwell,\n       Executive Director, ACIP.\n     Michael P. Aitken,\n       Vice President, Government Affairs, SHRM.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                      Connect,\n\n                                               September 19, 2012.\n     Speaker John Boehner,\n     Majority Leader Eric Cantor,\n     Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy,\n     Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Whip Steny Hoyer,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives, As a \n     leading voice for tech start-up and emerging companies, \n     CONNECT applauds you for your efforts to address a critical \n     innovation policy issue by bringing to a vote the STEM Jobs \n     Act of 2012, H.R. 6429. This important legislation will spark \n     innovation across the U.S. and assist start-up company \n     growth, which remains America's best job-creating engine.\n       CONNECT was birthed out of the University of California--\n     San Diego over twenty-five years ago with the mission to \n     propel creative ideas and emerging technologies to the \n     marketplace by training entrepreneurs and connecting them to \n     the comprehensive resources they need to sustain viability \n     and business vibrancy. Since 1985, CONNECT has assisted in \n     the formation and development of over 3,000 companies and is \n     recognized as one of the world's most successful regional \n     innovation development programs. In 2010, CONNECT won the \n     Innovation in Economic Development Award in the Regional \n     Innovation Clusters category presented by the U.S. Department \n     of Commerce's Economic Development Administration.\n       Although much of the discussion regarding STEM visa reform \n     centers around the benefits that will accrue to larger \n     companies in the tech sector, it should not be overlooked \n     that a STEM visa reform proposal like H.R. 6429 will \n     facilitate new STEM grads to also be hired by startup and \n     emerging companies. As both the Small Business Administration \n     and the Kauffman Foundation have confirmed, the vast majority \n     of America's net job growth in recent years has come from \n     startup and emerging companies. Allowing foreign-born STEM \n     graduates to stay in the U.S. to work in startup and emerging \n     companies will help keep America at the edge of the frontier \n     of global competitiveness. However, that edge is being \n     aggressively trimmed by our foreign competitors. Thus, it is \n     imperative we retain U.S.-educated, foreign-born STEM talent \n     instead of forcing them to find jobs overseas with global \n     competitors.\n       There is much talk in Washington about helping start-up \n     businesses, but the STEM Jobs Act takes tangible action \n     toward achieving that goal. We commend you for advancing this \n     solution that will have real-world benefits for America's \n     entrepreneurs and innovators.\n       In CONNECT's ``Innovation Agenda for the 112th Congress'' \n     and ``Seven Innovation Policy Ideas to Spark an American \n     Recovery,'' we endorsed STEM visa reform. Continuing that \n     long-term commitment in support of the issue, we encourage \n     the House to pass the bill and we stand ready to assist the \n     Senate in its consideration of H.R. 6429.\n           Sincerely,\n                                    Timothy Tardibono, M.A., J.D.,\n     Vice President of Public Policy, CONNECT.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            Baylor University,\n\n                                       Waco, TX, December 5, 2012.\n     Senator John Cornyn,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: Since 1845, Baylor University has \n     promoted academic excellence and Christian service, and its \n     achievements have been recognized around the world. As a \n     nationally ranked research institution, Baylor is also \n     dedicated to scientific discovery and training the inventors \n     and entrepreneurs who will create the jobs of the future. We \n     now have more than 70 masters and doctoral degree programs, \n     including eleven science, technology, engineering, and math \n     (STEM) programs. Of the Masters and PhD students enrolled in \n     our STEM programs, 13 percent are foreign nationals. Many of \n     these students are listed as co-inventors in patent \n     applications filed by Baylor research teams.\n       Unfortunately, our innovation efforts are being undermined \n     by U.S. immigration laws. Many of our STEM Masters and PhD \n     students may not be able to obtain an appropriate work visa \n     in industry because of the low cap on the number of such new \n     visas that can be issued. They would have to return to their \n     home country after graduation or obtain a visa in an \n     occupation that is unrelated to their education. The House-\n     passed STEM Jobs Act would create 55,000 additional visas for \n     foreign nationals with an advanced STEM degree from a U.S. \n     research institution. It represents an important step in \n     fixing America's broken immigration system.\n       I encourage the Senate to pass this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Kenneth Winston Starr.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I think the record should be clear that \nour side of the aisle believes we should act today and not wait and not \ndelay further this important STEM Jobs Act for the very reason I said \nearlier, which is that it will help job creators and entrepreneurs.\n  The reason STEM visas are particularly powerful is because these \nindividuals with special expertise in math, technology, engineering, \nand the like are uniquely qualified to be able to start up new \nenterprises and to attract and create jobs for other people. In other \nwords, there is a multiplier effect. For every 1 of the 55,000 green \ncards that would be created by this act, there are hundreds of \nthousands of people who would enjoy jobs as a result of the economic \nactivity in this country.\n  I hope we don't sacrifice another crop of science, technology, and \nengineering graduates in the hope that we can get the perfect \nimmigration bill. In fact, we know this is a difficult area in which to \nlegislate, and both sides of the aisle know we need to deal with all of \nthe different facets of our broken immigration system. But this bill \nhas passed the House. It is here and now. We could pass it today by \nunanimous consent but for the objection of our friends across the aisle \nand the objection, amazingly enough, of the President of the United \nStates who himself has claimed for at least the last 4 years that he is \nin favor of immigration reform.\n  It is also an important confidence builder in terms of the acceptance \nof this legislation by the American people. The American people are \njustifiably skeptical of Congress passing another omnibus or \ncomprehensive piece of legislation. We tried that before, and we found \nout that even if people have read bills going into the thousands of \npages in length, many times there are unintended consequences.\n  So I believe it is very important that we start with this important \nSTEM Jobs Act, that we demonstrate we are worthy of the confidence and \ntrust of the American people when it comes to addressing our broken \nimmigration system, in an area where we have consensus such as the STEM \njobs field. I tell my colleagues they have my personal commitment that \nI will be there to work with them to deal with other parts of our \nbroken immigration system as we go forward.\n  The best way to do that, in my opinion, is to start here. If we can't \npass this legislation--and I am skeptical based upon the objection we \nhave heard today--I wonder if we will ever be able to pass immigration \nreform. If we can't do this consensus bill, tell me one other piece of \nlegislation we could pass in this field by agreement of the political \nparties and send it on to the President. Indeed, I think there is room \nto wonder whether some people in this Chamber would prefer to have this \nan issue they can wield in the next election rather than to join \ntogether on a bipartisan basis and to solve what is broken in our \nimmigration system.\n  Let's start here. Let's build on this. We can do it today if we can \njust somehow avoid the objections and pass this legislation that has \nbeen passed by the House. It passes the STEM visa bill, it keeps \nfamilies together, and it represents values I would think both sides of \nthe aisle would applaud.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7426]]\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, middle-class families in our country \ntoday are paying very close attention to what we are doing here in \nWashington, DC. They really understand what is at stake. They know the \nimpact our decisions will have on their lives, and they keep hoping \ntheir elected officials will finally come together around a budget deal \nthat works for them.\n  Less than a month ago, we concluded an election season that engaged \nour Nation in a conversation about this very issue. Candidates for the \nPresidency and for the Senate on down all laid out their positions on \nsome of the key questions we are now hoping to answer. Should the \nmiddle-class tax cuts be extended? Should the Bush tax cuts on the rich \nend? Should we end the Medicare guarantee for our seniors and the next \ngeneration?\n  Well, those big questions were discussed, argued, and clear positions \nwere taken, and voters went to polling places on election day to render \ntheir verdict. The outcome was clear. Candidates who stood for the \nmiddle class won. Candidates who advocated for our seniors came out \nahead. And in exit polls across the country, voters made very clear \nthat they strongly supported the idea that the wealthy should pay \nhigher tax rates and their fair share.\n  And everyone--Democrat, Republican, Independent; wealthy, low income, \nmiddle class; students, workers, retirees; older, younger, and in \nbetween--everyone supports extending the tax cuts for the middle class. \nNobody thinks the taxes should go up for 98 percent of our workers and \n97 percent of our small business owners.\n  This ought to be easy. The American people just weighed in supporting \na continuation of the Bush tax cuts for the middle class. It is a \npolicy Democrats and Republicans agree on, and it would cushion \nmillions of middle-class families across the country from a significant \nportion of the upcoming so-called fiscal cliff.\n  So why isn't it already in law? Why aren't middle-class families \nalready able to feel confident in their taxes not going up? Well, for \none reason, and one reason alone. House Republicans continue to hold \nthe middle class hostage in a desperate and deeply misguided attempt to \nbuck the will of the people, ignore the results of this election, and \nprotect the wealthiest Americans from paying their fair share. That is \nall there is to it.\n  If Republicans truly cared about keeping taxes low for the middle \nclass, they can do it right now. The Senate passed a bill that would \nextend the tax cuts for 98 percent of families and 97 percent of \nworkers. President Obama said he would sign it into law. He even showed \nus the pen. All the House has to do is let this bill come up for a vote \nand pass it and middle-class families can go into these holidays with \nthe certainty they deserve.\n  I want to be very clear about something because some of my Republican \ncolleagues seem intent on confusing the issue. Republicans do not have \nto support taxes going up on the rich in order to vote for our bill to \nkeep taxes low on the middle class. Let me repeat that. Republicans can \nbelieve that the Bush tax cuts for the rich should be extended, they \ncan remain committed to fighting for that misguided policy, in my \nopinion, and they can still vote on the portion of the tax cuts we all \nagree should be extended for the middle class. Then middle-class \nfamilies would win, we would have worked together to extend tax cuts \nfor 98 percent of workers and 97 percent of small business owners. Then \nwhen the middle class is taken care of, I would be happy to engage my \nRepublican colleagues in a debate about extending the Bush tax cuts for \nthe top 2 percent.\n  But the first step, the most obvious step, is for the Republican \nHouse to take the 98 percent both sides agree on, pass our Senate bill, \nand send it to the President for his signature.\n  Recently there have been some cracks in the Republican rhetorical \narmor that has held fast against compromise for years. More and more \nRepublicans have begun to accept in their rhetoric what Democrats--and, \nfrankly, every bipartisan group that has examined this issue--have \nknown all along: A deficit deal is going to have to be balanced. It is \ngoing to have to include new revenue from the wealthiest Americans.\n  Grover Norquist calls these ``impure thoughts,'' but to most \nAmericans it is common sense. Now the onus is on Republicans--and \nespecially their leadership--to follow this encouraging rhetoric with \nsome action. So far that has been lacking.\n  The lengths to which Republicans are now going in order to protect \nthe rich from paying higher rates would be comical if it were not so \ndetrimental. They say they have accepted that revenue needs to be on \nthe table, but then the proposal that Speaker Boehner made to the \nPresident would actually cut rates for the rich. It lacks any details \nabout where that claimed revenue would come from. And just as \nindependent analysts confirmed about the Ryan plan, and just as we saw \nin the Romney plan, when you are talking about simply closing loopholes \nand ending deductions, either the math does not add up or the middle \nclass ends up bearing the entire burden.\n  Republicans are tying themselves in knots to avoid the obvious: The \neasiest way to raise revenue from the wealthiest Americans is simply to \nallow the Bush tax cuts for the top 2 percent to expire as scheduled. \nThat is what the Democrats want, it is what the American people \nsupport, and it would move us a long way toward the balanced and \nbipartisan deal we are all working to get to.\n  My colleague in the House of Representatives, Minority Leader Pelosi, \nis circulating a discharge petition to bring the Senate bill to the \nHouse floor. I strongly support this move, and I urge House Republicans \nto sign on and allow this legislation to come to the floor for a vote.\n  Democrats have proven we are willing to make the tough compromises \nthat a balanced and bipartisan deal will require. And we have been very \nclear we will not allow Republicans to push through a bad deal that \nforces seniors and the middle class to bear this burden all alone.\n  I am hopeful Speaker Boehner and House Republicans will decide to \nstop holding the middle class hostage, allow the Senate bill to come to \nthe floor, put it up for a vote, and give our middle-class families the \ntax cuts on which we all agree.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/05/senate-section/article/S7426-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7426-S7427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  MALI\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise today to address a challenging \nsituation in Mali. Mali is a west African country, a country of nearly \n\\1/2\\ million square miles, a vast country that stretches from the \nSahara Desert to the Niger River area and is home to roughly 15 million \npeople. Yet it is not at the top of the list of concerns for many \nAmericans.\n  This spring, back in March, a rogue element in Mali's security forces \nlaunched a coup and forcefully overthrew a longstanding, democratically \nelected government in the nation of Mali, our ally. This may seem \ninconsequential to the average American, but it could have big \nimplications for our security, as well that of our regional and global \nallies, because in the power vacuum created in that spring coup, al-\nQaida saw an opportunity, and they stepped in. Three different \nextremist groups, all linked to or controlled by al-Qaida in the \nIslamic Mahgreb, or AQIM, now control an area the size of Texas in the \nnorthern part of Mali. They succeeded in fracturing a formerly stable \ndemocracy and contributing to broad security, political, and \nhumanitarian crises that I believe have grave implications for the \nSahel region and for America's interests. To put it simply, this \nmatters.\n  Mali, a relatively strong democracy for more than two decades and an \nally\n\n[[Page S7427]]\n\nto the United States, is now embroiled in turmoil. The United States, \nin partnership with the international community, must show leadership \nin helping it rebuild its democracy and restore its territorial \nintegrity by reclaiming northern Mali from terrorists and extremists. \nSo this morning, as the chair of the African Affairs Subcommittee of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, I chaired a hearing to assess the \ndevelopments and the path forward for U.S. policy in Mali.\n  What I heard from our experts, from the Department of Defense, from \nthe State Department, from the USAID, as well as a range of outside \nexperts and one witness who testified from Bamako, the capital of Mali, \nwas of real concern to me.\n  Northern Mali today is the largest terrorist-controlled area in the \nworld. In the north, extremists have imposed a harsh and strict version \nof Sharia or Islamic law and committed gross violations of human \nrights. Many folks have heard of Timbuktu but don't know that it is an \nancient city in northern Mali, a site where these Islamic extremists \nhave behaved much as the Taliban did in Afghanistan before 9/11. They \ndestroyed sacred religious and historic artifacts in Timbuktu, imposing \na harsh version of Sharia that has meant amputations, stonings, \nviolations of women's rights of free speech, religious exercise of \nrights, fundamentally changing the tolerance and exclusive history of \nMali.\n  This created a humanitarian crisis as more than 400,000 Malians have \nfled, either internally displaced within Mali or going into neighboring \ncountries as refugees.\n  With growing ties between these terrorists and Nigeria, Libya, and \nthroughout the region, AQIM, we believe, may now use its safe haven in \nnorthern Mali to plan for regional or transnational terrorist attacks. \nJust as we should not have ignored developments in Afghanistan, which \nseemed a remote and troubled country when the Taliban took it over more \nthan a dozen years ago, so too we would ignore the chaos in northern \nMali at our peril.\n  In fact, Secretary Clinton has said that Mali has now become a powder \nkeg of potential instability in the region and beyond. The top American \nmilitary commander in Africa, GEN Carter Ham, said publicly just this \nweek that al-Qaida is operating terrorist camps in northern Mali and is \nproviding arms, explosives, and financing to other terrorist groups in \nthe region. So I believe it is critical that the United States has a \nstrong and comprehensive policy to deal with this threat.\n  I am concerned that the current U.S. approach may not be forward \nleaning enough to address all three crises--security, political, and \nhumanitarian--in a coordinated, comprehensive, and effective way at the \nsame time. Given the compelling U.S. interest in stability, security, \nand good governance in Mali, we must ensure that we don't miss the \nbigger picture of what this situation means for the future of Mali, to \nour allies, and to our security.\n  The U.N. Security Council is now considering what they call a concept \nof operations for an African-led military operation. The United States \ncan and should play a more active role in supporting this and \npreventing the country from becoming a permanent home for extremists \nand a safe haven for terrorists.\n  An active role does not mean putting American boots on the ground. \nInstead, we can provide operational support for a regionally led, \nmultilateral, African-led force being organized by ECOWAS, the Economic \nCommunity of West African States, and the African Union. In the weeks \nahead the U.N. Security Council will likely vote on a resolution \nauthorizing this coalition to lead a military intervention to dislodge \nthe terrorists in the north. We have seen models like this work in Cote \nd'Ivoire and Somalia, so there is reason to believe in the potential of \na regional military solution to the security crisis in the north.\n  However, even if this intervention works, it will take time to train, \nequip, and assemble the regional force and to develop the appropriate \nplans for what happens during and after a military intervention. \nFrankly, Mr. President, security and stability can't be restored to \nMali with military action alone. The current crisis is as much about \ngovernance as it is about security. A stronger Malian democracy is the \nbest way to ensure security and societal gains in the short term and \nthe long term, but democracy doesn't just begin or end with an \nelection.\n  One of the reasons Mali's democracy crumbled so quickly was that \nMalians didn't feel connected to, represented, or well served by their \ngovernment. Voter turnout in the last few elections was lower and \nlower, with the government viewed as corrupt, social services not \nbenefiting the relatively sparsely populated north, and institutions \nnationwide that were weak.\n  The political and security challenges in Mali are two sides of the \nsame coin; they are not separate issues. I will urge that we break down \nsilos between departments and agencies in our government and take a \ncomprehensive view.\n  If we focus on the political only and insist on Mali moving forward \nbriskly with an election even when the security situation will prevent \nmost northern Malians from meaningfully participating, I think we risk \nunintentionally strengthening the hands of those who want to ensure \nthat Mali's regional divide is permanent and hand a symbolic victory to \nal-Qaida.\n  On the other hand, if we rush forward with a security solution, with \na regional military intervention before it is adequately planned, \nbefore they are responsibly trained and equipped, we risk defeat on \nthat front as well.\n  I think we can and should do better. We can work closely with our \nallies, with regional partners in the international community to \naddress all the security, political, and humanitarian crises unfolding \nin Mali. Effective, inclusive elections early next year should be one \ngoal but not the only one. We also have to address the ongoing \nhumanitarian crisis of the 400,0000 displaced persons and refugees, the \nmore than 4.5 million people in need of emergency food aid in the \nregion, and the security crisis of terrorists controlling an area this \nlarge.\n  To bring long-term peace and stability to Mali and to ensure northern \nMali doesn't slide into being the base of operations for the next al-\nQaida attack on our allies, our interests abroad, or even the United \nStates, we can't afford to ignore any of the pieces of this complex \npuzzle. The United States simply cannot afford, despite the many \ndistractions and other priorities facing us, to ignore Mali.\n  I pledge to work in close partnership with my colleagues in the \nSenate and with my friends on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to \nensure an effective engagement by the United States in this important \narea.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/05/senate-section/article/S7427-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXTENSION OF MORNING HOUR\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Mr. President, last week I came to the floor and \nspoke about our Nation's military and intelligence leaders \nacknowledging, along with our Nation's scientific leaders, the clear \nevidence that carbon pollution is changing our climate. Unfortunately, \nthere continues to be some confusion among many Americans regarding the \nclear scientific consensus, but that is confusion caused by coordinated \nand deliberate attempts to mislead the American people.\n  For more than two decades now, the climate denial movement has been \nwell-organized and funded by the fossil fuel industry and conservative \nideologues and foundations. The mission of these paid-for deniers is to \n``manufacture uncertainty,'' to manufacture doubt so the polluters can \nkeep on polluting.\n  This isn't a new strategy. We have seen self-serving strategies such \nas this before. These strategies questioned the merits of requiring \nseat belts in cars. They questioned CFCs causing deterioration of the \nozone layer. They questioned the toxic effects of lead exposure for \nchildren. They questioned whether tobacco was really bad for people--\nthe same strategy to manufacture\n\n[[Page S7428]]\n\ndoubt, and often, actually, the same cast of characters was involved.\n  While the Congress of the United States has been distracted and \ndeceived by these ploys, climate change marches on. The laws of \nchemistry and the laws of physics don't care about the nonsense we are \nup to in this building. They do what the laws of chemistry and physics \nsay. Precious time is wasting. In the balance hangs lives and jobs. \nThis nonsense has gone on long enough.\n  The public is being misled. Special-interest dollars pull the strings \nof sophisticated campaigns to give the public the impression that there \nis a real scientific debate regarding whether climate change is \nhappening. Well, there isn't. There just isn't. The real scientific \ndebate is about how bad the changes will be.\n  Here is one example out of my home State, the Warwick Beacon, in an \narticle entitled, ``Sandy: A wake up call to climate change.'' It \ndescribes the head of our Coastal Resources Council, saying--he is \ntalking about the sea level rise:\n\n       I can tell you that it is real. I can't tell you how fast \n     or how bad it is.\n\n  That is what I said. The real scientific debate is actually about how \nbad the changes are going to be.\n  To manufacture doubt to allow the polluters to keep polluting, \nskeptics with little training in climate science are promoted as \nexperts. Front groups such as the Global Climate Coalition, Information \nCouncil for the Environment, Heartland Institute, Annapolis Center and \nCooler Heads Coalition are created or enlisted to propagate this \nmessage of doubt. Deniers question the motives and engage in harassment \nof the real credentialed climate scientists.\n  Well, for the record, there has been scientific debate regarding \nclimate change. Ideas have been tested, theories have been ventured, \nand the evidence keeps coming back to the same conclusion: Increased \ncarbon dioxide in the atmosphere from human-related sources is \nstrengthening the greenhouse effect, adding to recent warming and \nacidifying the oceans.\n  Actually, the evidence coming in tends to confirm the worst and most \ndangerous projections. Claims, for instance, that solar activity is \ncausing recent global warming, and even about whether the atmosphere is \nreally warming, have been settled. But when the scientific research \ndoesn't work out for the skeptics, they turn to straw man arguments. \nOne straw man is that extreme weather events such as hurricanes and \ndroughts aren't proof of climate change.\n  Well, let's be clear. No credible source is arguing that extreme \nevents are proof of climate change. But extreme events are associated \nwith what has been staring us in the face for years: The average global \ntemperature is increasing, average sea level is rising, and average \nocean acidity is increasing. When averages change, extremes usually \nchange with them, and a warming climate, to use the best example, loads \nthe dice--loads the dice for extreme weather.\n  So let's look at some of the games that the deniers display to try to \nmanipulate public opinion. One gimmick they have reverted to is the \nobservation that there has been no warming trend in the last 10 years--\nno warming trend, they say, in the last 10 years.\n  In 2010, a Republican Senator said: I don't think that anyone \ndisagrees with the fact that we actually are in a cold period that \nstarted about 9 years ago.\n  Well, let's look at the facts. Let's start with the green line on \nthis graph. The green line is the global surface temperature data. It \nis not a protection, it is not a hypothesis, it is a measurement. This \nis global surface temperature data. As you can see, it changes monthly.\n  The red line that goes through it is the trend line that is \nmathematically developed from that data. That trend line is the product \nof basic and undeniable mathematics.\n  The trend is extremely clear.\n  So let's look at what the deniers do with the very same data. Here \nthey take the very same data, and the green line is unchanged. It is \nexactly the same data, and this is how they get to saying that we have \nhad a cooling period for the past 10 years. They pick a high point, and \nthey pick a low point out of this data, and they say that is their 10-\nyear cooling period.\n  The problem is, if you go back, here is another one, here is another \none, here is another one, and here is another one. It is interesting \nhow all the cooling periods stack up to an increase.\n  It is a little bit like--who was the guy on the radio? He explained \nsomething to you, and it didn't seem quite right. Then he would say: \n``Paul Harvey, what's the rest of the story?''\n  So the rest of the story is that if someone picks one piece of data \nout of a line that is going like this and then they go forward and pick \na lower one later, they can manufacture the hypothesis there has been \nno warming trend in the last 10 years. But if we do it legitimately, if \nwe run an actual trend line with mathematical precision through the \ndata, it shows this theory is nothing but misleading bunk--misleading \nbunk--designed for the purpose of creating confusion.\n  This period, of course, is only a recent portion of the temperature \nrecord. When skeptics and deniers look deeper into the past, they find \neven more strawmen--that the Earth's climate always changes; that it \nhas been warmer in the past. Yes, the Earth has seen different climates \nin the past, not all ones we would necessarily want to live in, by the \nway. The reason we know about these climates is because of the \nexcellent work done by scientists--the same scientists who tell us that \nrecent climate change can only be explained by increased carbon dioxide \nin the atmosphere. The final classic is that more carbon in the \natmosphere is good because it provides more food for plants, the old \nplant food theory.\n  The fact is we have changed the composition of our atmosphere, \npushing the concentration of carbon dioxide beyond the range it has \nbeen in for 8,000 centuries. For 8,000 centuries, it has been between \n170 and 300 parts per million. For the first time this past year, it \ntouched 400 parts per million in the Arctic. To give a time scale of \nwhat 8,000 centuries means, the practice of agriculture has been around \nfor about 100 centuries. That is 8,000 centuries in this safe zone of \ncarbon concentration of our atmosphere, with only 100 centuries of \nthose with the human species, even farmers. Modern humans began to \nmigrate out of Africa 600 centuries ago. Once again, 8,000 centuries of \nthis safe climate belt of carbon concentration and 600 centuries of our \nspecies leaving Africa and migrating to populate the rest of our \nplanet. Homo sapiens, our species, appeared around 2,000 centuries ago.\n  We are messing with planetary concentrations of atmospheric carbon \nthat go back four times longer than our species has inhabited this \nplanet. In all that time, in those 8,000 centuries, the Earth has never \nreached carbon dioxide concentrations as we have caused now through \nhuman activity.\n  Deniers also tend to just flat ignore the facts they can't explain \naway or gimmick the data for. For example, the increased acidification \nof the oceans, that is something that is simple to measure. It is \nundeniably chemically linked to carbon concentrations in the \natmosphere. So we hear nothing about ocean acidification from the \ndeniers. But ocean acidification is possibly the most disastrous \nconsequence of our carbon pollution. The rate of change in acidity of \nour oceans is already thought to be faster than at any time in the past \n50 million years.\n  I was talking a moment ago about being outside a boundary of carbon \nconcentration or atmosphere that has persisted for 8,000 centuries. We \nare talking now about a rate of change of acidity in the ocean that \nhasn't been seen on this planet in the past 50 million years. A paper \npublished this March in ``Science'' concluded the current rate of \ncarbon dioxide emissions could drive chemical changes in the ocean \nunparalleled in the last 300 million years.\n  We are effecting changes in our atmosphere and in our oceans that \nonly compare to ancient periods of geologic time. When we consider the \nimplications for food security, biodiversity, and ocean-based \nindustries, we cannot ignore these changes in our oceans.\n  Coincidentally, just last Friday, the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration proposed listing 66 species of coral as \nendangered or threatened and cited climate change as driving three key \nthreats: disease, warmer seas, and more acidic seas.\n\n[[Page S7429]]\n\n  It might be worth reminding the deniers what NASA says. The National \nAeronautics and Space Administration--NASA--says this about climate \nchange and our global temperature rising.\n\n       All three global surface temperature reconstructions show \n     that Earth has warmed since 1880. Most of this warming has \n     occurred since the 1970s, with the 20 warmest years having \n     occurred since 1981 and with all 10 of the warmest years \n     occurring in the past 12 years. Even though the 2000s \n     witnessed a solar output decline resulting in an unusually \n     deep solar minimum in 2007-2009, surface temperatures \n     continue to increase.\n\n  On ocean temperatures and sea level rise, NASA said:\n\n       The oceans have absorbed much of this increased heat, with \n     the top 2,300 feet showing warming of 0.302 degrees \n     Fahrenheit since 1969. Global sea level rose about 6.7 inches \n     in the last century. The rate in the last decade, however, is \n     nearly double that of the last century.\n\n  On ocean acidification, this quote from NASA:\n\n       Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the \n     acidity of surface ocean waters has increased by about 30 \n     percent. This increase is the result of humans emitting more \n     carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n\n  Let me say that again:\n\n       This increase is the result of humans emitting more carbon \n     dioxide into the atmosphere. The amount of carbon dioxide \n     absorbed by the upper layer of the oceans is increasing by \n     about 2 billion tons per year.\n\n  NASA scientists put a man on the Moon. NASA scientists have a rover \nright now driving around on the surface of the planet Mars. They are \nnot the quacks. Our Nation's best and brightest minds accept the \nevidence of climate change and they are urging us to act.\n  Yet still, for some in this body, the deniers carry the day. Why? In \na weekend editorial entitled ``Flight from Facts''--``Flight from \nFacts''--my home State Providence Journal said:\n\n       [The] GOP is winning the race to avoid evidence--some of \n     this escapism based on a desire to hold on to what had been \n     comforting, if error-based, traditional beliefs, and some of \n     it to avoid policies that might be economically and otherwise \n     inconvenient.\n\n  Whatever the reason, the price of our folly will be very high for \nfuture generations.\n  One of the things I have noticed on this floor is that when it is a \nquestion of putting the cost of taking care of their grandparents on \nour children and grandchildren, oh, how the Republican crocodile tears \nflow about that unfair burden on children and grandchildren. In one of \ntheir attacks on Medicare and Social Security, which the Republicans \nlike to call entitlements, we heard this:\n\n       We have got a serious spending problem here . . . and we \n     need to have an impact on entitlements . . . if we're going \n     to have entitlements for our children and grandchildren when \n     they reach retirement age, we have got to change the \n     trajectory.\n\n  The minority leader has also spoken about what appears in his remarks \nto be the health care bill--the ObamaCare bill--and he worried about it \n``creating a more precarious future for our children.''\n  The minority leader has said this about the stimulus effort to get \nour economy back on its feet: ``This needs to stop for the future of \nour country and for our children and for our grandchildren.''\n  When it is the deficit, he has urged us ``to make sure we have the \nsame kind of country for our children and grandchildren that our \nparents left for us.'' He has even talked about ``the Europeanization \nof America,'' and as a result of that Europeanization of America--\nwhatever that is--he has said, ``Our children and grandchildren could \nno longer expect to have the same opportunities that we've had.''\n  On virtually every traditional anti-Obama Republican tea party \nbugbear--Medicare, ObamaCare, the stimulus, the deficit, even this \nEuropeanization of America--out come the children and grandchildren. \nLet's assume they are sincere. Let's assume they have a sincere concern \nfor what we are leaving to our children and grandchildren.\n  So when it comes to big corporate polluters of today leaving our \nchildren and grandchildren a damaged and more dangerous planet, where \nthen is the concern for those children and grandchildren? To have \nchildren and grandchildren pay for the care of their grandparents \nthrough Medicare and Social Security is some kind of sin or outrage, \nbut to force on those same children and grandchildren the untold costs \nand consequences of the harms done by today's corporate polluters, what \ndo they have to say about that? For that, the future generations' \ninterests receive nothing from the Republican Party but stony silence \nor phony and calculated denial.\n  But the cost will be on them. The cost of our negligence and folly in \nnot addressing our carbon pollution will fall on our children and our \ngrandchildren. The cost will be on them and the shame will be on us.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in a few moments the distinguished chair \nof the Finance Committee and the Senator from Utah will commence debate \non H.R. 6156, the Russia and Moldova Jackson-Vanik Repeal and Sergei \nMagnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012. Because of scheduling \nconcerns, I am speaking on this in morning business, and that will \nallow time for other Members to speak.\n  I come to the floor today to support this bill. It has a very \nimportant twofold purpose: It approves normal trade relations with \nRussia, and at the same time the legislation insists that the Russian \nGovernment adhere to the rule of law. It does so by putting \nconsequences in place for those in Russia who abuse basic human rights.\n  Granting PNTR to Russia is a big win for Americans. If Congress does \nnot act, American workers, including millions employed by small \nbusinesses, stand to lose out to foreign competitors as Russia opens \nits market as a new member of the WTO.\n  Many in my home State of Mississippi and around the country deserve \nto benefit from increased trade that this new relationship would bring. \nMore jobs and greater economic growth are our potential rewards here in \nthe United States. Last year Mississippi's $55 million in exports to \nRussia helped support an estimated 170 jobs. Certainly this number \nneeds to grow, and I believe it will under this legislation.\n  Yet in realizing the immense trade potential at hand, we cannot \nignore the urgent need to address serious concerns about Russia's \nappalling human rights record. Most agree that the Jackson-Vanik \namendment currently in place is an outdated restriction on trade which \ncould hurt American competitiveness. But repeal alone will not suffice \nwhen dealing with a country that continues to protect corrupt \nofficials, and that is what the Russian Government continues to do.\n  The Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act is a necessary \nreplacement for Jackson-Vanik. The legislation targets human rights \nviolators by imposing restrictions on their financial activities and \ntravel. It recognizes that the privilege of using America's banking \nsystem and acquiring a U.S. visa should be denied to those who disgrace \nhuman dignity and justice.\n  Facts need to be retold today about the case of Sergei Magnitsky \nafter whom this legislation is named. Sergei Magnitsky was a lawyer and \npartner with an American-owned law firm based in Moscow. He was married \nand had two children. In his investigative work on behalf of the \nHermitage Fund, the largest foreign portfolio investor in Russia, Mr. \nMagnitsky uncovered the largest tax rebate fraud in Russian history. He \nfound that Russian Interior Ministry officers, tax officials, and \norganized criminals had worked together to steal $230 million in public \nfunds.\n  In 2008 Mr. Magnitsky voluntarily gave sworn testimony against \nofficials from the Interior Ministry, Russian tax departments, and the \nprivate criminals whom he discovered were complicit in the fraud. A \nmonth later, instead of being commended for doing the right\n\n[[Page S7430]]\n\nthing, Mr. Magnitsky was arrested in front of his wife and children and \nplaced in pretrial detention. He was held without a trial for 1 year. \nThe Russian Federal Security Service deemed Mr. Magnitsky was a flight \nrisk to prolong his detention, based on false claims that he had a U.K. \nvisa application.\n  While in custody, Mr. Magnitsky was tortured by officials, hoping he \nwould withdraw his testimony, and falsely incriminate himself and his \nclient. Refusing to do so, his conditions and his health worsened. He \nstayed in an overcrowded cell with no heat, no sunlight, and no toilet. \nThe lights were kept on throughout the night to deprive him of sleep. \nMr. Magnitsky lost 40 pounds and suffered from severe pancreatitis and \ngallstones.\n  Months went by without any access to medical care. Despite hundreds \nof petitions, requests for medical examination and surgery were denied \nby Russian Government officials. So were family visits. After his \narrest Mr. Magnitsky saw his wife once and never again saw his \nchildren.\n  On November 13, 2009, Sergei Magnitsky's condition deteriorated \ndramatically. Doctors saw him on November 16. He was transferred to a \nMoscow detention center that had medical facilities and, instead of \nbeing treated there immediately, he was placed in an isolation cell, \nhandcuffed, beaten, and subsequently Sergei Magnitsky died.\n  After his death, Russian officials repeatedly denied the facts \nsurrounding his health condition. Requests by his family for an \nindependent autopsy were rejected. Detention center officials said Mr. \nMagnitsky's abdominal membrane had ruptured and that he died from toxic \nshock. The official cause of death would blame heart failure.\n  According to the Russian State Investigative Committee, Mr. Magnitsky \nwas not pressured and tortured but died naturally of heart disease. The \ncommittee said his death was ``nobody's fault.''\n  For 3 years not a single person has been prosecuted for Mr. \nMagnitsky's false arrest, torture, murder, or for the massive fraud \nthat he had the courage to expose. Like many of my colleagues, I \ncontinue to have real concerns about the current state of human rights \nand rule of law in Russia. I have come to the floor on numerous \noccasions demanding accountability for Russia's rampant extrajudicial \noffenses.\n  Tragically, Mr. Magnitsky is not the only victim of the country's \ncriminal regime. The cases of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Planton Lebedev, \nwho remain in prison, are also poignant examples of the corruption that \npervades the Russian Government. My friend, the junior Senator from \nMaryland, has shown tremendous leadership on this issue and I commend \nhim for his steadfast dedication to the highest standard of democracy \nand justice. I have long supported Senator Cardin's efforts to use the \nMagnitsky Act as a way to protect human rights globally.\n  The Magnitsky Act is a simple straightforward call for justice. It \nsignals to the world that America will uphold its commitment to the \nprotection of human rights and the rule of law. It is a tool that could \nbe extremely powerful in penalizing human rights violators everywhere. \nMany of us had hoped to achieve a bicameral consensus in applying the \nMagnitsky Act globally. Although global language is not included in the \nHouse bill being considered today, sanctions against human rights \nviolations in Russia and within the Russian Government are still an \nimportant victory. It moves us in the right direction.\n  I hope we can work in the next Congress to consider broadening the \nreach of the Magnitsky Act. Russia is not alone in its human rights \nabuses and the United States' unwavering stance against corruption \nshould not stop there.\n  PNTR with Russia is an important vehicle for American trade and it \nshould serve as a reminder of our country's role in promoting the \nadvancement of human rights. At the same time, I remain committed to \nsupporting this role as we move forward.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We share a \ngreat partnership together as chairman of our two committees focused on \ntrade and on the relationship with Russia, both of which come together \nin the legislation today.\n  I would be remiss, however, if I didn't say a word about what \nconsumed us yesterday with the vote on the disabilities treaty. It is \ncertainly a moment that stands out in my memories of my time in the \nSenate. I can't think of any other time when a former majority leader \nhas come to the floor--a veteran--who sought to have his colleagues \njoin together in supporting something that would improve the lives of \npeople with disabilities.\n  I am not going to go back and reargue it now. That would be fruitless \nand I think not helpful to where we want to move to. What we want to \nmove to is a place where we can pass this. I can say--I believe this--I \ncan say to Senator Robert Dole that we will pass the disabilities \ntreaty and we will pass it, I believe, early next year. I base that on \nthe fact that some Senators had difficulties with the fact that we are \nin a lameduck session and they had signed a letter which, regrettably, \nsome of them didn't digest completely but nevertheless signed, saying \nthey wouldn't take up a treaty in a lameduck session and I think some \nfelt compelled by that and others felt compelled by other things.\n  But here is what I think we can do. Starting next year, I believe we \ncan move to additional hearings that can make crystal clear to all \ncolleagues the state, as it may not have been yesterday in some cases, \nwith respect to both the law and the facts as it applies to persons \nwith disabilities. I pledge now to make certain that within the \nresolution of advice and consent, any concern that was not adequately \naddressed--I personally believe they were addressed--it is possible we \ncan find the language that will address the concerns of any Senator who \nyesterday felt--whether it was the United Nations or homeschooling, I \nbelieve those things can be adequately addressed. I do know a number of \nSenators said they would be prepared to vote for it after we are out of \nthe lameduck session, and I am confident we will pass the disabilities \ntreaty in a different atmosphere and in a different time.\n  One of the things I learned from my senior colleague Ted Kennedy, who \ndid this for so many years, is that perseverance pays off when the \nissue is worth fighting for and we always have another day and another \nvote in the Senate. That always affords us the opportunity to make \nthings right. We are certainly going to try and do that.\n  This PNTR-Magnitsky bill is, in fact, one of those opportunities \nwhere we can start to put the Senate on the right track, and I think \nall of us look forward to the chance to be able to do that.\n  This bill passed the House of Representatives by a huge margin of 365 \nto 43. What it would do is establish permanent normal trade relations \nfor Russia, and it would require the identification and imposition of \nsanctions on individuals who are responsible for the detention, abuse \nand death of Sergei\n\n[[Page S7431]]\n\nMagnitsky and other gross violations of human rights.\n  Let me make my best argument, if I can, in favor of the bill, and \nthen I wish to turn the discussion over to the ranking member, Senator \nHatch, to present his case for passage. After that, the Presiding \nOfficer of the Senate at this moment, the Senator from Maryland, Mr. \nCardin, will lead a discussion of the provisions of the act related to \nhonoring the memory of Sergei Magnitsky and combating the types of \nhuman rights abuses that led to his premature and tragic death. I wish \nto congratulate the Presiding Officer and salute him for his \nsignificant efforts. He has been dogged, and that component of this \nlegislation would not be here today if it weren't for the efforts of \nthe Senator from Maryland. Chairman Baucus will then have been able to \nreturn to manage the rest of the consideration on the floor at that \ntime.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, Chairman Baucus and I lead the two \nSenate committees that are charged with overseeing the twin pillars of \nAmerica's unique role in the world. Our commitment to open, transparent \nand free markets and our commitment to democracy and open discourse is \na force for international peace. We believe our global economic \ninterests and our foreign policy values are closely tied together. They \nshould be closely tied together. That is why we urge our colleagues to \nseize this opportunity that Russia's accession to the World Trade \nOrganization presents for both job creation and our ability to bind \nRussia to a rule-based system of trade and dispute resolution.\n  Granting Russia permanent normal trade relations is as much in our \ninterests as it is in theirs. Frankly, that is what ought to guide the \nchoices we make in the Senate. The upside of this policy is clear on an \ninternational landscape. It is one that rarely offers this kind of what \nI would call, frankly, a kind of one-sided trade deal--one that \npromises billions of dollars in new U.S. exports and thousands of new \njobs in America. That is certainly in our interests.\n  Today, Russia is the world's seventh largest economy. Having \nofficially joined the WTO on August 22, Russia is now required by its \nmembership in the WTO to lower tariffs and open to new imports. That \nsudden jump in market access is, frankly, important to any country that \nis the first country through the door, and if we don't pass this trade \nlegislation, we will not be among those countries.\n  I can tell my colleagues Massachusetts, speaking for my State, \nwelcomes access to the Russian market, and we want that access to be \nplayed out on a level playing field. The State of Massachusetts \nexported $120 million worth of goods to Russia last year, and those \nexports obviously support hundreds of jobs. But if we don't pass this \nbill, those exports will face competition from other countries that \nwill not pay the same high-level tariff we currently pay.\n  Let's take one specific example. Massachusetts exported $18.5 million \nin medical equipment to Russia in 2011, but we face strong competition \nfrom China, which has increased its share of the Russian market in each \nof the last 10 years. We don't shy away from strong competition, but we \nwant that competition to be able to be played out on an even playing \nfield. As long as we don't have normal permanent trade relations with \nRussia, we are disadvantaging ourselves. It simply doesn't make sense. \nSince joining the WTO, Russia agreed to reduce average tariffs on \nmedical equipment to 4.3 percent and to cut its top tariffs from 15 \npercent down to 7 percent. As it stands now, that is a benefit China \nwill get and we will not. It simply doesn't make sense to anybody.\n\n  To grant Russia PNTR status requires us to repeal the 1974 Jackson-\nVanik amendment. A lot of our staff members, I hasten to say, were not \neven born back when Jackson-Vanik was put in place. Many of our \ncolleagues and a lot of our staff have studied the Soviet Union but \nhave never experienced that period of time. What we are living with is \na complete and total relic of a bygone era.\n  Congress passed Jackson-Vanik during the Cold War to pressure the \nSoviet Union to allow Russian Jews to be able to emigrate freely. It \nwas very successful. It worked, and as a result, the Kremlin worked \nwith us and others to help Jews be able to emigrate. As a result, every \nsingle U.S. President has, regardless of political party, waived \nJackson-Vanik's requirements for Russia since 1994. The American-Israel \nPublic Affairs Committee, the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, and \nthe Government of Israel now all support the repeal of Jackson-Vanik \nfor Russia. With too many Americans still searching for jobs all across \nour country, our manufacturing sector needs every boost it can get. We \ncannot afford to retain Jackson-Vanik any longer. This is in America's \ninterest. Despite progress, our trade deficit remains too wide, and I \nthink that seizing this opportunity to increase exports to Russia is \none very obvious way to be able to make concrete progress in reducing \nthat trade deficit.\n  U.S. exports to Russia total more than $9 billion a year. \nEstablishing PNTR for Russia could double that number in just 5 years, \naccording to one recent study. That could mean thousands of new jobs \nacross every sector of our economy. With the Russian economy's \nimpressive growth, it is actually--Russia is expected to outgrow \nGermany by about 2029, so it is steadily growing in the world \nmarketplace. The long-run gains for everybody would be even greater.\n  None of us is going to suggest that every issue with respect to \nRussia has been resolved. We know there are still points of tension, \nand some of them in the foreign policy area are very relevant today, \nfor instance, over Syria. We understand that. We hope recent events in \nSyria may be moving Russia and the United States closer in terms of our \nthinking. But it is only a good thing to bring Russia into a rules-\nbased system with mechanisms for peaceful, transparent dispute \nresolution.\n  There is no debate--and I think the Presiding Officer knows this full \nwell--that the very tragic and senseless death of anticorruption lawyer \nSergei Magnitsky, who died while in Russian custody--is simply \nunacceptable. It is appalling, and it highlights a human rights problem \nthat has grown in its scope, not diminished. It is one we hope to be \nable to resolve with good relationships and good discussions.\n  Senator Cardin, the sponsor of that legislation in the House and in \nthe Senate, is going to speak shortly about it, and I will leave him to \ndescribe in full the nature of that particular component of this bill. \nBut suffice it to say that human rights, democracy, and transparency \nactivists in Russia favor the passage of constructive human rights \nlegislation in our Congress, and they also see WTO membership and \nincreased trade for the United States as an avenue toward progress. So \nthere is no contradiction in what is happening. They understand, as we \nall should, that repealing Jackson-Vanik is not a blanket acceptance of \nany particular policy or approach in Russia. It is certainly not an \nacceptance of what happened with respect to Sergei Magnitsky and that \nis because of the Magnitsky legislation.\n  Repealing the bill--repealing Jackson-Vanik--is not an economic \ngiveaway to Russia. To the contrary, it represents, as I have \ndescribed, an enormous opportunity for the United States to compete on \na fair playing field with other countries and to create more jobs in \nthe United States. By establishing PNTR with Russia, U.S. businesses \nwill win increased market access without giving up anything in return. \nThere would be no tariff changes, no market concessions, nothing. It, \nfrankly, diminishes the willingness of some hard-liners in Russia to \ndistort the current dialog and to distort the possibilities of a better \nrelationship, which we want with Russia. By taking this away, we will \nreduce the abuse of Jackson-Vanik as a rhetorical tool to rally anti-\nAmerican sentiment in Russia. I believe we can do something very \nimportant here today and both our economy and our foreign policy will \nbe better for the effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we will soon vote on H.R. 6156, the Russia \nand Moldova Jackson-Vanik Repeal and Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law \nAccountability Act of 2012. The trade elements of the bill are \nidentical to legislation which passed the Senate Finance Committee by \nunanimous vote on July\n\n[[Page S7432]]\n\n18, 2012. The bill repeals the application of the Jackson-Vanik \namendment to Russia and Moldova, which will enable U.S. workers and job \ncreators to fully benefit from Russia and Moldova's accession to the \nWorld Trade Organization. The bill will also put into place new tools \nto help stop human rights abuse and battle systemic corruption within \nRussia.\n  After 18 years of hard fought negotiations under both Republican and \nDemocratic administrations, President Obama finalized the terms of \nRussia's accession to the WTO on November 10, 2011. Russia was invited \nto join the organization on December 16, 2011, and officially joined in \nAugust of this year. Now that Russia is a member of the WTO, for our \nworkers to benefit Congress has no choice but to extend permanent \nnormal relations to Russia through repeal of the application of the \nJackson-Vanik amendment.\n  Russia is now a member of the WTO, but they are under no obligation \nto extend the economic benefits of their membership to the United \nStates unless we have permanent normal trade relations. Simply put, if \nCongress does not act, our workers and exporters will be at a serious \ndisadvantage in trying to export their goods and services to the \nRussian market, and that will cost us jobs at home. Given our weak \neconomic recovery, if it is a recovery, it is critical that Congress \ndoes everything it can to help U.S. workers to compete.\n  There are many economic benefits to Russia's WTO accession. Under the \nterms of its accession, Russia must cut tariffs on manufactured \nproducts, reduce duties on farm products, open its service markets to \nU.S. firms, meet international intellectual property rights standards, \nand reduce customs clearance fees. If Russia fails to meet any of its \ncommitments, Russia will be subject to WTO dispute settlement \nproceedings.\n  Russia is an attractive market for American exporters. It is the \nworld's 11th largest economy with more than 140 million consumers and \nthe last major economy to join the World Trade Organization. American \ncompanies and workers must compete on a level playing field with their \nforeign competitors in Russia to succeed.\n  When President Obama first asked Congress to remove Russia from \nlongstanding human rights legislation and grant permanent normal trade \nrelations for Russia, he suggested that we do it unconditionally. Even \nbefore Russia joined the WTO, President Obama and his team argued that \nCongress should quickly pass a clean bill. Given the myriad problems we \nhave with Russia, it has always been very hard for me to understand \nthis position. President Obama and his team appeared almost manic in \ntheir attempts to avoid offending President Putin and his government or \ndoing anything at all to upset their failed reset policy.\n  Fortunately, just as Congress did in 1974 when they created Jackson-\nVanik, we insisted on more. Working side by side with our Senate and \nHouse colleagues in both parties, we drafted a bill which serves our \neconomy and replaces the application of the Jackson-Vanik amendment \nwith policies more appropriate for the realities in Russia today. We \nshould all be justly proud of our bipartisan effort. Basically, the \nbill we will vote on fills many of the gaps in President Obama's policy \ntoward Russia.\n  For example, rather than ignore continuing human rights abuses and \ncorruption in Russia, my friends and colleagues, Senators McCain and \nCardin, joined together with many others to craft a bill to help combat \ndeep-rooted and institutionalized corruption within Russia. This bill \nbecame the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law and Accountability Act. By the \nend of this debate, the American people will be intimately familiar \nwith the name Sergei Magnitsky.\n  Briefly, Sergei was a Russian tax lawyer investigated by the Russian \nGovernment for alleged tax evasion and fraud. In reality, Sergei was \ntargeted by government officials for his role in uncovering tax fraud \nand corruption within the Russian Government. Sergei was arrested and \nheld for 11 months without trial. While in prison, Sergei was subject \nto mistreatment and torture and was eventually beaten to death. \nUnfortunately, such sad stories are all too common in Russia today.\n  Rather than tolerate such injustice, my friends, Senators McCain and \nCardin, introduced legislation to impose sanctions on individuals \nresponsible for, or who benefited financially from, the detention, \nabuse, and/or death of Sergei Magnitsky, as well as other human rights \nabusers. Their efforts resulted in the inclusion of provisions in this \nbill which impose visa restrictions and asset freezes on those involved \nin human rights abuses in Russia.\n  This will be a powerful new tool to battle corruption within Russia, \nas corrupt Russian officials will no longer be able to travel to the \nUnited States or hide their ill-gotten gains in many Western \ninstitutions.\n  The Magnitsky Act represents an admirable replacement of the Jackson-\nVanik amendment, and it is designed to address the situation in Russia \ntoday. President Obama opposed efforts to include these provisions, \nconcerned that holding Russian Government officials accountable for \ntheir crimes might offend President Putin and undermine the \nadministration's ill-conceived reset policy.\n  I am proud that my House and Senate colleagues stood firm on the side \nof justice and demanded that these provisions be included. Jackson-\nVanik served its purpose with respect to Russia and should be revoked, \nbut in its place we should respond to Russia's continued corruption and \nhuman rights violations.\n  There were many other gaps in President Obama's Russia policy. To \nhelp fill these gaps, I worked with my Senate Finance Committee \ncolleagues to add provisions to the permanent normal trade relations \nbill introduced by our chairman, Mr. Baucus, that address a number of \nthese issues.\n  First, I worked with Senator Kyl to develop language to further \nadvance anti-corruption efforts in Russia by requiring the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative and the Secretary of State to report annually on their \nefforts to promote the rule of law and U.S. investment in Russia. We \nalso included a provision to assist U.S. businesses, especially small \nbusinesses, to battle corruption in Russia by requiring the Secretary \nof Commerce to devote a phone hotline and secure Web site to allow U.S. \ncitizens and businesses to report on corruption, bribery, and attempted \nbribery in Russia and to request the assistance of the U.S. Government \nif needed.\n  I was also highly disappointed that the administration did not \nfinalize an SPS equivalency agreement with Russia before agreeing to \nlet them join the WTO. Under an SPS equivalency agreement, Russia would \nrecognize our food safety standards as equivalent to its own, thereby \nreducing costs and burdensome paperwork on U.S. exporters. Today's bill \nrequires the Trade Representative to continue efforts to negotiate a \nbilateral SPS equivalency agreement with Russia. In an effort to apply \ncontinued pressure on the administration to resolve these problems, we \nincluded language requiring the Trade Representative to report to \nCongress annually on Russia's implementation of its WTO sanitary and \nphyto-sanitary obligations.\n  Intellectual property rights protection in Russia remains poor. To \nmake sure that Russia meets its commitments in this area, we included \nlanguage requiring the Trade Representative to report annually on \nRussia's compliance with its WTO intellectual property rights \nobligations. As part of its accession package, Russia committed to \njoining the WTO Information Technology Agreement. Once they are a \nmember, this agreement will allow a number of additional U.S. high-\ntechnology products to be exported to Russia duty free. Unfortunately, \nRussia has to date failed to fully live up to this commitment, even \nthough Russia became a member of the WTO in August. To ensure that the \nadministration holds Russia's feet to the fire, the Trade \nRepresentative must report annually on Russia's compliance with this \ncommitment as well as its commitment to join the WTO Government \nProcurement Agreement.\n\n  When Ambassador Ron Kirk testified before the committee in June, he \ncommitted to continue efforts to develop an intellectual property \nrights action plan which implements Russia's obligations under a 2006 \nbilateral IPR agreement with the United States. That agreement goes \nbeyond Russia's WTO\n\n[[Page S7433]]\n\ncommitments, requiring, among other things, that Russia take \nenforcement actions against Russia-based Web sites posting infringing \ncontent, implement the World Intellectual Property Organization \ncopyright treaty and performances and phonograms treaty, and enact a \nsystem of data exclusivity for pharmaceuticals.\n  I understand the administration is working on completing that action \nplan quickly and that our workers will soon be able to benefit from the \nagreement reached in 2006. To ensure that this is the case, this bill \nrequires the administration to continue efforts to finalize that \nagreement.\n  Russia's WTO commitments go far beyond intellectual property rights. \nGiven President Obama's past reluctance to hold Russia accountable for \nits actions, I wanted to make a tool available to Congress and the \nAmerican people to put pressure on the administration to make sure that \nRussia lives up to its international commitments. So we included \nlanguage which provides an opportunity for public comment and hearings \non Russia's compliance with its obligations. If there are areas where \nRussia is not in compliance with its obligations, the administration is \nrequired to develop an action plan to address them and then provide an \nannual report on their enforcement efforts to bring Russia into \ncompliance.\n  I believe this package of modifications vastly improves the bill. The \nTrade Representative's general counsel apparently agrees, stating \nduring congressional testimony that ``this bill provides the strongest \npackage of enforcement measures for us at USTR to move forward and \nensure full compliance once Russia joins the WTO.''\n  It was over 30 years ago that Senator Henry Jackson and Congressman \nCharles Vanik stood up to their President and demanded that the \nadministration address policies that denied individuals, especially \nJews, the right to emigrate from Russia and other communist nations. \nTheir work became known as the Jackson-Vanik amendment. The policies \nembodied in that amendment helped create the environment for literally \nhundreds of thousands of Jews to emigrate from the former Soviet Union, \nmany of them to their homeland of Israel.\n  Jackson-Vanik served its purpose in Russia, but today we act to \naddress the issues on the ground in Russia as we debate this bill. \nToday Congress will once again lead the way to help shape the future of \nU.S.-Russian relations. Approval of this bill will help establish a \nframework for addressing the myriad economic problems we face with \nRussia's Government. If the administration uses these tools \neffectively, we will see the fruits of our efforts, as we one day work \nside by side with a Russia free from corruption and in full compliance \nwith its international obligations. I urge my colleagues to join me--\nand my colleagues on the other side of the floor and my colleagues here \nwho are for this bill--in support of this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I understand we are, in effect, debating Russian PNTR. \nRobert Louis Stevenson once said, ``The mark of a good action is that \nit appears inevitable in retrospect.'' When I traveled to Russia in \nFebruary, many doubted that Congress would establish permanent normal \ntrade relations, known as PNTR, with Russia this year. But in July the \nSenate Finance Committee unanimously approved legislation to do just \nthat. And last month the House of Representatives passed very similar \nRussia PNTR legislation with 365 ``yes'' votes. Passing PNTR clearly is \na good action for the United States. It is also an obvious one. Why \nobvious? Jobs. PNTR will mean more job opportunities for American \nfarmers, ranchers, businesses, and workers.\n  Russia is a fast-growing market. For the United States to share in \nthat growth, we must first pass PNTR. If we do, American exports to \nRussia are projected to double in 5 years. When Russia joined the World \nTrade Organization in August, it lowered its trade barriers to all WTO \nmembers who have PNTR with Russia. This is no small matter.\n  It includes lower tariffs on aircraft and auto exports, larger quotas \nfor beef exports and greater access to Russian telecommunications and \nbanking markets. It also includes strong commitments to protect \nintellectual property and to follow sound science on agricultural \nimports. It includes greater transparency on Russian laws and binding \nWTO dispute settlement. All very important.\n  One hundred fifty-five countries already receive these benefits in \nRussia. They receive those benefits right now. That is to say, every \nsingle member of the World Trade Organization--all 155 countries--\nexcept one, the United States of America, receives those benefits. So \nright now, companies and workers in China, Canada, and Europe can take \nfull advantage of these export opportunities in Russia, the world's \nsixth largest economy. But U.S. companies and workers cannot.\n  We cannot let this stand. When Russia joined the World Trade \nOrganization in August, we Americans gave up nothing. We will give up \nnothing if we pass PNTR legislation now. We change no U.S. tariffs, we \nchange no U.S. trade laws. This is a one-sided deal in favor of \nAmerican exporters.\n  In my home State of Montana, one out of five 5 jobs today is tied to \nagriculture. Ranching is a major driver of our agricultural economy. \nWhen Montana ranchers can sell more beef in Russia, they can support \nmore workers in Montana. It is that simple. It is a similar story in \nStates all across our country.\n  I know that passing PNTR will not solve all of our trade problems \nwith Russia, but it gives us new tools to tackle these problems, such \nas binding dispute settlements. Thanks to the efforts of Senators \nHatch, Stabenow, Rockefeller, Brown of Ohio, and others, this bill \nincludes strong measures to ensure Russian compliance with its WTO \nobligations and that the administration enforces them.\n  This legislation also includes the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law \nAccountability Act to help fight criminal rights abuses in Russia. In \n1974, Senator Jackson and Congressman Vanik teamed together to pass \nlegislation called the Jackson-Vanik bill, which this legislation \nrepeals. Jackson-Vanik addressed one of the biggest human rights abuses \nin Russia at that time. And it succeeded. For the last 20 years, Jews \nhave been able to freely emigrate from Russia, what Jackson-Vanik was \ntrying to address.\n  Jackson-Vanik is outdated. Jews can emigrate from Russia and this is \nno longer an issue. Senator Cardin has courageously pushed the \nMagnitsky legislation for years. I commend him. The Magnitsky \nprovisions in this legislation address one of the biggest human rights \nabuses in Russia today. The bill would punish those responsible for the \ndeath of anticorruption lawyer Sergei Magnitsky and others who commit \nhuman rights violations in Russia. It would do so by restricting their \nU.S. visas and freezing their U.S. assets.\n  Passing PNTR along with these provisions is the right thing to do. In \nclosing, I urge my colleagues to follow the words of Robert Louis \nStevenson and take good action. Every day we wait, U.S. farmers, \nranchers, businesses, and workers fall farther behind their \ncompetitors. We owe it to them to pass this legislation. We owe it to \nthem to make it inevitable.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Ohio is ready \nto speak?\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Yes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. How much time does the Senator wish to have?\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Five minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Ohio be \nallowed to speak for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S7434]]\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, the bill extending permanent normal \ntrade relations to Russia is a positive step for American business and \nAmerican workers. I have been critical of both Democratic and \nRepublican administration approaches to trade negotiations and \nenforcement in the past. I think the improved enforcement reporting \nrequirements in this legislation are a step in the right direction \ntoward monitoring and toward enforcement of Russia's commitments made \nas part of its new membership in the World Trade Organization.\n  For too long, both Democratic and Republican administrations have \nnegotiated trade agreements that undermine rather than maximize \nAmerican job creation. Too often these agreements have failed to demand \nthat our partners follow the same rules we do. Too often our government \nhas not held our trade partners accountable when they do not meet \ncommitments to which they have already agreed. We have seen this in our \ntrade relationship with China for more than a decade. From currency \nmanipulation to intellectual property theft, to failing to offer \nreciprocal access to its government procurement market, to hoarding \nrare earth materials, the People's Republic of China has ignored its \ninternational commitments and obligations.\n  For more than a decade, American workers and manufacturers, \nespecially in a State such as mine, Ohio, have paid the price. There \nwere thousands of lost jobs, a trade deficit that grew from $83 billion \nin 2001 to $295 billion in 2011 and a deficit in auto parts alone that \nwent from about $1 billion a decade ago to about $10 billion today.\n  More recently, though, President Obama stood up to China issues on \nsteel, which led to a new steel mill in Youngstown, OH; more steel jobs \nin Cleveland and Lorain, OH; on tires, which have translated into more \njobs in Findlay, OH; and on aluminum, which has meant more jobs in \nHeath and Sidney, OH. That is obviously good news in my State and \naround the country. But our experience in China proves we must more \nclosely monitor our trade partners' commitments before workers and \nbusinesses are injured by them.\n  As part of its WTO accession, Russia committed to lower tariffs on \nmanufactured goods to ensure predictability by capping quota levels and \nto meet international standards on intellectual property rights. I am \npleased to see the legislation extending Russia PNTR includes \nenforcement measures much stronger than the China PNTR, several based \non legislation I introduced earlier this year.\n  By requiring the U.S. Trade Representative to monitor Russia's \ncompliance with its WTO obligations to publish an annual report and our \nactions to promote compliance and establish a formal and public process \nfor workers to weigh in on Russia's progress in anticipation and before \nviolations or failing to follow the rule of law might take place, we \ncan ensure that our trade relations with Russia put our interests first \nto build confidence, that our government can enforce the rules. Again, \nprior to potential misbehavior--as we saw with China--we will likely \nnot see this from Russia because of this. Similar to any trade \nagreement, commitments must be adhered to; otherwise, they are not \nworth negotiating.\n  As an additional measure of commitment, I appreciate the \nadministration's response to my request. Senior personnel at the Office \nof the U.S. Trade Representative, at USTR, who have served our \ngovernment in Russia and are fluent in Russian are held accountable for \nmonitoring Russia's compliance with its WTO commitments. Again, this is \nsomething we didn't do a decade-plus ago with the People's Republic of \nChina.\n  Japan and Europe have already threatened to take Russia to the WTO \nover a number of unfair trade restrictions, including on autos. The \nUnited States will need to be vigilant on these issues as well. This \nwork that Chairman Baucus did, that the House Ways and Means did, and \nthe administration has done and will continue to do gives us that \nopportunity to be more vigilant and more effective.\n  Our workers, our farmers, our ranchers, and producers should have \nconfidence that the trade deal signed will actually be enforced. For \ncompanies in my State, such as Proctor & Gamble, Goodyear or Alcoa, \nthat stand to export more goods to Russia because of PNTR, enforcement \nof the rules matter. Whether economic opportunities for our businesses \nand our workers from Russia's PNTR, we can't ignore the Russian \nGovernment's consolidation of power and crackdown on political \nopponents, including the Russian media. Despite these challenges, \nthough, we should not turn our backs as Russia continues breaking free \nfrom its totalitarian past. These are strong economic and democratic \nforces that are moving forward in Russia. These forces for change must \nbe supported and must be allowed to grow. We must not forget how far \nRussia has come or how far it has to go.\n  About 40 years ago, Senator Jackson from Washington State and \nCongressman Vanik from my State of Ohio--the son of a Cleveland \nbutcher--offered an amendment to a trade bill that used the leverage of \nthe U.S. market to deny favorable trade status.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 \nadditional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. This was to deny favorable trade status to \ncountries that restrict immigration. Jackson-Vanik became antiquated \nmore than a decade ago, but it proved that trade can be an instrument \nfor improving human rights and the rule of law.\n  PNTR now includes the important Magnitsky legislation, which will \nimpose travel and financial penalties on officials responsible for \nhuman rights abuses abroad. I commend Senator Cardin for his leadership \non this issue, on this important amendment.\n  As the administration looks ahead to trade initiatives such as TPP \nand the United States-European Union Trade Agreement, Congress can take \nsteps now, new steps, to assure the benefits of expanded trade reach \nworkers, reach small manufacturers, not just large corporations. \nSeveral colleagues and I have proposed legislation updating our \nnegotiating objectives on labor, on the environment, on import safety, \nand to restore congressional oversight to future trade negotiations to \nagreements and especially to their enforcement. It is time we practice \ntrade so it achieves real results for middle-class families in \npromoting job creation.\n  While the Russia PNTR represents a positive step forward, we must \nbuild on this step to ensure that over the long term, promises made are \npromises kept.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, tomorrow this body will vote to advance \nlegislation that will grant permanent normal trade relations with \nRussia and, in so doing, repeal the Cold War-era Jackson-Vanik \nsanctions that denied most-favored nation status to China.\n  As part of this comprehensive package, the Senate will also pass the \nso-called Magnitsky bill. This piece of legislation was inspired by a \nyoung Russian attorney, Sergei Magnitsky, who died in police custody in \n2009 after he was jailed on trumped-up charges for exposing a vast web \nof corruption and tax fraud by some of Russia's most senior officials.\n  Sergei's story, extensively reported and documented by human rights \nactivists, business leaders, journalists, and others, helped stir a \nbipartisan group of Senators led by our colleague Senator Ben Cardin to \ndraft legislation to hold accountable officials from all over the world \nwho disregard basic human rights and fail to uphold the rule of law, \nincluding those responsible for the murder of Sergei Magnitsky.\n\n  Unfortunately, the legislation before us is deficient. While I do not \nintend to make perfection the enemy of the good, this bill falls short \nof the longstanding objective of this body to demonstrate a sustained \ncommitment to the long tradition of U.S. leadership in the fight \nagainst corruption and human rights abuses around the world.\n  Regrettably, the House-passed bill deals only with Russian officials. \nSergei Magnitsky's story could have been lost. It was kept alive by \nimpassioned and inspired friends and supporters in Russia.\n  But from Pyongyang to Minsk, to Harare, and elsewhere, there are many\n\n[[Page S7435]]\n\nwho remain voiceless under despots and strongmen and lack the advocates \nand resources to detail their abuses and seek justice, whether through \ndocumentary film or newspaper stories.\n  That is why the Senate bill went beyond the particular case of Sergei \nMagnitsky. Much like Jackson-Vanik forced Budapest, Warsaw, and Moscow \nto allow citizens to freely emigrate or travel, I believe a global \napproach would help to deter future abuses throughout the world. I am \npuzzled and, frankly, disappointed that our House colleagues did not \nrecognize our government needs tools that will allow it to stand up for \nthese individuals regardless of where they are in the world.\n  Because some have elevated the subject of commerce above human \nrights, there is a view that it is more important to pass PNTR than a \nglobal Magnitsky bill; thus, we should settle for a Russia-only bill. \nWhile the Jackson-Vanik sanctions we are about to repeal have obviously \noutlived their usefulness, there is an urgent need for additional tools \nto protect the invisible around the world.\n  I hope our collective failure to give voice to their struggles, \nexcept in Russia, will not discourage these brave men and women, \nwhether in Beijing, Tehran or elsewhere, from their continued efforts \nto root out corruption or expose rule of law abuses.\n  For now, at least, we address the problem in Russia. While I will not \nbe here next year, I hope my colleagues in both the House and Senate \nwill seek to uphold U.S. values and to do justice to Sergei Magnitsky \nand his legacy by passing a global bill sometime in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank Senator Kyl for his \nleadership on this issue. He knows I share his views on the global \naspect of the legislation. I wish to thank him for his extraordinary \nleadership as we have been working this issue. We have worked it hard \nto try to get as far as we possibly could. He will be missed in the \nnext Congress.\n  We will take up this cause again, but I wanted to thank Senator Kyl \nfor his commitment on this issue and finding a way that we could \nadvance this bill to the floor. I do look forward to the day we will \nmake this bill global.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/05/senate-section/article/S7435-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Is there objection?\n  The minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, last \nweek, Secretary Geithner brought up for the President an offer that was \nso not serious it makes me wonder what the point of it was. In light of \nthat offer, I would like to see if our Democratic friends are willing \nto support it. It includes a $2 trillion tax increase over 10 years, \nwhich would be the biggest real-dollar tax increase in U.S. history. It \nincreases taxes on nearly 1 million small businesses and increases the \ntaxes paid by family farmers and small businesses at death in the \nmiddle of a jobs crisis.\n  Most outrageous of all, it gives the President of the United States \nunilateral power--unilateral power--to raise the limit on the Federal \ncredit card, the so-called debt ceiling, whenever he wants, for as much \nas he wants.\n  I don't think we should have to speculate how Democrats might feel \nabout this. I think we should give them a chance to demonstrate for \nthemselves how serious the President's plan was and how serious they \nare.\n  I would like to ask consent to offer an amendment to the Russia trade \nbill--this is Secretary Geithner's proposal right here--an amendment to \nthe Russia trade bill that gives our friends on the other side of the \naisle a chance to vote on this proposal Secretary Geithner brought up \nlast Thursday. It gives the President's proposal to solve the fiscal \ncliff, as delivered by Secretary Geithner and outlined in the \nPresident's budget, an opportunity to be voted upon.\n  I should note I would be happy to have this vote right here or as an \namendment to the next bill or as a stand-alone. It will not slow down \nwhat I hope is swift passage of PNTR for Russia. If this proposal was \nmade in good faith, our friends on the other side, I am sure, would be \nhappy to vote for it.\n  Let me just say I expect my good friend, the majority leader, to \ndecline this chance to support the President and this laughable \nproposal because they know it couldn't even pass if it was sent to \ntheir majority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I reserve the right to object.\n  Just a minute ago, Mr. President, I moved to the Russia trade bill. \nThe purpose of moving this bill is to protect American jobs. If we \ndon't do this legislation, we will lose American jobs for sure and put \nAmerican companies in even worse shape than they are with Chinese and \nEuropean companies. So the question is really this: Are we going to get \nserious here and legislate or is this more of the obstructionism we \nhave felt so much of during this last Congress? The answer to that is \nreally obvious. The answer is yes. Are we going to continue the sort of \npolitical stunts the minority leader is trying to pull here and now?\n  On the substance, the Senate has passed a bill that will go a long \nway to address the fiscal cliff. It has already passed here. Last July \nthe Senate passed a bill to continue tax cuts for 98 percent of all \nAmericans and 90 percent of all American small businesses. If the \nRepublican leader were serious about preventing us from going over the \nfiscal cliff, he would urge his colleague, the Speaker, to get the \nHouse to take up the Senate-passed bill now. There are Republicans who \nhave already said that is the right thing to do. Conservatives, more \nmoderate Republicans--we even had one Republican Senator today say she \nthinks that will happen and it should happen.\n  In the meantime, the Republican leader's request is just a stunt. But \nthe election is over. It is time to get down to business. These pieces \nof paper he has--Secretary Geithner didn't bring that stack of stuff to \nme. It was a private meeting--a private meeting--trying to work \nsomething out with this very troublesome issue facing this country--the \ndeficit, the debt. And this private meeting turned out to be a \npublicity stunt for the Republicans talking about what he had said in \nprivate.\n  So, Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would add one comment about the \nconsent I just offered. I think it would not be inaccurate to assert \nthat the proposal the Secretary of the Treasury brought up last \nThursday would not have passed the House when Nancy Pelosi was Speaker. \nThis was an unserious proposal. And I can understand why my good friend \nthe majority leader would rather not vote on it because I can't imagine \nthat it would get many, if any, votes here in the Senate as well.\n\n[[Page S7436]]\n\n  Having made that point, with regard to PNTR for Russia, when the two \nparties first sat down to discuss the so-called fiscal cliff, it was \nwidely assumed among Republicans that President Obama and Democrats \nactually wanted to avoid it. That was the premise on which any possible \nagreement hinged. That was the common goal--or so we thought. Over the \npast couple of weeks, it has become increasingly clear to many of us \nthat we were simply wrong about that. Incredibly, many top Democrats \nseem perfectly happy--perfectly happy--to go off the cliff. That is why \nthe President has been more interested in campaign rallies than \nactually negotiating a deal, and it explains why the President is now \nstubbornly insisting on raising tax rates when he himself said just \nlast year that you could raise more revenue from capping deductions and \nclosing loopholes.\n  Look, this isn't about the deficit for them or balance. It is about \nan ideological campaign most Americans thought would have ended on \nNovember 6. And that is also why the President sent Secretary Geithner \nup here last week with a proposal so completely ridiculous it wouldn't \nhave passed the House, as I indicated earlier, if Nancy Pelosi were \nstill Speaker. It was more of a provocation than a proposal, to be \nperfectly frank about it. It was a message that the President really \ndoesn't want to deal at all.\n  To date, not a single Democrat has come forward to support the \nGeithner proposal, and anybody who looks at the details would certainly \nunderstand why. As I just indicated, it includes a $2 trillion tax \nincrease over 10 years--the biggest real-dollar tax increase in U.S. \nhistory. It increases taxes on nearly 1 million small businesses in the \nmiddle of a jobs crisis. According to Ernst & Young, this type of rate \nhike would cause more than 700,000 Americans to lose their jobs. It \nraises taxes on investment income, harming economic growth even more. \nIt includes tens of billions of dollars in more Washington spending in \na deal supposedly to cut the deficit. And most outrageous of all, it \ngives the President of the United States unilateral power to raise the \nlimit on the Federal credit card--the so-called debt ceiling--whenever \nhe wants, for as much as he wants.\n  While I am flattered that the administration has taken to calling \nthis the ``McConnell provision,'' they seem to have forgotten how this \nprovision worked in the Budget Control Act. Yes, we gave the President \nthe authority then to request a debt ceiling increase, but that was \nonly after the White House agreed to $2 trillion in cuts to Washington \nspending and agreed to be bound by the timing and amount set by \nCongress.\n  This time, the request is for the President to have the ability to \nraise the debt ceiling whenever he wants, for as much as he wants, with \nno fiscal responsibility or spending cuts attached. This is an idea \nopposed by Democrats and Republicans alike. It is a power grab that has \nno support here, and so it is not only completely dishonest, it is \njuvenile to compare it to last year's debt ceiling agreement. It would \nalso be incredibly irresponsible since history shows that the only \nmajor deficit-cutting deals we ever do around here--ever--come after \ndebates over the debt ceiling. It may be a good idea if you don't care \nabout the debt, but it is a nonstarter for those of us who do. It also \nrepresents a dangerous attempt by the President to grab more power over \nspending--power Congress must not and will not cede.\n  Beyond these details, not only would the President's plan raise taxes \non certain individuals, it would also cap their ability to deduct \ndonations they make to charities, the interest they pay on mortgages, \nthe contributions they make to retirement accounts, and the value of \nemployer-based health insurance. Don't get me wrong, you have heard me \nsay that if Democrats insist on getting more money to Washington, \ncapping these deductions is a better way to raise revenue, but capping \ndeductions and raising taxes is a recipe for economic disaster.\n  The President's proposal would also subject tens of thousands of \nsmall businesses and family farms to a massive tax hike to be paid by \nthe family upon the deaths of the owners. It would impose a crushing \ntax increase on industries that employ millions of Americans, including \nmanufacturers in my State, businesses that operate abroad, the \ninsurance industry, and would raise the price at the pump by targeting \nthe oil and gas industry for special tax treatment.\n  It is so ridiculous, as I have said repeatedly, it wouldn't have \npassed the House under Speaker Pelosi, and that is why even the most \nliberal Members of Congress, the President's most ardent supporters, \nhaven't come forward to support it. So for the White House to demand a \nresponse shows they are just playing games at this point.\n  If you don't believe me, ask yourself this: How many Democrats would \nvote for this bill? Not many. But I didn't think we should have to \nspeculate. I still think we should give Democrats a chance to \ndemonstrate for themselves just how serious the President's plan was \nand how serious they are.\n  That is why I just asked consent to offer an amendment to the Russia \ntrade bill that gave them that opportunity. As I noted, I would be \nhappy to have this vote here or as an amendment to the next bill or as \na stand-alone. It will not slow down what I hope is swift passage of \nPNTR for Russia. If the President's proposal was made in good faith, \nour friends should be eager to vote for it. So I am surprised the \nmajority leader just declined the chance for them to support it with \ntheir votes. I guess we are left to conclude that it couldn't even pass \nby a bare majority of votes and they would rather take the country off \nthe cliff than actually work out a good-faith agreement that reflects \ntough choices on both sides.\n  To be fair to the Secretary and to the President, we didn't just put \ntogether a bill that included his $2 trillion tax increase, we also \nadded the almost $400 billion in new tax stimulus measures he wanted as \nwell. This bill contains a continuation of the payroll tax holiday, a \n10-percent credit on new wages that will go to businesses large and \nsmall, and it included a fix to one of the many flawed provisions of \nObamaCare, an expansion of the tax credit for businesses that no one \nuses. This proposal reflected exactly what was in the President's \nbudget and his various submissions to Congress. I, for one, was eager \nto see this vote, to see if Senate Democrats were ready to support it. \nI think folks should know who actually wants to raise taxes on family \nfarmers and manufacturers and who thinks we can solve our fiscal \nproblems without doing anything serious to our real long-term \nliabilities.\n  Our Democratic friends are so focused on the politics of this debate \nthat they seem to forget there is a cost. They are feeling so good \nabout the election, they have forgotten they have a duty to govern. A \nlot of people are going to suffer--a lot--if we go off this cliff. That \nis why we assumed Democrats would have preferred to avoid it. We \nthought this was the perfect opportunity to do something. Apparently, \nwe were wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the original request?\n  Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is no Geithner proposal. This is all \nmade up.\n  Mr. President, I remember Dorothy in ``The Wizard of Oz''--I think \nshe was from Kansas and she wound up in Oz. We are here in Washington, \nDC, and yet suddenly we are in Oz--a real strange place.\n  The Republican leader is an expert in ways to kill legislation, and \npeople who are watching can see he is trying to torpedo the fiscal \ncliff negotiations which are ongoing.\n  Republican Senators have spoken to people in the White House today. \nThis is no serious way to negotiate, out here on the Senate floor. At \nthe end, the Republican leader is complaining because President Obama \nwants the rich to pay their fair share, and as usual Republicans are \ndefending the rich, holding tax cuts for the middle class hostage.\n  At the first of the year, unless we work something out, taxes will go \nup for people making less than $250,000 a year, an average of $2,200 \neach--not per family but each person. The Senate has already passed the \ncenterpiece of President Obama's offer, and his offer has always been \nthe same.\n  We are not going to go through the same thing we have gone through \nhere for years where we lay out different\n\n[[Page S7437]]\n\nways to cut spending and there is never any revenue. The President has \nmade it very, very clear. They have already passed the President's \nproposal, which is to make sure people making less than $250,000 a year \nare not burdened with an extra $2,200 each after the first of the year. \nThat passed in July. The House could take that up. Every Democrat in \nthe House has agreed they will vote for that. We need only 25 or 26 \nRepublicans in the House to make life something that is stable for \npeople making less than $250,000 a year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, may I ask my friend from Maryland if he \nhas spoken on the Magnitsky portion of this bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. We have not yet gotten to the bill. I believe we are now \nprepared to go to H.R. 6156. I know the Senator from Connecticut would \nlike to speak for 5 minutes, and I was hoping we could get some time \nwhere we could go back and forth and talk about the Magnitsky aspects \nof that legislation now.\n  Am I correct, Mr. President, that the bill has not yet been reported \nor it will be reported now and that perhaps we can enter into a consent \nagreement as to the next 30 or 40 minutes?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/05/senate-section/article/S7437-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to consideration of H.R. 6156, which the clerk will report by \ntitle.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6156) to authorize the extension of \n     nondiscriminatory treatment (normal trade relations \n     treatment) to products of the Russian Federation and Moldova \n     and to require reports on the compliance of the Russian \n     Federation with its obligations as a member of the World \n     Trade Organization, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I also note several of our friends, \nincluding Senator Lieberman, who are on the floor. Senator Lieberman \nalso has had a major role in this legislation, and I would ask \nunanimous consent that he be included in the colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask my friend, Senator Cardin, I had a \nstatement I wanted to make before the colloquy and I know the Senator \nhas a statement. Since it is his legislation, I would be glad to wait \nwith my remarks until the Senator from Maryland completes his. And how \nmuch time, could I ask, of my colleague?\n  Mr. CARDIN. I think my initial comments would be about 10 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And I would have about 10 minutes, if that is agreeable \nto my friend from Connecticut--who, obviously, is jobless and homeless. \nSo I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Maryland make his \nremarks, followed by mine, and then the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank Senator McCain for not \njust working this out but for his leadership on this issue. He has \nprovided the moral leadership we need on dealing with human rights \nissues. He is a cosponsor of the Sergei Magnitsky Accountability Act, \nand I thank him for that.\n  Today we close a chapter in the U.S. history on the advancing of \nhuman rights with the repeal basically of Jackson-Vanik. It served its \npurpose. Today, we open a new chapter in U.S. leadership for human \nrights with the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act.\n  As the Presiding Officer has heard, this involves a lawyer named \nSergei Magnitsky who had U.S. interests that he was representing in \nRussia. He discovered the largest tax fraud in Russia's history. He did \nwhat a lawyer should do: He brought it to the attention of the \nauthorities.\n  As a result of his bringing this corruption in local government to \nthe authorities, he was arrested. He was tortured because they wanted \nhim to recant what he had said. They wanted him to basically not tell \nthe truth. He refused to do that. He needed medical attention; he was \ndenied medical attention; and on November 16, 2009, he lost his life in \na Russian prison, being denied the opportunity to get needed health \ncare. He was 37 years old, with a wife and two children. Those who were \nresponsible for his death and those who were responsible for the \ncoverup have never been brought to justice. They have gone unpunished, \nand in some cases they have even been promoted.\n  The facts are well known. These are not hidden facts. The \ninternational community knows the people who were involved, knows about \nthe coverup, and knows that they have not been held accountable, and \nthis has gained international attention. That is why I filed \nlegislation aimed at the individuals responsible for the Magnitsky \ntragedy. It says, quite clearly, that those involved would be held \naccountable by being denied certain international rights.\n  It also includes those involved in extrajudicial killings, torture, \nor violations of internationally recognized human rights. The \nlegislation says, Look, we are not going to let you have the fruits of \nyour corruption. We are going to deny you the opportunity to hold your \nillegal gains in our banking system--which is where they prefer; they \ndon't want to hold rubles, they want to hold dollars--and that we will \nnot let you have a visa, a privilege, to visit our country, to visit \nyour property in our country or your family in this country. It targets \nthe individuals who committed the gross human rights violation, and it \nrecognizes the failure of the host country to deal with those \nviolations.\n  I want to thank all those who have been involved in the development \nof this legislation. Senator McCain has been one of the great leaders \non these human rights issues. This is not a partisan division. We have \nstrong bipartisan support. I have already acknowledged Senator Kyl, who \nrecently spoke. I know Senator Wicker took the floor a little earlier \nand I thank him, the ranking member on the Helsinki Commission. I want \nto thank Senator Shaheen, the chair of the European Subcommittee of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee for her work, and Senator Bob \nMenendez on the Foreign Relations Committee. All those individuals were \nvery instrumental in dealing with this. Senator Durbin has been a real \nchampion on human rights. I want to acknowledge Kyle Parker, staff \nperson from the Helsinki Commission, who was very instrumental in the \ndevelopment of this legislation. I want to also acknowledge Senator \nLieberman's work. I know he will be speaking in a few minutes.\n  It was Senator Lieberman, Senator McCain, and myself who first \nsuggested that we should pass the Magnitsky bill. It is the right thing \nto do, but we certainly shouldn't let PNTR go without attaching the \nMagnitsky bill. I thank Senator Lieberman and Senator McCain for \nraising that connection. It was the right thing to do. First, it \nallowed us to get this human rights tool enacted. Secondly, I think it \ngave us the best chance to get the PNTR bill done in the right form. So \nI thank both of them for their leadership.\n  In 1974, we passed the Jackson-Vanik law that dealt with the failure \nof the Soviet Union to allow for the emigration of its citizens, \naffecting mainly Soviet Jews. It was controversial in its time. People \nsaid, Why are we connecting human rights to trade? Why is the United \nStates doing that? After all, trade is so important.\n  Well, we did it. It made a huge difference, and we were able to get \nSoviet Jews out of the Soviet Union. We spoke for Western values in our \ntrade legislation. We protected the rights of individuals who refused \nthis.\n  When I first came to Congress 26 years ago, I joined the \ncongressional caucus for Soviet Jewry. I wore the wrist bands of \nrefuseniks, joined by many of our colleagues. Twenty-five years ago, I \nmarched in Washington, a march for Soviet Jews. We stood for basic \nrights, and we changed the landscape on this issue. I had a chance to\n\n[[Page S7438]]\n\nbe with Natan Sharansky and celebrate what he meant to people who loved \nfreedom around the world. We initiated that with Jackson-Vanik. It was \na proud chapter in American history.\n\n  Today we end that chapter, because Jackson-Vanik is no longer \nrelevant to the human rights challenges of our time. But with the \npassage of the Sergei Magnitsky Accountability Act, we meet the \nchallenges of our time. We meet those individuals who are committing \ngross human rights violations. This act is a global standard for the \nadvancement of human rights.\n  Unfortunately, the Magnitsky tragedy is not unique within Russia. We \nknow of other circumstances within the country. We saw the results of \nlast year's elections and the attitude of government toward \njournalists. We need the protection of the Magnitsky standards for \nhuman rights violations within Russia.\n  But it doesn't end with Russia. Human rights violations are global, \nand we should have these tools available globally. We need to prevent \nRussia and other countries from regressing on their commitments to \nhuman rights.\n  I must tell you, when you take a look at the legislation that came \nout of our two committees, S. 1039, coming out of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee and coming out of the Senate Finance Committee--I \nserve on both of those committees--it says very clearly that the law \nwould apply to those responsible for extrajudicial killings, torture, \nor other gross violations of internationally recognized human rights \ncommitted against individuals seeking to obtain, exercise, defend, or \npromote internationally recognized human rights and freedoms, such as \nthe freedom of religion, expression, association, assembly, and the \nrights to a fair trial and democratic elections anywhere in the world. \nThat was the legislation we reported in two of our committees. And I \nmight tell you, there was overwhelming support that we should make it \nglobal. Senator Kyl talked about that, and I am sure others will also.\n  In H.R. 6156, you will see the exact language we have in our \nMagnitsky bill with one exception: ``Anywhere in the world'' is changed \nto ``Russia.'' I am disappointed in that, and I join with Senator Kyl \nin that disappointment. I think it would have been much better if we \nwould have incorporated the international standards and global \nprovisions.\n  I think it is very important Congress pass this bill. I strongly \nsupport it. I support the effort to get this to the President as \nquickly as possible. But there is a clear message here: This bill is \nour standard. We will be holding countries to this standard. We will \nlook for other opportunities to attach these provisions to other trade \nbills. We will look for other opportunities to reinstitute the global \napplication of the Magnitsky standards. It is the right thing. The \nworld is on notice. Other countries are following our leadership. We \nexpect other countries will be acting with similar standards.\n  I might point out, as I did over 2 years ago, there is existing \nauthority within the State Department to deny visas to human rights \nviolators. I think we should make that very clear and we should enact a \nlaw that makes it clear. We have to pass the Magnitsky law as relates \nto Russia. But there is authority, and we expect the administration \nwill follow that authority.\n  I am hopeful people understand that although the language of the law \nis not as broad as we would like it to be, many of us consider this to \nbe the international standard, and we will be asking to hold other \ncountries accountable for violators of human rights that that country \ndoes not deal with in denying them the right to visit our country or to \nuse our banking system.\n  One last point. There are some who say, Well, aren't we interfering \nwith the internal affairs of a sovereign country? Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth. We have a right--I would say a responsibility--\nto challenge internationally recognized human rights violations in \nother countries. It is well established. Both Russia and the United \nStates are members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope. I had the honor of a senate chair in the Helsinki Commission, \nour implementing arm. That organization gives us the right to raise \nhuman rights problems in other countries. We have used that to advance \nefforts to stop human trafficking, to deal with antisemiticism, to deal \nwith corruption issues in other countries. We have that right. We have \nthat responsibility. And our actions today are for the Russian people \nand for its government.\n  I have heard from so many human rights activists in Russia, from \nRussian business leaders to ordinary citizens, who tell me Russia can \ndo better, and they urge us to move forward with the Magnitsky \nAccountability Act.\n  The United States, by the passage of this bill, will be on the right \nside of history. It will deepen our relationship with the Russian \npeople. Yes, we are ending a chapter with the repeal of Jackson-Vanik, \nbut we are starting a new chapter on human rights--one which we can be \nproud of where America once again is establishing a basic principle \nthat we will not tolerate those who violate internationally recognized \nhuman rights standards. We will not let them go without being held \naccountable. And we certainly will not let them have the privileges of \nour country if they violate internationally recognized human rights \nstandards.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, it is my pleasure to rise today to speak \nin favor of H.R. 6156--the Russia and Moldova Jackson-Vanik Repeal and \nSergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act. This day has been a \nlong time in coming, and the fact that it has now come is thanks to the \ngreat work of many of my colleagues, and I want to take a minute to \nrecognize a few of them personally.\n  First and foremost is the Senator from Maryland. It is not an \nexaggeration in the least to say that, were it not for Senator Cardin's \nleadership on behalf of human rights in Russia and his tireless \ndedication to memorializing the courageous dissent of one remarkable \nman--Sergei Magnitsky--we would not be here today. Senator Cardin is \nthe original author of the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability \nAct. He passionately educated his colleagues about the need for this \nlegislation, which is why it eventually won 25 bipartisan cosponsors in \nthe Senate. The Senator from Maryland has my deepest respect and \ngratitude for his efforts on behalf of human rights in Russia. He has \nestablished himself as a leading voice in our country on these issues. \nI have been honored to be his partner in this endeavor from the very \nbeginning as the original lead Republican co-sponsor of the Magnitsky \nAct. And when this legislation is passed, as I am confident that it \nwill be, Senator Cardin deserves all the credit in the world for this \nhistoric achievement.\n  I also want to recognize the efforts of the Senator from Montana. I \nappealed to Senator Baucus last year to join the Magnitsky Act together \nwith the repeal of Jackson-Vanik for Russia and Moldova and the \nextension of Permanent Normal Trade Relations status to both countries. \nHe agreed, and in a letter to me, as well as a few of my colleagues, \nthe Senator from Montana pledged to marry the 2 pieces of legislation \ntogether and to do everything in his power to see that the Senate could \nact on them together. He has been true to his word at every step of the \nway, and I am pleased to stand here today as an original co-sponsor of \nthe repeal of Jackson-Vanik for Russia and Moldova, as well as the \nMagnitsky Act.\n  Finally, the person I want to acknowledge above all is Sergei \nMagnitsky--whose remarkable life and tragic death is the reason that \nbrings us here today. Sergei Magnitsky was a tax attorney working for \nan international company, Hermitage Capital, that had invested in \nRussia. He did not spend his life as a human rights activist or an \noutspoken critic of the Russian government. He was an ordinary man, but \nhe became an extraordinary champion of justice, fairness and the rule \nof law in a Russia where those principles have lost nearly all meaning.\n  What Mr. Magnitsky uncovered was that a collection of Russian \ngovernment officials and criminals associated with them colluded to \ndefraud the Russian state of $230 million. The Russian government in \nturn blamed the crime\n\n[[Page S7439]]\n\non Hermitage Capital and threw Mr. Magnitsky in prison in 2008. Mr. \nMagnitsky was detained for 11 months without trial. Russian officials \npressured him to deny what he had uncovered--to lie and recant. But he \nrefused. He was sickened by what his government had done, and he \nrefused to surrender principle to brute power.\n  As a result, Mr. Magnitsky was transferred to increasingly more \nsevere and more horrific prison conditions. He was forced to eat \nunclean food and drink unsanitary water. He was denied basic medical \ncare as his health worsened. In fact, he was placed in increasingly \nworse conditions until, on November 16, 2009, having served 358 days in \nprison, Sergei Magnitsky died. He was 37 years old.\n  What is even more tragic is that the case of Mr. Magnitsky is only \none of the most extreme examples of the broad and dramatic \ndeterioration of rule of law in Russia, and its replacement with \narbitrary and nearly unchecked state power, which is increasingly \nconcentrated in the hands of one man, President Vladimir Putin.\n  What is emerging in Russia today can only be described as a culture \nof impunity--a sense among those who control the levers of power that \nRussia is theirs for the taking, and the only question left to debate \nis how government officials and other elites will divide up the wealth, \nthe power, and the spoils. This culture of impunity begins, first and \nforemost, with President Putin. He sets the tone in the country. And \nright now, with his return to the presidency, and with many of the \nactions that the Russian government has taken recently, the signal is \nbeing sent across the country, especially to every petty tyrant and \naspiring autocrat in the Russian state, that Putin is doing what he \nwishes. He is using the instruments of the state to crush his critics. \nHe is getting away with it. And you can too.\n  This culture of impunity in Russia has been growing worse and worse \nover many years. It has been deepened by the increased surveillance and \nharassment of members of opposition and civil society groups . . . by \nthe continued violent attacks on brave journalists who dare to publish \nthe truth about official corruption and other state crimes in Russia \ntoday . . . and of course, by the continued detention of numerous \npolitical prisoners, not least Mikhail Khordokovsky and his associate \nPlaton Lebedev, who remain locked away but not forgotten. I continue to \nfear for the health and safety of both men. And I pray for them.\n  The culture of impunity in Russia can also be seen in Russia's recent \nelections--the parliamentary election last December and the \npresidential election in March--which were criticized for their flaws \nand irregularities by impartial, objective international organizations. \nIt can be seen in the recent NGO law passed by the Russian legislature, \nwhich requires any civil society group in Russia that receives \ninternational funding to register as a ``foreign agent.'' The vast \nmajority of these civil society groups have nothing to do with \npolitics. Clearly, the intent of this law is nothing less than to \ndemonize, and marginalize, and stigmatize as treasonous whatever \nindependent civil society organizations still remain in Russia.\n   The culture of impunity in Russia can also be seen in the \ngovernment's new and growing interpretation of its law against \nextremism. A law that may once have been designed to address real \nconcerns with terrorism and violent extremism is now being broadened to \nput pressure on civil society groups and religious minority groups, \neven including the Jehovah's Witnesses. A Russian court even went so \nfar as to classify as an extremist organization the punk rock band of \nRussian girls that staged a protest performance this year in Moscow's \nChrist the Savior Cathedral. Any media outlet in Russia that would dare \nto broadcast this group's material could now be subject to having their \noutfit closed down by the Russian state.\n  This culture of impunity was extended even further last month in \nRussia's new law against treason. That term has now been defined so \nbroadly that it allows the state to ban websites and impose fines, and \nlikely worse penalties, against Russians who participate in \nunregistered demonstrations, who fail to register as foreign agents \nwhere now required under Russian law, and even to those who are \nsuspected of giving advice to foreigners. Many Russians rightly believe \nthat this new treason law is so expansive that the government can use \nit to stifle the legitimate rights and freedoms of anyone they deem to \nbe an enemy of the state.\n  This culture of impunity also extends to the recent decision by the \nRussian government to terminate the presence and all programming of \nUSAID in Russia. Whatever the stated reason for this decision, there \nshould be no doubt why it was done--to try to further isolate, and \nmarginalize, and emasculate civil society groups in Russia by denying \nthem an ability to work in partnership with the United States, as many \nof these groups have freely done and wish to continue doing.\n  Ultimately, this culture of impunity in Russia is why Sergei \nMagnitsky is dead. That is why, even now, no one has yet been held \naccountable for his murder. And I suspect no one ever will. What is \nworse, the Russian government has done the opposite: It has put Sergei \nMagnitsky, a dead man, on trial, perhaps in an effort to prove that he \ngot what he deserved. They have even required Mr. Magnitsky's mother \nand family to appear at the trial, which sinks this case to a whole new \nlow. This culture of impunity is why videos are surfacing even now that \ndocument the brutal conditions of Russia's prison system, and the \nsystematic abuse and torture to which detainees are subjected there at \nthe hands of midlevel tyrants who want to run their small part of the \nRussian state just as their president does.\n  This is why we need to pass the Magnitsky Act. If citizens and civil \nsociety groups in Russia do not have a path to justice in Russia, then \nthe international community has a responsibility to show these people \nthat there can still be accountability, that there can still be \nconsequences, for what they are suffering.\n  The Magnitsky Act does that. And I want to be clear: What is so \nimportant about this legislation is that its provisions would not \nsimply apply to those Russian officials responsible for the torture and \nmurder of Sergei Magnitsky; it would also apply to other persons in \nRussia who commit human rights abuses. In short, this is not just about \nhistorical accountability; it is also about preventing future Magnitsky \ncases. It is about imposing consequences on all human rights violators \nin Russia.\n  The allegation that this legislation infringes on Russian sovereignty \nis nonsense. The Magnistsky Act does not require the Russian government \nor Russian citizens to do anything they do not wish to do. It cannot \nforce human rights abusers in Russia to stop what they are doing. But \nif they continue, what this legislation does do is tell those \nindividuals that they cannot bank their money in the United States, \nthat they are not welcome in this country, that they cannot visit this \ncountry, and that they will have no access to the U.S. financial \nsystem.\n  Now, I know we have had a debate about whether to make this bill \nglobally applicable--a tool that could be used to apply these same \nkinds of penalties to human rights abusers anywhere in the world. This \nis a worthy goal, and I believe we should have such a debate in the \nnext Congress. It is important now, however, that the Magnitsky Act \nremain focused squarely and exclusively on Russia. That is what Russian \ndemocrats and civil society groups tell me they want right now. They \nwant Congress to send their government a message on human rights, and \nby keeping the Magnitsky Act focused for now on Russia, we can do just \nthat.\n  Furthermore, the administration can use its own executive authority \nat this time to apply similar kinds of pressures contained in the \nMagnitsky Act to human rights abusers in other countries. I, for one, \nwill be watching closely to see if they do, for many other cases are \ncrying out for greater U.S. leadership on behalf of human rights. And \nif the administration does not take the initiative to apply the \nleverage at our disposal to these other cases beyond Russia, that is \nthe surest way to ensure that the Congress will act to globalize the \nMagnitsky Act next year.\n\n  There are still many people who look at the Magnitsky Act as anti-\nRussia. I\n\n[[Page S7440]]\n\ndisagree. I believe it is pro-Russia. I believe it is pro-Russia \nbecause this legislation is about the rule of law, and human rights, \nand accountability, which are values that Russians hold dear. I believe \nit is pro-Russia because it does not make all Russians pay for the \ncrimes of a small handful of corrupt officials, and in this way, the \nMagnitsky Act is an improvement on Jackson-Vanik and an ideal \nreplacement for it. I believe the Magnitsky Act is pro-Russia in the \nsame way that Permanent Normal Trade Relations is also pro-Russia--\nbecause both measures are ultimately about strengthening ordinary \nRussians who long for greater opportunity, greater freedom, and greater \nprotections for their rights under the rule of law.\n  I am not under any illusion that the passage of either the Magnitsky \nAct or PNTR for Russia will ensure the success of rule of law in \nRussia. Not at all. But while both measures are very different and \npresent very different kinds of benefits to the Russian people--one a \nmaterial benefit, the other a moral benefit--both of these measures, I \nfirmly believe, are nonetheless beneficial to Russia. Both create high \nstandards to which we and others can hold the Russian government, both \non the trade front and on matters of human rights. Both provisions \ncreate levers for international accountability where few currently \nremain in Russia. In other words, the Magnitsky Act and PNTR for Russia \ncan serve as tools that will help to empower ordinary Russians who do \nnot want their lives or their livelihoods to be determined solely by \nthe predatory elites in the Russian state.\n  Ultimately, passing this legislation will place the United States \nsquarely on the side of the Russian people and the right side of \nRussian history, which appears to be approaching a crossroads. I remind \nmy colleagues that today is the anniversary of the massive protests \nthat rocked Russia one year ago. As I have said before, I do not \nbelieve that the demand for freedom and dignity that have so profoundly \nshaken the Arab world are unique to that part of the world. I think the \neffects of these upheavals will be global, because the values and \naspirations at their heart are universal. I think this makes Mr. Putin \nand his cronies very nervous--and it should. The desire for peaceful \nchange and democratic and legal reform can be delayed for a time. They \ncan be delayed, but they cannot be denied. This legislation is a vote \nin favor of a brighter, better future for the Russian people--a future \nthat they can determine, freely and independently, for themselves.\n  Finally, I would be remiss if I did not conclude with a word on \nMoldova, because this legislation would also take the long overdue step \nof repealing Jackson-Vanik for Moldova and granting it Permanent Normal \nTrade Relations as well. This should have been done years ago. I have \nbeen an advocate for this action for many years. I have continually \ninsisted that the Congress should not be allowed to pass PNTR for \nRussia without doing the same for Moldova. That was a condition of my \nco-sponsorship of this legislation, and I am proud that the Senate is \nnow on the verge of clearing the way for normal trade relations between \nthe United States and Moldova. That small country has taken enormous \nstrides toward democratic and economic reform, and toward deeper \nintegration in the European community. Passing this legislation will be \na critical vote of confidence in Moldova's political and economic \nreforms and in support of its democratic future.\n  For all of these reasons, and for the many more that I have listed \nwith regards to Russia, I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  Finally, I say to my three colleagues on the floor, there are times \nwhen we do a lot of things for the people we represent and a lot of \nthings for the country. I think what we are doing here, which will be \nrapidly approved and has already been approved by the House and will be \nmade into law, is something we are doing for people in Russia who need \nour help now, our voice and our commitment. Many of the great and \nwonderful ideas, promises, and prospects after the fall of the Soviet \nUnion that was the case of Russia have been dashed. Maybe we should \ntake responsibility for not playing a more constructive role in the \n1990s when Russia was going through a critical phase.\n  I promise today, not just to Sergei Magnitsky's widow, but to all \npeople throughout Russia who will be encouraged by this message \nbecause, as they were years ago, the legislation we are now repealing, \nthe Jackson-Vanik act, was a call to the people in Russia who were \nbeing held under terrible conditions that they would now be able to \nfreely immigrate to a land with promise of a better future. I believe \nthat today this legislation is one of the most important ones that in \nyears to come we can be proud we were a small part of.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I compliment the Senator from Arizona on \nthe moral clarity of his statement. I think the Senator is absolutely \nright. The moral clarity here is clear: Those who commit gross \nviolations of internationally recognized human rights are on notice. As \nthe Senator pointed out, this legislation applies beyond the Magnitsky \ntragedy, it applies to Russia, and it is a standard that we intend to \nuse for other opportunities whether it is trade bills or other \nlegislation.\n  I hope we will make this statutorily global. We will have that debate \nat a later point. We will have other opportunities to make it clear \nthat those who violate human rights are internationally recognized, \nthat the clarity here is clear, and that there will be repercussions on \nthe rights of our own country.\n  We cannot determine how Russia will treat its violators under their \nlaws; they will have to handle that. But we have the moral certainty \nthat we are not going to assist those violators and deny their \nopportunities to come to America and use our banking system.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, a quick response to my friend from \nMaryland, and that is we talk a lot about the globalization. Don't \nthink that dictators, brutal rulers, and oligarchies all over the world \nare not paying attention to this legislation. Our message to them is: \nKeep it up; you are next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, before the Senator leaves the floor, I \nthank him very much for his leadership. He is a stalwart leader in \nprotecting human rights all over the world, but in this case Russia. I \nthink he is right in suggesting that it is a good follow-on to \nprotecting human rights, and certainly in this case Russia.\n  I thank the Senator very much.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that under the time to be \ncontrolled on the Democratic side, the following Senators be given the \ntime listed: Senator Levin, 15 minutes, and Senator Cardin, 50 minutes. \nI understand that he has already used a certain amount of time, so the \ntotal will be 50 minutes. Senator Durbin will be given 10 minutes and \nSenator Lieberman 10 minutes; further, all time used for debate on the \nbill earlier today during morning business be counted toward the 5 \nhours allocated under the unanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank my friend, the chair of the \nFinance Committee. I thank him for yielding me 10 minutes. While I am \nexpressing gratitude, may I express gratitude to the Senator from \nMaryland. Talk about moral clarity, which is a term he just used for \nour friend from Arizona, he showed real moral clarity for this and so \nmany other issues. I thank him for that.\n  As I begin my final month in the U.S. Senate, it gives me great \nconfidence to know that people such as Senator Cardin and Senator \nMcCain are going to be here to continue to hold America to the standard \nthat our founding doctrines hold us to, which is to be a beacon of \nhuman rights and a protector of those who fight for human rights around \nthe world. So my thanks and compliments to Senator Cardin.\n  I rise to join those who are supporting this bill, which is two \nmeasures brought together in a mutually productive partnership. The \ncase for granting\n\n[[Page S7441]]\n\nPNTR to Russia is clear and straightforward.\n  Russia became a full member of the World Trade Organization over 3 \nmonths ago, and in doing so was bound to pledge to cut tariffs for \nmanufactured imports and open its service sector to foreign \ncompetition. In order for American companies to realize these benefits, \nwe must grant permanent normal trade relations, PNTR, to Russia. For \nthis reason the only country that will be disadvantaged if we fail to \npass this bill will be our own, and that particularly means our own \nbusinesses. Of course, that is why generally American businesses and \nleading business advocacy groups such as the chamber of commerce, in \nparticular, have supported this legislation so strongly. It is also why \nthe Governors of 14 of our States, including Connecticut, and six \nformer U.S. Trade Representatives have urged the Senate to follow the \nHouse and swiftly pass this bill.\n  I also note that this legislation will grant permanent normal trade \nrelations to the country of Moldova, a country that has demonstrated \ntremendous democratic progress over the past two decades. Deepening our \neconomic ties with Moldova is good for American business and will help \nkeep Moldova on the path of democracy as well as development. So PNTR \nfor Russia and Moldova is necessary and good for the United States.\n  For me, and I hope many others--eloquently expressed by Senator \nCardin and Senator McCain--the case for this bill is sealed because of \nits incorporation of separate legislation, the Magnitsky Rule of Law \nand Accountability Act, of which I am privileged to be a cosponsor.\n  I must say that as I look back over the 24 years in the Senate, which \nI have been doing a lot lately, there are not too many pieces of \nlegislation that I have been prouder to be associated with than the \nMagnitsky Act.\n  As many of you know, this legislation is named for a 37-year-old \nRussian tax lawyer named Sergei Magnitsky whose tragic murder 3 years \nago is among the most horrible examples of corruption and thuggishness \nthat continues to afflict Russia. Mr. Magnitsky is rightfully the \nnamesake of this legislation. It will impose a visa ban and asset \nfreeze not only against those officials whom we have good reason to \nbelieve are responsible for his murder, but also against Russian \nofficials responsible for any and all human rights abuses that are too \nregularly taking place in that country.\n  Senator McCain, Senator Cardin, and I have had the privilege of \nmeeting with Russian dissidents, political activists, and human rights \nleaders over the years. What they have told me and my colleagues over \nand over is that there is one thing above all others we can do here in \nthe United States to help support the cause of human rights and the \nrule of law in Russia, and that is to pass the Magnitsky Act.\n  So today I join my colleagues who support this legislation and say to \nthose in Russia who are striving courageously to secure their \nfundamental freedoms--the same rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit \nof happiness that our Founders said in our declaration were the \nendowment of our Creator to every human being--that we have not and \nwill not forget them and their cause. We know and will remember their \nnames. We will stand in solidarity with them and in support of them \nuntil they achieve their goal, which is a goal we share. That goal is \nthe spread of democracy and a democratic Russia that respects the rule \nof law, protects human rights, and is free of corruption.\n  I want to echo what my friends said a moment ago. I was thinking \nabout it. I am not sure anybody has mentioned the name of Natan \nSharansky, a famous Russian dissident of an earlier time, a refusenik \nplaced in a Russian gulag and who served so much time in solitary \nconfinement. I have had the honor to get to know him. If you read his \nbooks, there is a very moving series of sections where he talks about \nthe fact that when Jackson-Vanik passed and they learned about it, they \nwould communicate with each other in the most primitive ways when news \ncame in, and what an inspiration it was. In some sense it kept not just \nhope alive but kept them alive, that the U.S. Congress had adopted this \nlaw which would impose penalties on the Soviet Union unless it allowed \npeople to freely emigrate. Disproportionately at that time it was \ndealing with Jews.\n  It was also stated that they wanted to leave because they were so \noppressed in the Soviet Union. It was actually stated in global terms \nat that time. Maybe sometime we will come back and address that.\n  I remember what Sharansky said about the day while in solitary \nconfinement somebody was able to convey to him by tapping pipes that \nPresident Reagan had called Russia--and the Soviet Union, really--the \nevil empire. And knowing that the leader of the free world--the most \npowerful person in the world--would call out this oppressive government \nthat had locked him up for no reason other than he had advocated for \nhuman rights, he said this would sustain his hope.\n  In some small way I hope the passage of this Magnitsky Act will do \nthe same for those who are fighting for the many people whose freedom \nof expression has already been compromised by the government in Russia \nand for the people whose businesses have been essentially taken by the \ngovernment.\n  I think one of the great disappointments over the last quarter \ncentury is the hope that we had after the fall of the Berlin wall and \nthe collapse of the Soviet Union, that this great country of Russia, \nthis great people whose history and culture is so proud and so strong, \nwould finally be able to be free of tyranny. Well, they are freer than \nthey were during Soviet times. I guess that is some small consolation. \nBut increasingly the central government and President Putin have \ncompromised human rights.\n  Incidentally, going to the other part of this bill, the PNTR part for \nfree trade, there are a lot of businesses in the United States and \nelsewhere in the world that will be hesitant to invest as much as they \nwould otherwise invest in Russia so long as the Russian Government is \nas autocratic, irrational, suppressive, repressive, and corrupt as this \nRussian Government is. So in all these respects, I would say that the \nMagnitsky Act is a worthy successor to Jackson-Vanik, which was such a \ncrusading human rights measure in its own day and, may I add, bears the \nname of a truly great Senator, Henry M. ``Scoop'' Jackson, a personal \nrole model to me and others. Today the Jackson-Vanik amendment no \nlonger makes sense because there is free emigration from Russia; \ntherefore, we are right to lift it. But it is equally right that we \nreplace it with a law that will address the primary human rights facing \nRussia today. May I say in repealing Jackson-Vanik, we actually honor \nhis proud legacy and keep it alive.\n  Just over a year ago, when the Russian people responded to a \nfraudulent parliamentary election by taking peacefully to the streets, \nthe Kremlin responded with thuggish brutality. Instead of at least \nrespecting the legitimate demands of his people or listening to them, \nPresident Putin falsely accused the United States of creating this \nopposition in Russia and began a campaign of stifling dissent that \ncontinues to escalate to this day. Independent media outlets have been \ntargeted, including American broadcasting services. Journalists and \nopposition activists have been harassed and arrested and put in jail, \nand the Russian Duma has passed a law that grants sweeping power to \nauthorities to close Web sites and limit freedom of expression, and \nanother law passed by the Duma expands the definition of treason so \nbroadly that human rights groups believe it could be used to punish \nanyone who questions the government.\n  Meanwhile, the nongovernmental organization community has come under \nincreasing attack. Our own Agency for International Development has \nbeen evicted from Russia recently, and Russian NGOs are now required by \nlaw to register as foreign agents if they receive any money from abroad \nor engage in political activity.\n  This is a sorry state of affairs, and it is very important that we \nheed Senator Cardin's call to act as best we can to speak out against \nit and to do something that the dissidents of Russia have told us will \nreally affect the elite class, the leadership class in Russia, which is \nto seize their assets if they are human rights violators and to \nprohibit them from freedom of travel. When we pass this, as I am \nconfident we will--this is one of the days when I am sure\n\n[[Page S7442]]\n\neverybody in the Senate feels grateful we are here because what we do \nhere matters. Sometimes we wonder, I think, in the gridlock and \npartisanship and complexity of politics in our country these days. But \nas I have traveled around the world over the last 24 years, I have been \nstruck by how many places democracy has taken root where few predicted \nit was possible, and the voices of Members of Congress or Congress as a \nbody have encouraged the dissidents to show the courage they needed to \nachieve what they wanted. From Indonesia to Chile, from East Germany to \nSouth Korea, authoritarian regimes have been supplanted by flourishing \nfree societies in just about every corner of the Earth. We in the \nUnited States and everybody in the world are a lot better off for it.\n  Unfortunately, that can't be said of Russia, and that is why this \nMagnitsky act is so important to adopt. Despite the democratic setbacks \nin Russia I have just described and the repressive acts by its \ngovernment, I remain confident that the future of these great people \ndoes not belong to those who would impose upon them a system of \ntyranny, of corruption, of abuse with impunity. The future of Russia \nbelongs to Russians who believe they have the right to decide their \ndestiny for themselves, to the Russian people who are sick of \ncorruption and who demand the rule of law--fairness, justice under law. \nIn short, it belongs to people like the late Segei Magnitsky, whose \nname will be immortalized when we pass this legislation.\n  In supporting this legislation, I say to my colleagues, we stand with \nthem in their noble cause. That is why I hope and I am confident that \nwe will all join together, Democrats and Republicans and an occasional \nIndependent, and pass this legislation overwhelmingly.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I rise today in support of the \nlegislation before us and in support of the comments my Independent \ncolleague from Connecticut just made which had to do with the Magnitsky \nprovision, which I also support. I heard my colleague from Arizona, \nSenator McCain, talking about it passionately earlier. It is an \nimportant part of this legislation. But with regard to the trade part \nof the legislation, I would like to say that I think this is also a \ngreat opportunity for us. I see my colleague from Maryland here who, \nalong with Senator McCain, has taken the lead on the Magnitsky \nprovision encouraging better human rights in Russia, and I think we \nwill see over time that this will have an impact globally.\n  With regard to the trade side of this debate we are having today, I \nhope we all recognize that one of the great, untapped opportunities for \nour economy and for adding jobs is to expand exports. We have a great, \nuntapped potential here because America still is not exporting at the \nlevel it should be. We do face stubbornly high unemployment. We do have \nstagnant growth rates. We are looking at some tough economic numbers \neven as we head toward the fiscal cliff which could make it even worse. \nSo we need to do all we can to ensure that our workers and our farmers \nhave access to the 95 percent of consumers who live outside of our \nborders. That adds jobs. When companies consider whether they are going \nto get into the export business or not, which again creates opportunity \nhere, they want to know if they are going to be treated with certainty, \npredictability, and fairness in the marketplace. Exporters need to know \nthat if a country doesn't play by the rules, then that country will \nthen face consequences. Those consequences really are what the World \nTrade Organization is all about. That is why this discussion is so \nimportant, because by today or tomorrow, voting to authorize permanent \nnormal trade relations with Russia, we then can take advantage of the \nWorld Trade Organization rules as they relate to Russia and to our \ntrade with them.\n  Russia joined the WTO on August 22, and the United States was a big \npart of that accession. We worked with Russia for 18 years to ensure \nthat they were willing to go along with certain fairness provisions on \ntrade to be able to enter the WTO, and we need to be sure now that we \ncan take advantage of those provisions. Without passing this \nlegislation, America and our farmers and our workers could get left \nbehind. By joining it, Russia did agree to abide by a certain set of \ncommon rules, and when they break those rules, other countries can then \ntake them to court--the World Trade Organization--and help hold their \nfeet to the fire.\n  It means Russia will be required to better protect intellectual \nproperty rights, which is a major concern for U.S. companies. It means \nRussia must treat fairly the highly technical services sector where the \nUnited States has a great opportunity, including telecommunications, \ninsurance, energy services, and retail services. There we have a lot of \ncompetitive advantages and we are looking for a level playing field. It \nmeans they have to give rules-based treatment to our agricultural \nexports so they are not trumped by internal Russian agricultural \npolitics. It means Russia has to improve its transparency and the \nrulemaking process so regulations are not taking place without an \nadequate comment period and input from job creators, including American \ncompanies that want to do business in Russia. These were all \nconcessions that were secured, again, over this 18-year period by the \nUnited States and other countries, but primarily the United States took \na role here--Republican and Democratic administrations alike--in \nensuring that as Russia entered the WTO, we had the opportunity to have \na fair trading system with them.\n  By the way, I was part of that as U.S. Trade Representative \nnegotiating with my Russian counterpart. Secretary Johanns--then \nSecretary, now colleague from Nebraska--was part of that as U.S. \nAgriculture Secretary. Others here in the Congress have been part of \nthat as members of the Finance Committee.\n  So currently we have these trade rules that apply to the rest of the \nworld but not to us because Russia is part of the WTO but we haven't \ngranted this important PNTR status. So of the more than 150 countries \nin the World Trade Organization, we are the only ones that are outside \nof this agreement at this point. American exporters will only receive \nthose benefits with total certainty if we pass this bill to provide \nthese normal trade relations with Russia. If we fail to do so, we \nreally hold back American workers and businesses from growing in the \nRussian marketplace, which, by the way, has 140 million consumers. Our \nEuropean and Asian competitors would have that reliability and \ncertainty that we would lack. When Russia doesn't play by the rules, \nour competitors around the globe would be able to take them to the \nworld trade court, but we wouldn't. If we think about it, in a way we \nare shooting ourselves in the foot if we don't move forward with \npermanent normal trade relations with Russia.\n\n  Russia is now the ninth largest economy. Unfortunately, we are \nunderperforming in the Russian market. The United States, the world's \ngreatest exporter, now only accounts for less than 5 percent of \nRussia's imports. Our competitors in Europe have a 40-percent share of \nthe Russian market. China holds a 16-percent share of that market. So, \nagain, it is a growth economy; it is an economy where we have \ntremendous opportunities.\n  I know Chairman Baucus talked about this earlier today. I watched him \non C-SPAN where he talked about the opportunities in this market and \nabout the need for us to help our exporters here in the United States \nby opening this potential market for our workers and our farmers. We \ncan do much better if we pass this PNTR bill.\n  This is certainly true in my home State of Ohio. Ohio already exports \nabout $200 billion a year in goods to Russia, and we want to retain \nthose sales and add even more. This bill impacts a number of businesses \nwith a large Ohio footprint.\n  Caterpillar, the world's leading manufacturer of construction and \nmining equipment, is one of them. Caterpillar employs nearly 1,000 \nOhioans, including in the Miami Valley in Clayton, and is a great \nexample of the certainty the PNTR bill will bring. With Russia's \nentrance into the WTO, tariffs on American-made Caterpillar trucks \nexported to Russia will fall from 15 percent to 5 percent. That allows \nCaterpillar to be much more competitive in the Russian market. For \nCaterpillar's off-highway trucks, the tariff reductions exceed\n\n[[Page S7443]]\n\n$100,000 per truck. That is a real difference. It is a substantial \nmargin. But if we don't pass this bill, we have no idea how Russia will \ntreat our U.S. exports and we will have no way to hold them \naccountable.\n  Other Ohio businesses that will benefit include Procter & Gamble, \nwhich sells more than 50 brands in Russia, including detergents, \nshampoos, and diapers. They have the leading market share, by the way, \nin 75 percent of the categories in which they compete.\n  Eaton, which is a company in the Cleveland area and has thousands of \nemployees in northeast Ohio, exports industrial clutches and brakes to \nRussia and looks forward, again, to the certainty this bill will bring \nwhen working with our customers in Russia. They need that certainty.\n  GE Aviation in Ohio employs about 9,000 people in Cincinnati and has \na great opportunity to compete as Russia acquires over 1,000 new \ncivilian aircraft over the next decade.\n  Ohio's cattlemen strongly support this legislation. Russia has made \nsome important concessions in the negotiations that will help meet the \ngrowing demand for U.S. beef in Russia. Russia is currently the fifth \nlargest export market for U.S. beef. According to the USDA, over 48,000 \nhead of U.S. live cattle were sold to Russia just this year. In 2011 \nOhio exported over 3,000 cattle to Russia, and we expect that number to \nrise dramatically.\n  The bill also contains some items the Russian Government opposes, \nincluding the human rights provisions which were discussed earlier here \non the floor, inspired by the treatment of Russian lawyer Sergei \nMagnitsky. Senators Cardin, McCain, and others have put the spotlight \non the corruption and the lack of transparency in Russia. These \nprovisions will clamp down on human rights abusers, denying them visas \nand putting them on notice that their corruption won't be tolerated by \nfreedom-loving countries such as the United States. The House passed \nthis bill last month on the anniversary of Magnitsky's death, and it is \ntime the Senate does the same.\n  We also have some provisions in this legislation that will ensure \nthat our trade negotiators keep Russia's feet to the fire in \nimplementing all the various commitments Russia has made, particularly \nwith regard to agriculture. Russia has not always played by the rules. \nIt has been a point of friction between our countries. We need to be \nsure they do the heavy lifting back home to bring their laws into \ncompliance, including their pervasive use over time of non-science-\nbased standards to discriminate against our U.S. agricultural exports.\n  I also wish to note my strong concern with Russia's involvement on \nanother front; that is, their involvement in the continuing Syrian \nconflict. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have \nwatched the Syrian situation with alarm, particularly as we have seen \nit unfolding this week. Russia has been anything but an ally in this \ncase with the support of the Asad regime. They vetoed three U.N. \nSecurity Council resolutions aimed at imposing tough sanctions on the \nAsad regime. When Russia isn't using their veto power to support their \nSyrian friends, they are arming the Asad dictatorship with over $1 \nbillion, we are told, in weaponry, including attack helicopters, that \nthey are using to continue their terror against their own citizens in \nSyria.\n  Let me be clear. While I fully oppose Russia's actions in Syria, this \nbill is no gift to Russia. In fact, this bill has teeth. It brings \nRussia into a rules-based system. It is good for America and our \neconomy and our jobs, and I think it strikes a critical balance by \ngiving critical assistance to American companies that want to export \ntheir products to Russia's growing middle class, supporting good-paying \njobs here at home, while forcing Russia to play by the rules and, \nagain, providing binding penalties if they fail to live up to these \ninternational standards.\n  While I am pleased we are finally moving forward on this bill, I am \nalso disappointed we haven't made more progress over the last 4 years \non trade. We didn't make opening new export markets a high priority in \nthe President's first term. I am hoping that will change over the next \n4 years because helping U.S. job creators export shouldn't be a \npartisan issue. Over 100 bilateral trade agreements are being \nnegotiated today as we speak here on the floor. The United States is a \nparty to none of them. We are a party to one multilateral trade \nagreement which I support, but we need to get back and engage in these \nbilateral agreements and open markets for our products. We have been \nsitting on our hands on the side lines in an increasingly global and \ndynamic economy. This is the first administration actually since FDR \nnot to ask for the ability to negotiate export agreements and bring \nthem to Congress under expedited procedures, which is now called trade \npromotion authority. And this is something unique. This administration \nhas yet to even ask for it over the last 4 years.\n\n  Last year, we finally passed the Korea, Colombia, and Panama export \nagreements. Hopefully, our bipartisan actions today to boost exports to \nRussia will signal a new chapter for us to engage as a Congress and \nwith the administration in a much more ambitious and proactive trade \npolicy.\n  I am pleased this bipartisan bill received such broad support from \nRepublicans and Democrats in the House, getting 365 votes, and I urge \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to now support this \nlegislation before us.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise to highlight an important \nprovision in the PNTR legislation that requires the United States Trade \nRepresentative and the State Department to provide an annual report to \nCongress on the steps they are taking to advocate for American \ninvestors in Yukos Oil, the Russian oil company that was effectively \nexpropriated by the Russian Federation in 2007. The annual report would \nalso include a report on the status of the petition filed by American \ninvestors in Yukos to request that the State Department formally \n``espouse'' the debt--meaning to make compensation for American \ninvestors a matter of bilateral negotiations between the United States \nand Russia.\n  More than 40 bipartisan Members of the House and Senate have written \nletters to Secretary Clinton in favor of the State Department taking up \nthe cause of American investors. The State Department has been closely \nwatching international tribunals adjudicating the claims of non-\nAmerican international investors in Yukos to help guide its own \ndecision-making. On July 25, 2012, an international tribunal \nestablished pursuant to the Spain-Russia bilateral investment treaty \nordered the Russian government to compensate a group of Spanish \ninvestors for the losses they suffered from the expropriation of Yukos. \nLikewise, an investor from the United Kingdom prevailed in a similar \nproceeding in September 2010. These rulings would appear to indicate \nthat there is merit to the claims of the American investors.\n  When a government abuses its tax and regulatory authority to \nnationalize the property of foreign investors, it is required to \nprovide compensation to those investors. To date, none of the American \nowners of Yukos has received any compensation.\n  I insisted that the Russia PNTR bill incorporate new trade tools and \nI hope that these will be used to assist in the satisfactory resolution \nof the claims of American investors in the Yukos case, as well as to \nassist other American businesses and investors who may struggle with \nRussian corruption and rule of law issues.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise to both support the bill we are \nconsidering today but also to discuss the implications of Russia's \naccession to the World Trade Organization, WTO. I was proud to be part \nof a unanimous vote for this measure coming out of the Finance \nCommittee and I expect tomorrow we will see a similarly strong showing \nof support for this significant trade measure. It is not often these \ndays that we see such bipartisan agreement and I welcome it and \nencourage its expansion into other key areas.\n  Russia was formally invited to join the WTO on December 16, 2011, and \nits entry into the WTO became official and effective this past August. \nThere are more than 150 countries in the WTO, and with Russia's entry, \nnow each of those countries have gained an improvement in trade \nconditions with Russia in the form of lower tariff barriers, easier \naccess to markets and credit, and a variety of less tangible but \ncertainly meaningful benefits including greater transparency and more\n\n[[Page S7444]]\n\nenforceable mechanisms for securing property and other rights. We are \npromised that all WTO member countries will enjoy these privileges in \ntheir trading with Russia, but so far we are not among them: if the \nCongress does not take the opportunity to enact the bill before us, \nthen we are only harming ourselves, as American businesses will be at a \nserious disadvantage relative to other nations' enterprises in terms of \ntheir ability to access the Russian markets. This is not merely \ntheoretical, as my own home State of Maine exported $13.9 million worth \nof goods to Russia in 2011 alone.\n  To recognize Russia's entry into the WTO and gain the advantages for \nAmerican interests that such recognition brings, we must now consider \nthe granting of Permanent Normal Trade Relations or PNTR with Russia. \nThe United States provides PNTR to nearly all nations, but routinely \nhas denied PNTR to communist or non-market countries. Specifically, \nthis restriction has reflected our desire as a Nation that all peoples \nshould be allowed to move freely in and out of their own countries--and \nthe restriction is a reaction to the regimes that do not allow the free \nmovement and emigration of their citizens. America memorialized this \nfreedom-of-emigration concept in the Jackson-Vanik amendment, in large \npart as a response to the then-Soviet Union's consistent and often \nharsh limitations on the free movement of its people. The Soviet Union \nis no more, and now we must repeal Jackson-Vanik before PNTR can be \ngranted. The bill before us accomplishes this significant objective.\n  But we cannot simply applaud this vote without also accounting for \nsome very troubling issues that remain with Russia. This year and the \nrecent past for Russia have been clouded by a disturbingly long list of \nconcerns about just how modern and democratic Russia may truly be. \nThere are very serious questions regarding the integrity of Russia's \nelectoral process, its support for brutal regimes such as in Syria, its \nabuse of human rights within its own borders and with its neighbors, \nits new promise of a massive arms and nuclear warhead build-up, and its \nnear-flagrant disregard for intellectual property rights. We are told \nthat entry into the WTO establishes Russia's willingness to abide by a \nrules-based system, but reports of corruption throughout Russia seem to \nbelie its ability or willingness to follow the rules it set for \nitself--so we must ask, how can we trust them to follow the rules when \nworking with others? I am saddened at the thought that, by taking \naction to provide PNTR to Russia, we are potentially condoning if not \nrewarding outright the manifold abuses that Russia continues to \nperpetrate under the guise of, but seemingly in defiance of, the \nconcept of an open and lawful democracy.\n  It is with that firmly in mind that I applaud our colleague Senator \nCardin, along with Senator McCain, for identifying one way to deal with \nat least some of our serious concerns about Russia. I am speaking of \nthe Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2011, or S. \n1039. This bill recognizes the tremendous courage that Mr. Magnitsky \nshowed in seeking to expose corruption and fraud in Russia, for which \nhe paid the ultimate price. He was imprisoned and allegedly tortured in \nan attempt to make him recant the charges he was making, charges that \nturned out to be accurate, and he died in the hands of his jailers. The \nlegislation would impose visa and asset forfeiture restrictions on \nthose responsible for these foul deeds, and it could set a new standard \nfor addressing future human rights abuses in Russia. I am proud to see \nthis measure included in the bill we are voting on today and its \ninclusion was critical to my support and, I am sure, that of many of my \ncolleagues. I believe its inclusion helps make this bill a holistic \napproach that does not punish honest American interests while also not \nrewarding questionable actors within Russia.\n  Mr. President, thank you and my colleagues for this vital vote. I \nlook forward to today's debate.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, today I wish to express my support \nfor legislation granting permanent normal trade relations, PNTR, to \nRussia.\n  We need to act now so that our exporters can take advantage of \nRussia's accession to the World Trade Organization, WTO, in August.\n  The House voted to approve PNTR for Russia on November 16th on a 365-\n43 vote. The Senate Finance Committee approved its version of the bill \non a 24-0 vote in July.\n  The legislation enjoys widespread support among manufacturers, \nservice providers, and farmers.\n  It has been endorsed by, among others, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \nthe National Association of Manufacturers, and the American Farm \nBureau.\n  As a part of joining the WTO, Russia negotiated agreements with each \nmember, including the United States, making commitments to eliminate \nnon-tariff barriers, protect intellectual property, liberalize key \nsectors such as services, and improve its business climate.\n  For example, Russia agreed to: lower tariffs on industrial products \nfrom an average rate of 10 percent to 7 percent; not raise tariffs on \n90 percent of agricultural products and keep them at 15 percent or \nlower; join the WTO Information Technology Agreement and eliminate \ntariffs on major IT products within 3 years; abide by WTO rules on \nenforcement of intellectual property rights; and remove limitations on \nforeign equity in telecommunications companies, insurance companies, \nbanks, and wholesale and retail enterprises.\n  These commitments will be subject to the WTO's dispute settlement \nprocess and help promote greater transparency and a more stable \nbusiness environment for foreign investors.\n  Since the United States is a member of the WTO, this agreement \nincludes only concessions by Russia. The United States will not lower a \nsingle tariff, provide any market access benefits, or make any changes \nto U.S. trade law.\n  Under WTO rules, however, in order for the United States to take \nadvantage of Russia's commitments, it must enact permanent normal trade \nrelations for Russia.\n  Currently, Russia enjoys normal trade relations, NTR, status--the \nstatus enjoyed by a trading partner that faces the most favorable U.S. \ntariffs in exchange for similar benefits for U.S. exports.\n  This status must be renewed on an annual basis due to a provision \nenacted in the Trade Act of 1974--the so-called ``Jackson-Vanik'' \namendment--in response to concerns about Jewish emigration from the \nformer Soviet Union.\n  That law conditions normal trade relations status on a country \nallowing its citizens to emigrate freely.\n  Russia has consistently met the requirements of Jackson-Vanik since \nthe fall of the Soviet Union and its NTR status has been renewed \nannually without debate since 1994.\n  Yet, WTO rules mandate that its members provide each other with \nunconditional or ``permanent'' normal trade relations. That is, we have \nto treat each member equally, extending them the most favorable U.S. \ntariffs in exchange for similar benefits without restrictions.\n  Otherwise, they are under no obligation to extend the same favorable \ntreatment to U.S. exports.\n  Since the United States only grants Russia conditional or annual \nnormal trade relations status, the United States is not in compliance \nwith these rules and Russia can refuse to extend the market access \ncommitments it made to join the WTO to U.S. exports.\n  This is putting our exports at a competitive disadvantage because \nevery other WTO member--155 in total--has permanent normal trade \nrelations with Russia and has been receiving the benefits of Russian \nmembership in the WTO since August.\n  So while we delay, our manufacturers, service providers, farmers, and \nworkers are losing out on a fast-growing market.\n  Russia has a gross domestic product of $2.2 trillion, the sixth \nlargest in the world. Its economy is expected to grow by 4 percent \nannually through 2015, according to the International Trade \nAdministration.\n  U.S.-Russia trade grew by 37.9 percent in 2011 and total U.S.-Russia \ntrade stood at $42.9 billion.\n  This mutually beneficial relationship will continue to grow by \nenacting this legislation.\n  Let me repeat: for those who may be concerned about this \nlegislation's effects on U.S. jobs, it is important to\n\n[[Page S7445]]\n\npoint out that the United States will not have to lower a single tariff \nor make any market concessions on Russian imports by approving \npermanent normal trade relations.\n  All concessions will be made by Russia as a part of its agreement to \njoin the WTO.\n  What does this legislation mean for my home State of California?\n  Among U.S. States, California is currently the 4th largest exporter \nto Russia, according to the Coalition for U.S. Russia Trade. According \nto the Business Roundtable, California exported $665 million worth of \ngoods to Russia in 2011, supporting 2,000 California jobs.\n  In 2011 California's exported $156 million of computers and \nelectronics to Russia, our top export. Yet, U.S. companies only held \n4.2 percent of the Russian import market compared to 36.5 percent for \nthe European Union, EU.\n  As part of its WTO accession, Russia agreed to eliminate tariffs on \nIT products and take additional actions to protect IPR, including \njoining the WTO Information Technology Agreement.\n  In 2011, California exported $47 million of pharmaceuticals to \nRussia, but the EU held 77 percent of the import market. As a part of \nits WTO accession, Russia agreed to lower its tariff to 4.4 percent.\n  In 2011, California exported $90 million of cars to Russia, the \nworld's 6th largest car market. U.S. cars, however, make up only 4 \npercent of Russian imports while Japan has 40 percent of the market and \nthe EU has 35 percent.\n  As a part of its WTO accession, Russia agreed to reduce its tariff on \ncars from 20-35 percent to 15 percent.\n  In addition, for California agriculture, Russia has agreed to: lower \ntariffs on dairy from 19.8 percent to 14.9 percent; reduce its tariff \non grapes from 10 percent to 5 percent within 3 years; lower tariffs on \ncereals from 15.1 percent to 10 percent; and establish lower in-quota \ntariff rates for pork, poultry, and beef.\n  Unless we pass permanent normal trade relations, our foreign \ncompetitors will be able to use the concessions Russia made when \njoining the WTO to protect their companies and workers and increase \ntheir market share, while the United States will not be able to do the \nsame for our companies and workers.\n  As a result, failure to pass this legislation will only make it \nharder for California and U.S. companies to compete in Russia.\n  The legislation would also impose sanctions on individuals linked to \nthe incarceration and death of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky.\n  Sergei Magnitsky was a Russian attorney who was arrested in 2008 \nafter alleging wide-scale tax fraud by several law enforcement and \ngovernment officials. He died in prison a year later due to health \ncomplications while awaiting trial.\n  Investigations later found that Mr. Magnitsky was beaten and did not \nreceive proper medical attention. His case gained international \nattention and was used to highlight systematic violations of human \nrights in the Russian judicial system.\n  It is my hope that this provision will help bring those responsible \nfor Mr. Magnitsky's death to justice and encourage Russia to do more to \ntackle corruption and promote a greater respect for human rights and \nthe rule of law.\n  This is critical if Russia is to enjoy the full benefits of WTO \nmembership and attract more foreign investment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I understand now under the existing \nunanimous consent agreement we are going to be proceeding to debating a \njudge. I ask unanimous consent that immediately after the disposition \nof that nomination, I be the first Democratic Senator recognized when \nwe return to the pending trade bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/05/senate-section/article/S7445-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7445-S7448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF MICHAEL P. SHEA TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR \n                      THE DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 676, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Michael P. Shea, of \nConnecticut, to be United States District Judge for the District of \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the Senate is finally being allowed to \nvote today on the nomination of Michael Shea to be a district judge on \nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut. It has taken \nfar too long for this day to come, but he will be confirmed and I \ncongratulate him and his family on his confirmation and I congratulate \nthe two Senators from Connecticut on finally having this nomination \ncome to a vote.\n  I mention this not to urge that we confirm him because we will--and I \nwill very proudly vote for him--but Michael Shea is another nominee \nwhose nomination was stalled for months for no good reason. The \nJudiciary Committee--and the distinguished Presiding Officer serves on \nthat committee and will recall--we gave his nomination strong \nbipartisan support more than 7 months ago. He has the support of both \nhome State Senators--both Senator Lieberman and Senator Blumenthal. He \nhas significant litigation experience. He is a graduate of Yale Law \nSchool. He clerked for the conservative Judge James Buckley in the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the DC Circuit following graduation.\n  We have to ask, why did it take 7 months for the Senate to finally \nconsider his nomination--after waiting 7 months, we will talk about it \nfor 20 minutes, and then we will vote on his nomination. Why the 7-\nmonth delay? Republican obstruction.\n  After this vote, the Senate remains backlogged with 17 judicial \nnominations that go back to before the August recess. Senate \nRepublicans are establishing another harmful precedent by refusing to \nproceed on judicial nominees with bipartisan support before the end of \nthe session. They held up judicial nominees 3 years ago, they did it 2 \nyears ago, they did it last year, and now they are doing it again this \nyear.\n  They have found a new way to employ their old trick of a pocket \nfilibuster. They stall nominees into the next year, and then they force \nthe Senate, in the new year, to work on nominees from the past year. \nThey delay and delay and delay and push other confirmations back in \ntime and then cut off Senate consideration of any nominees.\n  How else does anyone explain the Republican Senate opposition to \nWilliam Kayatta of Maine, who is supported by the two Republican \nSenators from Maine? How else to explain the Republican filibuster and \ncontinuing opposition to Robert Bacharach of Oklahoma, who has the \nsupport of Senator Inhofe and Senator Coburn, the two Republican \nSenators from Oklahoma? How else to explain their adamant refusal to \nconsider the nomination of Richard Taranto to the Federal Circuit, when \nthe Judiciary Committee had seven of the eight Republican Senators \nvoting for him? One, Senator Lee, cast a ``no'' vote but said it was a \nprotest on another matter. But every single Democrat voted for him.\n  These delays may serve some petty political purpose, but the American \npeople do not want petty political purposes. They want our Nation's \ncourts to be staffed. They want the American people who seek justice to \nbe able to get it. So we should take action on all pending nominees and \nreduce the damagingly high number of judicial vacancies. Federal \njudicial vacancies remain above 80. By this point in President Bush's \nfirst term, we had reduced judicial vacancies to 28.\n  There were more than 80 vacancies when the year began. There were \nmore than 80 vacancies this past March when the majority leader was \nforced to take the extraordinary step of filing cloture motions on 17 \ndistrict court nominations--something I had never seen in my 37 years \nhere. There are going to be at least 80 vacancies after today. Before \nwe adjourn, we ought to at least vote on the 17 pending nominations \nthat could have been and should have been confirmed before the August \nrecess.\n\n[[Page S7446]]\n\n  From 1980 until this year, when a lame duck session followed a \nPresidential election, every single judicial nominee reported with \nbipartisan Judiciary Committee support has been confirmed. That is \nwhether there was a Republican or Democratic President or a Republican-\ncontrolled or Democratic-controlled Senate.\n  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, no \nconsensus nominee reported prior to the August recess has ever been \ndenied a vote--before now. Somehow, this President is treated \ndifferently than all the other Presidents before him. I have been here \nwith President Ford, President Carter, President Reagan, the first \nPresident Bush, President Clinton, the second President Bush, and now \nPresident Obama. None of those other Presidents were treated in the way \nthis President is treated. It is something Senate Democrats have never \ndone in any lame duck session, whether after a Presidential or midterm \nelection.\n  In fact, Senate Democrats allowed votes on 20 of President George W. \nBush's judicial nominees, including 3 circuit court nominees, in the \nlame duck session after the election in 2002. I remember. I was the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee. I moved forward with those votes, \nincluding one on a very controversial circuit court nominee. The Senate \nproceeded to confirm judicial nominees in lameduck sessions after the \nelections in 2004 and 2006. Actually, in 2006, we confirmed another \ncircuit court nominee.\n  We proceeded to confirm 19 judicial nominees in a lame duck session \nafter the elections of 2010, including five circuit court nominees. The \nreason I am not listing confirmations for the lame duck session at the \nend of 2008 is because that year we had proceeded to confirm the last \n10 judicial nominees approved by the Judiciary Committee in September \nand long before the lame duck session.\n  That is our history. That is our recent precedent. Those across the \naisle who contend that judicial confirmation votes during lame duck \nsessions do not take place are wrong. The facts are facts are facts. It \nis past time for votes on the 4 circuit court nominees and the other 13 \ndistrict court nominees still pending on the Executive Calendar.\n  Let's do our job. This is what the American people pay us to do. \nLet's vote up or vote down, but let's vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY Mr. President, today, the Senate turns to the \nconfirmation of another U.S. district judge. According to the \nCongressional Research Service, the Senate rarely confirms judicial \nnominees during a lameduck session in a Presidential election year. It \ndid so in a very limited fashion in 1944, 1980, and 2004.\n  The last time a President was re-elected--President Bush in 2004--\nonly three judicial nominees were confirmed following the election. \nThat year, following President Bush's re-election, 23 judicial \nnominations that were pending either on the Senate Executive Calendar \nor in the Judiciary Committee were returned to the President when the \nCongress adjourned in December.\n  Today's vote, the second post-election judicial confirmation, is \nsomewhat of a milestone for this President. It is the 100th judicial \nconfirmation during this Congress. That happens to be the same number \nof confirmations during President Bush's first term when the Democrats \ncontrolled the Senate and chaired the Judiciary Committee. I have heard \nthe chairman rightfully take pride in that accomplishment. Today we \nmatch that record. So I think that the continued complaints we hear \nabout how unfairly this President has been treated are unfounded.\n  Despite our cooperation, we continue to hear the other side argue \nthat since the President won re-election, we shouldn't follow past \npractice, but rather we should confirm a large number of nominations \nduring this lameduck session. Recently one of my colleagues on the \nother side stated: ``From 1980 until this year, when a lame duck \nsession followed a presidential election, every single judicial nominee \nreported with bipartisan Judiciary Committee support has been \nconfirmed.''\n  I suppose this is meant to imply there is some long record of routine \nconfirmations following a Presidential election. But again, that is \nsimply not the case. The record is one circuit confirmation in 1980, \nand three district confirmations in 2004. That is it. From 1980 through \n2008, those four nominations represent the entire list. With today's \nvote we will add two more confirmations to that exclusive list.\n  This year we have already confirmed 32 district judges and 5 circuit \njudges. Today's vote meets or exceeds the confirmations for \nPresidential election years in recent memory. In fact, going back to \n1984, there has been only one Presidential election year in which more \ndistrict judges were confirmed. Let me emphasize that point: In only \none of the past eight Presidential elections have more district \nnominees been confirmed.\n  Today we vote on the nomination of Michael P. Shea, to be U.S. \ndistrict judge for the District of Connecticut. With this confirmation, \nthe Senate will have confirmed 160 of President Obama's nominees to the \ndistrict and circuit courts. During the last Presidential election \nyear, 2008, the Senate confirmed a total of 28 judges--24 district and \n4 circuit. This Presidential election year we have exceeded those \nnumbers. We have confirmed 5 circuit nominees, and Mr. Shea's \nconfirmation will be the 33rd district judge confirmation. That is a \ntotal of 38 judges this year versus 28 in the last Presidential \nelection year.\n  Finally, I would note that Mr. Shea was not reported out of committee \nby a unanimous vote. There were concerns about part of his record, and \nthat resulted in a few ``no'' votes in committee. I supported the \nnomination in committee and will do so again today. But for those who \nargue that the Republicans have delayed this nomination just to \nobstruct, that is not the case.\n  Mr. Shea received his B.A. from Amherst College in 1989 and his J.D. \nfrom Yale Law School in 1993. Following graduation from law school, he \nclerked for James Buckley, U.S. circuit judge for the District of \nColumbia Circuit. Mr. Shea began his legal career in 1994 at Clearly, \nGottlieb Steen & Hamilton in Washington, DC where he worked primarily \non civil and criminal antitrust matters. In October 1995, he moved to \nClearly Gottlieb's Brussels, Belgium, office, where he continued to \nwork on antitrust matters, including European Union antitrust issues, \nas well as international business transactions in Eastern Europe and \nAfrica. In the summer of 1998, he returned to the DC office where he \nassisted in defending a corporate client in a large money laundering \nprosecution.\n  In September 1998, Mr. Shea returned to Connecticut, accepting a \nposition as an associate at Day, Berry & Howard, now known as Day \nPitney. In 2003, he became a partner with the firm. His career there \nhas spanned a broad range of civil and criminal litigation. His \npractice included trials and appeals in commercial, civil rights, \npersonal injury, criminal, family, and other cases.\n  He has tried nine cases to verdict, judgment or final decision. In \nthe past decade, he argued 20 appeals, including 6 at the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Second Circuit. The American Bar Association's Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary gave him a Unanimous Qualified \nrating.\n  Again, I support this nomination and congratulate Mr. Shea on his \nanticipated confirmation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nthe nomination of Michael Shea to serve as the next Federal district \ncourt judge for the District of Connecticut. As the Presiding Officer \nheard--and I did as well--Chairman Leahy and Senator Grassley expressed \nvery different analyses of the pace at which this Senate is confirming \njudicial nominations of President Obama, but I note, with gratitude, \nthat both of them expressed support for this particular judge, Michael \nShea, and it gives me confidence that he will receive the confirmation \nvote today that he deserves.\n  I suppose, because I am at the end of the privilege of serving as a \nSenator for 24 years, I am looking back at various opportunities and \nexperiences I have had.\n  It strikes me at this moment that I should say what I am sure is felt \nby all\n\n[[Page S7447]]\n\nof my colleagues; that is, while it is often said of Presidents of the \nUnited States that the most important decisions they make are the \npeople they put on the Federal bench, particularly Justices of the \nSupreme Court because those Justices and judges serve long after a \nPresident has left office and continue to affect the course of our \ncountry of justice under law, the same really can be said with regard \nto Senators and the role we play in proposing nominees for the Federal \ndistrict courts in our States.\n  I must say as I look back at the time I have been privileged to be in \nthe Senate, working with Senator Dodd and now with Senator Blumenthal, \nI am proud of the people we have helped onto the district courts for \nthe District of Connecticut, obviously, with a lot of support from \nnominating Presidents of both parties and from people of both parties \nin the Senate Judiciary Committee and on the Senate floor.\n  The district court bench in Connecticut is an impressive group and \nquite a diverse one as well. Michael Shea, if confirmed, will add to \nits excellence and its legal heft. In November of last year, Judge \nChristopher Droney left the district court when the Senate confirmed \nhis nomination to serve on the Federal Court of Appeals for the Second \nCircuit. Judge Droney's vacancy gave Senator Blumenthal and me the \nopportunity to recommend his replacement.\n  We took this responsibility seriously. We brought together an \nadvisory panel of nine Connecticut citizens who considered more than 20 \ncandidates for this spot. The panel included a former chief justice of \nthe Connecticut Supreme Court, a former U.S. attorney, several partners \nat major Connecticut and national law firms, and academic, business, \nand community leaders throughout the State. Their insights and hard \nwork throughout the process were invaluable to my colleague from \nConnecticut and I. I express on this floor my gratitude to them for \ntheir service.\n  Based on the work of the advisory panel and our review of its \nrecommendations, Senator Blumenthal and I recommended Michael Shea to \nthe President for nomination. I will say that Michael was ranked very \nhigh among the highly qualified applicants for this position by all \nmembers of the advisory panel. I should say right at the outset that we \nare grateful to President Obama for nominating him for this place on \nour court.\n  Michael Shea is a native of West Hartford, CT, a graduate of Amherst \nCollege and Yale Law School, served as a clerk to Judge James Buckley, \nthough a resident of Connecticut, and sat on the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the District of Columbia. Michael Shea clerked for Judge Buckley in \n1993 and 1994. I will say that Judge Buckley sent our advisory \ncommittee and, I believe, the Judiciary Committee and Senator \nBlumenthal and me a very thoughtful, positive, personal letter of \nrecommendation on Mr. Shea's behalf.\n  After concluding his clerkship, Michael Shea joined the firm of \nCleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton as an associate, where he stayed for \n4 years working on both criminal and civil cases and for a period of \ntime was dispatched to the Brussels, Belgium, office of the firm \nworking on an antitrust investigation. But much more significant than \nhis legal work, in Brussels he met his wife Frederique, and together \nthey now have three wonderful children.\n  Since 1998, Michael Shea has been a partner at Day Pittney, LLP, \nwhere his practice has included trials and appeals in commercial, civil \nrights, personal injury, criminal, and other cases. He is currently the \nchair of the firm's Appellate Practice Group. But we found in talking \nto lawyers and judges around Connecticut on the State and Federal bench \nthat Michael Shea is quite simply one of the most experienced and \nbroadly respected litigators in our State.\n  If confirmed, he will bring to the district bench an enormous \nbackground of experience in our courts. I want to add that Michael Shea \nalso serves his community in various charitable organizations, \nincluding the Nutmeg Big Brothers and Sisters, and the Supreme Court \nHistorical Society.\n  In 2008, as a result of pro bono work Michael has consistently done \nrepresenting indigent criminal defendants, he received the Connecticut \nBar Association's Pro Bono Award for successfully protecting a young \nmother from having to return her children to an abusive father who \nlived abroad.\n  First, I thank Michael Shea for his interest in serving on the \nFederal bench of Connecticut. I am honored to present him, along with \nSenator Blumenthal, to our colleagues in the Senate. He is a first \nclass nominee.\n  Again, I thank the President for nominating him. I am confident that \nthe President's trust in Mr. Shea will be more than vindicated by the \nyears of judicial service that he will give our State and country.\n  I am now glad to yield the floor to my colleague from Connecticut, \nSenator Blumenthal, who I am sure, with my successor, Chris Murphy, \nwill continue to fill vacancies as they arise. There is one now with \nthe same high level of nominee as we have been privileged to do \ntogether in this case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, let me first thank my colleague, \nSenator Lieberman, for the extraordinary work he and my predecessor, \nSenator Dodd, have done in filling our U.S. District Courts with some \nof the most eminent jurists in the United States.\n  As he has remarked so eloquently, part of the living legacy of the \nSenate and of individual Senators is, in fact, the men and women whom \nwe recommend to serve in this critically important decision.\n  As someone who has been a trial lawyer, who has practiced for a few \ndecades in the Federal district courts of our country, I know \npersonally that these men and women for most Americans are the voice \nand face of justice in our Federal courts. The U.S. Supreme Court may \nbe the highest Court in the land, but most litigants go no higher than \nthe U.S. District Court, and for them fairness and justice is the voice \nand face of the U.S. district judge.\n  So I thank the Senator for the great work he has done. In decisions \nbased on merit, without regard to personality or politics, he has \nparticipated in recommending some of the best of the best men and women \nto serve on our Federal bench.\n  Michael Shea epitomizes that quality of fairness, intellect, and \ndedication to public service. He is a native of Connecticut, but his \nexperience is national and international in scope. I am not going to \nrepeat all of the extraordinary credentials that Senator Lieberman has \ndescribed so well. I just want to say that on a level that is as \nimportant as any professional credentials in terms of temperament, he \nis the kind of person we want on our bench. He is unpresuming, \nunassuming, self-effacing, understated, but powerfully attentive to \nindividual facts and personal circumstances.\n\n  He has compassion and conviction, principle and impeccable honesty \nand integrity, and he has an empathy for people who are in distress, \nwho are in need of somebody to listen. That may be a quality that is \npreeminently important on the bench, the ability to listen and the \nattention to detail.\n  Mr. Shea has served as counsel for criminal defendants. He has argued \n20 appeals, including 6 to the Second Circuit. He has tried 9 cases to \nverdict. He has served as counsel to the Bridgeport Roman Catholic \nDiocese in first amendment matters. I worked with him personally in a \nprofessional capacity when I was attorney general of the State of \nConnecticut. I know him as someone who will do justice and love mercy.\n  He is a man whom we can be proud to support. I am proud to support \nhim. I thank President Obama for nominating him and the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Patrick Leahy, for his leadership on our committee \nin making sure he had a hearing and a vote, and now this vote is here.\n  I thank also our ranking member, Senator Grassley, for his \ngraciousness in stating that he would support him. My hope is that the \nU.S. District Court of Connecticut, which faces a backlog now, will \nhave the good fortune to have remaining vacancies filled at the \nearliest possible date by lawyers as eminently qualified as soon-to-be \njudge Michael Shea. I thank this body in advance for approving him.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7448]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield back all remaining time and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Michael P.

The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Kirk), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. DeMint), \nand the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. \nDeMint) would have voted ``nay,'' and the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. \nAlexander) would have voted ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet).

Mr. President, I wish to explain my vote against Mr. \nMichael Shea, nominee to the District Court of Connecticut. My decision \nis based on Mr. Shea's assistance in drafting an anticus brief in the \nSupreme Court case of Kelo v. New London on behalf of the Connecticut \nConference of Municipalities and other municipalities.\n  The Kelo decision delivered a serious blow to private property rights \nby upholding a municipality's use of eminent domain to seize private \nhomes and transfer the property to a pharmaceutical company for \npurposes of ``economic development.'' As Justice Sandra Day O'Connor \nstated in her dissent, the ``Court abandoned its long-held, basis \nlimitation on government power'' in the Kelo case. The Fifth Amendment \nof the Constitution states: ``No person shall be . . . deprived of \nlife, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall \nprivate property be taken for public use, without just compensation.'' \nThe Kelo decision altered what was traditionally viewed as ``public \nuse.'' As Justice O'Connor noted, as a result of this decision, \n``Nothing is to prevent the State from replacing any Motel 6 with a \nRitz-Carlton, any home with a shopping mall, or any farm with a \nfactory. . . . Any property may now be taken for the benefit of another \nprivate party, but the fallout from this decision will not be random. \nThe beneficiaries are likely to be those citizens with disproportionate \ninfluence and power in the political process, including large \ncorporations and development firms.''\n  In contrast, Mr. Shea's amicus brief argued the eminent domain action \ntaken by New London was constitutional and should be upheld. He \nasserted the ``taking of some of the petitioners'' homes'' is \n``undeniably a genuine cost of realizing the City's goal of improving \nthe economic well-being of its citizens?' But, the Public Use Clause \n``sweeps as broadly as the [State's] police powers.'' He said siding \nwith the Kelo plaintiffs in the case would ``contort'' the Public Use \nClause. Justice Stevens, the author of the 5-4 majority opinion in \nKelo, cited Mr. Shea's brief in his opinion.\n  Perhaps the saddest aspect of this case is the ``economic \ndevelopment'' that was key to the taking being a ``public use'' never \nhappened because the developer could not get funding. Susette Kelo lost \nher property for nothing. The site of her former home is a garbage \ndump. This fact exposes another reason the takings clause was only \nintended for public use, because the government is more likely to have \nthe funding ready to use the property. Normally, I would not hold a \nlawyer responsible for the legal views of his clients, but the Kelo \ndecision dealt such a serious blow to private property rights, a \ncrucial element of our founding principles, and so clearly departs from \nthe original understanding of the Constitution, I feel I must vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motion to \nreconsider is considered made and laid upon the table. The President \nshall be immediately notified of the Senate's action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/05/senate-section/article/S7448-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Russia PNTR bill that is before us \ntakes a long overdue action by ending the application of Jackson-Vanik \nsanctions to Russia. Jackson-Vanik is no longer relevant to Russia \nbecause Russia no longer restricts the free emigration of its people.\n  The Soviet Union began to relax its restrictions on Jewish emigration \nin 1987, during Gorbachev's perestroika. Following the collapse of the \nSoviet Union in 1991, millions of Soviet Jews were permitted to leave. \nSince then, Russia has allowed free emigration.\n  I have felt for a long time that we should have graduated Russia from \nJackson-Vanik when Jackson-Vanik's noble purpose was achieved, rather \nthan waiting years, often in the effort to make other points relative \nto Russia on other issues. First some history.\n  In 2007, I met with Rabbi Lazar, chief rabbi of Russia, regarding \nJackson-Vanik. He urged passage of legislation ending the application \nof Jackson-Vanik to Russia.\n  Also in 2007, I received a letter from the chairman of the Federation \nof Jewish Communities, which represents presidents and rabbis of over \n200 Jewish communities in Russia, a letter which urged me to work to \ngraduate Russia from the Jackson-Vanik amendment in view of the fact \nthat its goals had already been met. Part of his letter reads as \nfollows:\n\n       [W]e are thankful for all your efforts toward gaining \n     freedom for our country's Jews. We will always appreciate the \n     role of Jackson-Vanik in bringing about change. We also \n     remain grateful to those who forced the U.S.S.R.'s Communist \n     regime to permit Jews to emigrate, and to end discrimination. \n     For us this was a huge morale boost--Jews behind the Iron \n     Curtain were thrilled that Americans were willing to risk \n     political and economic confrontation, in order to stand up \n     for the freedom and rights of their fellow human beings.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       Nevertheless, in the last 15 years the situation has \n     changed, radically. The freedom for Soviet Jews to live \n     wherever they desire was fully obtained; nearly a million \n     Jews from the F.S.U. now live in Israel, while hundreds of \n     thousands live in other countries throughout the world. We \n     are positive that these developments were in part thanks to \n     the American lawmakers who supported the Jackson-Vanik \n     amendment. Yet we now see a backward migration, when Jews \n     from abroad move back to Russia. This proves that Jews in \n     Russia feel as confident as those inhabiting other countries \n     of the Free World.\n\n  The rabbi added: ``The provisions of the Jackson-Vanik amendment have\n\n[[Page S7449]]\n\nalready achieved the goals of its initiators.'' That was in 2007. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the Federation \nof Jewish Communities of Russia be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     Federation of\n\n\n                                 Jewish Communities of Russia,\n\n                                                   April 16, 2007.\n     Hon. Senator Carl Levin,\n     Russell Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: I am writing this letter in my name and \n     in the name of the Presidents and Rabbis of over 200 Jewish \n     communities throughout our country which comprise the \n     Federation of Jewish Communities. I am writing to you on \n     behalf of our constituency, to ask you to work to graduate \n     Russia from the Jackson-Vanik amendment in view of the fact \n     that its goals have already been met.\n       We know that the fate of Soviet Jewry is important to you, \n     and we are thankful for all your efforts towards gaining \n     freedom for our country's Jews. We will always appreciate the \n     role of Jackson-Vanik in bringing about change. We also \n     remain grateful to those who forced the USSR's Communist \n     regime to permit Jews to emigrate, and to end discrimination. \n     For us this was a huge morale boost--Jews behind the Iron \n     Curtain were thrilled that Americans were willing to risk \n     political and economic confrontation, in order to stand up \n     for the freedom and rights of their fellow human beings.\n       Nevertheless, in the last 15 years the situation has \n     changed, radically. The freedom for Soviet Jews to live \n     wherever they desire was fully obtained; nearly a million \n     Jews from the F.S.U. now live in Israel, while hundreds of \n     thousands live in other countries throughout the world. We \n     are positive that these developments were in part thanks to \n     the American lawmakers who supported the Jackson-yank \n     amendment. Yet we now see a backward migration, when Jews \n     from abroad move back to Russia. This proves that Jews in \n     Russia feel as confident as those inhabiting other countries \n     of the Free World.\n       Today the Jewish people have equal rights with the general \n     population. Jewish life in our country has experienced \n     dynamic growth. While it is well known that during the years \n     that Communism ruled we were forbidden to pray in synagogues, \n     and to learn the Torah or Hebrew, now, most of the larger \n     cities have built community centers, Jewish schools, day care \n     centers, humanitarian facilities, and artistic collectives, \n     in addition to synagogues. The country's leaders, inducting \n     the President, regularly visit Jewish communities. Russia's \n     Jews are treated as equal citizens and any outburst of anti-\n     Semitism is met with harsh consequences.\n       The provisions of the Jackson-yank amendment have already \n     achieved the goals of its initiators. At this point a public \n     ceremony marking the official graduation of Russia from the \n     provisions of the amendment would be a tremendous opportunity \n     to remind the rest of the world that the U.S. has \n     successfully completed a policy initiative, and will continue \n     to look after the needs of the Jewish people and to defend \n     them from discrimination. At the same time, the abolishment \n     of this amendment in respect to Russia would reiterate to the \n     rest of the world that America is ready to commit the \n     resources necessary to the needs of the Jewish people. It \n     would also demonstrate fairness, acknowledging that when a \n     ``carrot and stick'' policy is pursued, the reward for \n     compliance will, in fact, be paid as promised.\n       Thanking you in advance for your kind help, I remain,\n                                                 Alexander Boroda,\n                                             Chairman, FJC Russia.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So I am glad, very glad, that finally, the Jackson-Vanik \nlaw is no longer going to apply to Russia.\n  Not only does the bill under consideration grant Russia PNTR, it also \ncontains enforcement provisions that my brother, Congressman Sander \nLevin, fought for to address concerns about Russia's compliance with \nits WTO obligations and other trade concerns such as Russia's \npersistent failure to stop intellectual property rights infringement, \nand to help promote the rule of law in Russia. These are important \nenforcement tools that will give us a chance to monitor Russia's \nprogress in fulfilling its commitments. I have looked forward to \ngetting these actions accomplished in PNTR legislation.\n  The bill before us also includes the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law \nAccountability Act of 2012 which was inspired by the Russian \nwhistleblower Sergei Magnitsky, who was ruthlessly murdered. The \nlegislation would require that human rights violators in Russia be \nidentified and that we deny them U.S. visas as well as freeze their \nU.S. assets.\n  However, and here's the problem for me, the Magnitsky language before \nus is not the Magnitsky language adopted by our Finance and Foreign \nRelations committees. Their Magnitsky language applied the same \nsanctions to human rights violators wherever they might be--whether in \nRussia, or Syria, or Sudan, or North Korea, or China, or in any other \ncountry.\n  In other words, the Senate committee-approved bill wisely adopted a \nglobal Magnitsky standard. The reasoning for this is sound, because \nwhile the mechanism of U.S. visa denial for human rights violators was \ninspired by a single case in a single nation, the principles that it \nseeks to advance are universal. This bipartisan Senate committee bill, \nunlike the House-passed version of the Magnitsky Act that we will soon \nvote on, does not single out Russian human-rights violators for visa \ndenial, but would apply the visa denial mechanism to people from any \ncountry who violate important human rights standards. The United States \nshould be clear and firm in its commitment to protecting human rights, \nwherever the violations occur, and to holding those who violate those \nrights accountable to the best of our ability, including denying them \nvisas to come to our country. Human rights do not end at the borders of \nRussia, and anyone who violates those standards, as so many did so \nblatantly in the case of Sergei Magnitsky, should be held accountable.\n  Applying the Magnitsky provisions globally, as the Senate bill \napproved by our committees did, follows in the spirit of Jackson-Vanik, \nwhich, while inspired by events in the Soviet Union, was not limited to \nthe Soviet Union.\n  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Finance \nCommittee both voted unanimously to report a version of the Magnitsky \nbill that applies its sanctions globally. Senators Cardin and Kyl have \nworked, on a bipartisan basis, to build support for that global \nstandard, and I strongly support their effort. I commend them on their \neffort.\n  So why is that Senate committee-reported bill not before the Senate? \nWhy would we deny visas only to Russian human rights violators? Why \ndiminish the universality of the values the Magnitsky bill seeks to \nuphold?\n  Applying the sanctions contained in this bill solely to Russians, as \nthe House version does, not only diminishes a universal value. Because \nit adds a political twist, it will stoke a nationalistic response in \nRussia. If this bill does not apply the same rule to all human rights \nviolators, if it singles out Russian human rights violators, President \nPutin will no doubt appeal to the nationalistic passions of many \nRussians by saying that our bill isn't aimed at protecting human \nrights, but is aimed at Russia. We should not hand President Putin that \nargument.\n  The Senate bill, as approved by our committees, very appropriately \npays tribute to the man whose tragic death inspired the legislation, \nand applies its message universally. I deeply regret that the House \nbill before us does not take that approach.\n  I don't understand why we are not taking up the Senate version, the \nversion approved by our two committees, and applying these standards \nuniversally. The only answer I get is that the House of Representatives \nmight not accept the Senate version. Well, we should do what we believe \nin, as reflected in two unanimous votes in two committees, and not be \nderailed by a prediction that the House will not accept our version. \nThere is time left in this session to test that prediction. The failure \nto do so is inexplicable to me. The House of Representatives did not \nhave a vote focusing on the issue of applying these sanctions globally. \nWe should give them a chance to do so.\n  In summary, it is important that we lift the Jackson-Vanik sanctions. \nIt is important that we speak out on the tragic death of Sergei \nMagnitsky and hold those responsible to account. These are issues on \nwhich I believe so strongly and that I have worked long and hard, \nparticularly on Jackson-Vanik, to achieve. Taking these steps should be \na cause of celebration.\n  But the violations of human rights that the Magnitsky bill seeks to \nremedy are far too widespread for us to apply remedies only to Russians \nhuman rights violators. The United States has an opportunity here to \nmake a strong, unmistakable statement about the sanctity of human \nrights. We should want that statement to ring out not just in Moscow, \nbut around the world.\n\n[[Page S7450]]\n\n  I know some of my colleagues have expressed hope that we can pass \nlegislation to address this issue in the next Congress. I know of no \nreason to believe that we will have significantly greater chances of \naccomplishing this goal next year than we do today.\n  Mr. President, over the next few weeks, we have time to conference \nand pass a defense authorization bill. We have time to debate and avoid \nthe fiscal cliff. We have time to address a farm bill and dozens of \nother important issues. And we have time to address the transcendent \nissue of the universal rights of mankind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nlegislation before us to enact permanent normal trade relations with \nrespect to Russia and Moldova. This legislation will also put in place \na new mechanism for combating human rights abuses and strengthening the \nruling of law in Russia commonly known as the Magnitsky bill. The \neconomic argument for the legislation before us is clear. Russia is the \nworld's sixth largest economy; the world's fifth largest global \nimporter of agricultural products, and home to 140 million potential \ncustomers, the largest consumer market in Europe.\n  Russia is already an important and growing market for U.S. \nbusinesses. Of the top 15 U.S. trading partners, Russia was the market \nwhere American companies enjoyed the fastest export growth last year, \nat 38 percent. If we enact PNTR, it is estimated that U.S. exports of \ngoods and services to Russia could literally double over the next 5 \nyears. That is why groups ranging from the American Farm Bureau to the \nNational Association of Manufacturers to the National Corn Growers, \njust to name a few, strongly support PNTR.\n  Just last week I met with representatives from the South Dakota \nSoybean Association, and I was reminded of the importance of Russia as \na growing export market to my State of South Dakota. While greater \naccess to the Russian market will benefit a wide range of U.S. \ncompanies, such as manufacturers and service providers, I would be \nremiss not to point out the enormous opportunity for America's \nagricultural producers in Russia. Consider that Russia is the world's \nlargest importer of beef on a quantity basis, with imports of nearly $4 \nbillion last year. Russia is the world's fifth largest importer of pork \nproducts as well as the world's largest importer of dairy products.\n  Despite the problems we have encountered recently with respect to our \npoultry exports, America remains the single largest supplier of poultry \nto the Russian market, accounting for 50 percent of Russian poultry \nimports last year.\n  Under the terms of Russia's WTO accession, which occurred last year, \nRussia is obligated to reduce tariffs across a wide range of \nagricultural products while also adhering to WTO rules regarding \nsanitary and phyto-sanitary measures. Once we have enacted PNTR the \nUnited States will have the ability to enforce visa commitments through \nthe World Trade Organization dispute settlement process.\n  It is important to note that our vote on passage of this bill is \ndifferent than voting on a trade agreement where both sides make \nconcessions in order to reach a conclusion. In contrast, our vote on \nthe House-passed Russia PNTR bill is entirely one-sided in favor of the \nUnited States. Russia joined the World Trade Organization in August and \nwill remain a member of the WTO regardless of what we do with respect \nto PNTR.\n  We are not giving Russia anything new because they have received PNTR \non a recurring annual basis for the past 20 years. The only issue today \nis whether we will now allow U.S. businesses to take full advantage of \nthe new trade commitments that Russia has made as part of joining the \nWorld Trade Organization. If we do not act, American manufacturers, \nfarmers, ranchers, and service providers will remain at a competitive \ndisadvantage relative to their foreign competitors doing business in \nRussia.\n  At a time when our economy is growing more slowly than any \npostrecession recovery since World War II, failure to enact PNTR makes \nno sense. American export growth has been one of the true bright spots \nsince the great recession.\n  According to the Department of Commerce, jobs supported by exports \nincreased by 1.2 million between 2009 and 2011.\n  If we are serious about encouraging job creation, we need to continue \nto open new job markets abroad for American exports. Normalizing our \ntrade relationship with Russia is an important step in the right \ndirection.\n  While this legislation is about supporting American jobs by promoting \nour exports, we should also recognize the importance of the Magnitsky \nprovision included in this bill at the insistence of Senators Cardin, \nKyl, McCain, and Wicker, among others. By replacing the outdated \nJackson-Vanik law with a new mechanism to support democratic reforms in \nRussia, this legislation will strengthen the rule of law while \ncombating corruption and human rights abuses.\n  The only thing surprising about this vote is that it did not happen \nsooner. Nearly 6 months ago, on June 12, I joined Senators Baucus, \nMcCain, and Kerry in introducing legislation to enact PNTR. With the \nleadership of Senator Hatch and others, we approved the PNTR \nlegislation in the Finance Committee by a unanimous vote on July 18.\n  Unfortunately, many of us believe the administration did not push \nforcefully enough for enactment of PNTR before Russia joined the World \nTrade Organization in August. As a result, we are just now finally \nconsidering this legislation more than 3 months after Russia's WTO \naccession.\n  Nevertheless, I look forward to enactment of this bill, especially \nconsidering the overwhelming bipartisan vote of approval for this \nlegislation in the House of Representatives just a few weeks ago. While \ntoday's vote is specific to Russia and Moldova, I hope this vote will \nremind us of the importance of moving forward on trade in general. It \nis an unfortunate reality that when America stands still on trade, we \nare actually falling behind relative to the rest of the world. There \nare more than 100 new free-trade agreements currently under negotiation \naround the world. Yet the United States is party to only one of those \nnegotiations, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n  The United States has not successfully negotiated a single new trade \nagreement during the 4 years of the Obama administration, and this \nadministration has not yet asked Congress for a renewal of trade \npromotion authority, despite the fact that TPA expired over 5 years \nago. The cost of inaction on trade is high because we live in a global \neconomy where American producers rely on access to foreign markets. \nMore than 95 percent of global consumers live outside the United \nStates.\n  Consider that in 1960 exports accounted for only 3.6 percent of \nGDP. Exports account for 12.5 percent of our GDP. Exports of U.S. goods \nand services supported over 10 million American jobs. If we do not \naggressively pursue new market opening agreements on behalf of American \nworkers, we will see new export opportunities go to foreign businesses \nand foreign workers.\n\n  So while I am pleased that we are considering PNTR today, I hope \nPresident Obama in his second term will recognize the potential for \nincreased trade opportunities through a more aggressive trade agenda. I \nlook forward to the President signing this legislation into law, and I \nurge all of my colleagues to vote for the legislation before us when \nthat vote comes up tomorrow at noon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The bill before us, the permanent normal trade relations \nwith Russia, is important legislation to expand trading opportunities. \nI was thinking, as the Senator from South Dakota spoke about this \ndebate on the floor and what it was like around this Chamber several \ndecades ago when this issue was raised and there was a strong feeling \nfor the Jackson-Vanik provisions which prohibited certain trade between \nthe United States and so-called communist countries of their day, there \nwere those voices on the other side, many from the Heartland such as \nSenator Thune and myself. Senator Humphrey used to say, sell anything \nthat can't shoot back at us, and that meant a lot of wheat sometimes \nand other agricultural commodities.\n\n[[Page S7451]]\n\n  I will speak to that trade relation aspect in a second, but before I \ndo, I want to address an aspect of this bill that is very important to \nme and should be to every Member of the Senate.\n  I am honored to be the chair of the Judiciary Committee Subcommittee \non the Constitution, Human Rights and Civil Rights. We have had a \nseries of hearings on the issues of human rights and laws in the United \nStates that affect them. I have also been honored to join with Senator \nCardin of Maryland who chairs our Helsinki Commission Senate Delegation \nand has been on several trips overseas. He has made human rights a part \nof that commission and part of the United States.\n  One of the aspects of this bill is so important. Sadly today in the \ncountry of Russia we are seeing evidence of brutal and horrific \ntreatment of individuals and abuse of human rights. Senator Cardin--who \nI said earlier is a great voice of human rights in the Senate--\nintroduced legislation in this Congress that would impose U.S. visa \nbans and asset freezes on those who commit gross human rights \nviolations around the world. That is a Cardin amendment which I thought \nwas a good one. The idea was simple: Those who commit such acts that \nare so contradictory to American values should not be allowed to visit \nor stash their wealth in our country, period.\n  The inspiration of this came from a terrible episode which occurred \nin Russia. A lawyer named Sergei Magnitsky died a tragic death while in \ncustody in Russia after being arrested for uncovering official \ncorruption. Magnitsky was working for Hermitage Capital, once the \nlargest Russian-only fund in the world. Drawn into the feud between the \nfund and Russian law enforcement authorities, he testified that senior \nRussian Interior Ministry officers had used his employer's companies to \nembezzle $230 million from the Russian treasury.\n  Later the same police officers he accused arrested him. They held him \nwithout bail on charges of evading taxes. After 11 months in custody, \nrepeatedly being denied medical care, he died at age 37. Russia's top \ninvestigative commission said that he died of heart disease and \nhepatitis that he could have survived with basic medical care. A \nparallel Russian Presidential advisory report said that he may have \ndied because of a beating while in prison.\n  Over time prison officials were dismissed but got jobs elsewhere. \nRussian authorities have also occasionally raised the prospect of a \nmore thorough investigation, but they ignored extensive evidence \nlinking police officials to Magnitsky's death. Incredibly, some of \nthose involved have even received medals for meritorious service by the \nRussian Government.\n  Sergei Magnitsky's death is part of a deeply troubling retreat on \nbasic political freedom and human rights in Russia. Activists and human \nrights leaders were harassed, often threatened with new sweeping \ntreason laws for speaking up against fraud, corruption, or denial of \nbasic rights. We saw what happened to Sergei Magnitsky when he tried to \nspeak out against corruption. I am saddened that the leadership of a \ngreat nation such as Russia is resorting to these hideous tactics. They \nare a throwback of the worst of the Soviet era. Our friends the Russian \npeople deserve a vision that looks forward to a new future that \nincludes freedom and human rights, not the past which adds sad chapters \nof the denial of both of these.\n  I am pleased today to speak in support of this bill. Unfortunately, \nit doesn't include the original Cardin amendment. The original Cardin \namendment had a global reach and said that we would treat virtually \nanyone guilty of these crimes the same way, denying visas and freezing \ntheir assets in the United States. Incidentally, that provision is said \nto be similar to an amendment that I just offered on the Defense \nauthorization bill as it related to supporting the M23 rebels causing \nmayhem in the Congo.\n  Unfortunately, the new provision modification of Senator Cardin's \noriginal limits the activities to those that occurred in Russia. He and \nI both wish it had gone farther, but often those imposing harsh and \narbitrary violations of their own people like to travel and hide their \nmoney. They should not be allowed to do it in the United States. If \nthey want to enjoy the benefits of the United States, respect our basic \ndemocracy and values.\n  Let me say a word about the overall bill. It is an important step \nforward and creates more opportunity for trade. I believe trade opens \nthe doors for exchanges of ideas, people, culture, and opens the doors \nto democracy.\n  The United States exported nearly $43 billion in goods to Russia in \n2011. My State of Illinois exported $287 million in heavy equipment \nalone, such as bulldozers and tractors. Extending permanent normal \ntrade relations to Russia will ensure business not only in Illinois but \nacross America to make sure we don't suffer a disadvantage of trade \nwith Russia.\n  Russia has made a dramatic break with the Soviet past. The United \nStates can help Russia on its path to an even better future, one that \nis more integrated socially and economically.\n  I again commend Senator Cardin for ensuring that our Nation's \nintolerance for human rights violations is not part of this process. \nAnd to the many Russian people who are trying to push for a more open \nand transparent country, we applaud their noble and courageous efforts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nlegislation before us, the repeal for Jackson-Vanik for Russia and \nMoldova and the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act.\n  The two main components of this package represent a win-win for U.S. \nbusinesses and for human rights defenders in Russia. Chairman Baucus \nand Chairman Kerry deserve a lot of credit for working together to get \nus to this point.\n  I also want to join my colleague Senator Durbin in singling out and \ncommending Senator Cardin of Maryland for his tremendous effort to \nbring this historic piece of human rights legislation to the floor \ntonight.\n  As one of the original cosponsors of the Magnitsky Act, I remember \nback in May of last year when Senator Cardin first introduced the bill. \nSince that time, he has been the driving force that has pushed this \nmeasure forward. It has taken a lot of patience, a lot of perseverance, \nbut his work on behalf of human rights in Russia has paid off, and he \nis a big reason why we are here debating this bill today.\n  This legislation comes at a complex time in the bilateral \nrelationship between the United States and Russia. The truth is the \nhistory of this relationship has always been full of complexity and \nseeming contradictions, and today is no different.\n  Over the last 4 years the subtle change in tone brought on by the \nreset has allowed us to establish substantial progress on some limited \nareas of mutual interests including the New START Treaty, Afghanistan, \nand Iran.\n  In addition, Russia has finally joined the World Trade Organization, \nwhich is another mutually beneficial outcome. Russia will become a more \nfully engaged member of the global trade community, and in exchange it \nwill be forced to abide by internationally recognized rules on trade \nand investment, including international property enforcement, the \nelimination of some key tariffs, and greater transparency in its laws \nand regulations.\n  Despite these obvious advantages for the United States, our \nbusinesses are currently stuck on the sidelines and unable to benefit \nfrom Russia's accession because of the outdated Jackson-Vanik \nlegislation. Although it was successful in its time, Jackson-Vanik \nremains the last obstacle for U.S. businesses to gain critical access \nto Russian markets and create jobs here at home.\n  The legislation before us now retires Jackson-Vanik and lets American \nbusinesses compete with the rest of the world to sell exports to and \nattract investment from Russia. Each and every State stands to gain \nfrom this legislation. In my home State of New Hampshire, exports to \nRussia have been on the rise over the last 2 years, particularly with \nrespect to transportation equipment, computers, electronics, and \nmachinery. If given the opportunity, I am confident that New Hampshire \nbusinesses will be able to successfully compete in the growing Russian \nmarket, and this legislation will help them\n\n[[Page S7452]]\n\nto do that. So even as we seek areas of mutual interest with Russia, we \nshould be honest and admit that areas of disagreement remain.\n  Perhaps the most pressing issue for today's relationship with Russia \nis the human rights situation there. Indeed, over the last 6 months we \nhave seen perhaps the worst deterioration in Russia's human rights \nrecord since the breakup of the Soviet Union. The Putin government has \nenacted a series of laws that restrict protests and public expression \nand severely constrain civil society in the country.\n  As some may know, my home State of New Hampshire has a motto that is \nwell known throughout this country. It is: ``Live free or die.'' We are \nnot ambiguous regarding how we feel about the principles on which this \ncountry was founded. The United States is not, should not, and will not \nbe shy about our staunch support for democratic values around the \nworld. When it comes to Russia, we should be no different.\n  The Magnitsky bill before us is an important tool to raise the \nprofile of human rights in Russia. It is supported almost unanimously \nby opposition and civil society figures across Russia. The case of Mr. \nMagnitsky is a tragic one, as so many people have eloquently talked \nabout today. We are here as part of this legislation to press for \naccountability in his death. However, this is really more than simply a \nquestion of one man's tragic case.\n  The State Department's human rights report annually describes \ncountless human rights violations, including attacks on journalists, \nphysical abuse of citizens, politically motivated imprisonments, and \ngovernment harassment and violence. There are numerous cases like \nMagnitsky and, unfortunately, there are likely to be many more.\n  That is why this bill before us is so important. It seeks to ensure \nthat no human rights abusers in Russia are granted the privilege of \ntraveling to this country or using our financial system. A strong, \nsuccessful, and transparent Russia that protects the rights of its \ncitizens is squarely in the interest of the United States. The \nMagnitsky Act will demonstrate that we stand unambiguously for the rule \nof law, for democracy, and for respect for human rights in Russia.\n  As we look forward and think about our relationship with Russia, we \nhave to be both pragmatic and principled. A successful policy with \nRussia will find a way to both protect our interests and defend our \nvalues. I think the legislation that is before us today is a perfect \nexample of how we can do both, and I certainly hope my colleagues will \nstrongly support its passage and send it directly to the President for \nhis signature.\n  Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Shaheen for her leadership \non this issue. We have had many discussions about how to advance human \nrights and what is the best strategy to get the Magnitsky bill enacted \ninto law. She has been a real champion with her leadership on the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee on Europe and her leadership on the \nHelsinki Commission. I thank her for her good advice for allowing us to \nbe able to get to this day.\n  I am convinced tomorrow the Senate will pass this legislation, the \nPresident is going to sign it, and we will achieve a great victory for \nhuman rights.\n  I thank the Senator for her observations as we were talking about how \nto move forward with this bill in connection with PNTR for Russia. I \nknow Senator Lieberman talked about it a little bit earlier. I am \nconvinced, as important as this bill was, that the Magnitsky bill by \nitself would have been extremely difficult for us to get through to the \nPresident and for the President to sign into law and that in combining \nit with PNTR, we got it done. I also believe that PNTR without \nMagnitsky would not have gotten done. So I think the marriage of these \ntwo bills was the right choice. They allow us to move forward, as \nSenator Levin said, repealing a provision that is not relevant for \nRussia, while also allowing us to make a new standard for Russia that \nis relevant for our problems we are confronting not just in Russia but \nthroughout the globe.\n\n  I wish to comment a little bit about Senator Levin's point. Senator \nLevin raised the issue of why couldn't we make this global. As Senator \nMcCain said, countries are on notice, particularly those countries that \nare known for their human rights violations. They now know what the \nstandard is, and they know what action the United States will take if \nthey don't meet that standard.\n  The standard is very clear. I will just read it into the Record one \nmore time so every country knows and every individual knows we will be \ntaking action against those who violate human rights. It says any \nindividual who ``is responsible for extrajudicial killings, torture, or \nother gross violations of internationally recognized human rights \ncommitted against individual seeking . . . to obtain, exercise, defend, \nor promote internationally recognized human rights. . . . ''\n  That is the standard. That is what is in this bill. That is what we \nwill be voting on tomorrow. That is what has been approved by the House \nof Representatives and I believe will be approved tomorrow by this body \nand will be signed into law by the President of the United States. We \nare establishing the standard that will be used to deny human rights \nviolators the right to visit our country, to obtain a visa, and to use \nour banking system.\n  Senator Levin is absolutely correct. The bill that came out of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee and the Finance Committee made it \ncrystal clear by statute that it applied globally. I strongly supported \nthat. I support that now. I would love to see that in our bill, but we \nneed to get this bill done. I would have preferred to see us take up \nthe amendment, hopefully pass the amendment, and work it out with the \nHouse. However, it was the collective wisdom that in order to get this \nbill done, particularly with the administration's position on it--they \ndid not support the global legislative solution at this point--that it \nwas unlikely we would reach the finish line and get that done.\n  That doesn't diminish the global impact of this bill. I need to \nunderscore that. It does not diminish the global impact of this bill. \nSenator McCain is right. Countries and individuals are on notice. I can \ntell my colleagues that as a Member of this body, I will be monitoring, \nand if there are individual people who have committed these gross \nviolations and who are seeking to come to America and use our banking \nsystem, I am going to take action. It may be filing additional \nlegislation. I hope we get it done. I hope we will find an opportunity \nto get the Senate language into law, that the legislative standard \nspecifically applies globally.\n  Let me point out we already have authority. The Secretary of State \nalready has authority to deny human rights violators the right to come \nto America. Before I filed the Magnitsky bill, I sent a letter to the \nSecretary of State saying we know who the perpetrators of the crimes \nagainst Mr. Magnitsky are; deny them the right. They want to come to \nAmerica. They are planning to come to America. Don't let them. We went \nback and forth a little bit as to what they were going to do.\n  What is interesting is that I filed this legislation with Senator \nMcCain and many others. Secretary Clinton took action. She said we will \ndeny them the opportunity of coming to America; we have that authority. \nThe Secretary of the Treasury has certain authorities to deny the \nrights of our banking system. So we have--our agencies have the \ninherent authority to block human rights violators from coming to \nAmerica or using our banking system. Should we legislate to make that \nclear? Absolutely. Should we pass legislation that is global? \nAbsolutely. I hope we will do that.\n  Today we have the opportunity to make a major advancement to \nestablish the standard in statute that we expect will be honored \ninternationally, globally, to provide the tools to act against Russia \nbecause this is a PNTR Russia bill. We will be able to do that. We also \nhave the tools in place to be able to take further action.\n  So what I said earlier I think is absolutely true. This isn't an end \nof a chapter of U.S. leadership. I can tell my colleagues when Senator \nJackson and Congressman Vanik suggested the use of trade as a leverage \nto block trade with countries if they didn't respect the basic human \nright of allowing their\n\n[[Page S7453]]\n\npeople to leave, there were many people who said: Why are you doing \nthat? Can't we just talk it out? That bill produced incredible results \nnot only on the individuals who were able to leave the Soviet Union, \nbut it spoke to America's leadership.\n  I honestly believe it helped establish the principles where the \nUnited States used trade to open and eliminate the apartheid government \nof South Africa. We were the leaders on that. We have been very strong \non protecting human rights and saying: We will use every tool at our \ndisposal to protect people's basic rights. We did that in South Africa \nand we did that in the Soviet Union and we are doing it again today. \nThat is where America's leadership shines. That is where America's \nleadership will be followed by other countries. We are already seeing \nother European capitals pass similar legislation as the Magnitsky bill \nto make this clear. We are ending a chapter with Jackson-Vanik and we \nshould be very proud of what America stood for, what we stand for \ntoday, and our leadership in the lives of real people and how it has \nhelped keep people safer.\n  Now we are starting a new chapter and that new chapter is not just \nRussia. That new chapter is global. We are putting the international \ncommunity on notice that we will not tolerate individuals who violate \nbasic human rights, and we will use every tool at our disposal, \nincluding trade, including the right to come to America, including the \nright to use our banking system, including putting as much pressure as \nwe possibly can on countries to take action against those who violate \nrights.\n  We respect the rights of individual countries. We want to work with \nthose countries, but America will not give up its values and on \npromoting these values internationally. That is what this legislation \nis.\n  I understand the disappointment that we don't have everything in this \nbill we would like. I am certainly disappointed. I fought hard. I spoke \nto so many Members in both the House and the Senate about trying to \nmake this bill even better. I am proud of how far we were able to get, \nand I can tell my colleagues this: The activists who are risking their \nlives today in countries around the world to protect the rights of \ncitizens, to question the actions of their government, to dare to say \nwe should have competitive elections, we should respect the religious \nfreedoms of individuals, we should be able to speak out, these people \nare putting their lives at risk. They are looking at what the Senate is \ndoing today, and they are looking at us and saying: Pass this bill. \nPass this bill because it gives us hope. It lets our countries know \nAmerica will stand for us, that America's leadership will be there to \nkeep us safe.\n  I know we have had a spirited discussion this evening. We will have a \nchance tomorrow to vote on this bill. I do believe we will have the \nopportunity to show America's leadership will be continuing to advance \nhuman rights. This legislation will make a difference not just in the \ntrade relationships between Russia and the United States--it will help \nthat--but it will help advance international respect for human rights. \nI am proud to be part of that effort.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

RUDMAN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues in extending \ncondolences to the family of Senator Warren Rudman, and add my voice to \nthose saluting a distinguished, effective and principled member of this \nbody.\n  It has been hard in the last few months, for those of us who knew and \nserved with him, not to think of Warren Rudman. More than 2 decades \nago, our circumstances were strikingly similar to the situation in \nwhich we find ourselves today. Rising Federal budget deficits were the \ncause of alarm. Almost everyone agreed that we needed to bring them \ndown. The difficulty was how. Meeting the widely differing priorities \namong members of Congress--and the American people we represented--\nseemed impossible.\n  Senator Rudman, along with Senator Ernest Hollings and Senator Phil \nGramm, crafted a solution. It is fair to say no one liked it very much. \nNone of us here at the time, including me, voted for it with great \nenthusiasm. That was its genius. By establishing a mechanism for \nautomatic, across-the-board spending cuts that would take place in the \nabsence of a more tailored program of deficit reduction, they sought to \nforce all of us to make the difficult choices required to reduce the \ndeficit.\n  The arrangement Senators Rudman, Gramm and Hollings concocted was \ndisagreeable to everybody, and so we looked for ways to avoid it. I \nvoted for the 1985 agreement in part because I believed it would help \nforce elected officials to get serious about the fact that revenue was \nan important part of the deficit-reduction formula. It was true then, \nit was true now, and Warren Rudman helped clarify that important fact. \nWe borrowed from Warren Rudman's playbook with the sequestration \nprovisions which are now the subject of so much debate and concern \nhere. I dislike the blind, Draconian cuts of sequestration today as \nmuch as I disliked them in the 1980s. Now, as then, I am hopeful that \nmembers of good will can reach across the aisle to reach compromise \nsolutions--solutions that we may dislike in part, in order to avoid \neven worse outcomes. If we do so, it will be because of the Sword of \nDamocles called sequestration that hangs over our heads. I know that is \nwhat Senator Rudman would hope for, and be working hard for, if he were \nstill serving here.\n  We should reflect on Senator Rudman's career today for another \nreason. When he decided not to stand for re-election in 1992, he did \nso, in the words of the New York Times, because ``the Federal \nGovernment was not functioning' and that it was impossible to get \nanything done in a Senate rife with posturing and partisanship.''\n  Maybe the lesson is that the present always looks more partisan and \npolarized than the past. I hope all of us can reflect on Senator \nRudman's efforts to achieve practical solutions to difficult problems, \nhis willingness to compromise, and his integrity, and keep those \nqualities in mind as we struggle with the many and complex problems we \nface today.\n  Barbara and I were terribly saddened to learn of Warren Rudman's \npassing. Our thoughts are with his family and the many close friends \nwho mourn him.\n\n[[Page S7454]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/05/senate-section/article/S7454-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n COMMEMORATING THE 84TH BIRTHDAY OF HIS MAJESTY KING BHUMIBOL ADULYADEJ\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, on behalf of myself as ranking member of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Senator James Inhofe, the \nranking member of the East Asia and Pacific Subcommittee, I rise today \nto commemorate the 85th birthday anniversary of His Majesty King \nBhumibol Adulyadej who has reigned for 66 years as King of Thailand.\n  Over 50 years ago, the King, also known as Rama IX, a long-time and \nproven friend of the United States, addressed a Joint Session of \nCongress. He and the people of Thailand have partnered with the people \nof the United States in war and in peace. As noted in the recent \nThailand-U.S. Joint Vision Statement preceding President Obama's recent \ntrip to Thailand, ``. . . the Thai-U.S. defense alliance has promoted \nregional stability by fostering cooperation in areas that enables both \nnations to address shared security concerns effectively''.\n  The King has been internationally recognized for his consistent \ndedication to promote the well-being of the Thai people. Among the \nawards received is the U.N. Development Program First Human Development \nLifetime Achievement Award. Over the last 60 years the King has \ninitiated thousands of development projects throughout Thailand \naddressing a wide range of challenges including public health and \neducation, agricultural development and reforestation.\n  Mr. President, in the Congress extensive time and effort are \ndedicated to the consideration of major challenges to the United \nStates, domestically and overseas. Endless debate carries on to \ndetermine how to deal with leaders in those countries who do not share \ndemocratic values, and in fact are opposed to the United States \nactively engaging in global free trade and the promotion of our \nnational security.\n  Consequently, it is a pleasure and an honor on behalf of Senator \nInhofe and myself to highlight the life of His Majesty King Bhumibol \nAdulyadej, who has been steadfast in his friendship to the American \npeople. He is the longest- reigning monarch in the history of Thailand \nand currently the world's longest-reigning monarch as well.\n  Mr. President I was pleased to recently visit Thailand and meet with \ngovernment officials regarding Thailand's participation in the Nunn-\nLugar Cooperative Threat Reduction, CTR, Program. Thailand is actively \nworking to counter biological threats. Among other areas, the U.S. will \nalso continue to work to help Thailand control infectious disease that \ncould become the source of a pandemic or the target of terrorists \nseeking to create a biological weapon.\n  In conclusion, I am grateful for the overall relationship between our \ntwo countries, and look forward to developments in the future which \nwill bring us closer together.\n Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, December 5 marks the 85th birthday of \nHis Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand. I would like to offer \nmy sincerest congratulations to His Majesty and to the people of \nThailand as they commemorate his 66-year reign of Thailand.\n  The United States and Thailand have had an extensive, close \nrelationship for nearly 200 years, beginning with the Treaty of Amity \nand Cooperation in 1833. This treaty--the first U.S. treaty in Asia--\ncemented the friendship between the American and Thai people. King \nBhumibol has nurtured this relationship in line with our shared values \nof democracy and rule law. He has been a vital supporter of a free and \nopen society in Thailand and a stabilizing force in the government's \ntransitions of political power. As the world's longest serving monarch, \nhe has placed his commitment to the Thai people above all.\n  I have visited Thailand many times over a span of more than 30 years. \nAs chairman of the East Asia and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee, I was \nfortunate to continue this close relationship, visiting Thailand \nnumerous times to meet Thai leaders, and reaffirm my support for a \nstrong alliance with the United States. I would like to thank King \nBhumibol and the Thai government for the courtesies extended to me over \nthe past 6 years of my service in the U.S. Senate. Going forward, I am \nconfident that the U.S.-Thai alliance will continue to be a critical \npartnership in guaranteeing stability in the Asia-Pacific region.\n  Mr. President, I am so pleased to join the people of Thailand in \ncelebrating the birthday of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej, and \nextend my best wishes to His Majesty for his good health.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/05/senate-section/article/S7454-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GREEN BUILDING STANDARDS\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Wicker for \nbringing attention to the need for the Department of Defense, and all \nFederal agencies, to include American-made wood products in green \nbuilding standards and rating systems.\n  I would also like to express my continued support for Federal \nGovernment measures designed to spur the design and construction of \nhigh-performance green buildings.\n  However, I am concerned that discouraging certain wood building \nproducts and materials from use in Federal buildings because they do \nnot comply with the LEED standard but are otherwise acceptable for U.S. \nbuilding projects, may undermine the Federal Government's energy \nefficiency goals.\n  Wood products are among the most ``green'' of all building materials.\n  With the green building market estimated to reach as high as $140 \nbillion by 2013, securing a strong place for wood is essential to the \nwood products industry's future growth.\n  Wood is an ideal green building material because it is renewable, \nstores carbon that reduces greenhouse gases, and is energy efficient.\n  There are several green building rating systems being used by Federal \nagencies and the private marketplace now, and the competition among \nthese systems has resulted in improvements in all of the green building \nstandards. Some of these rating systems recognize the benefits of \nAmerican-made wood products in their scoring system.\n  It is important that the Department of Defense, General Services \nAdministration and other Federal agencies ensure that multiple green \nbuilding standards be considered for the design and construction of \nFederal buildings.\n  I believe the best approach is to permit the marketplace to decide \nwhich rating system is best suited for each project and Congress should \nencourage all of the rating systems to compete for government \ncontracts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/05/senate-section/article/S7454-3", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7454-S7455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING NORMA HOLMGREN\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity today to pay \ntribute to a wonderful woman, devoted mother and grandmother, loyal \nfriend, exceptional employee, and patriotic American Norma Holmgren. \nNorma was my Northern Utah Area Director for 26 years and was devoted \nto our state and nation.\n  Sadly, Norma passed away this past weekend, as a result of a tragic \naccident as she was taking her daily walk. Norma kept herself very \nactive and physically fit and you could often find Norma walking the \nstreets of her neighborhood enjoying her surroundings and neighbors.\n  Norma retired from public service almost 10 years ago, however her \nretirement did not stop her from participating in her community and \ncontinuing her interest in republican politics. In fact, my staff \ncontacted her last week to seek her advice on a constituent's request. \nShe was always available and happy to share her knowledge. She spent \nmany years working for the ideas and philosophy of the Republican \nParty, and assumed numerous leadership positions to further the cause. \nNorma loved politics and even after leaving the government and \npolitical arena, she still loved a good political conversation and was \nkeenly interested in what was happening in our state and nation.\n  Norma was a ferocious reader, and it was not unusual for Norma to \nvisit her local Costco and buy up to 20 books at a time. She loved to \nlearn and continue her education on so many issues, and would spend \nhours curled up with a good book.\n  She also loved antiques and was widely known for her collections that \nshe beautifully displayed throughout her home. She would often invite \nfriends to come and see her latest find or beautiful item and she was \nvery proud of her life-long interest of antiques.\n\n[[Page S7455]]\n\n  Norma accomplished many great things in her life, yet perhaps her \ngreatest accomplishment was the loving care and nurture she always \ndisplayed to her son Randy and his wife, whom she dearly loved. She \nalso adored being a grandmother, and took great pride in her family and \nthe relationships they shared. I had the pleasure of hosting Norma's \ngranddaughter Emily as a Senate page several years ago and I could see \nfirst-hand the great traits Norma had instilled in her granddaughter.\n  I am grateful I had the opportunity to work with Norma for many \nyears, and consider her a true friend. She believed in public service \nand demonstrated her commitment to excellence on so many occasions. She \nwas a fierce advocate for the military and spent years working as a \nliaison for me at Hill Air Force Base where she garnered the respect \nand admiration of the military leaders on the Base. Her influence in so \nmany areas will never be forgotten.\n  Norma's life touched many and she will be forever remembered as \nsomeone who truly cared about her family, her friends, and in doing \ngood for her community. Elaine and I would like to extend our deepest \nsympathies to Norma's family at the loss of their mother and \ngrandmother; and pray that they will find some peace and comfort in the \nmemories they have shared.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/05/senate-section/article/S7455-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MARREEN CASPER\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity today to pay \ntribute to a wonderful woman, dedicated public servant and loyal friend \nMarreen Casper. Marreen is retiring from my staff at the end of the \nyear and she will be very missed.\n  Marreen joined my staff in 1999 and has been a shining star. She has \ntackled some of the most difficult assignments that have faced my Utah \nSenate Offices. She started as a Federal grants coordinator and \ncaseworker. However, when a need arose to fill a very important \nposition in my organization, she willingly sold her house, and packed \nup and moved to St. George, UT to become my Southern Utah Field \nDirector.\n  Marreen has filled this position with dogged determination, and a \nnoteworthy attention to details. She quickly immersed herself into the \ncommunity and became a true Southern Utahn. She was always available to \nmeet with and listen to the citizens of this area of our State. She has \nattended literally hundreds of local government meetings, and discussed \nthe issues affecting Southern Utah with many mayors, county commission \nand council members, and community leaders every day she served. She \nhas such a warm demeanor and accepting personality that people from all \nwalks of life and positions felt comfortable to discuss with Marreen \nthe issues important to them, and know that she would try to do \nsomething to help. She has made friends in every nook and cranny of \nsouthern Utah and earned the respect of many.\n  One aspect of her job that many do not realize, is the travel she \nundertook to fulfill her duties to the best of her ability. Marreen's \nfield area includes one of the most remote and unpopulated areas in the \ncontinental United States. Traveling in her area can get very harrowing \nat times, but Marreen never let it stop her from doing her job. She has \ntraveled the icy roads in the dead of winter, attended outdoor meetings \nin the searing heat, and even crashed on an ATV she was riding on for \nan event that sent her to the Emergency Room.\n  And some of the issues Marreen has worked on might seem trivial to \nsome, but have long-ranging impacts on rural Utah. These issues have \nranged from prairie dogs, desert tortoises, and Mexican wolves; to \nfighting with the Army Corps of Engineers over whether a dry wash is a \n``navigable body of water.'' I am not sure that she will miss the \ntedious nature of some of these issues, but I am certain she will miss \nthe people in the many communities she worked with to find solutions to \nthe problems.\n  There has been no assignment ever given to Marreen that she did not \nfulfill willingly and with a great determination to see it through. In \nfact, Marreen has undertaken one of the most tedious, yet important \nprojects every year the Hatch Family Christmas Card. This is a project \nI am certain she would like to have run from, yet year after year she \nplanned, organized, and ensured that this card was sent to thousands of \nUtahns helping me stay in touch with so many constituents. For this \nseemingly thankless task, I want to sincerely convey my appreciation to \nher for her wonderful assistance that has meant so much to me and to \nthe many who received it.\n  Although Marreen has accomplished many great things in her \nprofessional life perhaps her greatest accomplishments have come \nbecause of her wonderful partnership with her husband Ron, and her \nloving and tender care of her 5 children and 22 grandchildren. She \ndearly loves her family and expresses it often. She sincerely strives \nto be at every important function in the lives of her family and is \noften traveling great distances so she can be there for the noteworthy \nmilestones.\n  She has also made her belief in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-\nday Saints central to her life and has served countless neighbors and \nfriends through the goodness of her heart. In fact, when other folks \nmight think their days of working with the youth in church service are \nover, Marreen accepted a call from her local Bishop to lead the Young \nWomen's organization in her Ward. She then spent several years \nmentoring and helping these young women in various ways and through her \nbeautiful example.\n  I am truly grateful for the tremendous service Marreen Casper has \ngiven to me, to her community, and to our great State. I will miss \nMarreen greatly but know that life holds many exciting and wonderful \nnew opportunities for her to enjoy. I want to wish Marreen the very \nbest in retirement and want her to know that I will be forever grateful \nfor her good work and loyal friendship. May Heavenly Father bless \nMarreen and her family for the honorable person she is and the service \nshe has rendered to so many.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/05/senate-section/article/S7455-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7455-S7456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO TOBY HYMAN\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, Toby Hyman has become something of an \ninstitution in the Senate over the course of her 17 odd years of \nservice in the Office of the Senate Chief Counsel for Employment. I \nunderstand that she has consistently and tirelessly devoted herself to \nensuring fairness for both Senate employees and their offices, helping \nthem sort through anything from day-to-day concerns that arise to \ncourtroom arguments to union disputes, even in the midst of an anthrax \nattack on her own office.\n  Those who know her best say that she displays compassion for \nemployers and employees alike, a deep understanding of employment law \nand conflict, and great skill resolving disputes and achieving fair \noutcomes for all involved parties. By all accounts, the Senate body is \nbetter today for her efforts, which is why her retirement is received \nwith bittersweet, much deserved well-wishes for the future by her \ncolleagues.\n  Before her time here, Toby spent 20 years as a fine attorney at the \nprestigious Proskauer Rose firm in New York City. Prior to that, she \nserved as the first female law clerk for the Honorable District Court \nJudge John F. Dooling, Jr. And prior to that, she was a fine young \ncitizen of the great State of Massachusetts.\n  Toby grew up in a family like so many in Boston. She is a proud \nproduct of Boston's public schools, including the Girls' Latin School \nin Roxbury, who excelled in her studies and earned admittance to the \ngovernment program at Radcliffe College, from which she graduated magna \ncum laude. Toby then continued to impress her friends and peers at \nHarvard Law School, where she performed as an able editor of the \nHarvard Law Review and, once again, graduated with distinction.\n  To afford these years of schooling, Toby simultaneously pursued a \ndegree in Jewish Education from Hebrew College in order to earn money \nteaching in Hebrew schools. She wanted to give back to her community, \npass on an education that she so enjoyed to the coming generation, and \nwork with children, all while making a little money to sustain her \nduring college. And so she made it happen. Pleased parents \naffectionately labeled one of her classes the ``Hebrew Sesame Street.''\n  Service to others--standing up for fairness and justice--has been a \ncommon thread running through Toby's\n\n[[Page S7456]]\n\nlife. From her days back home in her native Massachusetts, to her \ncareer in New York City, to her visit to the Soviet Union in the late \n1970s where she greeted oppressed Soviet Jews with encouragement and a \nhelping hand, Toby has treated people with compassion and respect and \nhas stood up for their rights and dignity. Most recently, during her \ntime as an advocate for us all here in the Senate family, she worked \nwith our offices to ensure a good and fair relationship between \nemployers and employees.\n  So it is no surprise that Toby intends for the next chapter of her \nlife to involve volunteer work teaching young children. She will \ncontinue in the example she has set throughout her life and career as \nan educator, mediator, and advocate for fairness. I thank Toby for \ndedicating so many years of her life to service in the Senate and look \nforward to all that she has yet to accomplish--and wish her \ncongratulations on a well deserved retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/05/senate-section/article/S7456-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       REMEMBERING WILLIAM MEEHAN\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President I come to the floor today to remember \nWilliam Meehan, an ``icon'' of Somerset, in the words of former fire \nchief Steven Rivard. He was a loving, and beloved, husband to JoAnne, \nbrother to Robert and John, father to John and Steve, and grandfather \nto Jake, Owen, and Liam. William is remembered by those who knew him \nbest as an impassioned cheerleader and reliable presence on the \nsidelines of his grandchildren's sports games, as a thoughtful and \ncompassionate voice on the Board of Selectmen, as an affable, warm \nfamily man armed with a lively Irish humor.\n  William was an anchor of his family and of his town. His care for his \ntown shone through his work and was reflected in his daily life. The \npeople of Somerset recall a dedicated public servant who embodied the \nmost noble qualities of a community advocate while eschewing the \ndivisive demagoguery that too often finds its way into politics. In his \n15 years as one of three selectmen for his town, he proved time and \nagain that he was more interested in understanding the concerns of \nothers and finding a just solution to any problem than he was in \npolitical bickering. And his example inspired those around him, with \nhis son Michael venturing into public service and actually serving in \nmy office for many years with great distinction.\n  In his last year on the board of selectmen, William was a part of the \nopening of the Veterans Memorial Bridge, a decade's long project to \nconnect Fall River with Somerset over the Taunton River. And he was \nintimately involved in the process that put into motion plans for the \nnew Somerset Berkley Regional High School. His interest was always in \ncommunity over conflict, in people rather than politics, and that is to \nwhat he devoted his life.\n  Friends remember William having lunch every day with peers or first \nresponders or community leaders, and he would often be found chatting \nwith neighbors and storekeepers around town or among the stands at \nlocal sporting events. He was a sportsman himself, with baseball second \nonly to family and community. When he wasn't coaching Somerset Little \nLeague, as he did for many years, he could be found out on the golf \ncourse.\n  I understand that William would make time each day after lunch to \nventure to the park and watch the boats sailing the Taunton River. I \nimagine the gentle breeze off the water, the parade of ships coming and \ngoing with the sun high in the sky, and William sitting along the shore \nfacing the water, breathing in the air and taking in the moment. We \nwon't see him there any longer, but when we look out at the boats \ndrifting by, we will think of William and remember the goodness he \nshared with the people of Somerset and beyond.\n  To JoAnne and William's family, I extend my deepest condolences. And \nto William, I wish him eternal rest watching over his family and all \nthose he cared about so deeply. And I wish him the same peace he found \nalong the river's edge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/05/senate-section/article/S7456-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING HOLY ROSARY CHURCH\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to honor the Holy Rosary \nChurch of Baltimore as it marks its 125th anniversary.\n  Holy Rosary Church was consecrated on December 8, 1887. From the \nbeginning, the church provided a spiritual home for new Americans who \nemigrated from Poland. My own family were parishioners from the \nbeginning. The church was the center of the community. It was the \nschool. It is where new Americans came to practice their faith in their \nnew home. While facing all the challenges of life in a new country, \nHoly Rosary provided a place of comfort and spiritual guidance. The \nChurch provided a place to practice the beloved traditions of their \nCatholic faith. It became one of the largest Polish parishes in \nBaltimore. Its priests were beloved in the community. The church also \nhad a parochial school staffed by the beloved Felician nuns. They not \nonly taught the three R's--religion, reading, writing--they helped \nyoung people get on the path of citizenship. They were a bridge between \nthe old world and the new.\n  My great grandmother was one of those immigrants who worshiped at \nHoly Rosary. Like so many, she came with little money in her \npocketbook, but big dreams in her heart for a new and better life. And \nthat life was nurtured by the Polish American community at Holy Rosary \nparish. In the 1920s and 1930s, Holy Rosary parish was the largest of \nsix Polish parishes in Baltimore and the largest in the Archdiocese. \nOver time, my family continued to attend Holy Rosary Church. My parents \nwere married there.\n  Holy Rosary Church played a part in Baltimore's history. It is where \nwe prayed through two World Wars and the Great Depression. It is where \nwe prayed that the Iron Curtain would be lifted and Poland would be \nliberated. It is where we organized to help the Solidarity movement. It \nis where we welcomed Pope John Paul II to Holy Rosary when he was the \nBishop of Krakow. That was the first time I met the Holy Father.\n  Holy Rosary was also where a stunning miracle occurred. It was where \nthe Vatican recognized the healing of Fr. Ronald Pytel as a miracle \nthrough the intercession of Blessed Faustina Kowalska, one of the \nmiracles that led to her canonization in 2000.\n  Today I honor the past, celebrate the present and have high hopes for \nthe future of Holy Rosary parish. The members continue to live their \nfaith of charity and hope. One hundred and twenty-five years ago the \npeople of Holy Rosary came together to forge a parish community \nanchored on the beliefs of Roman Catholicism and the values of hard \nwork, neighbor-helping-neighbor and patriotism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/05/senate-section/article/S7456-3", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7456-S7457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO TOM CASEY\n\n Mrs. MURRAY.

Commissioner Casey \nis the longest-serving Grays Harbor PUD Commissioner and is concluding \nhis fifth term in office.\n  Commissioner Casey was elected to the Grays Harbor PUD Board of \nCommissioners in 1982. Prior to serving in public office, he was \nactively involved in energy and public utility issues from his home in \nSatsop, WA. Commissioner Casey also worked as a Policy Analyst in the \nWashington State House of Representatives.\n  Commissioner Casey's commitment to public power was not limited to \nonly the Grays Harbor Public Utility District. Commissioner Casey \nserved on the Board of Directors of Energy Northwest for 12 years, 8 of \nwhich were on the executive board. Commissioner Casey also served on \nthe Executive Council of the Public Power Council for 16 years.\n  Commissioner Casey was also a key leader in the effort to create a \nPublic Development Authority to transform the non-operational nuclear \nplant site in Grays Harbor County into an industrial park for economic \ndevelopment in a part of the state with high unemployment.\n  Commissioner Casey has been a fierce advocate for public power for \ndecades. That spirit of advocacy for public power has been a keystone \nfor\n\n[[Page S7457]]\n\nCommissioner Casey for as long as I have known him. As he retires from \npublic service, I join with others throughout the Northwest in thanking \nCommissioner Casey for his years of service and his steadfast belief in \nthe unique value of public power.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/05/senate-section/article/S7457-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO WILMA JINKS\n\nMr. PRYOR. Mr. President, it is with the greatest pleasure that \nI rise today to honor Wilma Jinks, of Piggott, AR, who is celebrating \nher 100th birthday.\n  Wilma grew up on a farm north of Piggott, AR. Her rural location \nrequired her to walk 2 miles for school daily, an incomprehensible feat \nin the modern age of transportation, but to Wilma, it was something you \njust had to do. As you will see, this approach to life would serve \nWilma well in later years. Following her graduation from Piggott High \nSchool in 1930, Wilma went on to serve as deputy county clerk. In this \ncapacity, Wilma and her colleague, Ruth Ballard, would make town \nhistory when they issued 101 marriage licenses in one day, leaving some \nto joke that Piggott should change its name to ``Marrying Town''. It \nwas not long after that Wilma would join those 101 newlyweds. In 1935, \nshe would meet her future husband, Harold, while working as a secretary \nin his brother's office. They would remain devoted to each other until \nhis death in 1995.\n  In 1962, President Kennedy appointed Harold as director of the \nPostmasters and Rural Appointments Division of the United States Post \nOffice, and in April of the same year, Harold and Wilma moved to \nWashington, D.C. While in the District, the Jinks enjoyed the same \nsocial circles as the Nation's leaders, and routinely attended the same \nevents as President Kennedy and President Johnson. Yet, Wilma and \nHarold still missed Arkansas. After four years of rubbing elbows on the \nnational stage, they moved back to Piggott in April of 1966 and \npartnered with former Arkansas Governor Orvil Faubus in purchasing \nPiggott's newspaper, The Piggott Banner in 1967.\n  Even after Harold's retirement, there was no slowing down ``Team \nJinks''. Wilma and Harold's can do attitude was infectious throughout \nthe State, earning the friendship of every major officeholder in \nArkansas, as well as two of our Nation's great leaders, President \nCarter and President Clinton. Senator Dale Bumpers said of Harold ``if \nthe term yellow-dog' were in the dictionary, Harold Jinks would be \nlisted as the definition.'' Harold went on to form several grassroots \norganizations in Arkansas and served as chairman of the Arkansas Joint \nLegislative Committee of the National Retired Teachers Association and \nAARP. Wilma was proudly by his side for every step.\n  Mr. President, Wilma Jinks truly is one of Arkansas's gems and we are \nblessed to have her. I ask my colleagues to join me today in \ncongratulating Wilma Jinks as she and her family celebrates her 100th \nbirthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/05/senate-section/article/S7457-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING THE BANKERY\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, our Nation's entrepreneurs \nunderstand the rigors and fears of starting a new business from \nscratch. The creativity, adaptability, and courage it takes to open a \nbusiness are immense. However, because of that risk and uncertainty, \nthe rewards seem all the greater. The drive and determination required \nof a new business can be seen prevalently in the entrepreneurs of my \nhome State of Maine. Many of today's businesses create a meeting ground \nwhere classic and traditional meets the new and innovative; \nrefurbishing nostalgia and revamping tradition. I rise to recognize a \nbusiness steeped in history which embraces the challenges of today with \nyouthful vigor.\n  The Bankery located in downtown Skowhegan, ME seamlessly blends \nantique charm and history with an innovative repurposing of space. \nOpened in 2008 by owners Michael Hunt, graduate from the University of \nMaine, and Matthew DuBois, alumnus of the Connecticut Culinary \nInstitute, The Bankery is more than a classic bakery. The sweets and \nconfections of this bakery are kept under lock and key, literally. The \nBankery is housed in a renovated bank that was built in 1864. The \nowners preserved the history of the architecture by carefully restoring \nthe original vaults and displaying many nostalgic mementos from the \nbuilding's original purpose.\n  After expanding from a simple menu of classic baked goods to include \nmeal items such as soups, sandwiches, and meat pies, The Bankery \ncontinues on an upward and outward trajectory. In 2010, Michael and \nMatthew acquired their next door neighbor, Skowhegan Fleuriste, a \nflorist and formal wear shop. Now they offer a one-stop-shop for many \nevents. It is their ambition and continued desire to pursue the next \nchallenge and grow in new ways that gives them a competitive edge and \nis so characteristic of Maine's small business owners.\n  With an eye to the future and a nod to the past, The Bankery has met \nthe challenges of growing a new business with excellence. I know that, \nthrough their hard work and delicious products, this Skowhegan staple \nwill continue to flourish. I offer Matthew and Michael and everyone at \nThe Bankery congratulations on their success and best wishes for a \nsweet future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/05/senate-section/article/S7457-3", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/05/senate-section/article/S7457-4", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/05/senate-section/article/S7457-5", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:55 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 316.

HOMELAND BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Ballistic Missile Defense Review of February 2010 \n     stated as its first policy priority that ``the United States \n     will continue to defend the homeland against the threat of \n     limited ballistic missile attack'' and that ``an essential \n     element of the United States' homeland ballistic missile \n     defense strategy is to hedge against future uncertainties, \n     including both the uncertainty of future threat capabilities \n     and the technical risks inherent to our own development \n     plans''.\n       (2) The United States currently has an operational Ground-\n     based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system with 30 Ground-Based \n     Interceptors (GBIs) deployed in Alaska and California, \n     protecting the United States against the potential future \n     threat of limited ballistic missile attack from countries \n     such as North Korea and Iran.\n       (3) As Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear \n     and Missile Defense Policy Bradley Roberts testified before \n     the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate on April 25, \n     2012, ``[w]ith 30 GBIs in place, the United States is in an \n     advantageous position vis-a-vis the threats from North Korea \n     and Iran,'' and ``neither has successfully tested an ICBM or \n     demonstrated an ICBM-class warhead''.\n       (4) Deputy Assistant Secretary Roberts testified that \n     maintaining this advantageous position ``requires continued \n     improvement to the GMD system, including enhanced performance \n     by the GBIs and the deployment of new sensors. It also \n     requires the development of the Precision Tracking Space \n     System (PTSS) to handle larger raid sizes and the Standard \n     Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IIB as the ICBM threat from states \n     like Iran and North Korea matures. These efforts will help to \n     ensure that the United States possesses the capability to \n     counter the projected threat for the foreseeable future''.\n       (5) As its highest priority, the Missile Defense Agency is \n     designing a correction to the problem that caused a December \n     2010 flight test failure of the Ground-based Midcourse \n     Defense system using the Capability Enhancement II (CE-II) \n     model of exo-atmospheric kill vehicle, and plans to \n     demonstrate the correction in two flight tests before \n     resuming production or assembly of additional Capability \n     Enhancement II kill vehicles.\n       (6) The Department of Defense has a program to improve the \n     performance and reliability of the Ground-based Midcourse \n     Defense system, including a plan to test every component of \n     the Ground-Based Interceptors for reliability. According to \n     Department of Defense officials, the goal of the Ground-Based \n     Interceptor reliability program is to double the number of \n     threat Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) that our \n     current inventory of Ground-Based Interceptors could defeat, \n     thereby effectively doubling the capability of our current \n     Ground-based Midcourse Defense system.\n       (7) The Missile Defense Agency, working with the Director \n     of Operational Test and Evaluation and with United States \n     Strategic Command, has developed a comprehensive Integrated \n     Master Test Plan (IMTP) for missile defense, with flight \n     tests for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system planned \n     through fiscal year 2022, including salvo testing, multiple \n     simultaneous engagement testing, and operational testing.\n       (8) The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, who \n     must review, approve, and sign each semi-annual version of \n     the Integrated Master Test Plan, testified that the Test Plan \n     is ``a robust and rigorous test plan''. He also testified \n     that the current pace of Ground-based Midcourse Defense \n     system testing of one flight test per year is the ``best that \n     we've been able to achieve over a decade''.\n       (9) The Director of the Missile Defense Agency testified \n     before the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate on April \n     25, 2012, that flight testing the Ground-based Midcourse \n     Defense system more often than once per year could cause \n     ``greater risk of further failure and setbacks to developing \n     our homeland defense capability as rapidly as possible''.\n       (10) As part of its homeland defense hedging strategy, the \n     Department of Defense has already decided upon or implemented \n     a number of actions to improve the missile defense posture of \n     the United States in case the threat of Intercontinental \n     Ballistic Missiles from North Korea or Iran emerges sooner or \n     in greater numbers than anticipated. These include the \n     following actions:\n       (A) The Missile Defense Agency has completed construction \n     of Missile Field-2 at Fort Greely, Alaska, with eight extra \n     silos available to deploy additional operational Ground-Based \n     Interceptors, if needed.\n       (B) With its request for 5 additional Ground-Based \n     Interceptors in the budget of the President for fiscal year \n     2013, the Missile Defense Agency plans to have enough test \n     and spare Ground-Based Interceptors to emplace in the 8 extra \n     silos from 2014 through 2025, and will keep the Ground-Based \n     Interceptor production line active for 5 additional years, \n     thus allowing additional Ground-Based Interceptor purchases \n     in the future, if needed.\n       (C) The Department has decided not to decommission \n     prototype Missile Field-1 at Fort Greely but, instead, to \n     keep it in a storage status that would permit it to be \n     refurbished and reactivated within a few years if future \n     threat developments make that necessary.\n       (D) The Missile Defense Agency plans to build an in-flight \n     interceptor communications terminal at Fort Drum, New York, \n     to enhance the performance of Ground-Based Interceptors \n     defending the eastern United States against possible future \n     missile threats from Iran.\n       (E) The Missile Defense Agency is continuing the \n     development and testing of the two-stage Ground-Based \n     Interceptor for possible deployment in the future, if needed.\n       (F) The Missile Defense Agency is upgrading early warning \n     radars in Clear, Alaska, and Cape Cod, Massachusetts, to \n     enhance the ability to defend against potential multiple \n     future Intercontinental Ballistic Missile threats from North \n     Korea and Iran.\n       (G) The Missile Defense Agency is pursuing development of \n     the Standard Missile-3 Block IIB interceptor for Phase 4 of \n     the European Phased Adaptive Approach. It is intended to \n     augment the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system as a cost-\n     effective first layer of defense of the homeland against a \n     possible future Intercontinental Ballistic Missile threat \n     from Iran.\n       (H) The Missile Defense Agency is pursuing development of \n     the Precision Tracking Space System, a satellite sensor \n     system to provide persistent tracking of large numbers of \n     missiles in flight, and fire-control quality targeting data \n     to various missile defense interceptor systems. According to \n     the Director of the Missile Defense Agency, ``the greatest \n     future enhancement for both homeland and regional defense in \n     the next ten years is the development of the Precision \n     Tracking Space System satellites''.\n       (11) As part of its homeland defense hedging strategy \n     review, the Department of Defense is considering other \n     options to enhance the future United States posture to defend \n     the homeland, including the feasibility, advisability and \n     affordability of deploying additional Ground-Based \n     Interceptors, either in Alaska or at a missile defense site \n     on the East Coast of the United States.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is a national priority to defend the homeland \n     against the potential future threat of limited ballistic \n     missile attack from countries such as North Korea and Iran;\n       (2) the currently deployed Ground-based Midcourse Defense \n     system, with 30 Ground-Based Interceptors deployed in Alaska \n     and California, provides protection of the United States \n     homeland against the potential future threat of limited \n     ballistic missile attack from North Korea and Iran;\n       (3) it is essential for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense \n     system to achieve the levels of reliability, availability, \n     sustainability, and operational performance that will allow \n     it to continue providing protection of the United States \n     homeland against limited ballistic missile attack;\n       (4) the Missile Defense Agency should, as its highest \n     priority, correct the problem that caused the December 2010 \n     Ground-based Midcourse Defense system flight test failure and \n     demonstrate the correction in flight tests before resuming \n     production of the Capability\n\n[[Page S7474]]\n\n     Enhancement-II kill vehicle, in order to provide confidence \n     that the system will work as intended;\n       (5) the Department of Defense should continue to enhance \n     the performance and reliability of the Ground-based Midcourse \n     Defense system, and enhance the capability of the Ballistic \n     Missile Defense System, to provide improved capability to \n     defend the homeland against possible increased future missile \n     threats from North Korea and Iran;\n       (6) the Missile Defense Agency should continue its robust, \n     rigorous, and realistic testing of the Ground-based Midcourse \n     Defense system at a pace of one flight test per year, as \n     described in the Integrated Master Test Plan, including salvo \n     testing, multiple simultaneous engagement testing, and \n     operational testing;\n       (7) if successfully developed, the Standard Missile-3 Block \n     IIB interceptor would provide an essential first layer of \n     defense of the homeland against an emerging Intercontinental \n     Ballistic Missile threat from Iran, using a cost-effective \n     forward-based early intercept system that could permit \n     holding Ground-Based Interceptors in reserve, and if such \n     interceptor could be deployed on ships, it would also provide \n     a significant enhancement to defense against possible future \n     threats from North Korea;\n       (8) the Precision Tracking Space System has the potential \n     to improve dramatically the capability of homeland and \n     regional missile defense systems against large numbers of \n     missiles launched simultaneously, and should remain a high \n     priority for development;\n       (9) the Department of Defense has taken a number of \n     prudent, affordable, cost-effective, and operationally \n     significant steps to hedge against the possibility of future \n     growth in the missile threat to the homeland from North Korea \n     and Iran; and\n       (10) the Department of Defense should continue to evaluate \n     the evolution of the long-range missile threat from North \n     Korea and Iran and consider other possibilities for prudent, \n     affordable, cost-effective, and operationally significant \n     steps to improve the posture of the United States to defend \n     the homeland against possible future growth in the threat.\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) Report required.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report \n     on the status of efforts to improve the homeland ballistic \n     missile defense capability of the United States.\n       (2) Elements of report.--The report required by paragraph \n     (1)) shall include the following:\n       (A) A detailed description of the actions taken or planned \n     to improve the reliability, availability, and capability of \n     the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system.\n       (B) A description of any improvements achieved as a result \n     of the actions described in subparagraph (A).\n       (C) A description of the results of the two planned flight \n     tests of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system (Control \n     Test Vehicle flight test-1, and GMD Flight Test-06b) intended \n     to demonstrate the success of the correction of the problem \n     that caused the flight test failure of December 2010, and the \n     status of any decision to resume production of the Capability \n     Enhancement-II kill vehicle.\n       (D) A detailed description of actions taken or planned to \n     improve the homeland defense posture of the United States to \n     hedge against potential future Intercontinental Ballistic \n     Missile threat growth from North Korea and Iran.\n       (E) Any other matters the Secretary considers appropriate.\n       (3) Form of report.--The report shall be submitted in \n     unclassified form, but may include a classified annex.\n\n     SEC. 232. REGIONAL BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the introduction to the Ballistic Missile Defense \n     Review of February 2010, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates \n     states that ``I have made defending against near-term \n     regional threats a top priority of our missile defense plans, \n     programs and capabilities''.\n       (2) In describing the threat of regional ballistic \n     missiles, the report of the Ballistic Missile Defense Review \n     states that ``there is no uncertainty about the existence of \n     regional threats. They are clear and present. The threat from \n     short-range, medium-range, and intermediate-range ballistic \n     missiles (SRBMs, MRBMs, and IRBMs) in regions where the \n     United States deploys forces and maintains security \n     relationships is growing at a particularly rapid pace''.\n       (3) In testimony before the Committee on Armed Services of \n     the Senate on April 25, 2012, Dr. Bradley Roberts, Deputy \n     Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear and Missile \n     Defense Policy stated, with respect to regional missile \n     defense, that ``the need arises from the rapidly emerging \n     threats to our armed forces in Europe, the Middle East, and \n     East Asia from regional missile proliferators and the basic \n     challenge such proliferation poses to the safety and security \n     of our forces and allies and to our power projection \n     strategy''.\n       (4) Iran has the largest inventory of regional ballistic \n     missiles in the Middle East, with hundreds of missiles that \n     can reach southeastern Europe and all of the Middle East, \n     including Israel. Iran is improving its existing missiles and \n     developing new and longer-range missiles.\n       (5) North Korea has a large and growing inventory of short-\n     range and medium-range ballistic missiles that can reach \n     United States forces and allies in South Korea and Japan. \n     North Korea is improving its existing missiles and developing \n     new and longer-range missiles.\n       (6) In September 2009, President Barack Obama announced \n     that he had accepted the unanimous recommendation of the \n     Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to \n     establish a European Phased Adaptive Approach to missile \n     defense, designed to protect deployed United States forces \n     and allies and partners in Europe against the large and \n     growing threat of ballistic missiles from Iran.\n       (7) In November 2010, at the Lisbon Summit, the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) decided to adopt the core \n     mission of missile defense of its population, territory and \n     forces. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization agreed to \n     enhance its missile defense command and control system, the \n     Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense, to provide \n     a North Atlantic Treaty Organization command and control \n     capability. This is in addition to contributions of missile \n     defense capability from individual nations.\n       (8) During 2011, the United States successfully implemented \n     Phase 1 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach, including \n     deployment of an AN/TPY-2 radar in Turkey, deployment of an \n     Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense ship in the eastern \n     Mediterranean Sea with Standard Missile-3 Block IA \n     interceptors, and establishment of a missile defense command \n     and control system in Germany.\n       (9) During 2011, the United States successfully negotiated \n     all the international agreements with North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization allies needed to permit future phases of the \n     European Phased Adaptive Approach, including agreements with \n     Romania and Poland to permit the deployment of Aegis Ashore \n     missile defense systems on their territory, an agreement with \n     Turkey to permit deployment of an AN/TPY-2 radar on its \n     territory, and an agreement with Spain to permit the forward \n     stationing of four Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense ships at \n     Rota.\n       (10) Phase 2 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach is \n     planned for deployment in 2015, and is planned to include the \n     deployment of Standard Missile-3 Block IB interceptors on \n     Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense ships and at an Aegis Ashore \n     site in Romania.\n       (11) Phase 3 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach is \n     planned for deployment in 2018, and is planned to include the \n     deployment of Standard Missile-3 Block IIA interceptors on \n     Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense ships and at an Aegis Ashore \n     site in Poland.\n       (12) Phase 4 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach is \n     planned for deployment in 2020, and is planned to include the \n     deployment of Standard Missile-3 Block IIB interceptors at \n     Aegis Ashore sites. This interceptor is intended to protect \n     both Europe and the United States against potential future \n     long-range ballistic missiles from Iran.\n       (13) At the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Summit in \n     Chicago in 2012, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization plans \n     to announce it has achieved an ``interim capability'' for the \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization missile defense system, \n     including initial capability of its Active Layered Theater \n     Ballistic Missile Defense system at a command and control \n     facility in Germany.\n       (14) The United States has a robust program of missile \n     defense cooperation with Israel, including joint development \n     of the Arrow Weapon System and the new Arrow-3 upper tier \n     interceptor, designed to defend Israel against ballistic \n     missiles from Iran. These jointly developed missile defense \n     systems are designed to be interoperable with United States \n     ballistic missile defenses, and these interoperable systems \n     are tested in large military exercises. The United States has \n     deployed an AN/TPY-2 radar in Israel to enhance missile \n     defense against missiles from Iran.\n       (15) The United States is working with the nations of the \n     Gulf Cooperation Council on enhanced national and regional \n     missile defense capabilities against growing missile threats \n     from Iran. As part of this effort, the United Arab Emirates \n     plans to purchase two batteries of the Terminal High Altitude \n     Air Defense (THAAD) system, as well as other equipment.\n       (16) The United States has a strong program of missile \n     defense cooperation with Japan, including the co-development \n     of the Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IIA interceptor for \n     the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system, intended to be \n     deployed by Japan and in Phase 3 of the European Phased \n     Adaptive Approach, Japan's fleet of Aegis Ballistic Missile \n     Defense ships using the SM-3 Block IA interceptors, and the \n     United States deployment of an AN/TPY-2 radar in Japan.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the threat from regional ballistic missiles, \n     particularly from Iran and North Korea, is serious and \n     growing, and puts at risk forward-deployed United States \n     forces and allies and partners in Europe, the Middle East, \n     and the Asia-Pacific region;\n       (2) the Department of Defense has an obligation to provide \n     force protection of forward-deployed United States forces, \n     assets, and facilities from regional ballistic missile \n     attack;\n       (3) the United States has an obligation to meet its \n     security commitments to its allies,\n\n[[Page S7475]]\n\n     including ballistic missile defense commitments;\n       (4) the Department of Defense has a balanced program of \n     investment and capabilities to provide for both homeland \n     defense and regional defense against ballistic missiles, \n     consistent with the Ballistic Missile Defense Review and with \n     the prioritized and integrated needs of the commanders of the \n     combatant commands;\n       (5) the European Phased Adaptive Approach to missile \n     defense is an appropriate and necessary response to the \n     existing and growing ballistic missile threat from Iran to \n     forward deployed United States forces and allies and partners \n     in Europe;\n       (6) the Department of Defense--\n       (A) should, as a high priority, continue to develop, test, \n     and plan to deploy all four phases of the European Phased \n     Adaptive Approach, including all variants of the Standard \n     Missile-3 interceptor; and\n       (B) should also continue with its other phased and adaptive \n     regional missile defense efforts tailored to the Middle East \n     and the Asia-Pacific region;\n       (7) European members of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization are making valuable contributions to missile \n     defense in Europe, by hosting elements of United States \n     missile defense systems on their territories, through \n     individual national contributions to missile defense \n     capability, and by collective funding and development of the \n     Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense system; and\n       (8) the Department of Defense should continue with the \n     development of the key enablers of enhanced regional missile \n     defense, including the Precision Tracking Space System.\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit \n     to the congressional defense committees a report describing \n     the status and progress of regional missile defense programs \n     and efforts.\n       (2) Elements of report.--The report required by paragraph \n     (1) shall include the following:\n       (A) An assessment of the adequacy of the existing and \n     planned European Phased Adaptive Approach to provide force \n     protection for forward deployed United States forces in \n     Europe against ballistic missile threats from Iran, and an \n     assessment whether adequate force protection would be \n     available absent the European Phased Adaptive Approach.\n       (B) An assessment whether the European Phased Adaptive \n     Approach and other planned regional missile defense \n     approaches of the United States meet the integrated \n     priorities of the commanders of the regional combatant \n     commands in an affordable and balanced manner.\n       (C) A description of the progress made in the development \n     and testing of elements of systems intended for deployment in \n     Phases 2 through 4 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach, \n     including the Standard Missile-3 Block IB interceptor and the \n     Aegis Ashore system.\n       (D) A description of the manner in which elements of \n     regional missile defense architectures, such as forward-based \n     X-band radars in Turkey and Japan, contribute to the \n     enhancement of homeland defense of the United States.\n       (E) A description of the current and planned contributions \n     of North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, both \n     collectively and individually, to missile defense in Europe.\n       (3) Form.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall be \n     submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified \n     annex.\n\n     SEC. 233. MISSILE DEFENSE COOPERATION WITH RUSSIA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) For more than a decade, the United States and Russia \n     have discussed a variety of options for cooperation on shared \n     early warning and ballistic missile defense. For example, on \n     May 1, 2001, President George W. Bush spoke of a ``new \n     cooperative relationship'' with Russia and said ``it should \n     be premised on openness, mutual confidence and real \n     opportunities for cooperation, including the area of missile \n     defense. It should allow us to share information so that each \n     nation can improve its early warning capability, and its \n     capability to defend its people and territory. And perhaps \n     one day, we can even cooperate in a joint defense''.\n       (2) Section 1231 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (as enacted into law \n     by Public Law 106-398; 1654A-329) authorized the Department \n     of Defense to establish in Russia a ``joint center for the \n     exchange of data from systems to provide early warning of \n     launches of ballistic missiles and for notification of \n     launches of such missiles'', also known as the Joint Data \n     Exchange Center (JDEC).\n       (3) On March 31, 2008, Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon \n     England stated that ``we have offered Russia a wide-ranging \n     proposal to cooperate on missile defense--everything from \n     modeling and simulation, to data sharing, to joint \n     development of a regional missile defense architecture--all \n     designed to defend the United States, Europe, and Russia from \n     the growing threat of Iranian ballistic missiles. An \n     extraordinary series of transparency measures have also been \n     offered to reassure Russia. Despite some Russian reluctance \n     to sign up to these cooperative missile defense activities, \n     we continue to work toward this goal''.\n       (4) On July 6, 2009, President Barack Obama and Russian \n     President Dmitry Medvedev issued a joint statement on missile \n     defense issues, which stated that ``Russia and the United \n     States plan to continue the discussion concerning the \n     establishment of cooperation in responding to the challenge \n     of ballistic missile proliferation. . . We have instructed \n     our experts to work together to analyze the ballistic missile \n     challenges of the 21st century and to prepare appropriate \n     recommendations''.\n       (5) The February 2010 report of the Ballistic Missile \n     Defense Review established as one of its central policy \n     pillars that increased international missile defense \n     cooperation is in the national security interest of the \n     United States and, with regard to cooperation with Russia, \n     the United States ``is pursuing a broad agenda focused on \n     shared early warning of missile launches, possible technical \n     cooperation, and even operational cooperation''.\n       (6) at the November 2010 Lisbon Summit, the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization (NATO) decided to develop a missile \n     defense system to ``protect NATO European populations, \n     territory and forces'' and also to seek cooperation with \n     Russia on missile defense. In its Lisbon Summit Declaration, \n     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization reaffirmed its \n     readiness to ``invite Russia to explore jointly the potential \n     for linking current and planned missile defence systems at an \n     appropriate time in mutually beneficial ways''. The new NATO \n     Strategic Concept adopted at the Lisbon Summit states that \n     ``we will actively seek cooperation on missile defense with \n     Russia'', that ``NATO-Russia cooperation is of strategic \n     importance'', and that ``the security of the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization and Russia is intertwined''.\n       (7) In a December 18, 2010, letter to the leadership of the \n     Senate, President Obama wrote that the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization ``invited Russia to cooperate on missile \n     defense, which could lead to adding Russian capabilities to \n     those deployed by NATO to enhance our common security against \n     common threats. The Lisbon Summit thus demonstrated that the \n     Alliance's missile defenses can be strengthened by improving \n     NATO-Russian relations. This comes even as we have made clear \n     that the system we intend to pursue with Russia will not be a \n     joint system, and it will not in any way limit United States' \n     or NATO's missile defense capabilities. Effective cooperation \n     with Russia could enhance the overall efficiency of our \n     combined territorial missile defenses, and at the same time \n     provide Russia with greater security''.\n       (8) Section 221(a)(3) of the Ike Skelton National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (Public Law 111-383; \n     124 Stat. 4167) states that it is the sense of Congress ``to \n     support the efforts of the United States Government and the \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization to pursue cooperation with \n     the Russian Federation on ballistic missile defense relative \n     to Iranian missile threats''.\n       (9) In a speech in Russia on March 21, 2011, Secretary of \n     Defense Robert Gates cited ``the NATO-Russian decision to \n     cooperate on defense against ballistic missiles. We've \n     disagreed before, and Russia still has uncertainties about \n     the European Phased Adaptive Approach, a limited system that \n     poses no challenges to the large Russian nuclear arsenal. \n     However, we've mutually committed to resolving these \n     difficulties in order to develop a roadmap toward truly \n     effective anti-ballistic missile collaboration. This \n     collaboration may include exchanging launch information, \n     setting up a joint data fusion center, allowing greater \n     transparency with respect to our missile defense plans and \n     exercises, and conducting a joint analysis to determine areas \n     of future cooperation''.\n       (10) In testimony to the Committee on Armed Services of the \n     Senate on April 13, 2011, Deputy Assistant Secretary of \n     Defense for Nuclear and Missile Defense Policy Bradley H. \n     Roberts stated that the United States has been pursuing a \n     Defense Technology Cooperation Agreement with Russia since \n     2004, and that such an agreement is necessary ``for the \n     safeguarding of sensitive information in support of \n     cooperation'' on missile defense, and to ``provide the legal \n     framework for undertaking cooperative efforts''. Further, Dr. \n     Roberts stated that the United States would not provide any \n     classified information to Russia without first conducting a \n     National Disclosure Policy review. He also stated that the \n     United States is not considering sharing ``hit-to-kill'' \n     technology with Russia.\n       (11) In a March 2012 answer to a question from the \n     Committee on Armed Services of the Senate on missile defense \n     cooperation with Russia, Acting Under Secretary of Defense \n     for Policy Jim Miller wrote that ``I support U.S.-Russian \n     cooperation on missile defenses first and foremost because it \n     could improve the effectiveness of U.S. and NATO missile \n     defenses, thereby improving the protection of the United \n     States, our forces overseas, and our Allies. Missile defense \n     cooperation with Russia is in the security interests of the \n     United States, NATO, and Russia, first and foremost because \n     it could strengthen capabilities across Europe to intercept \n     Iranian missiles''. He also wrote that ``[t]he United States \n     has pursued missile defense cooperation with Russia with the \n     clear understanding that we would not accept constraints on \n     missile defense, and that we would undertake necessary \n     qualitative and quantitative improvements to meet U.S. \n     Security needs''.\n\n[[Page S7476]]\n\n       (12) In February 2012, an international group of \n     independent experts known as the Euro-Atlantic Security \n     Initiative issued a report proposing missile defense \n     cooperation between the United States (with its North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization allies) and Russia. The group, \n     whose leaders included Stephen Hadley, the National Security \n     Advisor to President George W. Bush, proposed that the \n     nations share satellite and radar early warning data at joint \n     cooperation centers in order to improve their ability to \n     detect, track, and defeat medium-range and intermediate-range \n     ballistic missiles from the Middle East.\n       (13) In a letter dated April 13, 2012, Robert Nabors, \n     Assistant to the President and Director of the Office of \n     Legislative Affairs, wrote that ``it is Administration policy \n     that we will only provide information to Russia that will \n     enhance the effectiveness of our missile defenses. The \n     Administration will not provide Russia with sensitive \n     information that would in any way compromise our national \n     security, including hit-to-kill technology and interceptor \n     telemetry''.\n       (14) The United States and Russia already engage in \n     substantial cooperation on a number of international security \n     efforts, including nuclear nonproliferation, anti-piracy, \n     counter-narcotics, nuclear security, counter-terrorism, and \n     logistics resupply through Russia of coalition forces in \n     Afghanistan. These areas of cooperation require each side to \n     share and protect sensitive information, which they have both \n     done successfully.\n       (15) The United States currently has shared early warning \n     agreements and programs of cooperation with eight nations in \n     addition to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The \n     United States has developed procedures and mechanisms for \n     sharing early warning information with partner nations while \n     ensuring the protection of sensitive United States \n     information.\n       (16) Russia and the United States each have missile launch \n     early warning and detection and tracking sensors that could \n     contribute to and enhance each others' ability to detect, \n     track, an defend against ballistic missile threats from Iran.\n       (17) The Obama Administration has provided regular \n     briefings to Congress on its discussions with Russia on \n     possible missile defense cooperation.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is in the national security interest of the United \n     States to pursue efforts at missile defense cooperation with \n     Russia that would enhance the security of the United States, \n     its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, and Russia, \n     particularly against missile threats from Iran;\n       (2) the United States should pursue ballistic missile \n     defense cooperation with Russia on both a bilateral basis and \n     a multilateral basis with its North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization allies, particularly through the NATO-Russia \n     Council;\n       (3) missile defense cooperation with Russia should not ``in \n     any way limit United States' or NATO's missile defense \n     capabilities'', as acknowledged in the December 18, 2010, \n     letter from President Obama to the leadership of the Senate, \n     and should be mutually beneficial and reciprocal in nature;\n       (4) the United States should not provide Russia with \n     sensitive missile defense information that would in any way \n     compromise United States national security, including ``hit-\n     to-kill'' technology and interceptor telemetry; and\n       (5) the United States should pursue missile defense \n     cooperation with Russia in a manner that ensures that--\n       (A) United States classified information is appropriately \n     safeguarded and protected from unauthorized disclosure;\n       (B) prior to sharing classified information with Russia, \n     the United States conducts a National Disclosure Policy \n     review and determines the types and levels of information \n     that may be shared and whether any additional procedures are \n     necessary to protect such information;\n       (C) prior to entering into missile defense technology \n     cooperation projects, the United States enters into a Defense \n     Technology Cooperation Agreement with Russia that establishes \n     the legal framework for a broad spectrum of potential \n     cooperative defense projects; and\n       (D) such cooperation does not limit the missile defense \n     capabilities of the United States or its North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization allies.\n\n     SEC. 234.

He also testified that ``Iran already has \n     the largest inventory of ballistic missiles in the Middle \n     East, and it is expanding the scale, reach, and \n     sophistication of its ballistic missile forces, many of which \n     are inherently capable of carrying a nuclear payload''.\n       (7) The 2012 Annual Report to Congress on the Military \n     Power of Iran by the Department of Defense states that, in \n     addition to increasing its missile inventories, ``Iran has \n     boosted the lethality and effectiveness of its existing \n     missile systems with accuracy improvements and new \n     submunitions payloads'', and that it continues to develop \n     missiles that can strike Israel and Eastern Europe. It also \n     states that ``Iran has launched multistage space launch \n     vehicles that could serve as a testbed for developing long-\n     range ballistic missiles technologies'', and that ``[w]ith \n     sufficient foreign assistance, Iran may be technically \n     capable of flight-testing an intercontinental ballistic \n     missile by 2015''.\n       (8) Despite the failure of its April 2012 satellite launch \n     attempt, North Korea warned the United States in October 2012 \n     that the United States mainland is within range of its \n     missiles.\n       (9) The threat of limited ballistic missile attack against \n     the United States homeland from countries such as North Korea \n     and Iran is increasing.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) the homeland defense hedging policy and strategy report \n     required by section 233 of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 2012 is necessary to inform Congress on \n     options to protect the United States homeland against the \n     evolving ballistic missile threat, including potential \n     options prior to the deployment of Phase 4 of the European \n     Phased Adaptive Approach to missile defense; and\n       (2) the Secretary of Defense should comply with the \n     requirements of section 233 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 by submitting the \n     homeland defense hedging policy and strategy report to \n     Congress.\n\n                          Subtitle D--Reports\n\n     SEC. 251.

SENSE OF SENATE ON THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF LATVIA AND \n                   OTHER NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION MEMBER \n                   NATIONS TO THE SUCCESS OF THE NORTHERN \n                   DISTRIBUTION NETWORK.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The remote and austere environments in which United \n     States troops are required to operate as part of the \n     International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission in \n     Afghanistan have increased the need for reliable lines of \n     supply in southwest Asia.\n       (2) The country of Afghanistan presents unique logistics \n     challenges, which have precipitated the development of \n     several redundant lines of supply.\n       (3) United States Transportation Command and the Defense \n     Logistics Agency (DLA), in consultation with United States \n     Embassy officials and other parties, have successfully \n     established memoranda of understanding and other agreements \n     with nations in and around southwest Asia to ensure the \n     reliability of lines of supply to Afghanistan.\n       (4) The lines of supply through Pakistan have been \n     repeatedly threatened by instability in that country. \n     Airlifting goods to Afghanistan, while safer, is expensive.\n       (5) The Northern Distribution Network (NDN) was established \n     in late 2008 to ensure that a safe and cost-effective line of \n     supply is available for United States troops in Afghanistan.\n       (6) The two prongs of supply provided by the Northern \n     Distribution Network ship nonlethal goods from the Baltic \n     ports in the north and the Caucauses in the west to southwest \n     Asia and Afghanistan.\n       (7) The Northern Distribution Network has been successful \n     and now handles more than 50 percent of cargo shipped to \n     Afghanistan.\n       (8) North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member \n     nations along the Northern Distribution Network routes have \n     contributed significantly to the success of the Northern \n     Distribution Network.\n       (9) The United States has strong economic ties to Northern \n     Distribution Network nations that are members of the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization, and these nations may be able \n     to provide quality goods and services for near and long-term \n     use by the Department of Defense.\n       (10) Since 2009 the port of Riga, on the Baltic Sea, has \n     been a critical overland entry point for goods being shipped \n     using the Northern Distribution Network. Latvia is a member \n     of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and has been an \n     ally of the United States in the region for many years.\n       (11) In September 2010, the Defense Logistics Agency, the \n     General Services Administration, and other parties hosted a \n     local procurement conference in Riga, Latvia.\n       (12) One hundred nine Latvian vendors attended the \n     September 2010 conference in Riga, and contracts with Latvian \n     vendors have been entered into as a result.\n       (13) In May 2012, Latvia hosted an international workshop \n     in Riga to examine ways of transforming the Northern \n     Distribution Network from a route for the delivery of United \n     States and other Allies' non-lethal goods to Afghanistan into \n     a commercial route that would support the economic growth of \n     Afghanistan and the southwest Asia region.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Latvia and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     member nations along the Northern Distribution Network routes \n     are key economic and security partners of the United States \n     and are to be commended for their contribution to ensuring \n     United States and International Security Assistance Force \n     troops have reliable lines of supply to achieve the mission \n     in Afghanistan;\n       (2) when quality products at competitive prices are \n     available, significant effort should be made to procure goods \n     locally from Latvia and other North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization member nations along the Northern Distribution \n     Network routes; and\n       (3) Latvia and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     member nations along the Northern Distribution Network routes \n     remain allies of the United States in the region, and a \n     mutually beneficial relationship should continue to be \n     cultivated between the United States and Latvia and such \n     other nations in the future.\n\n     SEC. 869.

SENSE OF SENATE ON POTENTIAL SECURITY RISKS TO \n                   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE NETWORKS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Cybersecurity threats are pervasive and serious, \n     including through the supply chain of information technology \n     equipment and software.\n       (2) Semiconductor manufacturing is already dominated by \n     foreign producers, presenting supply chain risk management \n     challenges.\n       (3) In a number of instances, foreign manufacturers of \n     telecommunications equipment, including advanced wireless \n     technology, are gaining global market share due to high \n     quality and low prices. Competitive market forces ensure that \n     commercial providers of consumer, business, and government \n     systems and services will choose equipment and associated \n     software from these manufacturers. In some cases, like Huawei \n     Industries, this competitive position stems in part from \n     inappropriate government subsidies and other forms of \n     assistance.\n       (4) Some of these companies also present clear \n     cybersecurity supply chain risks that the Government must \n     address.\n       (5) The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United \n     States has blocked the attempt by Huawei to acquire United \n     States technology firms on two occasions and the National \n     Security Agency and the Secretary of Commerce have advised \n     two major United States telecommunications carriers against \n     selecting Huawei as a supplier.\n       (6) The Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2011 (Public Law 111-383) provided authority and \n     mechanisms for the Secretary of Defense to control these \n     supply chain risks, but only for National Security Systems, \n     leaving many information technology systems and missions \n     exposed to supply chain risks.\n       (7) Blocking sales from providers of information technology \n     systems and services due to concerns about cybersecurity \n     risks, while maintaining our commitment to free trade and \n     fair and transparent competition, poses difficult policy \n     challenges.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the Department of Defense--\n       (1) must ensure it maintains full visibility and adequate \n     control of its supply chain, including subcontractors, in \n     order to mitigate supply chain exploitation; and\n       (2) needs the authority and capability to mitigate supply \n     chain risks to its information technology systems that fall \n     outside the scope of National Security Systems.\n\n     SEC. 935. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE UNITED STATES CYBER \n                   COMMAND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On June 23, 2009, the Secretary of Defense directed the \n     Commander of the United States Strategic Command to establish \n     the United States Cyber Command, which became operational on \n     May 21, 2010, and operates as a sub-unified command \n     subordinate to the United States Strategic Command.\n       (2) In May 2012, media reports indicated that General \n     Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \n     planned to recommend to Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta \n     that the two-year-old United States Cyber Command be elevated \n     to full combatant command status.\n       (3) On August 14, 2012, General Keith Alexander, the \n     Commander of the United States Cyber Command and the Director \n     of the National Security Agency, addressed the TechNet Land \n     Forces conference and stated that ``[i]n 2007 we drafted . . \n     . a paper . . . about establishing a Cyber Command . . . \n     [which concluded that] . . . the most logical is to set it up \n     as a sub unified and grow it to a unified, and I think that's \n     the process that we're going to work our way through''.\n       (4) On October 11, 2012, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta \n     discussed cybersecurity in a speech to the Business \n     Executives for National Security in New York, New York, \n     specifically calling for a strengthening of the United States \n     Cyber Command and stating that the Department of Defense \n     ``must ensure that [the United States Cyber Command] has the \n     resources, that it has the authorities, that it has the \n     capabilities required to perform this growing mission. And it \n     must also be able to react quickly to events unfolding in \n     cyberspace and help fully integrate cyber into all of the \n     department's plans and activities.''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the serious cyber threat to national \n     security and the need to work both offensively and \n     defensively to protect the Nation's networks and critical \n     infrastructure;\n       (2) acknowledges the importance of the unified command \n     structure of the Department in directing military operations \n     in cyberspace and recognizes that a change in the status of \n     the United States Cyber Command has Department-wide and \n     national security implications, which require careful \n     consideration;\n       (3) expects to be briefed and consulted about any proposal \n     to elevate the United States Cyber Command to a unified \n     command before a decision by the Secretary make such a \n     proposal to the President and to receive, at a minimum--\n       (A) a clear statement of mission and related legal \n     definitions;\n       (B) an outline of the specific national security benefits \n     of elevating the sub-unified United States Cyber Command to a \n     unified command;\n       (C) an estimate of the cost of creating a unified United \n     States Cyber Command and a justification of the expenditure; \n     and\n       (D) if the Secretary considers it advisable to continue the \n     designation of the Commander of the United States Cyber \n     Command as also being the Director of the National Security \n     Agency--\n       (i) an explanation of how a single individual could serve \n     as a commander of a combatant command that conducts overt, \n     albeit clandestine, cyber operations under title 10, United \n     States Code, as well as the director of an intelligence \n     agency that conducts covert cyber operations under the \n     National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 401 et seq.) in a \n     manner that affords deniability to the United States; and\n       (ii) a statement of whether the Secretary believes it is \n     appropriate either to appoint a line officer as the Director \n     of the National Security Agency or to take the unprecedented \n     step of appointing an intelligence officer as a unified \n     commander; and\n       (4) believes that appropriate policy foundations and \n     standing rules of engagement must be in place before any \n     decision to create a unified United States Cyber Command.\n\n     SEC. 936.

REPORT ON EFFECTS OF BUDGET SEQUESTRATION ON THE \n                   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The inability of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit \n     Reduction to find $1,200,000,000,000 in savings will trigger \n     automatic funding reductions known as ``sequestration'' to \n     the Department of Defense of $492,000,000,000 between 2013 \n     and 2021 under section 251A of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 USC 901a).\n       (2) These reductions are in addition to reductions of \n     $487,000,000,000 already being implemented by the Department \n     of Defense, and would decrease the readiness and capabilities \n     of the Armed Forces while increasing risks to the effective \n     implementation of the National Security Strategy of the \n     United States.\n       (3) The leaders of the Department of Defense have \n     consistently testified that threats to the national security \n     of the United States have increased, not decreased. Secretary \n     of Defense Leon Panetta said that these reductions would \n     ``inflict severe damage to our national defense for \n     generations'', comments that have been echoed by the \n     Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.\n       (4) While reductions in funds available for the Department \n     of Defense will automatically commence January 2, 2013, \n     uncertainty regarding the reductions has already exacerbated \n     Department of Defense efforts to plan future defense budget.\n       (5) Sequestration will have a detrimental effect on the \n     industrial base that supports the Department of Defense.\n       (b) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than August 15, 2012, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Committees on Armed \n     Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives a \n     detailed report on the impact on the Department of Defense of \n     the sequestration of funds authorized and appropriated for \n     fiscal year 2013 for the Department of Defense, if \n     automatically triggered on January 2, 2013, under section \n     251A of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \n     of 1985.\n       (2) Elements.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall \n     include the following:\n       (A) An assessment of the potential impact of sequestration \n     on the readiness of the Armed Forces, including impacts to \n     steaming hours, flying hours, and full spectrum training \n     miles, and an estimate of the increase or decrease in \n     readiness (as defined in the C status C-1 through C-5).\n       (B) An assessment of the potential impact of sequestration \n     on the ability of the Department of Defense to carry out the \n     National Military Strategy of the United States, and any \n     changes to the most recent Risk Assessment of the Chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff under section 153(b) of title 10, \n     United States Code arising from sequestration.\n       (C) A list of the programs, projects, and activities across \n     the Department of Defense, the military departments, and the \n     elements and components of the Department of Defense that \n     would be reduced or terminated as a result of sequestration.\n       (D) An estimate of the number and value of all contracts \n     that will be terminated, restructured, or revised in scope as \n     a result of sequestration, including an estimate of potential \n     termination costs and of increased contract costs due to \n     renegotiation and reinstatement of contracts.\n       (3) Assumptions.--The report required by paragraph (1) \n     shall assume the following:\n       (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the funds \n     subject to sequester are the funds in all 050 accounts, \n     including all unobligated balances.\n       (B) The funds exempt from the sequester are the following:\n       (i) Funds in accounts for military personnel.\n       (ii) Funds in accounts for overseas contingency operations.\n       (4) Presentation of certain information.--In listing \n     programs, projects, and activities under paragraph (2)(C), \n     the report required by paragraph (1) shall set forth for each \n     the following:\n       (A) The most specific level of budget item identified in \n     applicable appropriations Acts.\n       (B) Related classified annexes and explanatory statements.\n       (C) Department of Defense budget justification documents \n     DOD P-1 and R-1 as subsequently modified by congressional \n     action, and as submitted by the Department of Defense \n     together with the budget materials for the budget of the \n     President for fiscal year 2013 (as submitted to Congress \n     pursuant to section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code).\n       (D) Department of Defense document O-1 for operation and \n     maintenance accounts for fiscal year 2013, for which purpose \n     the term ``program, project, or activity'' means the budget \n     activity account and sub account for the program, project, or \n     activity as submitted in such document O-1.\n\n     SEC. 1005.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON RECAPITALIZATION FOR THE NAVY \n                   AND COAST GUARD.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) More than 70 percent of the world's surface is \n     comprised of navigable oceans.\n       (2) More than 80 percent of the population of the world \n     lives within 100 miles of an ocean.\n       (3) More than 90 percent of the world's commerce traverses \n     an oceans.\n       (4) The national security of the United States is \n     inextricably linked to the maintenance of global freedom of \n     access for both the strategic and commercial interests of the \n     United States.\n       (5) To maintain that freedom of access the sea services of \n     the United States, composed of the Navy, the Marine Corps, \n     and the Coast Guard, must be sufficiently positioned as \n     rotationally globally deployable forces with the capability \n     to decisively defend United States citizens, homeland, and \n     interests abroad from direct or asymmetric attack and must be \n     comprised of sufficient vessels to maintain global freedom of \n     action.\n       (6) To achieve appropriate capabilities to ensure national \n     security the Government of the United States must continue to \n     recapitalize the fleets of the Navy and Coast Guard and must \n     continue to conduct vital maintenance and repair of existing \n     vessels to ensure such vessels meet service life goals.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the sea services of the United States should be funded \n     and maintained to provide the broad spectrum of capabilities \n     required to protect the national security of the United \n     States;\n       (2) such capabilities should include--\n       (A) the ability to project United States power rapidly \n     anywhere on the globe without the need for host nation basing \n     permission or long and potentially vulnerable logistics \n     supply lines;\n       (B) the ability to land and recover maritime forces from \n     the sea for direct combat action, to evacuate United States \n     citizens from hostile situations, and to provide humanitarian \n     assistance where needed;\n       (C) the ability to operate from the subsurface with \n     overpowering conventional combat power, as well as strategic \n     deterrence; and\n       (D) the ability to operate in collaboration with United \n     States maritime partners in the common interest of preventing \n     piracy at sea and maintaining the commercial sea lanes \n     available for global commerce;\n       (3) the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the \n     Secretary of the Navy, should maintain the recapitalization \n     plans for the Navy as a priority in all future force \n     structure decisions; and\n       (4) the Secretary of Homeland Security should maintain the \n     recapitalization plans for the Coast Guard as a priority in \n     all future force structure decisions.\n\n     SEC. 1024.

Vessels of the \n     Continental Navy were named for early patriots and military \n     heroes, Federal institutions, colonial cities, and positive \n     character traits representative of naval and military \n     virtues.\n       (2) An Act of Congress on March 3, 1819, made the Secretary \n     of the Navy responsible for assigning names to vessels of the \n     Navy. Traditional sources for vessel names customarily \n     encompassed such categories as geographic locations in the \n     United States; historic sites, battles, and ships; naval and \n     military heroes and leaders; and noted individuals who made \n     distinguished contributions to United States national \n     security.\n       (3) These customs and traditions provide appropriate and \n     necessary standards for the naming of vessels of the Navy.\n       (b) Notice to Congress.--Section 7292 of title 10, United \n     States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new subsection:\n       ``(d)(1) The Secretary of the Navy may not announce or \n     implement any proposal to name a vessel of the Navy until 30 \n     days after the date on which the Secretary submits to the \n     Committees on Armed Services of the\n\n[[Page S7526]]\n\n     Senate and the House of Representatives a report setting \n     forth such proposal.\n       ``(2) Each report under this subsection shall describe the \n     justification for the proposal covered by such report in \n     accordance with the standards referred to in section 1024(a) \n     of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2013.''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--This section and the amendment made by \n     this section shall go into effect on the date that is 30 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n                     Subtitle D-- Counterterrorism\n\n     SEC. 1031.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON NON-UNITED STATES CITIZENS \n                   WHO ARE GRADUATES OF UNITED STATES EDUCATIONAL \n                   INSTITUTIONS WITH ADVANCED DEGREES IN SCIENCE, \n                   TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is a national security concern that more than half \n     of all graduates with advanced scientific and technical \n     degrees from United States institutions of higher education \n     are non-United States citizens who have very limited \n     opportunities upon graduation to contribute to the science \n     and technology activities of the Department of Defense and \n     the United States defense industrial base.\n       (2) The capabilities of the Armed Forces are highly reliant \n     upon advanced technologies that provide our forces with a \n     technological edge on the battlefield.\n       (3) In order to maintain and advance our military \n     technological superiority, the United States requires the \n     best and brightest scientists, mathematicians, and engineers \n     to discover, develop, and field the next generation of weapon \n     systems and defense technologies.\n       (4) The Department of Defense and the defense industrial \n     base compete with other sectors for a limited number of \n     United States citizens who have appropriate advanced degrees \n     and skills.\n       (5) While an overarching national priority is to increase \n     the numbers of United States citizens who have appropriate \n     advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering, and \n     mathematics (STEM), it would be beneficial if the Department \n     of Defense and the defense industrial base were able to \n     access the pool of talent of non-United States citizens with \n     advanced scientific and technical degrees from United States \n     institutions of higher education, many of whom are otherwise \n     returning to their home countries.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress--\n       (1) that the Department of Defense should make every \n     reasonable and practical effort to increase the number of \n     United States citizens who pursue advanced degrees in \n     science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; and\n       (2) to strongly urge the Department of Defense to \n     investigate innovative mechanisms (subject to all appropriate \n     security requirements) to access to the pool of talent of \n     non-United States citizens with advanced scientific and \n     technical degrees from United States institutions of higher \n     education, especially in those scientific and technical areas \n     that are most vital to the national defense (such as those \n     identified by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research \n     and Engineering and the Armed Forces).\n\n     SEC. 1084. SENSE OF SENATE ON THE MAINTENANCE BY THE UNITED \n                   STATES OF A TRIAD OF STRATEGIC NUCLEAR DELIVERY \n                   SYSTEMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The April 2010 Nuclear Posture Review concluded that \n     even with the reductions specified in the New START Treaty, \n     the United States should retain a nuclear ``Triad'' of land-\n     based intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched \n     ballistic missiles and nuclear capable heavy bombers, noting \n     that ``[r]etaining all three Triad legs will best maintain \n     strategic stability at reasonable cost, while hedging against \n     potential technical problems or vulnerabilities''.\n       (2) The resolution of ratification for the New START \n     Treaty, which the Senate approved on December 22, 2010, \n     stated that ``it is the sense of the Senate that United \n     States deterrence and flexibility is assured by a robust \n     triad of strategic delivery vehicles. To this end, the United \n     States is committed to accomplishing the modernization and \n     replacement of its strategic nuclear delivery vehicles, and \n     to ensuring the continued flexibility of United States \n     conventional and nuclear delivery systems''.\n       (3) In a message to the Senate on February 2, 2011, \n     President Obama certified that he intended to ``modernize or \n     replace the triad of strategic nuclear delivery systems: a \n     heavy bomber and air-launched cruise missile, an ICBM, and a \n     nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) and SLBM'' \n     and to ``maintain the United States rocket motor industrial \n     base''.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States should maintain a triad of strategic \n     nuclear delivery systems; and\n       (2) the United States is committed to modernizing the \n     component weapons and delivery systems of that triad.\n\n     SEC. 1085. PLAN TO PARTNER WITH STATE AND LOCAL ENTITIES TO \n                   ADDRESS VETERANS CLAIMS BACKLOG.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Department of Veterans Affairs defines any claim \n     for benefits under laws administered by the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs as backlogged if the claim has been pending \n     for 125 days or more.\n       (2) According to the Department, as of November 24, 2012, \n     there were 899,540 pending claims, with 604,583 (67.2 \n     percent) of those considered backlogged.\n       (3) The Department's data further shows that, on November \n     22, 2010, there were 749,934 claims pending, with only \n     244,129 (32.6 percent) of those considered backlogged.\n       (4) During the past two years, both the overall number of \n     backlogged claims and the percentage of all pending claims \n     that are backlogged have doubled.\n       (5) In order to reduce the claims backlog at regional \n     offices of the Department of Veterans Affairs located in \n     Texas, the Texas Veterans Commission announced two \n     initiatives on July 19, 2012, to partner with the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs--\n       (A) to assist veterans whose claims are already backlogged \n     to complete development of those claims; and\n       (B) to help veterans who are filing new claims to fully \n     develop those claims prior to filing them, shortening the \n     processing time required.\n       (6) The common goal of the two initiatives of the Texas \n     Veterans Commission, called the ``Texas State Strike Force \n     Team'' and the ``Fully Developed Claims Team Initiative'', is \n     to reduce the backlog of claims pending in Texas by 17,000 \n     within one year.\n       (7) During the first two months of these new initiatives, \n     the Texas Veterans Commission helped veterans complete \n     development of more than 2,500 backlogged claims and assisted \n     veterans with the submission of more than 800 fully developed \n     claims.\n       (8) In testimony before the Subcommittee on Disability \n     Assistance and Memorial Affairs of the Committee on Veterans' \n     Affairs of the House of Representatives on September 21, \n     2012, Diana Rubens, Deputy Under Secretary for Field \n     Operations of the Veterans Benefits Administration, indicated \n     that the Department of Veterans Affairs has experienced \n     positive outcomes in projects with the Texas Veterans \n     Commission, stating that both Veterans Service Organizations \n     ``and state and county service officers . . . are important \n     partners in VBA's transformation to better serve Veterans.''.\n       (9) At the same hearing, Mr. John Limpose, director of the \n     regional office of the Department of Veterans Affairs in \n     Waco, Texas, testified that the ``TVC is working very, very \n     well'' with regional offices of the Department in Texas, \n     calling the Texas Veterans Commission a ``very positive story \n     that we can branch out into . . . all of our stakeholders.''.\n       (b) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 60 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     shall submit to Congress a plan to reduce the current backlog \n     of pending claims for benefits under laws administered by the \n     Secretary and more efficiently process claims for such \n     benefits in the future.\n       (2) Contents.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall \n     include the following:\n       (A) A summary of all steps the Secretary has taken thus far \n     to partner with non-Federal entities in support of efforts to \n     reduce the backlog described in paragraph (1) and more \n     efficiently process claims described in such paragraph in the \n     future, including two previous initiatives by the Texas \n     Veterans Commission, namely the 2008-2009 Development \n     Assistant Pilot Project and the 2009-2011 Claims Processing \n     Assistance Team.\n       (B) A plan for the Secretary to partner with non-Federal \n     entities to support efforts to reduce such backlog and more \n     efficiently process such claims in the future, including the \n     following:\n       (i) State and local agencies relating to veterans affairs.\n       (ii) Organizations recognized by the Secretary for the \n     representation of veterans under section 5902 of title 38, \n     United States Code.\n       (iii) Such other relevant government and non-government \n     entities as the Secretary considers appropriate.\n       (C) A description of how the Secretary intends to leverage \n     partnerships with non-Federal entities described in \n     subparagraph (B) to eliminate such backlog, including through \n     increasing the percentage of claims that are fully developed \n     prior to submittal to the Secretary and ensuring that new \n     claims are fully developed prior to their submittal.\n       (D) A description of what steps the Secretary has taken and \n     will take--\n       (i) to expedite the processing of claims that are already \n     fully developed at the time of submittal; and\n       (ii) to support initiatives by non-Federal entities \n     described in subparagraph (B) to help claimants gather and \n     submit necessary evidence for claims that were previously \n     filed but require further development.\n\n[[Page S7533]]\n\n       (E) A description of how partnerships with non-Federal \n     entities described in subparagraph (B) will fit into the \n     Secretary's overall claims processing transformation plan.\n\n     SEC. 1086. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PROTECTION OF DEPARTMENT OF \n                   DEFENSE AIRFIELDS, TRAINING AIRSPACE, AND AIR \n                   TRAINING ROUTES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Department of Defense airfields, training airspace, and \n     air training routes are national treasures that must be \n     protected from encroachment;\n       (2) placement or emplacement of obstructions near or on \n     Department of Defense airfields, training airspace, or air \n     training routes has the potential of increasing risk to \n     military aircraft and personnel as well as impacting training \n     and readiness; and\n       (3) the Department of Defense should develop comprehensive \n     rules and regulations to address construction and use of land \n     in close proximity to Department of Defense airfields, \n     training areas, or air training routes to ensure \n     compatibility with military aircraft operations.\n\n     SEC. 1087.

PLAN FOR PROMOTING THE SECURITY OF AFGHAN WOMEN \n                   AND GIRLS DURING THE SECURITY TRANSITION \n                   PROCESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the Department of Defense's April 2012 \n     Report on Progress Toward Security and Stability in \n     Afghanistan:\n       (A) ``U.S. and coalition forces will continue to degrade \n     the Taliban-led insurgency in order to provide time and space \n     to increase the capacity of the Afghan National Security \n     Forces and the Afghan Government so they can assume full \n     responsibility for Afghanistan's security by the end of \n     2014.''\n       (B) ``Transition to Afghan security lead began in July 2011 \n     and transition to full Afghan security responsibility will be \n     complete country-wide by the end of 2014.''\n       (C) ``The security of the Afghan people and the stability \n     of the government are used to judge provincial readiness to \n     move to each successive stage of transition implementation.''\n       (D) For each area designated for transition, a transition \n     implementation plan is developed by the Government of \n     Afghanistan, NATO, and ISAF and approved by the Joint Afghan-\n     NATO Inteqal Board (JANIB). JANIB is also responsible for \n     recommending areas to enter and exit the transition process.\n       (2) According to a 2002 study on Women, Peace and Security \n     submitted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations \n     pursuant to Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), ``the \n     suspension of or restriction on women's enjoyment of their \n     human rights'' can act as an early-warning indicator of \n     impending or renewed conflict. In Afghanistan, restrictions \n     on women's mobility and rights can signal the presence of \n     extremist or insurgent elements in a community.\n       (3) The security of Afghan women and girls in areas \n     undergoing security transitions will be an important gauge of \n     the transition strategy's success. Indicators by which to \n     measure women's security include the mobility of women and \n     girls, the participation of women in local government bodies, \n     the rate of school attendance for girls, women's access to \n     government services, and the prevalence of violence against \n     women.\n       (4) Maintaining and improving physical security for Afghan \n     women and girls throughout the country is critical in order \n     for women and girls to take advantage of opportunities in \n     education, commerce, politics, and other areas of public \n     life, which in turn is essential for the future stability and \n     prosperity of Afghanistan.\n       (5) Women who serve as public officials at all levels of \n     the Government of Afghanistan face serious threats to their \n     personal security and that of their families. Many female \n     officials have been the victims of violent crimes, but they \n     are generally not afforded official protection by the \n     Government of Afghanistan or security forces.\n       (6) Protecting the security and human rights of Afghan \n     women and girls requires the involvement of Afghan men and \n     boys through education about the important benefits of \n     women's full participation in social, economic, and political \n     life. Male officials and security personnel can play a \n     particularly important role in supporting and protecting \n     women and girls.\n       (7) The Chicago Summit Declaration issued by NATO in May \n     2012 states: ``As the Afghan National Police further develop \n     and professionalize, they will evolve towards a sustainable, \n     credible, and accountable civilian law enforcement force that \n     will shoulder the main responsibility for domestic security. \n     This force should be capable of providing policing services \n     to the Afghan population as part of the broader Afghan rule \n     of law system.''\n       (8) Women face significant barriers to full participation \n     in the ANA and ANP, including a discriminatory or hostile \n     work environment and the lack of separate facilities designed \n     for female personnel.\n       (9) As of September 2012, female recruitment and retention \n     rates for the Afghan National Security Forces are far below \n     published targets, as follows:\n       (A) Approximately 1,700 women serve in the Afghan National \n     Security Forces, or less than half of one percent of the \n     total force.\n       (B) In 2010, President Hamid Karzai announced plans to \n     recruit and train 5,000 women in the Afghan National Police, \n     or approximately 3 percent of the force, by 2014. Currently, \n     there are approximately 1,370 women in the ANP, or 0.87 \n     percent of the police force.\n       (C) Approximately 350 women currently serve in the Afghan \n     National Army, representing only 0.17 percent of the force. \n     The Government of Afghanistan has said that its goal is to \n     achieve a force that is 10 percent female. As of May 2012, \n     approximately 3 percent of new ANA recruits were women.\n       (10) Male security personnel often do not respond to \n     threats or incidences of violence against women, particularly \n     at the local level. They largely lack the training and \n     understanding needed to respond appropriately and effectively \n     to situations involving women. According to the Department of \n     Defense's April 2012 Report on Progress Toward Security and \n     Stability in Afghanistan:\n       (A) The Afghan Ministry of Defense ``lacks the combination \n     of policies, procedures, and execution to promote opportunity \n     and fair and respectful treatment of women in the force''.\n       (B) The Afghan Ministry of Interior ``faces significant \n     challenges in fully integrating and protecting women in the \n     ANP workforce, especially among operational units at the \n     provincial and district levels''.\n       (C) In the Afghan National Police, ``Many Provincial \n     Headquarters Commanders do not accept policewomen, as they \n     prefer male candidates and lack adequate facilities to \n     support females.''\n       (D) ``While women are greatly needed to support police \n     operations, a combination of cultural impediments, weak \n     recruitment, and uneven application of policies hinder \n     significant progress.''\n       (E) ``Although stronger documentation, implementation, and \n     enforcement of policies, procedures, and guidance to better \n     integrate women will help, time will be needed to change the \n     cultural mores that form the basis of many of the current \n     impediments.''\n       (11) The United States, the North American Treaty \n     Organization, and United States coalition partners have made \n     firm commitments to support the human rights of the women and \n     girls of Afghanistan, as evidenced by the following actions:\n       (A) According to the United States National Action Plan on \n     Women, Peace and Security, ``integrating women and gender \n     considerations into peace-building processes helps promote \n     democratic governance and long-term stability,'' which are \n     key United States strategic goals in Afghanistan.\n       (B) The National Action Plan also states that ``the \n     engagement and protection of women as agents of peace and \n     stability will be central to United States efforts to promote \n     security, prevent, respond to, and resolve conflict, and \n     rebuild societies.'' This policy applies to United States \n     Government efforts in Afghanistan, where addressing the \n     security vulnerabilities of Afghan women and girls during the \n     period of security transition is an essential step toward \n     long-term stability.\n       (C) The Chicago Summit Declaration issued by NATO in May \n     2012 states: ``We emphasize the importance of full \n     participation of all Afghan women in the reconstruction, \n     political, peace and reconciliation processes in Afghanistan \n     and the need to respect the institutional arrangements \n     protecting their rights. We remain committed to the \n     implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     (UNSCR) 1325 on women, peace and security. We recognize also \n     the need for the protection of children from the damaging \n     effects of armed conflict as required in relevant UNSCRs.''\n       (12) The Strategic Partnership Agreement signed between the \n     United States and Afghanistan by President Obama and \n     President Karzai in June 2012 states, ``Consistent with its \n     Constitution and international obligations, Afghanistan shall \n     ensure and advance the essential role of women in society, so \n     that they may fully enjoy their economic, social, political, \n     civil and cultural rights.''\n       (b) Plan To Promote Security of Afghan Women.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 120 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense, in \n     concurrence with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the \n     appropriate congressional committees a plan to promote the \n     security of Afghan women during the security transition \n     process.\n       (2) Elements.--The plan required under paragraph (1) shall \n     include the following elements:\n       (A) A plan to monitor and respond to changes in women's \n     security conditions in areas undergoing transition, including \n     the following actions:\n       (i) Seeking to designate a Civilian Impact Advisor on the \n     Joint Afghan-NATO Inteqal\n\n[[Page S7547]]\n\n     Board (JANIB) to assess the impact of transition on male and \n     female civilians and ensure that efforts to protect women's \n     rights and security are included in each area's transition \n     implementation plan.\n       (ii) Reviewing existing indicators against which sex-\n     disaggregated data is collected and, if necessary, developing \n     additional indicators, to ensure the availability of data \n     that can be used to measure women's security, such as--\n\n       (I) the mobility of women and girls;\n       (II) the participation of women in local government bodies;\n       (III) the rate of school attendance for girls;\n       (IV) women's access to government services; and\n       (V) the prevalence of violence against women; and \n     incorporating those indicators into ongoing efforts to assess \n     overall security conditions during the transition period.\n\n       (iii) Integrating assessments of women's security into \n     current procedures used to determine an area's readiness to \n     proceed through the transition process.\n       (iv) Working with Afghan partners, coalition partners, and \n     relevant United States Government departments and agencies to \n     take concrete action to support women's rights and security \n     in cases of deterioration in women's security conditions \n     during the transition period.\n       (B) A plan to increase gender awareness and responsiveness \n     among Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police \n     personnel, including the following actions:\n       (i) Working with Afghan and coalition partners to utilize \n     training curricula and programming that addresses the human \n     rights of women and girls, appropriate responses to threats \n     against women and girls, and appropriate behavior toward \n     female colleagues and members of the community; assessing the \n     quality and consistency of this training across regional \n     commands; and assessing the impact of this training on \n     trainee behavior.\n       (ii) Working with national and local ANA and ANP leaders to \n     develop and utilize enforcement and accountability mechanisms \n     for ANA and ANP personnel who violate codes of conduct \n     related to the human rights of women and girls.\n       (iii) Working with Afghan and coalition partners to \n     implement the above tools and develop uniform methods and \n     standards for training and enforcement among coalition \n     partners and across regions.\n       (C) A plan to increase the number of female members of the \n     ANA and ANP, including the following actions:\n       (i) Providing, through consultation with Afghan partners, \n     realistic and achievable objectives for the recruitment and \n     retention of women to the ANA and ANP by the end of the \n     security transition period in 2014.\n       (ii) Working with national and local ANA and ANP leaders \n     and coalition partners to address physical and cultural \n     challenges to the recruitment and retention of female ANA and \n     ANP personnel, including through targeted recruitment \n     campaigns, expanded training and mentorship opportunities, \n     parity in pay and promotion rates with male counterparts, and \n     availability of facilities for female personnel.\n       (iii) Working with national and local ANA and ANP leaders \n     to increase understanding about the unique ways in which \n     women members of the security forces improve the force's \n     overall effectiveness.\n       (iv) Working with national and local ANA and ANP leaders to \n     develop a plan for maintaining and increasing the recruitment \n     and retention of women in the ANA and ANP following the \n     completion of the security transition.\n       (3) Report.--The Secretary of Defense shall include in each \n     report on progress toward security and stability in \n     Afghanistan that is submitted to Congress under sections 1230 \n     and 1231 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2008 (Public Law 110-181;

REGIONAL RADIOLOGICAL SECURITY ZONES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A terrorist attack using high-activity radiological \n     materials, such as in a dirty bomb, could inflict billions of \n     dollars of economic costs and considerable societal and \n     economic dislocation, with effects and costs possibly lasting \n     for years.\n       (2) It may be easier for terrorists to obtain the materials \n     for, and to fabricate, a dirty bomb than an improvised \n     nuclear device.\n       (3) Radiological materials are in widespread use worldwide, \n     with estimates of the number of radiological sources ranging \n     from 100,000 to millions.\n       (4) Many nations have a security and regulatory regime for \n     their radiological sources that is much less developed than \n     that of the United States.\n       (5) Radiological materials are used at many civilian sites \n     including hospitals, industrial sites, and other locations \n     that have little security, placing these materials at risk of \n     theft.\n       (6) Many radiological materials have become lost, disused, \n     unwanted, or abandoned, with the Global Threat Reduction \n     Initiative of the National Nuclear Security Administration \n     having recovered more than 30,000 radioactive sources in the \n     United States, repatriated more than 2,400 United States-\n     origin sources from other countries, and helped recover more \n     than 13,000 radioactive sources and radioisotope \n     thermoelectric generators in other countries.\n       (7) High-activity radiological materials can be used in a \n     dirty bomb.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     United States and global nonproliferation efforts should \n     place a high priority on programs to secure high-activity \n     radiological sources to reduce the threat of radiological \n     terrorism.\n       (c) Study.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the National \n     Nuclear Security Administration shall submit to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress a study in accordance with \n     paragraph (3).\n       (2) Consultation.--The Administrator may, in conducting the \n     study required under paragraph (1), consult with the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of State, the \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and such other departments and \n     agencies of the United States Government as the Administrator \n     considers appropriate.\n       (3) Matters included.--The study under paragraph (1) shall \n     include the following:\n       (A) An assessment of the radioactive isotopes and \n     associated activity levels that present the greatest risk to \n     national and international security.\n       (B) A review of current United States Government efforts to \n     secure radiological materials abroad, including coordination \n     with foreign governments, the European Union, the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency, other international \n     programs, and nongovernmental organizations that identify, \n     register, secure, remove, and provide for the disposition of \n     high-risk radiological materials worldwide.\n       (C) A review of current United States Government efforts to \n     secure radiological materials domestically at civilian sites, \n     including hospitals, industrial sites, and other locations.\n       (D) A definition of regional radiological security zones, \n     including the subset of the materials of concern to be the \n     immediate focus and the security best practices required to \n     achieve that goal.\n       (E) An assessment of the feasibility, cost, desirability, \n     and added benefit of establishing regional radiological \n     security zones in high priority areas worldwide in order to \n     facilitate regional collaboration in--\n\n[[Page S7578]]\n\n       (i) identifying and inventorying high-activity radiological \n     sources at high-risk sites;\n       (ii) reviewing national level regulations, inspections, \n     transportation security, and security upgrade options; and\n       (iii) assessing opportunities for the harmonization of \n     regulations and security practices among the nations of the \n     region.\n       (F) An assessment of the feasibility, cost, desirability, \n     and added benefit of establishing remote regional monitoring \n     centers that would receive real-time data from radiological \n     security sites, would be staffed by trained personnel from \n     the countries in the region, and would alert local law \n     enforcement in the event of a potential or actual terrorist \n     incident or other emergency.\n       (G) A list and assessment of the best practices used in the \n     United States that are most critical in enhancing domestic \n     radiological material security and could be used to enhance \n     radiological security worldwide.\n       (H) An assessment of the United States entity or entities \n     that would be best suited to lead efforts to establish a \n     radiological security zone program.\n       (I) An estimate of the costs associated with the \n     implementation of a radiological security zone program.\n       (J) An assessment of the known locations outside the United \n     States housing high-risk radiological materials in excess of \n     1,000 curies.\n       (4) Form.--The study required under paragraph (1) shall be \n     submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified \n     annex.\n       (d) Appropriate Committees of Congress Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' \n     means--\n       (1) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations of the Senate;

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON OVERSIGHT OF THE NUCLEAR \n                   SECURITY ENTERPRISE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 2000, the National Nuclear Security Administration \n     was established as an independent entity within the \n     Department of Energy to manage and secure the nuclear weapons \n     stockpile of the United States and to manage nuclear \n     nonproliferation and naval reactor programs.\n       (2) Serious security and health incidents continue to occur \n     at sites of the National Nuclear Security Administration.\n       (3) In September 2012, an official of the Government \n     Accountability Office testified to Congress that lax \n     laboratory attitudes toward safety procedures, laboratory \n     inadequacies in identifying and addressing safety problems \n     with appropriate corrective actions, and inadequate oversight \n     by site offices of the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration were responsible for nearly 100 safety \n     incidents since 2000.\n       (4) On July 28, 2012, three unarmed individuals compromised \n     security at the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, \n     Tennessee, and according to the Government Accountability \n     Office, ``gained access to the protected security area \n     directly adjacent to one of the nation's most critically \n     important nuclear weapons-related facilities''.\n       (5) In June 2006, hackers attacked an unclassified computer \n     system at the National Nuclear Security Administration's \n     Service Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and gained access \n     to a file containing the names and social security numbers of \n     more than 1,500 employees of the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration.\n       (6) As early as February 2005, the Inspector General of the \n     Department of Energy identified problems with the retrieval \n     of badges from terminated employees at Los Alamos National \n     Laboratory and other sites of the National Nuclear Security \n     Administration.\n       (7) In 2004, a pattern of safety and security incidents \n     that occurred over the course of a year prompted the stand-\n     down of Los Alamos National Laboratory.\n       (8) The National Nuclear Security Administration, \n     independent of the safety and security reform efforts of the \n     Department of Energy, has launched an overhaul of its \n     contracting oversight, placing an emphasis on contractor \n     self-policing through an untested ``contractor assurance'' \n     approach.\n       (9) The Government Accountability Office has given the \n     contractor administration and project management capabilities \n     of the National Nuclear Security Administration a ``high \n     risk'' designation and found there to be insufficient \n     qualified Federal acquisition professionals to ``plan, \n     direct, and oversee project execution''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) there is a need for strong, independent oversight of \n     the United States nuclear security enterprise;\n       (2) any attempt to reform oversight of the nuclear security \n     enterprise that transfers oversight from the Department of \n     Energy to the National Nuclear Security Administration, \n     reduces protections for worker health and safety at \n     facilities of the National Nuclear Security Administration to \n     levels below the standards of the Department of Energy, or \n     transfers construction appropriations for the nuclear \n     security enterprise from the Department of Energy \n     appropriation account to the military construction \n     appropriation account, should be carefully evaluated;\n       (3) the Office of Health, Safety, and Security of the \n     Department of Energy, which reports to the Secretary of \n     Energy but is also accountable for routinely reporting to \n     Congress on the performance with respect to safety and \n     security of the Department, including the National Nuclear \n     Security Administration, and the role of that Office in \n     overseeing safety and security at the National Nuclear \n     Security Administration, should not be diminished but should \n     be routinely evaluated;\n       (4) any future modifications to the management or structure \n     of the nuclear security enterprise should be done in a way \n     that maintains or increases oversight of critical \n     construction, security, and acquisition capabilities;\n       (5) to the extent possible, oversight of programs of the \n     National Nuclear Security Administration by the Department of \n     Defense should increase to ensure current and future \n     warfighting requirements are met; and\n\n[[Page S7579]]\n\n       (6) the Nuclear Weapons Council should provide proper \n     oversight in the execution of its responsibilities under \n     section 179 of title 10, United States Code.\n\n            Subtitle E--American Medical Isotopes Production\n\n     SEC. 3151.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 609, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 609) calling for the immediate and \n     unconditional release of United States citizen Alan Phillip \n     Gross from detention in Cuba and urging the Government of \n     Cuba to address his medical issues.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, 2 days ago--December 3, 2012--marked the \nthird anniversary of Alan Gross' arrest by the Cuban Government. Over \nthe past 3 years, Alan's case has been of deep personal concern to me \nand many in my State. Alan, an American citizen and Marylander, was in \nCuba to help the small Jewish community there establish improved access \nto the Internet, which would allow the community to go online without \nfear of censorship or monitoring. After being held for 14 months \nwithout charge and then a cursory 2-day trial, he was convicted and \nsentenced to 15 years in prison. In August 2012, a petition to the \nUnited Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention was filed on his \nbehalf.\n  Last week, officials with the Cuban Ministry for Foreign Affairs \nclaimed that Alan Gross is in good health. But the Cuban Government has \nnot allowed Mr. Gross to receive an independent medical evaluation. To \ndate, Alan has lost 105 pounds, suffers from degenerative arthritis, \nand has a mass behind his shoulder. Alan also suffers from severe \nmental anguish because of the separation from his family.\n  To say that the Gross family has been on a rollercoaster would be an \nunderstatement. His mother and daughter are both battling cancer. His \nwife Judy is struggling to make ends meet. Judy Gross has fought for \nAlan's release every day for the last 3 years. Judy has called, e-\nmailed, and met with everyone imaginable. She has been on news programs \nand written letters. Judy has never given up hope; she has remained \nstrong for her family and for Alan. As many of our colleagues will \nattest, she will stop at nothing to see Alan return home. Due in no \nsmall part to Judy's perseverance, the U.S. Senate has been actively \ninvolved in this matter.\n  Over the past 3 years, U.S. officials have traveled to Cuba, we have \nwritten to numerous Cuban dignitaries, and we have employed other \ncreative means to encourage Mr. Gross' release. In September, my \ncolleague Senator Moran and I, along with a bipartisan group of 44 \nSenators, sent a letter to Raul Castro urging the Cuban Government in \nthe strongest possible terms to release Alan Gross immediately and \nunconditionally. But these attempts have been futile. Alan Gross \nremains in prison, caught in the middle of a conflict between two \nnations with a complex, often frustrating relationship.\n  Tonight, the Senate is adopting a resolution unanimously, a \nresolution Senator Moran and I have submitted with a long list of \nbipartisan sponsors. The resolution calls for Mr. Gross' immediate and \nunconditional release and urges the Cuban Government to address his \nmedical issues, including allowing an independent medical examination \nto be completed. Alan's personal freedoms are being violated every day \nthat he continues to be incarcerated, and we can no longer tolerate his \nbeing denied an independent medical evaluation. Alan Gross should no \nlonger be forced to suffer the consequences of political gamesmanship. \nEnough is enough.\n  Today the Senate has spoken once again. Alan Gross is a husband, a \nfather, a son, and an American. We call on the Cuban Government to \nrelease Alan Gross immediately.\n  Mr. President, I know of no further debate on this measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the resolution.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 609) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the preamble \nbe agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements relating to the matter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 609\n\n       Whereas, Alan Phillip Gross, a citizen of the United \n     States, was born in New York on May 2, 1949, and is a \n     resident of the State of Maryland;\n       Whereas Mr. Gross has devoted his professional life to \n     helping others through his work in international development \n     and has served in more than 50 countries and territories \n     worldwide;\n       Whereas, in 2001, Mr. Gross founded JBDC, LLC to support \n     Internet connectivity in locations with little or no access;\n       Whereas, on February 10, 2009, JBDC, LLC received a \n     subcontract with the United States Agency for International \n     Development (USAID);\n       Whereas, working as a subcontractor for the United States \n     Agency for International Development, Mr. Gross sought to \n     establish wireless networks and improve Internet and Intranet \n     access and connectivity for a small, peaceful, non-dissident, \n     Cuban Jewish community;\n       Whereas Mr. Gross made 5 trips to Cuba in furtherance of \n     the United States Agency for International Development \n     project he was subcontracted to support;\n       Whereas the last time Mr. Gross was in the United States \n     was on November 24, 2009;\n\n[[Page S7638]]\n\n       Whereas Mr. Gross was arrested on December 3, 2009, in \n     Havana, Cuba;\n       Whereas Mr. Gross was detained without charge for 14 \n     months;\n       Whereas Mr. Gross was charged in February 2011 with \n     ``actions against the independence or the territorial \n     integrity of the state'';\n       Whereas Mr. Gross's trial lasted only 2 days, after which \n     he was sentenced to 15 years in prison;\n       Whereas Mr. Gross and his wife Judy have 2 daughters, one \n     of which was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010;\n       Whereas Mr. Gross's 90-year old mother was diagnosed with \n     inoperable cancer in February 2011;\n       Whereas, in 2011, Mr. Gross's wife Judy underwent surgery, \n     causing her to miss considerable time from work and putting \n     further financial strain on their family;\n       Whereas Mr. Gross is 63 years old and has lost more than \n     105 pounds since being detained in Cuba;\n       Whereas Mr. Gross has developed degenerative arthritis in \n     his leg and a mass behind his shoulder;\n       Whereas the Government of Cuba has denied requests by Mr. \n     Gross for an independent medical examination;\n       Whereas Mr. Gross's legal representative filed an appeal to \n     the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention of the United \n     Nations in August 2012; and\n       Whereas, since Mr. Gross was detained by the Government of \n     Cuba on December 3, 2009, his health has severely \n     deteriorated and his family members have suffered health and \n     financial problems: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) calls for the immediate and unconditional release of \n     United States citizen Alan Phillip Gross; and\n       (2) urges the Government of Cuba in the meantime to provide \n     all appropriate diagnostic and medical treatment to address \n     the full range of medical issues facing Mr. Gross and to \n     allow him to choose a doctor to provide him with an \n     independent medical assessment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/05/senate-section/article/S7638-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TEEN CANCER AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  Mr. CARDIN.

Res. 595\n\n       Whereas there are millions of unparented children in the \n     world, including 400,540 children in the foster care system \n     in the United States, approximately 104,000 of whom are \n     waiting for families to adopt them;\n       Whereas 59 percent of the children in foster care in the \n     United States are age 10 or younger;\n       Whereas the average length of time a child spends in foster \n     care is approximately 2 years;\n       Whereas for many foster children, the wait for a loving \n     family in which they are nurtured, comforted, and protected \n     seems endless;\n       Whereas in 2011, nearly 26,000 youth ``aged out'' of foster \n     care by reaching adulthood without being placed in a \n     permanent home;\n       Whereas every day, loving and nurturing families are \n     strengthened and expanded when committed and dedicated \n     individuals make an important difference in the life of a \n     child through adoption;\n       Whereas a 2007 survey conducted by the Dave Thomas \n     Foundation for Adoption demonstrated that though ``Americans \n     overwhelmingly support the concept of adoption, and in \n     particular foster care adoption . . . foster care adoptions \n     have not increased significantly over the past five years'';\n       Whereas while 4 in 10 Americans have considered adoption, a \n     majority of Americans have misperceptions about the process \n     of adopting children from foster care and the children who \n     are eligible for adoption;\n       Whereas 71 percent of those who have considered adoption \n     consider adopting children from foster care above other forms \n     of adoption;\n       Whereas 45 percent of Americans believe that children enter \n     the foster care system because of juvenile delinquency, when \n     in reality the vast majority of children who have entered the \n     foster care system were victims of neglect, abandonment, or \n     abuse;\n       Whereas 46 percent of Americans believe that foster care \n     adoption is expensive, when in reality there is no \n     substantial cost for adopting from foster care and financial \n     support is available to adoptive parents after the adoption \n     is finalized;\n       Whereas family reunification, kinship care, and domestic \n     and inter-county adoption promote permanency and stability to \n     a far greater degree than long-term institutionalization and \n     long-term, often disrupted foster care;\n       Whereas both National Adoption Day and National Adoption \n     Month occur in the month of November;\n       Whereas National Adoption Day is a collective national \n     effort to find permanent, loving families for children in the \n     foster care system;\n       Whereas since the first National Adoption Day in 2000, \n     nearly 40,000 children have joined forever families during \n     National Adoption Day;\n       Whereas in 2011, a total of 365 events were held in 47 \n     States and the District of Columbia, finalizing the adoptions \n     of 4,187 children from foster care and celebrating an \n     additional 1,030 adoptions finalized during November or \n     earlier in the year; and\n       Whereas the President traditionally issues an annual \n     proclamation to declare the month of November as National \n     Adoption Month, and National Adoption Day is on November 17, \n     2012: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Adoption Day \n     and National Adoption Month;\n       (2) recognizes that every child should have a permanent and \n     loving family; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to consider \n     adoption during the month of November and all throughout the \n     year.\n\n[[Page S7639]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/05/senate-section/article/S7639-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nCOMMEMORATING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE GRADUATE RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP \n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. CARDIN.

Res. 610\n\n       Whereas the United States is a world leader in science, \n     technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fundamental \n     research and related education;\n       Whereas an excellent STEM higher-education system is \n     critical to the development of a robust and inclusive U.S. \n     STEM workforce and to U.S. global science and engineering \n     preeminence;\n       Whereas Congress and President Harry S. Truman created the \n     National Science Foundation (NSF), an independent Federal \n     agency, 62 years ago specifically to advance scientific \n     discovery and innovation through the Nation's basic research \n     and STEM education infrastructure;\n       Whereas fundamental research supported by NSF across all \n     scientific disciplines have resulted in many significant \n     contributions to Americans' health and security, as well as \n     to technological innovation and U.S. economic prosperity;\n       Whereas advances in knowledge are made possible by \n     researchers who focus on the fundamental properties of \n     nature, and who mentor and educate the next generation of \n     scientists and engineers;\n       Whereas 60 years ago, NSF purposefully created the Graduate \n     Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) as an instrument to \n     prepare the Nation's reservoir of science and engineering \n     talent;\n       Whereas the GRFP, the country's oldest graduate fellowship \n     program, supports outstanding graduate students pursuing \n     masters and doctoral degrees in research at accredited U.S. \n     institutions;\n       Whereas the GRFP has contributed to the development of \n     outstanding U.S. scholars, entrepreneurs, teachers, mentors, \n     and inventors who continue to support and promote the \n     Nation's science and engineering enterprise and the next \n     generation of scientists and engineers;\n       Whereas this flagship program helps maintain high-quality \n     and highly skilled graduates who enter the Nation's STEM \n     workforce prepared to innovate and collaborate in the global \n     scientific arena;\n       Whereas NSF has funded more than 46,500 competitive \n     graduate research fellows with selection criteria based on \n     the intellectual merit of their research and its potential \n     broader impacts for society;\n       Whereas of the more than 200 NSF-supported Nobel laureates, \n     40 were selected as graduate research fellows, and more than \n     440 graduate research fellows have become members of the \n     National Academy of Sciences;\n       Whereas graduate research fellows have an exceptionally \n     high rate of doctorate completion;\n       Whereas since 2001, graduate research fellows have filed \n     more than 1,000 patents while working toward their graduate \n     degrees, thus contributing directly to scientific advancement \n     and discovery;\n       Whereas since 2007, 1145 graduate research fellows were \n     selected from Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive \n     Research jurisdictions; and\n       Whereas NSF's GRFP continues to be an essential component \n     of the Nation's discovery and innovation ecosystem, and is \n     instrumental in STEM workforce development: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates the 60th anniversary of the Graduate \n     Research Fellowship Program of the National Science \n     Foundation; and\n       (2) continues to recognize U.S. STEM graduate education as \n     central to U.S. workforce competitiveness and our country's \n     international leadership and economic prosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/05/senate-section/article/S7639-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, DECEMBER 6, 2012\n\n  Mr. CARDIN.
