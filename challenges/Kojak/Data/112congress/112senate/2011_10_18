Madam President, America's education system is literally \nunder siege. This terrible recession we are involved in has put \nmillions of families in our country in a desperate economic situation. \nIt has also put our schools at risk.\n  Since 2008, we have lost 300,000 education jobs, including 200,000 in \nthe last year alone. Without talented, dedicated teachers and support \nstaff, our schools cannot provide the world-class education students \nneed to succeed in today's difficult economic climate. As State and \nlocal governments are forced to slash education funding again and \nagain, it jeopardizes the future of millions of children, regardless of \nwhere they live or how much money their parents make.\n  Nevada alone is facing a $1.2 billion budget shortfall in 2011, \npractically ensuring further cuts to State and local education. But \nNevada can ill afford to lose more teachers, police, and first \nresponders. The State has already\n\n[[Page S6624]]\n\nslashed State education funding below previous session levels. Any \nadditional cuts will place thousands of Nevada teaching jobs at risk. \nSchool districts in Nevada have already made difficult cuts: laying off \nteachers, eliminating programs, and reducing the number of hours \nchildren spend in school.\n  The State has delayed expansion of all-day kindergarten, eliminated \nresources for gifted and talented programs, cut a magnet program for \nstudents who are deaf or hard of hearing. All around schools have been \neliminated.\n  Further cuts will affect the basic pillars of American education. \nAlready the school board in one county, Lyon County, a rural part of \nNevada, has considered moving to a 4-day school week. Students in the \nUnited States already spend much less time in school than students in \nother countries, including those with whom we compete for jobs. Most \nAmerican people spend a month less in the classrooms than those in \nSouth Korea or Japan, whose students are among the highest performing \nin the world.\n  At a time when Nevadans are competing for jobs with graduates from \ncountries around the world, as well as those in neighboring States, \nschool districts should not be forced to make decisions such as the one \nfacing Lyon County, NV. The Teachers and First Responders Back to Work \nAct, filed last night and led by Senator Menendez, will ensure the Lyon \nCounty school district will not have to choose between laying off \nteachers and reducing the school year.\n  It will protect gains made by school districts such as the one in \nWashoe County, which increased its graduation rate from 55 percent to \nnearly 70 percent in a period of less than 2 years. Budget cuts would \nthreaten that progress. The district cannot expect to improve on these \ngains if it has to jam more students in every class and lay off \nliteracy and math specialists.\n  The teachers legislation I introduced last night will stem the loss \nof education jobs and help districts such as Washoe to continue to \nimprove. This legislation will provide Nevada with an additional $260 \nmillion to keep teachers in the classroom and maintain class sizes. It \nwill support 3,600 education jobs in the State and give the economy a \njolt.\n  It will not increase the deficit by one penny. It asks millionaires \nand billionaires to contribute a tiny fraction more to help turn our \neconomy around. That is an idea two-thirds of Americans and a majority \nof even Republicans support. This Nation's schools have already been \nhit hard by State and local budget cuts. We cannot afford to lose more \nteachers or lay off more police or first responders.\n  In Nevada, local governments have already made the difficult choice \nto cut almost 9,000 jobs. These unprecedented layoffs have extended the \nrecession and slowed the recovery in Nevada. And further budget \nshortfalls threaten thousands more jobs. Nationwide, State and local \nbudget cuts will cost as many as 280,000 teaching jobs next year unless \nwe do something about that. This teachers and first responders \nlegislation will invest $30 billion to create or save nearly 400,000 \nteacher jobs; that is, those who are going to be laid off this year, \nplus those who have been hurt and laid off in past years. That money \nwill help State and school districts stop more layoffs and rehire tens \nof thousands of teachers laid off since this severe recession began.\n  We will also invest $5 billion to retain and rehire the police, \nfirefighters, and first responders to protect our communities \nthroughout this tough economic time. That is why it is so important \nthat the Senate move to this as quickly as possible. Teachers out of \nwork through no fault of their own and students who desperately need a \ngood education are relying on us to act.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, it is no secret that the vast \nmajority of Americans are not happy with Washington right now. They say \n13 percent of the public approves of Congress, and I have not met any \nof those people.\n  It is also no secret that the President of the United States is \ntrying to use the displeasure of Washington for political gain. I think \nthat is a pretty sad commentary on the state of affairs over at the \nWhite House lately. As the only person elected to represent every \nAmerican, the President should speak for all Americans, especially in \ntimes of crisis, not divide them for short-term partisan political \ngain.\n  But it is perfectly obvious why the President would find the path of \ndivision appealing, because on the No. 1 issue we face, jobs and the \neconomy, the President's policies have not worked as advertised. After \nnearly 3 years in office, he has failed to make any progress on his \npromises to turn the jobs crisis around. I think we can pretty much sum \nup that failure with a single number, 1.5 million. That is how many \nfewer jobs there are right now in America since the President signed \nhis first stimulus, according to the Obama administration's own Labor \nDepartment--1.5 million.\n  So what is the President trying to do? Well, he is trying to change \nthe topic. He wants to deflect attention from that 1.5 million job \nloss. He wants to think the problem is not his policies, it is those \nmean Republicans in Congress who oppose them. But the President leaves \na few things out of the reelection script he brought along on his bus \ntour.\n  First of all, it was not just the Republicans who defeated his latest \nstimulus bill last week. The only reason a majority of Democrats voted \nto debate it is they knew they would not have to vote on it. That is \nwhy the majority leader repeatedly moved to block a vote on the measure \nitself, the actual proposal.\n  Second, we are now living under economic policies that President \nObama himself put in place. This is not something you will hear on the \nbus tour, but let's be clear. The President got everything he wanted \nfrom a Democratic-controlled Congress during the first 2 years of his \npresidency. He owned the place.\n  Now we are living with the hard realities that those policies have \nbrought to bear on the American worker. So at this point, anytime the \nPresident says ``pass this bill,'' people have a very good reason to be \nskeptical, because this is not the first time President Obama demanded \nthat Congress pass what he calls a jobs bill. But if this one were to \npass and it worked as advertised, then it would be the first one that \ndid.\n  Again and again, the President's response to America's ongoing jobs \ncrisis has been to insist that Congress pass some urgent piece of \nlegislation right away or an even worse calamity would result. Those \nbills were supposed to create jobs and prevent layoffs as well.\n  But he keeps coming back for more. I guess the President is counting \non the American people to forget that part. He is counting on us to \nforget about the other stimulus legislation he has already signed into \nlaw and that has failed to live up to its hype every single time.\n  Again and again the President has demanded that Congress do something \nto create jobs, and the only thing we seem to end up with at the end of \nthe day is more debt, more government, and fewer jobs. So let's review \nthe record for a while.\n  Two and a half years ago, President Obama went down to Florida and \nsaid the first stimulus--the nearly $1 trillion government spending \nbill he signed shortly after taking office--would save or create \nmillions of jobs, including jobs for firefighters, nurses, police \nofficers, and teachers.\n  Well, what happened? The States got their bailout, the national \nunemployment rate didn't budge, and a year and a half later the \nPresident was back asking for another one. That is right, a year and a \nhalf after the first stimulus,\n\n[[Page S6625]]\n\nthe White House was back last August saying they needed another $26 \nbillion right away or else 160,000 teachers would get pink slips and \npolice and firefighters across the country would literally be off the \njob. What happened then? Well, the States got another bailout. The \nunemployment rate didn't budge. And now the President is riding around \non a bus saying that if they don't get another one, teachers, police, \nand firefighters will lose their jobs again.\n  Does anybody notice a pattern? We have been doing this for nearly 3 \nyears now--3 years. It doesn't work as advertised. Bailouts don't solve \nthe problem. In fact, they perpetuate it. Yet all we get from the \nPresident and Democrats in Congress is do it again, do it again, or \nelse.\n  We have been mired in a jobs crisis for 3 long years now, and all the \nDemocrats ever want to do is throw more taxpayer money at it. It never \nworks the way they claim it will. Yet they want to keep on doing it--\nwith other people's money. Just throw another bailout together, slap \nthe word ``jobs'' on the cover page, and dare people to vote against \nit. That is, apparently, the Democrats' governing philosophy--3 years \ninto this jobs crisis. It would not be irresponsible to oppose an \napproach such as this; it would be irresponsible to consider it. It \ndidn't work the first time. It didn't work the second time. The third \ntime won't be a charm. That is why Republicans and a growing number of \nour Democratic friends want a different approach. There is a growing \nbipartisan opposition to trying the same failed policies again.\n  There is bipartisan opposition to raising taxes, especially at a time \nwhen 14 million Americans are out of work. If there is one thing we \nshould agree on now, it is that we should be making it easier for \nbusinesses to hire, not harder. So the President should drop his \nobsession with raising taxes, and if he really wants to create jobs, \nmaybe he should consider doing something different.\n  We have tried the bailout approach. We have tried more regulations, \nmore debt, and more taxes. Why don't we try a new idea for a change, \none that has bipartisan support, one that isn't a two-time proven \nfailure? Let's try something that might actually work because the \nAmerican people didn't send us here to kick our problems down the road. \nThey certainly didn't send us here to repeat the same mistakes over and \nover and then stick them and their children with the tab. That might be \nhow you maintain a sense of urgency--by failing to solve the problem \nthe first two times around--but it is not how you solve a jobs crisis. \nThe American people simply deserve better than this. They deserve \nbetter than the false promises they have been getting.\n  The President got everything he wanted from a Democratic Congress for \n2 years--everything he wanted: a health care law designed to take over \none-sixth of the entire economy; a financial reform bill that punishes \nbusinesses that had nothing to do with the financial crisis; out-of-\ncontrol regulations that are forcing otherwise healthy businesses to \nshut down, businesses such as Smart Papers in Hamilton, OH, a paper \nmill that said last week it is shutting down because of onerous new \nFederal regulations that make it too costly to do business; and a \ntrillion-dollar stimulus that was supposed to solve the jobs crisis \n2\\1/2\\ years ago.\n  For 2 years, when the President said: Pass this bill right away, \nDemocrats did it. Here is what they got, despite all that: trillions in \ndebt and more than 1\\1/2\\ million fewer jobs. And that is after the \nPresident got everything he wanted for 2 whole years. We don't need any \nmore of that. We can't afford more of the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/18/senate-section/article/S6625-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise as the lead sponsor of the \nTeachers/First Responders Back to Work Act. I rise in favor of jobs, in \nfavor of teachers, in favor of police officers and firefighters, \nkeeping our communities safe, and the promise we made to first \nresponders after September 11.\n  We have a choice. I listened to the distinguished Republican leader, \nbut it is interesting how history can be viewed through different \nlenses. What I failed to hear were the challenges this President and \nthis country inherited from 8 years of policies that led us, in 2008, \nto the verge not of the great recession we had been referring to but on \nthe verge of a new depression, where the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve and the former Secretary of the Treasury, under President Bush, \ncame before Members of Congress and said: We have a series of financial \ninstitutions on the verge of collapse, and if they collapse, it will \ncreate systemic risk to the entire country's economy, and every \nAmerican will feel the consequences of that.\n  The result of that 8 years of largely unregulated process created \nexcesses where large entities made decisions that ultimately became the \ncollective responsibility of everybody in this country because a \nfailure to have met those responsibilities would have meant a collapse \nof this country.\n  Now, there are those in the Senate who are advocating we go back to \nthose very policies. They talk about stopping each and every \nregulation. Those regulations ultimately--the lack of it and the lack \nof enforcement of it is what gave us the excesses we had.\n\n  Additionally, we had the two wars abroad, which are totally unpaid \nfor, and fiscal responsibility went out the window there. Tax cuts were \ntotally unpaid for, and fiscal responsibility went out the window \nthere.\n  The culmination of all of that brought us to January of 2009, when \nthe new President took office and had already inherited millions of \njobs that had been lost prior to then. Around 7.5 percent unemployment \nwas the starting point already. In the first quarter of 2009, before he \ncould even do anything--he took the oath of office in late January, \nswore in a cabinet in February, and sent a plan up in March--another 2 \nmillion jobs were lost.\n  I find it interesting how we forget all of that, at least as a \nstarting point.\n  We have had 19 months of private sector growth--a little over 2 \nmillion jobs. That is good news. But where we have been shedding many \njobs is in the very essence of those in the public sector who teach our \nchildren, who prepare for the next generation and the competitive \nfuture of America, and who protect our communities--police officers, \nwho protect us from crime, and firefighters, who respond when there is \nan emergency in our communities.\n  With the Teachers and First Responders Back to Work Act, we can \nfulfill our duty to educate our children and keep our communities safe \nor we can gamble our future on the political games we have seen here \nthat disinvest in the future of our children and the safety of our \ncommunities.\n  Almost 300,000 education jobs are on the chopping block this year in \nthis country. At a time when other countries in the world are \nincreasing their educational workforce, we are in the process of \ndecreasing it. New Jersey, my home State, is facing a $10.5 billion \nshortfall in its 2012 budget. That means more cuts in State and local \nspending for education, and that hurts our children.\n\n[[Page S6626]]\n\n  The Teachers and First Responders Back to Work Act creates 400,000 \neducation jobs because an investment in our teachers is an investment \nin our children and in our collective future. We are talking about $30 \nbillion to States and local communities to retain, to hire, to rehire \nthe teachers who have already been separated, to educate tomorrow's \nentrepreneurs.\n  In my State of New Jersey, this bill would provide an additional $831 \nmillion in funds to support an additional 9,300 education jobs that \nlargely have been lost. New Jersey alone has lost over 6,000 teachers \nsince 2008, slowing our economic recovery and creating a huge knowledge \ngap in our schools. What does that gap translate into in terms of lost \nknowledge? What does it mean to a promising young scientist who needs \nsome guidance or a struggling student who needs a little extra help?\n  I know about the power of a teacher. I know it through my own \npersonal life. I have had several great teachers along the way, but one \nmade a huge difference in my life. I remember her name--Gail Harper, my \nspeech teacher in high school.\n  You know, I know some of my colleagues won't believe this, but I was \namong the most introverted persons at that time in my life. I didn't \neven want to take the speech course, but I was told by my guidance \ncounselors that it was a must. I was a good student, an honor student, \nbut I didn't want to take the speech course because I didn't want to do \nextemporaneous speaking, read assignments, or get up in front of the \nclass, any of that. I was forced to take it. I would prepare my work, \nbut I would not deliver it.\n  Finally, Gail Harper, the teacher, said to me--she kept me after \nclass, and she said: Robert, I don't know why you prepare yourself--\nyour preparation is great, but if you don't deliver this year, you will \nfail. My mother, who had fled a country to come to freedom, was \nconvinced that I would be the first in my family to go to college. She \ntold me that failure is not an option. When I heard Gail Harper talk \nabout failure, I knew that was not an option. She worked with me to \nnurture my abilities so that I could break out of that self-imposed \nshell and really transform my life. In some respects, that I am here \ntoday speaking on the Senate floor is because of Gail Harper. I fully \nunderstand how teachers can make a huge difference in the life of a \nyoung person.\n  We need to reinvest in teachers and education, in New Jersey's kids \nand in America's future. We need to get those 6,000 New Jersey teachers \nback in the classrooms and hire thousands more in every school in every \nState in America.\n  Then I turn to the police and firefighters, and I remember living in \nthe New Jersey-New York region on September 11 a little over a decade \nago. On that fateful day, it was not the Federal Government that \nresponded to the tragedies and the horror of the World Trade Center; it \nwas local police, local firefighters, local emergency management who \nwere the first responders, who risked their lives and gave their lives \non that fateful day.\n  We made a promise to every community that we would keep communities \nsafe in America in a post-September 11 world, that we would give cops \nand firefighters what they needed to do their jobs.\n  Every Member of Congress wanted to take a picture with a police \nofficer or a firefighter. We called them heroes. Now, Republicans want \nto zero out the COPS Program that puts police officers on the beat. \nThey want to break our promises after September 11, and I think it is \ntime to make good on it with the $5 billion our legislation provides so \ncommunities can hire and keep cops and firefighters on the job. They \nare our first line of defense. We learned that after September 11.\n  I don't care where one is on the political spectrum or what one \nbelieves the role of government is, we can all agree public safety and \nthe security of our communities is government's most fundamental \nresponsibility. We don't need police and firefighters just in the big \ncities--although they face some of the major challenges--we need them \nin every town and community.\n  Over 2,700 communities applied for help to fund 9,000 officers in the \nlast round for a total of $2 billion. But because of the opposition of \nthose on the Republican side to keeping our promise to first \nresponders, only $243 million was available, enough for only 238 of \n2,700 communities that applied. That is 9 percent, and it was capped at \n25 officers, no matter how big the city or how great the need.\n  In New Jersey, more than 150 communities applied for funding to keep \ncops on the job. Only 12 of those 150 were funded. Those 12 communities \nwere only able to hire approximately 78 cops over the course of the \nnext 3 years. Right now, in New Jersey, there are 705 police officers \nwho lost their jobs and can't find law enforcement work, 705 fewer \nsworn officers on the street, and there are 4,000 fewer officers in New \nJersey than there were on December 31, 2009. Public safety is \ngovernment's No. 1 responsibility, and it is time to deliver on that \npromise, after September 11, to our communities and our first \nresponders. This legislation includes $5 billion to help first \nresponders stay on the job, close the public safety gap, and keep our \ncommunities safe.\n  Let me conclude by saying, according to a CNN poll released just \nyesterday afternoon, 75 percent of Americans support providing funding \nto State and local governments to hire teachers and first responders, \nincluding 63 percent of Republicans.\n  We have a choice. With this legislation, we can fulfill our duty to \neducate our kids and keep our communities safe or we can gamble our \nfuture on political games that don't invest in our children, our \neconomy, and the safety of our communities. I think the choice is \nclear. I choose educating our kids. I choose protecting our \ncommunities. I choose investing in our future and we do this all and \npay for it at the same time.\n  This is the beginning of a fight, and we will be back again and again \nto force our friends on the other side to make the choice again and \nagain about whose side they are on. I think the choices are pretty \nclear. The American people have spoken. It is time to get our teachers \nand our first responders back to work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from New \nJersey for this amendment. It is an amendment that is critically \nimportant to New Jersey, to Alaska, and to the State of Illinois \nbecause the Menendez-Casey amendment in my State means that 14,500 \nteachers, firefighters, and policemen will stay on the job.\n  If the Menendez amendment--which is part of President Obama's jobs \npackage--does not pass, these people will be out of work. There will be \nmore kids in the classroom, talented teachers will be laid off, there \nwill be fewer cops on the beat in small towns and large, and \nfirefighters will have to cut back in terms of their ranks and we need \ntheir protection. We can't let that happen. Senator Menendez has an \namendment which deals with this responsibly. It pays for it. It doesn't \nadd to the deficit, and that is where the objection comes in from the \nRepublican side of the aisle because he pays for it by asking those \nmaking over $1 million a year to pay about one-half of 1 percent more \nin taxes, and the Republicans say: No way. We cannot ask the wealthiest \npeople in America to pay one penny more.\n  To me, it is hard to explain why we would want to deny our children a \nquality education, lay off teachers, make our streets a little less \nsafe with fewer police, and run the risk of fewer firefighters because \nwe don't want to ask people making over $1 million a year to pay one-\nhalf of 1 percent more on their taxes. People who are making over \n$20,000 a week, we are asking them to pay one-half of 1 percent to save \nthe jobs of teachers, firefighters, and police. It is interesting to \nme, because when President Bush offered his jobs bill years ago, with \npayroll tax cuts and cuts for businesses, these same Senators who are \ncriticizing President Obama's version of the bill were voting for it \nand it wasn't paid for. It was added directly to the deficit. These \ndeficit hawks were willing to vote for this with President Bush's name \non it but now oppose it with President Obama's name on it. Is there a \nmessage there? I think there is a clear message.\n  There are two things which drive the Republican caucus when it comes \nto this debate. First, protect those making over $1 million a year at \nany cost.\n\n[[Page S6627]]\n\nLet America languish in this recession, with 14 million people \nunemployed, rather than ask the wealthiest, most comfortable people in \nAmerica, to pay just a little bit more in taxes.\n  Secondly, they consistently oppose proposals to deal with this jobs \ncrisis if they are offered by the President of the United States. \nSenator McConnell said it earlier. It has been quoted over and over and \nover that his highest priority as the Republican leader in the Senate \nwas to make sure President Obama was a one-term President.\n  If we are driven only by that kind of motive, I assume it will make \nfor good political headlines, but it ties our hands in getting things \ndone. You see, in the Senate, it takes 60 votes to do anything \nsignificant and, unfortunately, 53 on this side of the aisle need the \nhelp of 7 on the other side and they haven't been forthcoming. Last \nweek, we offered the President's jobs bill and said to the Republicans: \nAt least let's proceed to the bill and offer amendments. We couldn't \nget a single Republican Senator to vote with us, not one. We had 51 \nvotes for it--two Democrats did not vote for it--but we had no \nRepublican support, none.\n  So what is the Republican jobs bill? What would they do to turn this \neconomy around and move us forward? Sadly, they have nothing to offer, \nnothing. Protect the incomes of the wealthiest people in America and \nsay no to everything President Obama suggests. That is not a recipe for \nmoving America forward.\n\n  I like to listen to their arguments about cutting redtape to create \njobs. I think to myself, do we have to eliminate the standards in this \ncountry for clean air and clean water in order to have a thriving \neconomy? If we went the Republican way of eliminating these protections \nfor America's families and children, would this be a better nation? I \nthink not. Basic protections when it comes to air pollution, for \nexample, mean an awful lot to a lot of Americans.\n  I make it a point of going to classrooms and asking the kids in the \nclassroom a question: How many of you in this classroom know someone \nwho has asthma? I just asked that question in Mount Sterling, IL, a \nrural community, one that you wouldn't believe would be dealing with \nair pollution problems or pulmonary issues. More than half the class \nraised their hand: Yes, they all knew someone--at least half of them \nknew someone who was dealing with asthma.\n  Every year, asthma is responsible for 9 million visits to health care \nprofessionals and more than 4,000 deaths in America. It is one of the \nleading causes of school absenteeism, accounts for 14 million missed \nschool days annually. The average family spends between 5.5 percent and \n14 percent of its total income on treating an asthmatic child.\n  So when the Republicans want to come forward and waive air pollution \nstandards, eliminate the protections we are trying to put in place, \nthey are endangering the health of people and children across America. \nThat is the reality. To argue that the only way to build the American \neconomy is by destroying public health standards to protect families \nand children is not the right answer. We have to find a balanced \napproach, one that takes into account the reality of science and the \nreality of business but certainly protects defenseless Americans from \nthe kinds of changes which some Republicans are suggesting.\n  Is this what it comes down to? Is this the only way to move the \nAmerican economy forward, to say we may have to compromise the purity \nof our drinking water when it comes to mercury and arsenic in order to \nhave the economy create jobs? What a terrible choice that is, and it is \na real choice. Take a look at the amendment offered by a Republican \nSenator on cement kilns. Cement kilns generate toxic chemicals that end \nup in air pollution and eventually are deposited on Earth, many times \nin bodies of water such as the Great Lakes. What do mercury and arsenic \ndo to the aquatic life in the Great Lakes and to the people who live \naround those Great Lakes? They compromise the safety of those great \nbodies of water.\n  There are some who say: It goes into the air; It surely isn't going \nto hurt you. Yet the statistics show the opposite. Poor air quality in \nthe most polluted U.S. cities can shorten the lives of residents up to \n2 years, on average. The American Cancer Society found that the risk of \nearly death is over 15 percent greater in areas with increased smog \npollution. Nearly two-thirds of those suffering from asthma live in an \narea where at least one Federal air quality standard is not being met. \nWe can't ignore this public health reality. We have an obligation to \nthe families who live in these cities, whether it is Chicago or \nSpringfield or any city across America, to make certain we don't \ncompromise basic air quality standards. That, frankly, is the only \nproposal we hear from the Republicans to create jobs. They want to \nprotect the incomes of the wealthiest people in America and lessen the \nstandards we use to protect innocent families from air pollution and \ndeterioration of water quality.\n  Before I got up to speak, the Chair showed me a headline from the \nWall Street Journal. It is a headline we need to remind the Republicans \nof when they get into this debate about jobs. Do you remember how many \ntimes they mocked the President of the United States because he stepped \nup and said: I will not allow the American automobile industry to die. \nI am going to step in, he said, and help General Motors and Chrysler \nthrough a very difficult time. Do you recall what we heard from the \nother side of the aisle? It is the wrong thing to do. Let General \nMotors go bankrupt, the Republicans said. Even former Governor Romney \nsaid the automobile bailout was a bad decision. Here is Governor \nRomney, from a family who had a lot to do with the automobile industry \nand ought to have known a little better about it.\n  The President of the United States said: It wasn't my ambition to \nstep in and intervene and help major automobile companies, but I am \ngoing to do it because hundreds of thousands of jobs are at stake. The \nreality is, the President's decision was the right decision. It was the \nright decision not just for Michigan--and Illinois, I might add--but \nfor the Nation. General Motors and Chrysler have now restructured. They \nhave a leaner workforce, a stronger inventory, and better products. The \nreport from the Wall Street Journal, which you showed me, shows that \nthe profitability of automobile companies when you look across the \nboard is now tipping in favor of American companies for American \nworkers.\n  There was also that story there that said, for the first time in a \nlong time, we are importing jobs from Asia and Mexico in the automobile \nindustry back to the United States of America.\n  Some Republican Senators can come to the floor and say President \nObama got it all wrong. Come on down to the Ford works, south of \nChicago, and take a look at those workers filing in every single day to \ngo to work.\n  Then go over to Belvedere, IL, to the Chrysler facility, and see \n1,200 people going to work with good-paying jobs. They are there \nbecause this President stepped up and said we are not going to let \nthese jobs go away. Many on the Republican side argued this was \nheretical and wrong. Explain that to the families who have these good-\npaying jobs, right here in America, with good benefits.\n  When I hear my Republican colleagues and friends come to the floor \nand criticize what President Obama has done in this economy, they had \nbetter stop and explain their early position opposing the President's \nefforts to make sure the automobile industry in America survives and \nthrives. Two hundred thousand workers today went to work for General \nMotors in America. If the Republicans had their way, GM would have gone \nbankrupt. Whether it would have survived bankruptcy no one knows. The \nPresident said we cannot run that risk. He kept the company in \nbusiness, restructured, and now it is profitable again. That is a fact.\n\n  I will say this too. When I hear the Republican leader come to the \nfloor and argue that the President should speak for all Americans, I \nask the Republican leader to take a look at the response of the \nAmerican people to the President's jobs package. When the President \nsays we should cut the payroll tax for working families who are \nstruggling paycheck to paycheck so they have money to get by, \noverwhelmingly the people support it. When the President says we should \nhelp small businesses hire the unemployed, particularly veterans, \noverwhelmingly the\n\n[[Page S6628]]\n\nAmerican people support it. When the President says we should make sure \nthat teachers and policemen and firefighters do not lose their jobs in \nthis tough economy, overwhelmingly the American people support it. When \nthe President says millionaires should pay a little bit more in their \ntaxes to make sure the American recovery is underway, overwhelmingly \nthe American people support that, too.\n  In fact, 56 percent of Republicans, when asked, say that is a \nreasonable way to pay for a jobs program. Unfortunately, none of those \n56 percent serve with the Republicans in the Senate who happen to \nbelieve their No. 1 task and goal is to protect the incomes of the \nwealthiest people in America.\n  We can do better. We need to make sure we move forward on a \nbipartisan basis to create jobs. This President inherited a very weak \neconomy. Under President Bush we had more than doubled the national \ndebt. When President Bush took office, our national debt was $5 \ntrillion. When he left office, it was over $10 trillion, two wars he \ndidn't pay for, programs he didn't pay for, and tax cuts for wealthy \npeople in the midst of a war--something no President had ever done. \nPresident Obama inherited that, and it has been a tough road, he will \ntell you, to get this economy back on track. Now he has a plan and the \nRepublicans offer nothing. They vote against the President--whatever he \nwants they are opposing--and they vote against common sense, which says \nhelping working families, helping small businesses, helping our \nveterans find jobs, and paying for it so it doesn't add to our deficit \nis a sensible approach to getting America back on the right track.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, put the \ncampaigning aside for a moment. Take a look at what it takes to create \njobs and bring your best ideas to the table. Let's sit down and put \ntogether a bipartisan bill. We will have the President's proposals as a \nstarting point. Bring your ideas too. Let's do something for this \ncountry on a bipartisan basis. I think that is why we were elected.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as always I listened with interest to my \nfriend and colleague from Illinois. I did not come to the floor with my \ncolleagues to discuss that particular issue, but it is interesting, the \njustification for the bailout of General Motors and Chrysler, when the \nfact is there are thousands of small businesses and companies all over \nAmerica that had to go into bankruptcy but did not get the bailout that \nwas favorable to the trade unions. Why couldn't General Motors have \ngone into bankruptcy the way every other company and corporation has \nhad to do in these hard economic times, restructured, and then gone \nback into business again?\n  Instead, this administration and my friend from Illinois seemed to \nfavor the trade unions who obviously got very favorable treatment \nrather than the normal bankruptcy procedures. Unlike the treatment the \nfavored trade unions and automobile corporations were able to get, \nthousands of small businesses and companies all over America were \nunable to get the benefit of their largesse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/18/senate-section/article/S6628-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRESIDENTIAL BUS TOUR\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I came to the floor this morning with my \ncolleagues to discuss the National Defense Authorization bill. Before I \ndo, I wish to mention there has been a lot of talk dominating certainly \npart of the talk radio and television about the bus tour the President \nis on. A lot of it is centered around the bus. I am not going to \ndiscuss that anymore except to say that in 2008 when I ran for \nPresident I didn't need a bus to be paid for and billed by the \ngovernment and the taxpayers of the United States. I understand that \nnow there has been another bus purchased for who ever the Republican \nnominees are. How do you justify that? The Republican nominee may not \nwant a bus.\n  The fact is, after having said that, the most important point here is \nthat the President is now, on the taxpayers' money, campaigning for 3 \ndays in North Carolina. It says in today's Washington Post ``On N.C. \nBus Tour, Obama In Full Campaign Mode.'' I say I have seen other \nPresidents, both Republican and Democrat, who have hedged and come \nright up to the edge, and sometimes crossed over it, charging the \ntaxpayers for what has been clearly campaign activities. But never do I \nbelieve any of us have seen the kind of activity the President is \nengaged in, and all of it being charged to the taxpayers of America. \nThat is wrong. That is the wrong thing to do.\n  According to recent reports, the President's campaign has raised \nrecord amounts of money already. The campaign should be paying for this \nNorth Carolina trip of his. I do not begrudge him beating up on us and \ncriticizing us and making all kinds of allegations about not \nunderstanding his stimulus 2 package, which we understand very well is \nmore of the same. But at least his campaign should be paying for this \nkind of campaigning.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with \nmy colleagues from Georgia, Senator Chambliss; from New Hampshire, \nSenator Ayotte; and the distinguished Republican leader, Senator \nMcConnell, for purposes of a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/18/senate-section/article/S6628-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6628-S6632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today we come to the floor to talk about \nthe importance of the Defense authorization bill. For 50 years the \nCongress of the United States has enacted a Defense authorization bill, \nenacted it into law and had it signed by the President of the United \nStates. There have been times when this legislation has been very \ncontentious--days during the Vietnam war, days during Operation Desert \nStorm, Operation Iraqi Freedom, Bosnia, Kosovo. All of those times the \nDefense authorization bill has been a vehicle for debate and votes on \nthe floor of the Senate concerning transcendent issues of national \nsecurity.\n  For 50 years we have cared for the men and women who have served and \nprovided them with the equipment, the pay, the benefits those men and \nwomen of this country deserve after hundreds of hours of deliberation, \nthousands of hours of written testimony and testimony before the \ncommittee--the full committee and subcommittees such as that under the \nchairmanship of the Senator from the State of Georgia.\n  Because of a part of the legislation, the majority leader has decided \nthat we will not take this bill to the floor of the Senate. That is a \nbetrayal of the men and women who are serving this Nation.\n  I understand there are differences on the issue of detainee \ntreatment. I understand it is an emotional issue. But should it be a \nreason for the Senate not to carry out its 50-year tradition to debate \nand discuss and amend and vote and then come out with a package that \nprovides for the needs, the training, the equipment, the benefits of \nthe men and women who are serving?\n  I quote from a letter from the distinguished majority leader to \nSenator Levin and to me, ``However, as you know, I do not intend to \nbring this bill to the floor until concerns regarding the bill's \ndetainee provisions are resolved.''\n\n  Is that the way the Senate works, that we do not bring bills to the \nfloor unless objectionable matters that are disagreed with by one side \nor the other are not resolved? I always believed the way these issues \nare resolved is through debates, through amendment, through votes, \nthrough allowing the American people also to see and hear our \ndeliberations, our discussions, and our debate.\n  Obviously the fiscal year has expired so this bill is obviously long \noverdue. Now we are in a position where apparently the majority leader \nwants to take up the President's jobs bill in parts, one by one, in \ncomplete disregard of the needs and requirements of the men and women \nwho are serving our national security.\n  Part of that bill also is the portion from the Intelligence \nCommittee. By the way, I note the presence of the Senator from South \nCarolina, who knows more about detainees than any Member of this body \nwithout question. He continuously travels to Iraq and Afghanistan, he \nhas visited the prisons. He understands the issues better than anyone. \nI would be willing to ask him how he feels about the detainee \nprovisions, after the Senator from Georgia makes\n\n[[Page S6629]]\n\na comment about the importance of the intelligence portion of the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. This is the ninth \nDefense authorization bill I have been involved in since I have been a \nMember of the Senate. I must say the refusal by the majority leader to \nbring this Defense authorization bill to the floor is truly \ndisheartening. It is critically important that we address the issues \nnot only of what is going on in Iraq and Afghanistan but the day-to-day \noperations of our military from the standpoint of pay raises, quality \nof life, purchase of weapons systems for future use--any number of \nissues that are included. The refusal of the majority leader to bring \nthis to the floor because of his objection to a very critical aspect of \nthis bill truly is disheartening.\n  During committee consideration of the bill, the committee considered \nand adopted, by a vote of 25 to 1, a comprehensive bipartisan provision \nrelating to detainees. We have no detainee policy in this country \ntoday. If we had captured bin Laden, what would we have done with him? \nIf we had captured Anwar al-Awlaki, what would we have done with him? \nCertainly we could have gained actionable intelligence from either one \nof those individuals, but we have no detainee policy in this country \ntoday. We have nowhere to take them, where we can hold these \nindividuals and ensure that they do not get lawyered up quickly and \nthat we are unable to get the type of information we need to get from \nindividuals such as that.\n  Over the past several years there has been an ongoing debate about \nthe importance of being able to fully and lawfully interrogate \nsuspected terrorists. One thing is clear after all these years: that \nour Nation still lacks this clear and effective policy. This bipartisan \ndetainee compromise goes a long way toward ensuring we can get timely \nand actionable intelligence from newly captured detainees connected to \nal-Qaida and other terrorist organizations. The compromise also \nprovides for a permanent process for transferring Guantanamo detainees \nto other countries. We are in the midst right now of a review within \nthe Intelligence Committee of the thought process that went into the \ntransferring of detainees by both the Bush administration and the \ncurrent administration. I will tell you that there are real flaws in \nthat policy. Those flaws have resulted, according to the DNI--General \nClapper--of a recidivism rate of Guantanamo detainees of 27 percent. \nThat means 27 percent of the individuals we have released from \nGuantanamo and sent to other countries that have been willing to take \nthem under various agreements--27 percent of them have returned to the \nbattlefield and are killing or are seeking to kill Americans. The \npolicy not only about detainees but policies with regard to what we do \nwith Guantanamo detainees is extremely important.\n  There were a number of us who were involved in the amendments that \nwent into the authorization bill in committee. Senator Graham from \nSouth Carolina was. Senator Ayotte from New Hampshire was integrally \ninvolved. Let me turn to Senator Ayotte and, from the perspective of \nthe people of New Hampshire, ask: Where does the Senator think we are \nwith respect to a detainee policy in this country today?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank Senator Chambliss. I would say this. The Senator \nhighlighted the importance, No. 1, as did Senator McCain, of passing \nDefense authorization. I have been to the floor twice on this issue \nbecause I think it is so important for our country, the notion that it \nhas been half a century since the last time we failed to pass this \nauthorization. What is at stake for our troops and the message it sends \nto them? We are in two wars. There are threats that face our country \nand our military men and women every day. We owe it to them that they \nknow we are going to pass this authorization to address issues such as \npay increases and weapons that they need and all of the fundamental \nday-to-day issues to make sure they know we are behind them.\n\n  I would summarize the issue of the detainee policy of this country \nover the past few months in the Armed Services Committee as military \nleader after military leader has come before our committee and we have \nasked them about this issue, about how we treat detainees. I questioned \nGEN Carter Ham, commander of the Africa command, about what we would do \nif we captured a member of al-Qaida in Africa. Do you know what he \nsaid? He said he would need lawyerly help to answer that one. Is that \nwhat we have come to, our commanders need lawyerly help in order to \nknow how to deal with captured terrorists and how to treat them within \nour system to make sure we have a secure place to gather intelligence \nfrom them and to ensure that the American people and our allies are \nprotected?\n  The majority leader is holding up the entire authorization bill with \nthis detainee compromise, which was an overwhelmingly bipartisan \ncompromise. This provision in the committee was voted 25 to 1 in \nsupport of this because there is such a need to address how we treat \ndetainees. As Senator Chambliss already highlighted, we have a 27-\npercent recidivism rate from those who have been released from \nGuantanamo. Here are a couple of examples of what those individuals are \ndoing right now against us, our troops, and our allies. For example, \nthe No. 2 in al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula was someone we released \nfrom Guantanamo.\n  Another top commander of the Taliban in the Quetta Shura who is out \nplanning attacks against us is someone we released from Guantanamo. \nThat is why this issue cries out for a detention policy for our \ncountry. This is a very important issue to be brought to the floor \nalong with the entire authorization.\n  I see my colleague from South Carolina here, Senator Graham, who I \nknow has worked very closely on these detention issues as a JAG \nattorney and is someone who visited Afghanistan in August.\n  First, I would ask, during his time in the Senate, has he seen the \nSenate act like this with the Defense authorization? Second, how \nimportant does the Senator think it is we address this detainee issue?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for the enormous \ncontribution she has made in putting together this legislation. I wish \nboth her and my friend from South Carolina to address this.\n  In the letter sent to Senator Levin and me to address this issue, \nSenator Reid, the majority leader, as the rationale for not bringing \nthe bill to the floor, says: I do not intend to bring this bill to the \nfloor until concerns regarding the bill's detainee provisions are \nresolved.\n  It goes on and on and then he says: As Deputy National Security \nAdviser John Brennan stated in a recent speech--he said in summary, \nthis approach, talking about the approach that we have taken in the \nbill--I believe the vote was 25 to 1. He said: This approach would \nimpose unprecedented restrictions on the ability of experienced \nprofessionals to combat terrorism, injecting legal and operational \nuncertainty into what is already enormously complicated work.\n  I wonder, does Mr. Brennan understand what is in the legislation?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator from Arizona and all of my colleagues \nworking on what is a very difficult subject matter. When 25 to 1 is the \noutcome, that is pretty good. I like Senator Reid. This goes back to \nthe White House. This is President Obama's team. This is not Harry \nReid. This is not the Senate holding up this bill, it is the White \nHouse holding up this bill. They have an irrational view of what we \nneed to be doing with detainees. They have lost the argument--and I \ntried to help--to close Guantanamo Bay. It is not going to close. We \nare not going to move those prisoners inside the United States. The \nCongress has said no. The American people have said no.\n  The reason they lost that argument is after working with the White \nHouse for about a year and a half to try to find a national security \ncentric detainee policy that would assure the American people we are \nnot going to let these people roam around the world and treat them as \ncommon criminals, they could never pull the trigger on the hard stuff. \nWe are here because the White House cannot tell the ACLU no. There are \n48 people at Guantanamo Bay being held under the law of war, who will \nnever see a courtroom, military or civilian courtroom, and that is part \nof military law. You don't have to let an enemy prisoner go. Most enemy \nprisoners are never prosecuted. They are held at Guantanamo Bay under \nthe\n\n[[Page S6630]]\n\nlaw of war. An Executive order issued by the Obama administration gives \nthem an annual review. We have been trying to work with the Obama \nadministration to deal with every class of detainee we may run into in \nthis war that will go well beyond my lifetime. The reason Mr. Brennan \nobjects is because there was a decision made by the Congress to say if \na detainee is captured and interrogated by the high-value interrogation \nteam--which I like, which is an interagency combination of the CIA, \nFBI, military, and other law enforcement agencies to make sure we get \nthe best intelligence possible, that we create a presumption for \nmilitary custody.\n  The reason we are doing that is because the Obama administration has \nbeen hell bent on criminalizing this war. Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the \nmastermind of 9/11, had charges against him in military commissions \nduring the Bush administration, and he was ready to go to trial, \nliterally ready to plead guilty. The Obama administration withdrew \nthose charges and was going to put him in New York City, giving Khalid \nShaikh Mohammed the same constitutional rights as an American citizen, \nthen take that show on the road from Guantanamo Bay and have a trial in \nthe heart of New York City that would cost $300 million alone in \nsecurity. That blew up in their face. They don't get it. Most Americans \ndon't see these people as some guy who stole a car or robbed a liquor \nstore. Most Americans see detainees who were captured on the \nbattlefield as a genuine threat to this country.\n  I applaud the Obama administration for taking the fight to the \nterrorists and going after bin Laden, for using Predator drones on the \nbattlefield throughout Pakistan and Afghanistan. What I have fought \nwith them over is we have no way of capturing someone and acquiring \ngood intelligence because you have locked down the system. This \ndetainee legislation we have before the Senate will allow a way to \ngo forward.\n\n  What happens if you capture someone tomorrow? Where do we put them? \nWhat jail do we have, as a nation, to put a captured terrorist in? We \ndon't have a jail because they will not use Guantanamo Bay. They \ncaptured a terrorist and put him on a ship for 60 days. The Navy is not \nin the detention business. We don't build ships to make them jails. We \nbuild ships to fight wars. This aversion to using Guantanamo Bay is \ngoing to bite us as a nation.\n  This legislation allows us to move forward. If you capture someone, \nyou can gather good intelligence. There is a presumption that they will \nbe held as an enemy combatant, but there is a waiver provision. What I \ndon't want to do is read rights to everybody we capture in the United \nStates as part of a terrorist organization's plot. We are not fighting \na crime, we are fighting a war. Under the rules of war, you can hold an \nenemy combatant and interrogate them as long as necessary to find out \nwhat the enemy is up to. That is what this legislation does.\n  To my colleagues, you have written a very balanced approach. This \nidea of never using Guantanamo Bay again is dangerous. The idea that \nthe CIA cannot interrogate enemy prisoners as a policy is dangerous. By \nExecutive order the President of the United States, President Obama, \nwithin a week of taking office, took off the table an enhanced \ninterrogation technique under the Detainee Treatment Act that was \nclassified, that was not waterboarding within our values, but \ntechniques available to our intelligence community, which Senator \nChambliss oversees, that would allow them over time to acquire good \nintelligence.\n  One of the reasons we killed bin Laden is because of the intelligence \npicture we acquired over 10 years. This President, within a week, said \nby Executive order the only interrogation tool available to the United \nStates of America is the Army Field Manual, which is online. You can \nread it yourself.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Can I ask my colleague--it is a fact, as the Senator from \nNew Hampshire pointed out, that 27 percent of the detainees who have \nbeen released from Guantanamo Bay have returned to the fight. Not only \nhave they returned to the fight, the fact that they were in Guantanamo \ngives them an automatic kind of charisma and aura and leadership in al-\nQaida and other terrorist organizations. Does the Senator think the \nAmerican people find that acceptable, that one out of every four we \nhave released from Guantanamo Bay has reentered the fight and clearly \nis responsible for the deaths of at least some of the brave young \nAmericans and may be responsible for the deaths of Americans in the \nfuture?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Not only are most Americans upset about that but they \nworry about what comes down the road. That is what I am worried about. \nThe Senate legislation is trying to create a pathway forward for the \nfuture. What do you do with these people we have in Guantanamo Bay who \nmay never go on trial? What do you do with these people at Guantanamo \nBay who come from countries where, if you return them to that country, \nthey would be back in the fight by the end of the day?\n  Mr. McCAIN. As has happened in Yemen.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. We have a bipartisan proposal that will allow us as a \nnation to make rational decisions about detention, and the White House \nis holding it up. There are provisions in this bill that affect the \nday-to-day lives of the men and women in our military. The White House \nis saying detainee policy driven by the ACLU is more important to them \nthan a bill that would allow the CIA the authorization they need to \nfight this war that would provide wounded warriors assistance at a time \nwhen wounded warriors need it the most. You talk about a perverse view \nof things, you talk about having it wrong in terms of what is most \nimportant, allowing the detainee issue to deny the CIA the \nauthorization they need to protect us all is dangerous. To put the \nneeds of the men and women in uniform in terms of their health care, \ntheir pay, their ability to take care of their families secondary to \ndetainee policies that make no sense and is driven by the far left of \nthis country is what this debate is about.\n  To the White House, we are not going to change this bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Am I correct, I would say to my friends from South \nCarolina and New Hampshire and Arizona, that because of the \nadministration's opposition to a detainee treatment provision that was, \nI gather, approved overwhelmingly in the Armed Services Committee, we \nwill for the first time deny everybody in the Senate an opportunity to \noffer any amendments on any subject with the DOD authorization bill \nand, in fact, will not consider it on the floor of the Senate for the \nfirst time in four decades?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The minority leader is absolutely right. I would add to \nmy good friend from Kentucky, it is even more. It is not just about us. \nWhat we are denying General Petraeus, the new CIA Director, is new \nauthorization language that he needs to fight the war. What we are \ndenying men and women in uniform is pay raises, health care benefits \nthey desperately need because of the detention policy driven by, I \nthink, the most liberal people in this country, and 25 out of 26 \nSenators blessed this package.\n  Senator McConnell is absolutely right. Not only does the Senate not \nhave a say on what would be the way forward for our detainees, the men \nand women in uniform, the CIA operatives taking the fight to the enemy \ndo not have the tools they need because of one area of this \nlegislation. It would be a national tragedy if we could not pass this \nbill, which is sound to its core in all areas, because the ACLU doesn't \nlike what we have done on detention.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. If the minority leader would yield for a question, as \nthe Senator well knows, the intelligence community depends upon the \nDefense authorization bill for the authorization to operate in the \nintelligence community. Whether it is the budget or policy, all of that \nis compromised in the majority leader's refusal to bring this bill to \nthe floor. Without the authorities in the respective intelligence bills \nthat are passed by the House and the Senate, then our Intelligence \nCommittee is handicapped and hamstrung in policies that are needed as \nwe move forward in this ever-changing war on terrorism.\n\n  I would ask the Senator from Kentucky if he has ever, in his long \nexperience in the Senate, seen any bill of this\n\n[[Page S6631]]\n\nnature held up and not allowed to come to the floor because of any \nsingle Senator's refusal to accept the provisions that are in the bill \nby an overwhelming vote such as this?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am not sure who has the floor, but I \nwould say, in response to my friend from Georgia----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, we have unanimous \nconsent for a colloquy.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. There may have been examples, but I am hard pressed to \nthink of one recently. The tradition of passing the Defense \nauthorization bill is there for a good reason. The national defense of \nthe United States is the most important thing the Federal Government \ndoes. The committee upon which the Senator from Georgia and the Senator \nfrom Arizona and the Senator from New Hampshire serve is expert on this \nmatter, and I find this truly astonishing.\n  It is consistent, however, I must say with the pattern around here in \nrecent times: no amendments, fill up the tree, deny the majority and \nthe minority--in this case, both the majority and the minority--the \nopportunity to have any input on a piece of legislation that determines \nwhat we do on the Federal Government's most important responsibility.\n  I think this is another example of the way the Senate has \ndeteriorated into operating like the House, and it is an extremely bad \ndirection for this institution and for the American people.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I wish to add as well, this detainee compromise, as \nSenator McCain and I have talked about before, is actually for--the \ngroup of individuals we are talking about here--having military custody \nfor members of al-Qaida or affiliated groups who are planning an attack \nagainst the United States or its coalition partners. You think about \nthat category of individuals. The most dangerous category of \nindividuals we have to address is why we came to the compromise in \ncommittee, that the default would be military custody for those \nindividuals, and it is inconsistent with the administration's position.\n  If you think about it, they are, rightly so--and I agree with them--\nundertaking taking out members of al-Qaida around the world who fall \nunder that category, who are out there killing Americans and plotting \nagainst Americans and our allies. Yet they are objecting to a \nprovision, a detainee provision, that would give guidance to our \nmilitary and intelligence leaders that those individuals should be \ntreated, in the first instance, with military custody. It seems to me \nto be very inconsistent with what they have been doing in other \ncontexts, and, obviously, this is a category of individuals who, on a \nbipartisan basis, we agreed in committee was the most dangerous \ncategory of individuals, who should be held in the first instance in \nmilitary custody.\n  I want to add that Mr. Brennan, whom the majority leader has cited on \nbehalf of the administration as objecting to this provision, does not \nseem to--in his speech at Harvard that he gave recently--appreciate who \nthis provision applies to and that there is actually a national \nsecurity waiver in the provision. So I would ask the administration and \nMr. Brennan, again, to read the provisions that were passed on a \nbipartisan basis by the committee because this is such a key issue to \nmove forward to give guidance to our military. But I am concerned that \nthe administration's objections to this are misguided and they have not \nread the actual legislation on which we are working.\n  It is my hope, as our leader, the minority leader, has said, that we \nwill move forward with passing the critical pieces for our troops \nbecause our troops deserve nothing less than for us to bring this \nforward to the floor because of the pay raises, the weapons systems \nthey deserve to have, everything that is in that bill. But, also, I \nwould ask the administration to revisit its position because it seems \ninconsistent with its own policies, and they do not seem to have \nactually read the compromise that was overwhelmingly passed out of the \nArmed Services Committee.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  I know we have addressed this issue in some depth, but I would remind \nmy colleagues, this is the Defense authorization bill. This is the \nproduct of thousands of hours of work, of staff work, hundreds of hours \nof testimony and hearings, a week-long markup of the full committee \nputting this package together. The thoughts, the ideas, the \nrecommendations of the administration, and people in and out of the \nadministration, the knowledge and expertise of thousands of individuals \ngo into this most important piece of legislation.\n  For 50 years it has been taken up, debated, amended, passed, and \nsigned into law by the President of the United States. Now, because of \none small provision of this bill, the majority leader of the Senate, at \nthe behest of the White House, has decided we will not take up the \nDefense authorization bill for the first time in 50 years.\n  I think the distinguished Republican leader and I, who have been \naround here for quite a while, have seen this process now deteriorate \nto the point where we now cannot debate, amend, and pass legislation \nthat is so vital to our Nation's security and the men and women who \ntake part in preserving it. This is kind of a sad day for this Member.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Finally, I would ask both the Senator from Arizona, \nwho has been our leader on national defense issues, and the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire: Is the basis of this that the administration wants \nto establish the precedent that they can capture enemy noncombatants \nanywhere in the world and send them straight into the United States \ninto an article 3 court? Is that the crux of this, I would ask my \nfriends?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I would say to our distinguished Republican leader, I \nthink that is what is at the heart of this, that they want to treat \nthese individuals in the context of our civilian court system; \notherwise, why would you object to a provision on military custody for \nthose who are members of al-Qaida who are planning an attack against \nthe United States or have attacked the United States? Also, I would \npoint out, there is a national security waiver in this provision. So \nthe only thing I can take from it is that they do want to treat this \nwar as people who are at war with us as civilians as opposed to who \nthey are--enemies of our country.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Could I ask the Senator from New Hampshire, a former \nattorney general, a further question?\n  Does this not lead, inevitably, in the further direction of a mindset \nthat would say, on the battlefield, if you capture an enemy combatant--\nand that enemy combatant is, inevitably, on the way to an article 3 \ncourt--could it lead to the feeling that that enemy combatant should be \nread his Miranda rights on the battlefield, if he is viewed as an \nindividual who is on the way to a U.S. court under U.S. law? Where does \nit end, I ask my friend from New Hampshire?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I would say that is an absolute concern here because this \nwould be the first war in the history of our country where we would be \ngiving those we capture on the battlefield the rights to our civilian \ncourt system. Where do we draw the line? It would be outrageous to \nrequire members of our military and intelligence officials to \nimmediately ask: Do I have to give Miranda rights? Do I have to worry \nabout some of the speedy trial and presentment issues that come from a \ncivilian court system?\n  That is why, in the guidance of the committee, on a bipartisan basis, \nfor this category of individuals, the presumption should be military \ncustody because these are individuals who are enemy combatants with \nwhom we are at war. That is fundamentally what is at issue. It does \nseem inconsistent--with what the administration is doing in terms of \nrightly going after these individuals around the world, and killing \nthem in certain instances--that we would not provide them with military \ncustody in the first instance.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I also point out to my friends and my colleagues \nthat, as is the case quite often, even though the vote was 25 to 1 on \nthis provision in the Senate Armed Services Committee, we did provide, \nat the request of the administration, a waiver for national security. \nSo we included a waiver that says:\n\n       The Secretary of Defense may, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, \n     waive the requirement of paragraph (1)--\n\n\n[[Page S6632]]\n\n\n  That is the detainee issue--\n\n     if the Secretary submits to Congress a certification in \n     writing that such a waiver is in the national security \n     interests of the United States.\n\n  So there is a national security waiver. We have given the President \nof the United States a way that he could waive every provision of this \nlegislation--something I was not particularly happy about, but in the \nspirit of compromise, we gave a waiver.\n  Could I say, also, I am sure--I see the majority leader on the \nfloor--yes, there have been contentious times. There was contention \nlast year about the don't ask, don't tell act. The year before, there \nwas contention about the fact that they added the hate crimes bill, \nwhich had nothing to do with national security, onto the bill. But at \nleast we ought to go ahead and take up and debate and amend and have \nthe Senate act, as the American people expect us to; that is, \nconsideration, voting, and the President, if it is that objectionable, \nobviously, could veto the bill.\n  But to say, because of these few pages--these pages right here of the \nbill--that, therefore, we will not even take up the bill, for the first \ntime in 50 years, in my view, is a great disservice to the men and \nwomen who are serving.\n  I thank my friends, the Senator from New Hampshire and the minority \nleader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/18/senate-section/article/S6632-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6632-S6633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              OBSTRUCTION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have had several very good conversations \nwith Senator McCain and Senator Levin about the provisions they have \nspent a lot of time on this morning. Discussions have been very \npositive. And, hopefully, these concerns can be resolved. Of course, if \nthey cannot be, the only way to resolve them would be here on the \nSenate floor. I hope in the next several days we can work something out \non this somewhat difficult provision that is in the bill reported out \nof the committee.\n  First of all, let me say to my friends who came and spoke on the \nfloor today, I understand their concern about the defense of this \ncountry. Anytime John McCain comes to the floor or comes anyplace in \nthe world and talks about anything dealing with the security of this \ncountry, everyone should listen. He is a man we all know, we respect, \nand hold in the highest regard, not only because of his legislative \nskills--he has been a Presidential nominee--but the fact is, he is a \ncertified American military hero. So I want everyone to understand that \nI have no problem at all with Senator McCain coming to the floor \ntalking about something he knows a lot about.\n  But I do want to remind everyone that we are now in the 10th month of \nthis Congress and we have been blocked, obstructed, prevented, and held \nup from moving legislation for 10 months. We have wasted months and \nmonths because of obstructionism, threats to shut down the government.\n  Think back a little while on trying to get the government funded \nuntil the 1st of October. I do not know at this stage how many votes we \nhad but at least a half dozen extending the government for a week, a \nfew days, with the threat of the government shutting down with every \none of those extensions of the continuing resolution.\n  Then we moved to a new stage in the history of our great country; \nthat is, extending the debt ceiling. Times in the past it has been done \nroutinely--hundreds of times--18 times during the Reagan \nadministration. But, no, we took months to do it for President Obama. \nAnd that has prevented us from doing a lot of the routine work we need \nto do here, including the Defense authorization bill. These items used \nto be routine under Democratic and Republican Presidents. But in this \nCongress, Republicans have turned even routine matters into crises.\n  Since the beginning of the year, they have blocked jobs bills using \nobstructionist tactics. They have filibustered everything by amendment. \nRemember the small business innovation bill--a bill I like to talk \nabout because it has been one of the best things that has happened to \nthis country. Small business entrepreneurs, people who had ideas on how \nto improve the economy did good things with these small grants they \ngot. My favorite, of course, is the electric toothbrush, but there were \nother things that have been done. But that bill traditionally has been \nhandled with minimal controversy--in fact, no controversy--always \npasses unanimously with help from both sides. Republicans amended this \nlittle piece of legislation--so good for our country in creating jobs--\nto death. The process took nearly 2 months. There was the Economic \nDevelopment Revitalization Act, something that started during the time \nRichard Nixon was President. We did this routinely, most every time by \nunanimous consent. A bill that creates lots and lots of jobs, \nemployment for our country--the Republican Senators blocked this bill, \ndragging out the process for months. Their obstructionism has cost this \ncountry millions of jobs, including 2 million that would have been \ncreated by the American Jobs Act.\n\n  Suddenly they are calling for a return to regular order. Well, after \n10 months of dragging out the most routine matters, preventing the \nnormal order of business here in the Senate, suddenly they are calling \nfor us to move quickly on the Defense authorization bill, something \nthat should have been done some time ago. They are threatening to shut \ndown the government if they do not get their way. We have coming up, in \nless than a month, another threat by the Republicans to shut down the \ngovernment. That seems to be the mantra: If we do not get what we want, \nwe will close the government.\n  The continuing resolution expires on November 18, right before \nThanksgiving. My colleagues are right about the Defense Authorization \nAct--absolutely right. We need to do this. We have always done it, and \nwe are going to do it this year. As I said to Senator McCain on a \nnumber of occasions, and Senator Levin, I am eager to find a path to \nget this done.\n  My colleagues have said several times that they believe these \nprovisions ought to be considered in regular order and that the Senate \nought to proceed to debate them. As I indicated a few minutes ago, if \nthat is the only avenue we have, then that is what we will do.\n  The Defense authorization bill is going to get done this year. But we \nhave been held up for 10 months in doing the ordinary process this \ngovernment is required to do.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the majority leader, since I have listened to \nthe colloquy by my Republican colleagues just a few minutes ago, and it \nrelated to the detainee policy, which is one of the controversial \nissues in the Defense authorization bill, I am sure he is aware of the \nfact that last week in Detroit, in an article III Federal court, an \naccused terrorist--the so-called Underwear Bomber--pled guilty to \nterrorism, having gone through the regular criminal process in article \nIII courts, having been interrogated by the FBI, and even after Miranda \nwarnings, surrendering very valuable information and intelligence to \nprotect the United States.\n  Is it not true that when we look at the record about detainees or \nthose accused of terrorism being tried, we find that since 9/11, over \n200 of them have been successfully tried in article III courts under \nPresident Bush and President Obama and that under military commissions, \nexactly 4, 4 terrorists have been tried; and that the argument on the \nother side, which is that the article III courts are incapable of \nprotecting the United States and successfully prosecuting terrorists, \nabsolutely flies in the face of the facts: 200 terrorists convicted in \narticle III courts, 4 by military tribunals. You would think it was \nexactly the opposite, from the arguments made on the floor by my friend \nfrom Arizona and others.\n  I would ask the Senator from Nevada, our majority leader, are we not \ntrying to give to any President--this President and any President--the \ntools and the decisionmaking necessary to protect our Nation, to pick \nthe best place to investigate and to prosecute those who are accused of \nterrorism?\n  Mr. REID. In response to my friend's question, he is absolutely \nright. Remember, this is not an Obama-driven\n\n[[Page S6633]]\n\nprogram. It started during the George Bush era. Why? Because George \nBush was President of the United States on 9/11, and he recognized the \nimportance of doing this in a fashion that would maintain the civility \nof our criminal justice system.\n  I say to my friend, I want to make sure--I will repeat what I said \nearlier. No one is saying we are not going to do the Defense \nauthorization bill. We are going to do that. But we are really, because \nof being jammed, as I have tried to outline here to the entire country, \nand being unable to get our work done here these last 10 months, we are \ntrying to find time to do lots of things. That is why we have come up \nwith this unique way of moving appropriations bills. We are doing them \ntogether--three at a time rather than one at a time--in an effort to do \nwhat I have been asked to do by the Speaker of the House: Do what you \ncan to get these appropriations bills done. Senator McConnell suggested \nsomething. We are doing our very best, but we have been held up from \ndoing the ordinary business. I gave two examples that were about as \ngood as you could give of our trying to do things to create jobs in \nAmerica today. We have been stymied from doing that.\n  So I say to everyone here that I am really somewhat at a loss for \nwords, for an organization here--the Republican caucus has done \neverything they can these past 10 months to stop us from moving \nforward. Remember, the No. 1 goal of my friend the Republican leader--\nand I admire his honesty--he said his No. 1 goal was and has been to \ndefeat President Obama. As a result of that, we have not been able to \ndo the government's business, because everything they can do to slow \ndown government is something they believe will help them a year from \nnow.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for one more question?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is it not true that the majority leader came to the floor \non the pending legislation, the appropriations bills, and invited \nMembers on both sides to bring their amendments to the floor, call \ntheir amendments for a vote, that some 10 or 11 or more amendments have \nbeen filed, and we are still waiting for that? Is it not true that we \nare giving this opportunity to our colleagues to offer their amendments \nand to call their amendments, and that is a way for those who are \nlooking for their opportunity on the floor to express their point of \nview and get a vote?\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate very much the Senator from Illinois reminding \nme what took place at the beginning of this Congress.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Would the Senator yield for a comment?\n  Mr. REID. As soon as I answer my friend's question.\n  I am reminded of what took place at the beginning of this year. We \nhad a number of new Senators--relatively new Senators--who joined with \nsome of the more experienced Senators who wanted to change the way the \nsaw our having done business in the last Congress.\n\n  I joined with my friend the Republican leader and said: Let's back \noff a little bit.\n  The Republican leader said: We are going to be very discrete in what \nwe do with the motions to proceed, to allow us to get on legislation.\n  I said: Fine. If that is the case, we will make sure we have the \nopportunity to offer amendments.\n  That has broken down big time, I say to my friend, because it is a \nrare day here that we have been able to move to a piece of legislation \nwithout having to go through the process of filing cloture on just the \nability to get on a bill. And we have had open amendments, as we did on \nthe small business innovation bill. Guess what happened. It was amended \nto death. So after 2 months--after 2 months--we gave up. We could not \ndo that bill as had been done routinely in the past.\n  So I say to my friend, we are going to try it again. We have these \nappropriations bills. We are going to try to get it done. We are \nwaiting for people to offer amendments, and we are going to try to move \nthrough this and get it done. We are going to do the appropriations \nbills this week. We have other things we need to do. It is an important \ntime in the history of our country to show the American people we can \nwork together. I hope that, in fact, is the case because based on my \nexperience from the beginning of this Congress, where there was \nsupposed to be a good-faith effort to return to regular order, it has \nnot happened.\n  I would be happy to yield to my friend for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I want to say to the majority leader, whom I have known \nand been friends with for many years, I thank him for his kind remarks. \nI am very appreciative of his commitment to bringing the Defense \nauthorization bill to the floor. I thank the majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/18/senate-section/article/S6633-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 775\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Yesterday, I introduced my amendment to the pending \nCommerce-Justice appropriations bill, and I would like to briefly \nexplain this amendment for my colleagues.\n  This amendment is designed to basically cut off any future funds that \nmight be made available under this appropriations bill to fund the \nDepartment of Justice's program now notoriously known as Fast and \nFurious. This would prohibit the taxpayer funding of operations where \nFederal law enforcement personnel knowingly cause the transfer of \nfirearms to drug cartel agents and intentionally fail to monitor those \nweapons.\n  On December 14, 2010, U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was gunned \ndown on the southern border while attempting to apprehend members of a \npredatory criminal gang that operated in Arizona's Peck Canyon. A \ncongressional investigation and several news reports have confirmed \nthat some of the guns used in that attack actually came from gun \ndealers in the United States, and the guns were actually put in the \nhands of the agents of the cartels and allowed to cross the border with \nthe full knowledge of officials associated with the U.S. Government, \nmost notably the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and the U.S. \nAttorney's Office in Arizona, although it is unknown at this point how \nfar up in the chain of command knowledge of this program went. But that \nis another story for another time.\n  The American people and their representatives in Congress have begun \nasking, after the death of Brian Terry, what happened under this Fast \nand Furious Program and who will be held accountable. Answers to those \nquestions have been very slow in coming, and some have been \ncontradictory. But the more questions that were raised, the more \nquestions came up.\n  One question is, of course, who authorized Fast and Furious and why? \nAccording to congressional investigations led on this side of the \nCapitol by Senator Grassley and on the other side of the Capitol by \nCongressman Darrell Issa, this Fast and Furious Program began in 2009 \nin the Phoenix field office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and \nFirearms, under the direct supervision of the U.S. attorney for the \nDistrict of Arizona, and instructed Phoenix-area firearms dealers to go \nthrough with sales of nearly 2,000 weapons to persons suspected of \nworking as straw purchasers on behalf of Mexican drug cartels. The \nlogical question is, Why in the world would such a misguided program be \ninitiated and who would be held accountable?\n  Another question is, Who objected to Fast and Furious, and why were \nthose objections not taken seriously? Congressional investigations have \nfound that many firearms dealers actually contacted the ATF and \nexpressed their concerns about who was buying these guns and in whose \nhands they might end up. Multiple ATF agents have testified that they \nopenly protested their orders to actually let these guns walk across \nthe border into the hands of the cartels when they were told to break \noff surveillance of those illegally purchased weapons, because they \nsuspected what eventually did happen: that no good would come of Fast \nand Furious.\n  Brian Terry lost his life as a result of this misguided program.\n  Weapons from the Fast and Furious Program have shown up at about 11 \ndifferent crime scenes in the United States. So the questions I have \nrelate to why weren't the voices of the people in the field who first \nraised objections or concerns about this program heard?\n  Another question my constituents in Texas have been asking is: Have \nsimilar gun-walking practices occurred in our State?\n  According to published reports, Houston-based firearms dealer \nCarter's Country revealed that its store clerks had been ordered to go \nthrough with a sale of weapons to suspicious persons who may have been \nworking as ``straw purchasers'' from Mexican drug cartels. Some of the \nweapons purchased from Carter's Country have been recovered at the \nscene of violent crimes in Mexico.\n  Senator Grassley's investigations have also revealed a possible Texas \nconnection to the February murder of U.S. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement officer Jaime Zapata in Mexico. One of the weapons used to \nmurder Officer Zapata was purchased in Texas in October 2010 and \nsubsequently trafficked to Mexico through Loredo, TX. While the \nsuspected weapons traffickers have been arrested, there are reports \nthat ATF was aware of these activities and allowed them to continue for \nfar too long.\n  Another question is being asked by our friends across the border, the \nGovernment of Mexico, those who are fighting these cartels and many of \nwhom over the years have lost their lives. Our friends in Mexico are \nasking: Why is the administration allowing guns to come into Mexico as \npart of U.S. Government policy? Why is the U.S. Government arming drug \ncartels?\n  According to a report in the Los Angeles Times, one of the victims of \nFast and Furious was a brother of Patricia Gonzalez, who at the time \nwas a top State prosecutor in Chihuahua.\n  The Los Angeles Times also reports that Mexico's Attorney General, \nMarisela Morales, who has been a good partner to the United States, \nfirst learned about Fast and Furious from news reports. As of last \nmonth, she said U.S. officials have not briefed her on the operation, \nnor had there been any apologies for this misguided program.\n  Questions are being asked on both sides of the border, and they \ndeserve answers. Back in August, I wrote to Attorney General Holder and \nasked him to promptly disclose the details of any past or present \nTexas-based gun-walking programs similar to operation Fast and Furious.\n  Much to my disappointment, I have not received any official response \nfrom the Department of Justice, nor Attorney General Holder. While \ndisappointing, this administration's stonewalling is not surprising, \nconsidering the difficulty Senator Grassley and Representative Issa \nhave had in their investigation of the Operation Fast and Furious \nscandal.\n  In May of 2011, Attorney General Holder told the House Committee on \nOversight and Government Reform that he had only learned of Operation \nFast and Furious ``in the past few weeks.''\n  The evidence now shows that Attorney General Holder had received \nmultiple briefing memos regarding the operation that date back to as \nearly as July 2010--much earlier than the few weeks ago he claimed in \nMay of 2011.\n  It is time for Attorney General Holder to tell Congress precisely \nwhat he knew, when he knew it, and to be honest with Congress and the \nAmerican people about how this happened and who will be held \naccountable for it. So far, I think the Attorney General's earnest hope \nis that this will all go away. But it will not go away.\n  My amendment would help ensure that we no longer have to worry about \nOperation Fast and Furious or similar ill-advised gun-walking \noperations.\n  This amendment will mandate that no taxpayer money will be spent on \nprograms where law enforcement personnel knowingly cause the transfer \nof weapons to suspected drug cartel associates with the intent that \nthose law enforcement officials break off the surveillance of those \nweapons prior to interdicting them.\n\n[[Page S6635]]\n\n  In other words, this amendment is narrowly tailored to prevent future \nprograms such as Operation Fast and Furious, while allowing law \nenforcement the freedom to operate gun-trafficking investigations, \nwhere they are in continuous surveillance of the weapons.\n  This will also allow law enforcement officials to use weapons \ntransfers to low-level straw purchasers as a tool to investigate the \nchain of command in a gun-trafficking ring, while simultaneously \nrequiring them to keep their eyes on the weapons at all times so they \ncan step in and prevent unnecessary and tragic violence.\n  Just over 10 months ago, U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was \nmurdered by criminal gang members with weapons ``walked'' into their \nhands by ATF and the Department of Justice.\n  It is my hope this body has learned from this tragedy and that we \nwill affirmatively act to ensure that nothing such as this happens \nagain.\n  My amendment does just that, and I hope my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the amendment of \nthe Senator from Texas.\n  I am chair of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and Science, and \nwe fund the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. I will comment on \nthe amendment.\n  Before I comment on the amendment explicitly, I compliment the \nSenator from Texas for raising the issue on the floor and, second, for \nhis fierce defense of the southwest border and his devotion to Federal \nlaw enforcement and for always being concerned when we send them into \nharm's way, and where we, in any way, could have contributed to either \ntheir injury or their death. I compliment the Senator on that.\n  My ranking member, Kay Bailey Hutchison, also from Texas, has spoken \neloquently, diligently, and unflinchingly about the need we have to be \nserious about what is happening on the southwest border. I say this to \nthe Senator and those of us concerned about our country: We support the \neffort to control our border and stop the growing violence that is \noccurring there.\n  I believe America is in four wars--Iraq, which is winding down; \nAfghanistan, which ultimately will; the southwest border; and the cyber \nwar. We have now two enduring wars.\n  I say to the Senator from Texas, I wish to work with him. When I look \nat what happened with Operation Fast and Furious, I was fast to be \nfurious about the bungled, botched occurrences that happened.\n  For those who might not be familiar with it, this was when Federal \nlaw enforcement, trying to combat illegal gun trafficking, allowed guns \nto knowingly ``walk'' into Mexico so we could track what was happening. \nIt was poorly planned, poorly executed, had flawed leadership, and it \nwas definitely of questionable strategy and value.\n  I wish to work with the Senator from Texas on some slight \nmodifications to the bill--some tweaking and more precise definitions--\nover the next hour or so, if we can look at it. I would like to be able \nto accept his amendment. He is on to something. I would like to work \nwith the Senator's colleague from Texas also and those others from the \nSouthwest to get the answers they want from the Attorney General. They \nare all entitled to them.\n  People at the local level who put local cops on the ground should at \nleast have answers from their own government about what they are doing. \nOperation Fast and Furious was one of many strategies along the U.S./\nMexico border, in Arizona, targeting illegal gun and drug smuggling--\nthe offshoot of Project Gunrunner. There were teams of ATF agents and \ninvestigators who increased our coverage, disrupting firearm traffic in \ncorridors. That Project Gunrunner has been operating since 2006.\n  Fast and Furious went too far. It went beyond the normal Project \nGunrunner strategy and allowed assault weapons to be sold to suspected \nstraw buyers who transported them to Mexico and then the ATF lost track \nof the weapons, which was the point of what they were trying to do.\n  Fast and Furious was brought to an end but with terrible problems. \nThere is no doubt ATF has done good work. They have seized tens of \nthousands of guns. There is the issue of allowing the selling of guns \nacross the area. But hundreds of Mexican citizens have died, our own \nlaw enforcement people have died, and we have to do something about it.\n\n  I understand from the Attorney General that when he heard about it, \nhe did take decisive steps to clean it up. He immediately asked the DOJ \ninspector general to conduct an investigation and examine the facts of \nwhat happened. He made it clear to all Federal prosecutors and law \nenforcement that they should never knowingly allow guns to cross the \nborder--long time Justice Department policy. He changed the leadership \nat ATF and the U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona and has complied--he \ntells me--with congressional requests for thousands of documents.\n  If the Senator feels he is not getting answers, I will join with him. \nHe deserves the answers. We need to make sure we are giving law \nenforcement the tools they need--hopefully, we have it in the bill--to \nfight those drug cartels and gun crimes, which are violent, grim, and \nghoulish.\n  We have listened to the concerns of our colleagues who have spoken. \nThe Senators from Texas and our two colleagues from Arizona, Senators \nKyl and McCain, are well known in their advocacy.\n  We have made a major investment in 2009 and another close to $2 \nbillion is in this bill--it is $1.9 billion--to safeguard our southwest \nborder. We are putting resources in it.\n  Fast and Furious has ended. We need better leadership, a better \nstrategy. I wish to work with the Senator on his amendment.\n  If we could, I think it would be great if we could just accept it. We \nall have to be in this together. The southwest border is America's \nborder. I don't live in the Southwest; I live in the Northeast. But \nanything that happens at your border affects us. That is the way we \nneed to think about ourselves. We are all Americans. We need to look \nout for one another. We need to be able to protect our borders, those \ndefending the border, make sure we get it right and that we don't \ncontribute to the problem. I would sure like to work with the Senator \non this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Senator from Maryland for her offer. I will \ntake her up on that. Our staffs are exchanging modest provisions that \nmaintain the general thrust of the amendment and make clear that the \nSenate will not approve of any funding used for the sort of misguided \nprogram such as Fast and Furious.\n  I ask for the Senator's help and take her up on her offer to try to \nget conclusive and comprehensive answers from the Department of \nJustice. Senator Grassley, Representative Issa, and I feel as well that \nthe Attorney General and the Department could be more forthcoming. It \nboils down to a matter of accountability.\n  One of the things that drives people crazy about Washington and \nCongress these days is that they feel as if things are happening that \nshould not be happening and nobody is held accountable. That is what \nneeds to happen in this program. So I will take her up on her offer. I \nappreciate that. We will work with the Senator and her staff to see if \nwe can come up with acceptable language.\n  As a matter of the record and from the standpoint of accountability \nand clearness, I would like to have a rollcall vote on my amendment at \nthe appropriate time. We will work with the Senator and come up with \nacceptable language.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I wish to update my colleagues on an \namendment that Senator Udall of Colorado and I, along with several of \nour colleagues, filed at the end of debate last night. This is the \namendment that would prevent the U.S. Department of Agriculture from \nimposing needless costly restrictions on the school lunch and school \nbreakfast programs.\n  We debated this amendment at length last night, so I will not do so \nagain now. I did wish to report on some progress we are making in \nachieving a consensus amendment.\n\n[[Page S6636]]\n\n  First, I thank the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Kohl, and \nhis staff, who have been very helpful to us. I also thank the ranking \nmember of the subcommittee, Senator Blunt, and his staff, who have also \nworked with us. We have worked with the USDA. So this morning I am \nfiling another amendment with Senator Udall of Colorado that makes a \nfew changes in the amendment. It is very consistent with the intent of \nthe amendment that we debated last night, but it does strike the words \n``and fruits.'' Since the intent of our amendment was not to change the \nrequirements on fruit servings, I was happy to accept that suggestion \nfrom USDA.\n\n  So I have filed a new amendment. I understand it is going through the \nclearance process on our side of the aisle, and I hope this is an \namendment we can clear and accept very shortly. But I just wanted to \nbring my colleagues up to date and to thank the two leaders of the \nsubcommittee and to let my colleagues know we are making great \nprogress.\n  This amendment is going to make a real difference to school districts \nacross the country without, in any way, impairing the nutritious meals \nwe want all our school children to receive.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I appreciate the amendment offered by \nSenator Collins. I understand her concerns about how proposed changes \nin nutrition standards may affect producers in her State. This issue \ndoes relate to child health, so we need to be careful what we do. I \nhave been working with the Senator on this issue, and I think we have \nmade good progress. I hope we will be able soon to have language where \nwe can come to an agreement.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I wish to join Senator Kohl in saying how \nmuch I appreciate Senator Collins working on this amendment and the \npurpose of the amendment and I think it is a good addition to the bill.\n  I also think we had a good exchange of ideas on the floor yesterday \nand would note we have received a number of amendments to the bill. I \nencourage my colleagues to offer amendments they feel would improve the \nbill that is in front of them. Senator Kohl and I believe this is a \ngood product, but we also believe it will benefit from debate. So we \nare looking forward to an open amendment process and are glad to have \nthe pending amendments to discuss, plus particularly the one Senator \nCollins has just discussed that we both believe is a good addition to \nthe bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 750, as Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I call for regular order with respect to \namendment No. 750 and that the amendment be modified with the changes \nthat are at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nreturn to amendment No. 775.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                             Elouise Cobell\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, a Native American expression on the circle \nof life offers insight into a life well-lived:\n\n       If you were born, you cried and the world rejoiced. Live \n     your life so that, when you die, the world cries and you \n     rejoice.\n\n  On Sunday, the world cried when Elouise Cobell left the Earth. \nElouise was a brave member of the Blackfeet Nation from my home State \nof Montana. She fought tirelessly for what was right.\n  On Sunday, the world lost a great hero. Native American people \neverywhere lost a champion. Her husband Alvin and son Turk, along with \nher entire extended family, lost an admired and irreplaceable loved \none. And I can say with deep gratitude, having worked with her for many \nyears, that I lost a dear friend.\n  Through her persistence and determination, she drew attention to the \nFederal Government's mismanagement of Indian trust lands. She deserves \nthe highest recognition and thanks for helping close a chapter on a \nbitter history of broken promises.\n  For more than 100 years, the Federal Government did not fairly \ncompensate Native Americans in Montana and across the Nation for \nrevenue generated from their land. The Federal Government squandered \nand wasted billions of dollars in not paying Native Americans revenues \nthey were due. It was Elouise who took up the cause. Others wouldn't; \nshe did. She knew it was wrong. She knew it, and she had a mission. She \nworked tirelessly through the courts until the judicial system finally \nrecognized what she had uncovered. The judge in the case decried the \nFederal Government's action as ``fiscal and government irresponsibility \nin its purest form.''\n  I was proud and humbled to work with her on the legislative plan to \nhelp settle the longstanding Indian trust lawsuit. Last year, we passed \nbipartisan legislation to provide a long-overdue conclusion for \nhundreds of thousands of folks in Indian Country.\n  Recently, I joined my colleague, the present occupant of the chair, \nSenator Tester, who introduced legislation to award Elouise with the \nCongressional Medal of Honor, the highest honor possible from Congress.\n  Elouise Cobell fought for many who could not fight for themselves and \nbrought a voice to many who died before being able to see justice \nserved. May we never forget Elouise's long battle to right this wrong. \nMay Elouise's memory continue to inspire everyone who believes justice \nis worth the fight. And may the Creator welcome Elouise home with joy \nand tenderness as we offer our thoughts and prayers to her loved ones. \nOur hearts are heavy as we mourn Elouise. Because she lived a life \nworth living, she lived a life worth rejoicing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 740\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to speak against the \namendment offered by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, amendment \nNo. 740.\n  This Chamber approved three free-trade agreements last week and did \nso with overwhelming support. But for many, that support hinged on \npassage of a robust trade adjustment assistance program, otherwise \nknown as TAA.\n  Last month, the Senate approved trade adjustment assistance, and \nduring floor consideration an amendment similar to the one offered by \nSenator McCain was rejected. Why was it rejected? I will tell you why. \nBecause a majority of Senators in this Chamber want to help small \nbusinesses. We want to help small businesses improve their \ncompetitiveness, and we want to help small businesses take advantage of \nthe opportunities trade provides.\n  But this amendment would end the Trade Adjustment Assistance for \nFirms Program. It would end the only program specifically designed to \nhelp small manufacturers hurt by import competition. It would end the \nprogram that helps companies adjust, retool, and stay competitive in an \nincreasingly global economy.\n  In 2010, trade adjustment assistance for firms enabled 330 companies \nto devise strategies that got them back on track. It helped them \nidentify new markets. It helped them improve inefficiencies. It helped \nthem restructure their debt, and it helped them find new financing.\n  The results proved that the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms \nProgram works. Ninety-eight percent of the companies that participated \nin the program are still in business after 5 years. Without trade \nadjustment assistance for firms, many of these companies would be out \nof business and their workers out of jobs.\n  The program has helped create or retain more than 50,000 good-paying \nmanufacturing jobs since 2006. I would think that with unemployment at \nsuch high rates--over 9 percent--and with the large vote in this body \non the currency amendment with respect to the Chinese manipulation of \ncurrency, it makes eminent sense to help American workers who lost \njobs, not prevent help to American workers who have lost jobs on \naccount of trade. And that is what the Trade Adjustment Assistance for \nFirms Program does--it helps American workers who have lost jobs on \naccount of trade.\n  Senator McCain's amendment will put those jobs at risk. I don't think \nthat is what this body wants to do. We should be creating jobs, not \ndestroying them. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote no on \nthe amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S6639]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 740\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I have a short presentation to make \nregarding trade adjustment assistance, which of course is legislation \nthat was passed through the Senate not too long ago. There was a long \ndebate, an important debate about trade adjustment assistance, which is \nbasically a program we have had in place for decades. That program \nrecognizes that sometimes workers and companies are caught in a \nposition, because of the unfair trade and unfair competition, where \nthey are left not only without a job but sometimes without the prospect \nof retaining their position in a particular trade or work they have \ndone for many years. So trade adjustment assistance allows us to \nprovide some help to that worker or that company so we can retrain \nfolks for the jobs of the future and so that worker can be retrained \nand adjust to the changes in the economy.\n  In particular, today I rise in opposition to amendment No. 740, which \nwould eliminate funding for trade adjustment assistance for firms. We \nprovide it for workers but there is also a part of the act that \nprovides help to firms. U.S. trade policy should, I believe, work in \nthe best interests of the American people, especially American workers \nand American companies. Of course, as a Senator from Pennsylvania, I \nwant that policy to work for our workers and our companies. \nUnfortunately, that is not always the case. Past trade deals have sent \njobs overseas. Several administrations have not done enough to crack \ndown on China's unfair trade policies. Our workers and our companies \nneed safeguards against employment disruptions caused by our trade \npolicies or sometimes caused by our lack of a trade policy. That is one \nof the reasons why trade adjustment assistance is so important, that we \nextend it as we have to help workers and the companies they work for \ndeal with the repercussions of bad trade deals and unfair competition, \nunfair trade that impacts our workers.\n  There is an effort by this amendment to somehow change the dynamic as \nit relates to firms. I know in Pennsylvania, in calendar 2010, 51 \ncompanies in our State were accepted into the program. Fifty-one \nindividual companies were accepted into the trade adjustment assistance \nprogram to help those companies rebound, to recover from the ravages of \ninternational trade.\n  Supporting these firms as they work to better compete against foreign \nimports will help protect the jobs of the workers in those firms. I \nhave worked to ensure that the TAA program is reextended, including \nthis help we provide for individual firms. The legislation that was \nrecently passed maintains trade adjustment assistance for firms but \nreturns funding authorization to its pre-2009 levels. I think this is a \ncritically important point to make.\n  Maybe the best evidence, though, of what has happened is evidence \nfrom individual States but more particularly individual companies. I \nask unanimous consent that a news article that is dated Tuesday, June \n21, 2011, from the Bethlehem Express-Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From lehighvalleylive.com, June 21, 2011]\n\n  Sen. Bob Casey Visits Bethlehem Chemical Manufacturing Plant, Urges \n                    Need To Renew Assistance Funding\n\n                           (By Andrew George)\n\n       Over the last five years, Bethlehem chemical manufacturing \n     company Puritan Products has tripled its sales and created 15 \n     new jobs.\n       According to company President Lou DiRenzo, much of that \n     success is owed to a federal grant for $75,000 awarded to the \n     company as part of the Trade Adjustment Assistance program.\n       U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., visited the Bethlehem facility \n     Monday to meet with workers and discuss the impact Trade \n     Adjustment Assistance has had on the company.\n       Casey, who is chairman of the Senate Joint Economic \n     Committee, urged the need to renew federal funding for the \n     TAA after touring the facility, citing the success Puritan \n     Products has had with the program. ``It's a remarkable story \n     over here at Puritan Products because you're not only seeing \n     all of the job growth results over the last couple years . . \n     . (but) adding jobs and innovating and adapting to new \n     environments in a very complicated part of our economy,'' \n     said Casey.\n       According to the U.S. Economic Development Administration, \n     TAA aims to provide technical and financial assistance to \n     manufacturers or producers who have lost employment, \n     production or sales due to increased imports and foreign \n     competition. It also provides aid to workers who have lost \n     their jobs due to foreign trade agreements.\n       Some Senate Republicans have expressed reluctance about \n     renewing TAA, which cost about $2 billion last year, \n     according to a Bloomberg report. They say the program \n     benefits only a small segment of the unemployed and want it \n     dismantled, according to the report.\n       The press secretary for U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., did \n     not return a phone message this evening.\n       Casey said the benefits of the program are extensive.\n       ``In a very tough economy, businesses need help,'' said \n     Casey. ``They need help with the results of unfair foreign \n     competition. We have to compete every day of the week with \n     countries that frankly cheat and make it much more difficult \n     for us to have a level-playing field for folks that are \n     trying to manufacture a product in this difficult \n     environment.''\n       Casey is urging Congress to renew federal funding for the \n     TAA through 2016 at the stimulus rate adopted back in 2009, \n     which includes coverage to service firms and workers. This \n     enhanced version has recently expired and funding has receded \n     back to pre-stimulus amounts.\n       According to Casey's press secretary, while there is no \n     official estimate yet for just how much an extension would \n     cost, Casey has pledged to find an offset for the cost so \n     that it will not increase the deficit.\n       In a recent letter to President Barack Obama, Casey asked \n     the president to consider delaying the consideration of \n     upcoming free trade agreements with South Korea, Panama, and \n     Colombia in order to focus on the American manufacturing \n     industry.\n       Casey has recently been visiting manufacturing plants \n     across Pennsylvania attempting to rally support to renew \n     funding in the upcoming federal budget for both the TAA and \n     the Manufacturing Extension Partnership.\n       The MEP is a nationwide network, which works with small to \n     mid-sized manufacturers to help create and sustain jobs, \n     increase profits and provide innovation strategies.\n       According to the MEP, for every dollar of federally \n     invested money into the partnership, $32 of new sales growth \n     is generated. They also claim that for every $1,570 of \n     federal investment, the MEP is able to create or retain one \n     manufacturing job.\n       Alongside Casey and DiRenzo was Jack Pfunder of the \n     Bethlehem-based Manufacturers Resource Center.\n       Jack Pfunder said that with the technical and financial \n     assistance provided by TAA, the manufacturing industry is \n     able to innovate and better prepare itself for a successful \n     future.\n       ``People ask me, `What is the future of manufacturing in \n     the United States?'' Pfunder said. ``To me it's pretty \n     simple, manufacturing is the future of the United States and \n     it rests with the researchers of innovation like what we're \n     seeing here today at Puritan Products.''\n       Puritan Products senior vice president Thomas Starner \n     believes it's ``absolutely'' important for a manufacturing \n     company of Puritan Products'' size to receive government \n     funding in this economic climate.\n       ``We don't have the funds internally to do some of these \n     things so getting some government support certainly helps our \n     cause,'' Starner said.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. This article talks about a visit I made to a chemical \nmanufacturing plant. The pertinent part of this article speaks volumes \nabout why trade adjustment assistance is so important for firms. I am \nquoting from a statement made by a gentleman who heads the \nManufacturing Resource Center in Bethlehem, PA, Jack Pfunder. Here is a \nsummary of what he said. The article says:\n\n       Pfunder said that with technical and financial assistance \n     provided by TAA, the manufacturing industry is able to \n     innovate and better prepare itself for a successful future.\n\n  That is someone who is on the ground every day, working on \nmanufacturing issues in Bethlehem, PA. He knows what he is talking \nabout when it comes to the impact of trade adjustment assistance for a \nfirm and in particular for this firm.\n  Another part of the article talks about one of the vice-presidents at \nthe company I visited, Puritan Products:\n\n       Senior vice president Thomas Starnes believes it is \n     `absolutely' important for a manufacturing company of Puritan \n     Products' size to receive government funding in this economic \n     climate.\n\n  I am quoting here from the last line of the article:\n\n       We don't have the funds internally to do some of these \n     things so getting some government support certainly helps our \n     cause.\n\n  That is one company and the leadership of one company telling us in a \nvery concise way why trade adjustment assistance for firms is vitally \nneeded. I know we are going to have debate about this issue that will \nbe ongoing even after passage of the legislation,\n\n[[Page S6640]]\n\nbut I rise in opposition to the amendment of Senator McCain, amendment \nNo. 740, and urge all Members of the Senate to continue to support not \njust trade adjustment assistance for workers but trade adjustment \nassistance for firms as well, especially in this very difficult \neconomy.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Continuing Resolutions\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, on November 18, exactly a month from \nnow, the current law that permits funding of the government will \nexpire. Something will have to be enacted in its place since it is \nclear to all of us, I believe, that we will not have passed and sent to \nthe President all of the appropriations bills by that time.\n  The normal procedure for enacting funding bills is for them to \noriginate in the House of Representatives and be passed there, and then \nthey come to the Senate for consideration and get passed here.\n  I come to the floor today to urge that before the expiration of the \ncurrent continuing resolution; that is, before November 18, the House \nenact and send to the Senate a funding bill which extends funding to \nthe end of the current fiscal year, which is September 30, 2012. My \nsimple point is that, in my view, it is irresponsible for us to \ncontinue funding the government just a few weeks at a time.\n  Already this year, we experienced a near shutdown of the Federal \nGovernment in April, a near default on the country's debt in August, a \npartial shutdown of the Federal Aviation Administration in August, and \nanother near shutdown of the Federal Government 3 weeks ago because of \na dispute over disaster funding. These repeated ``Perils of Pauline'' \nscenarios have understandably shaken the confidence of Americans about \ntheir government and, more particularly, about this Congress.\n  This government-generated uncertainty also has real economic \nconsequences. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said:\n\n       The negotiations that took place over the summer disrupted \n     financial markets and probably the economy as well, and \n     similar events in the future could, over time, seriously \n     jeopardize the willingness of investors around the world to \n     hold U.S. financial assets or to make direct investments in \n     job-creating U.S. businesses.\n\n  So these are self-inflicted wounds that the economy can ill afford, \nand reducing the risk of them occurring in the future would provide a \nmodicum of certainty to businesses in this country and throughout the \nworld.\n  Congress can readily eliminate the risk of a government shutdown \nduring this fiscal year simply by enacting a full-year continuing \nresolution. The sad reality is that in recent years the Congress has \nmore and more relied on short-term funding bills or so-called \ncontinuing resolutions to keep the government functioning while we try \nto reach agreement on appropriations levels.\n  So some would ask, why are the circumstances different this year? \nThey are different for the simple reason that we have already settled \non the level of funding for the government. The Budget Control Act of \n2011 that was enacted in August set the spending levels for the Federal \nGovernment for this year and for each of the next 9 years. These \nspending levels were passed with large bipartisan majorities in both \nChambers. Here in the Senate, the vote was 74 to 26. Therefore, \nenacting a full-year continuing resolution that sets Federal spending \nat that level should not be controversial.\n  We should not have to rehash the debate on spending levels every few \nmonths. Adopting a full-year continuing resolution would free up \nvaluable time in Congress to work on other legislation intended to \ncreate jobs and to help the economy.\n  A full-year continuing resolution also allows the government to \noperate more efficiently than it can under a series of short-term \ncontinuing resolutions. Short-term continuing resolutions make it \ndifficult for Federal agencies to enter into construction contracts, \nsuch as to build or repair roads, or to enter into long-term supply \ncontracts that are often less expensive than short-term supply \ncontracts. In other words, short-term continuing resolutions delay \ncritical projects and increase the overall cost to taxpayers. Adopting \na full-year continuing resolution would address both of these problems.\n  It is clear that passing a long-term continuing resolution does \nnothing to preclude Congress from going ahead and passing individual \nappropriations bills as they are agreed upon. Stan Collender, a \nrespected budget expert, has written about this issue. I will quote \nfrom an article he wrote. He said:\n\n       If the tried and true procedure is used, the CR will simply \n     stop applying to the departments and agencies when the \n     separate appropriation is signed. In appropriations-speak, \n     those covered by the individual spending bill will \n     ``disengage'' from the CR.\n\n  The only argument I have heard against passing a continuing \nresolution for the rest of the year is the argument that doing so will \ntake away the pressure on the appropriations committees and the \nCongress to pass the remaining appropriations bills. That is \nessentially an argument to force those of us in Congress to do what we \nought to do; that is, to pass appropriations bills. In order to do our \nbasic job, do we need to subject the rest of the government and the \ncountry to a series of threatened shutdowns? And especially, do we need \nto do that at a time when we have already agreed on spending levels?\n  I question this argument. It seems to me that both parties--Democrats \nand Republicans--and particularly the appropriators both in the House \nand the Senate have substantial incentive to reach agreement and pass \nappropriations bills whether a yearlong continuing resolution has been \nadopted or not. And if it were true that passing a yearlong continuing \nresolution would lessen the incentive to complete action on \nappropriations bills, then so be it. To my mind, the benefit from \neliminating the threat of a series of government shutdowns far \noutweighs any disadvantage that might result from failure to pass full \nappropriations bills.\n  So, to me, the conclusions are clear. First, we have already as a \nCongress agreed on spending levels for the current fiscal year. Second, \nwe should make every effort to pass all the appropriations bills \nreflecting those spending levels as soon as possible. Third, while we \nare making that effort to pass the appropriations bills, the \nresponsible course is to pass a continuing resolution that extends to \nthe end of the fiscal year. Here is a chance for us to provide at least \na modest degree of predictability for the remaining 11 months of this \ncurrent fiscal year. I believe we owe it to the American people to do \njust that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Americans have a right to know how their \ngovernment is spending their money. If Congress were more open and \nhonest about where their tax dollars were going, I think they would be \nshocked by what they would see. It is even worse than people think.\n  My commitment as ranking member of the Budget Committee is to fight \nfor honest budget practices. I have joined with Senator Olympia Snowe \nto introduce the Honest Budget Act, stripping away some of the most \noutrageous gimmicks that are being used in Congress to advance spending \nbeyond our limits. In fact, I will be filing an amendment today to stop \nthe use of a gimmick called ChiMPs in one of the very bills that is \nbefore us this week. We will explain how that leads to improper \nincreases in spending as we go forward.\n  President Obama is taking his bus tour around the country, riding in \nhis\n\n[[Page S6641]]\n\ntaxpayer-funded, million-dollar campaign bus, telling people we must \nraise taxes to prevent dramatic cuts in Federal spending. What the \nPresident does not say is how much spending has increased in just the \npast few years, including through a number of gimmicks, and how much of \nthat money is being improperly spent and wasted.\n  Indeed, since the President has taken office the first 2 years, we \nsaw a 24-percent increase in nondefense, nonwar discretionary \nspending--not Social Security, not Medicare, but discretionary spending \nwent up 24 percent at a time when this country has never faced larger \ndeficits.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office this fiscal year, \nWashington set record high spending levels this year despite our debt--\n$3.6 trillion went out the door and $1.3 trillion of that was borrowed. \nWe spent not less but more than last year, a 4.2-percent increase, but \nwe do not have the money.\n  My challenge to the President is this: During his next speech, before \nhe calls for higher taxes on American people, would he be able to look \nthem in the eye and tell them he has cleaned up spending here, that \nWashington is not wasting their money. Would he be able to look them in \nthe eye and tell them their money is being spent wisely and effectively \nwith strict oversight. Would he be able to look them in the eye and \ntell them he is reducing spending, not increasing it.\n  I fear the answer is no. I fear any increase in tax rates will amount \nto nothing more than a bailout for the big spenders here and an \nincentive to continue business as usual, an excuse to avoid the hard \nchoices that are being made by families all over America when their \nincomes are down, by cities and counties and States all over this \ncountry making the kind of tough choices that eventually will help them \nbe a more productive institution for the taxpayers.\n  Let's consider the situation in the Congress. The Senate Democratic \nmajority has not had a budget plan for over 900 days. Indeed, Sunday \nwas the 900th day this Congress has gone without a budget. The \nRepublican House has produced a historic, effective budget that would \nchange the debt trajectory of our country in a positive way. It would \nnot do everything that needs to be done, but it is a significant, \npositive historic step. The Senate? Nothing.\n  Hard to remove waste from a budget when we do not even put together a \nbudget plan. We should bring these spending appropriations bills that \nwe have on the floor now through the regular order one at a time, not \nthree at a time, trying to find savings in each and every one of them \nevery place we can. We owe it to the people who send us their tax money \nthat we disburse up here. Cramming three bills through in one is no way \nto run this government.\n  We, I suppose, are supposed to thank Majority Leader Reid for \nallowing us to have some amendments on this bill because we have only \nthree appropriations bill in one, rather than all of them in a \nsuperomnibus, as we have been having. There is time to move these bills \nthrough the Congress. Our leadership would tell us there is not. We \nhave not done much at all this year. We could have passed a budget. We \ncould have been moving appropriations bills long before now, one at a \ntime, brought forth under a full amendment process, under strict \nscrutiny, with every possible effort to see what we can do to fulfill \nour responsibilities without running up the debt.\n  I would ask, how can my friends on the other side of the aisle ask \nanyone to pay more in taxes when they are not even willing to comply \nwith the Congressional Budget Act and produce a budget plan in the \nregular order? Washington asking for more tax revenue is akin to an \nalcoholic asking for more cash before a trip to the liquor store. Even \nif the alcoholic asks a millionaire for the cash, it does not change \nthe fact that the money is not being wisely used. For example, just a \nfew weeks ago, we learned that lawyers at the Department of Justice \nwent to a conference where they were billed $16 apiece for muffins. We \nall know about the $\\1/2\\ billion loan guarantee to the now bankrupt \nSolyndra--yet another big business ally of the White House.\n  President Obama has coined the term the ``Buffet Rule'' in his push \nto raise taxes. The rule relies on a little sleight of hand, since \nBuffett pays mostly a capital gains tax. The upper brackets, as we all \nknow, pay the highest income tax rates. That is how our system works. \nBut this debate about taxes is a little premature.\n  That is why I would like to suggest something called the ``Solyndra \nRule.'' Under this rule, before any proposals are offered to raise any \ntaxes, we first put an end to wasteful and inappropriate spending in \nWashington. Until we do, raising tax rates only funds Washington's \ncontinuing abuse of all American taxpayers.\n  But the waste is not limited to headline-grabbing controversies. It \nis pervasive throughout, I am afraid, virtually every aspect of our \ngovernment. The Food Stamp Program, now called the Supplemental \nNutrition Assistance Program, is the largest item in the agricultural \nbudget.\n  In the appropriations bill before us this week, the Democratic \nmajority would propose to increase this by 9 billion, a 14-percent \nincrease for fiscal year 2012. This $9 billion increase in funding over \nlast year's level would amount to a quadrupling since 2001. In fact, \nfood stamp appropriations have nearly doubled since President Obama \ntook office.\n  Eleven million more Americans are on food stamps now than when the \nPresident took office. The size of the benefit has increased 31 percent \nsince 2008. When the Food Stamp Program was expanded nationally in the \n1970s, food stamps were used by 2 percent of the population. At the \nbeginning of the last decade, they were used by 6 percent of the \npopulation. Today, that figure has risen to 13 percent--one in eight \nAmericans. This sevenfold increase in food stamp usage demands honest \nexamination. It is time to look under the hood of this program. What is \ngoing on?\n  A recent article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that \nWisconsin food stamp recipients routinely sell their benefit cards on \nFacebook. The investigation also found that ``prosecutors have simply \nstopped prosecuting the vast majority of [food stamp] fraud cases in \nvirtually all counties, including the one with the most recipients, \nMilwaukee.''\n  In Michigan, a $2 million lottery winner continued to receive food \nstamps because his winnings were counted as an asset and not income. I \nkid you not. Apparently, he asked about it and they said it is not \nincome, it is an asset, and you don't count assets. But you are \nsupposed to.\n\n       Eligibility standards have been loosened across the board. \n     People are getting food stamps that don't fit the program's \n     requirements. We have always had a problem with this program. \n     As a Federal prosecutor, an assistant U.S. attorney for \n     almost 15 years, I personally prosecuted fraud in the Food \n     Stamp Program. They were used as currency among drug dealers \n     in many areas of our country. There are all kinds of \n     problems. We have done little or nothing about it--nothing \n     about it. One glaring example is something called categorical \n     eligibility. This basically means that even if your level of \n     wealth would ordinarily make a person ineligible for the \n     benefit, those assets are not examined and they will still \n     get food stamps simply because they have used another \n     government program. So if they use another program, they can \n     qualify for it.\n\n  In one State, they have included information for a pregnancy \nhotline--in other words, if a person uses a pregnancy hotline, \napparently, their assets are overlooked and they can qualify for food \nstamps. They automatically become eligible for it. In many States, all \nthat is needed to become food stamp eligible is to be mailed a brochure \nby the government--again, regardless of the assets the individual might \nhave.\n  The amendment I am filing today would eliminate categorical \neligibility. Only those people eligible under food stamp requirements \nwould be eligible to receive the benefit.\n  It is too much to ask of an applicant for benefits who is worth \nthousands of dollars to file an application, under oath, that assures \nthat the person is truly in need and truly qualifies under the law to \nreceive a benefit paid for by the taxpayers of this country. Is that \ntoo much to ask?\n  The second amendment I will be offering today would set next year's \nfood stamp funding at the same level the House of Representatives \npassed. Eliminating the proposed $9 billion increase would amount to \nnearly $100 billion in savings over the next 10 years in the Food Stamp \nProgram assuming no further increases in the program.\n\n[[Page S6642]]\n\n  By the way, I just met an Alabaman who is familiar with the Alabama \nharbors and the waterway system. That program totally, nationally, \ncomes in at less than $\\1/2\\ billion. We have had three ships run \naground in recent months because we didn't have the money to do the \ndredging--a few million dollars. This is talking about saving $9 \nbillion a year; $1 billion is $9,000 million--when just a few hundred \nmillion dollars would fix our waterways and harbors all over the \ncountry. One-half billion dollars would double the current waterway \nbill in the entire United States of America.\n  So surely Members on both sides of the aisle can agree we need to be \nfocused on making the program more effective before we increase it \nbeyond the 100-percent growth it has experienced already.\n  The greatest danger our economy faces, in my opinion--and I believe \nthat from experts from whom we have had testimony in the Budget \nCommittee--is that the cloud the debt places over our economy is \nendangering it, costing economic growth, and costing jobs this very \nminute. The first thing we need to do is see if we can't reduce that \ndebt without raising more taxes on a weakened economy. That is the \nfirst responsibility, I believe.\n  Under the President's leadership, the deficits have increased \ndramatically each year. No one can deny that. Meanwhile, the \nPresident's stimulus plans have resulted in not less but more \nunemployment, actually.\n  To restore prosperity, we need an honest, concrete budget plan that \nrestores confidence, ends waste, and creates private sector growth. \nSuch a plan must reduce the deficit, the experts tell us, by at least \n$4 trillion over the next 10 years.\n  If our committee of 12 reaches the agreement they have been asked to \nreach, they would, in effect, reduce the projected deficit increase by \n$2.4 trillion. But the experts tell us we need to reduce it by $4 \ntrillion. It is bipartisan. Erskine Bowles, who was appointed by \nPresident Obama to head his debt commission, said $4 trillion. Mr. \nZandi, who has been advising the Democratic majority and who testified \nin the Budget Committee a couple weeks ago, said you have to have $4 \ntrillion in reduced spending and reduced deficit.\n  We are not getting there. We are not doing the things necessary. I \ntruly believe that we are still in denial in this Congress. We have not \nrealized how serious the threat is and some of the things we are going \nto have to do. Business as usual cannot continue.\n  I hope that, as we go forward with this legislation, we will get some \nvotes that can actually begin to reduce spending in a number of areas. \nI hope that, during the course of this debate, the people of the United \nStates will begin to focus on what is happening in their Congress and \nhold us all accountable, make sure we are managing their money \neffectively. If we do that, we might surprise ourselves--indeed, we \nwould surprise ourselves on how much could be accomplished in one \ndecade of sustained, smart effort to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse, \nto focus on our spending that can be contained.\n  The defense budget has to tighten its budget, no doubt about it. But \nyou cannot balance the budget all on the Defense Department. Their \nbudget makes up less than half the deficits this year. Our deficit this \nyear will be about $1.3 trillion. The defense budget is about $529 \nbillion. It is way less than half of it. We have to do it across the \nboard in programs not being run well, that are surging out of control, \nsuch as food stamps. They need to be brought into control.\n  We may not have enough money for the highway bill. It is about $40 \nbillion. We are now spending twice that on food stamps, having \nquadrupled it in one decade.\n  I say to my colleagues, we need to get serious about spending. I \nbelieve we can do better and we can surprise ourselves if we make a \nfirm determination to do better. I look forward to offering amendments \nthat will help us get there.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             Teachers and First Responders Back to Work Act\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I agree with my colleague from Alabama \nthat the Senate can no longer deal with serious issues relating to \neconomic and national security as if we were doing business as usual.\n  I have slightly different views--in some instances, radically \ndifferent views--but I hope, on the issue I will discuss, we can come \ntogether on a bipartisan basis in support of the Teachers and First \nResponders Back to Work Act, which I am cosponsoring. I hope for a \nbipartisan support because this bill should be about as far from a \npartisan issue as can be.\n  I hope we can all agree that what America needs, at this moment in \nour history, is policies that put America back to work and help to \nprotect and create jobs. We need to put Connecticut back to work and \nevery State in our Union, with policies that favor not just our \nnational security and make us safer and more secure but also invest in \nour workforce for the future. There is no better place to start than \nwith teachers and first responders.\n  Funding these professional areas is much more than an immediate need; \nit is a commonsense solution and a national priority in promoting safe \nand secure communities and a highly educated workforce.\n  We all know the numbers. Tens of thousands of jobs--300,000 jobs, to \nbe more precise, in our schools have been lost due to budget cuts in \nthe last few years. In Connecticut alone, 3,600 jobs have been lost in \nour schools.\n  Those numbers are not just abstract, speculative statistics; each of \nthem attests to an individual whose potential creativity in the \nclassroom and possible contribution to our young people has been lost. \nIt attests to the loss of individualized attention to students at a \ncritical point in their lives, when they need that kind of care. Every \none of them means that an educator--probably another educator--is \nstretched further, burdened more in the capacity to provide a positive \nlearning environment for our kids.\n  The teachers that would be supported by this bill are not numbers, \nnot statistics; they are vital to our most precious resource, our \nchildren. This bill is not about only their fate, it is about our \nchildren. It is about the quality of their learning, and it is about \nthe quality of our future workforce in this Nation.\n  When manufacturers tell us, as we go home, they need people with the \nskills to match jobs that exist now or will be created in the future, \nthis measure will help to provide them with the workforce they need and \ndeserve to make things in America and to make sure America is \ncompetitive in the world economy. This measure meets our most urgent \npriorities--our children, our competitiveness in the world, and our \nsecurity and safety in our communities.\n\n  We all know that fiscal challenges have forced our towns and cities \nto make cuts to the bone, cuts to programs that are fundamental and \nessential to our schools and also to our first responders. This bill \nis, in a sense, an emergency response--a first response--to those \nneeds, because if we fail to meet this challenge, the lives of our \nchildren will be changed forever. The lives of children in Connecticut, \naffected by those 3,600 laid-off teachers, will be diminished and \ndegraded forever by the loss of classes and tutoring that will be \nended.\n  Our first responders need this bill as much as our teachers, and not \njust our first responders, but the people they serve. Every day we urge \nour children to follow their example, their integrity, their \ncommitment, their service. Yet as budgets have been cut, we have been \nall too willing to cut the first responders, who should be the last to \nbe subject to budget cuts. This approach not only weakens our economy, \nit weakens the safety of our neighborhoods and our communities. This \nbill is just common sense. It is about putting first responders back on \ntheir routes, back in their emergency vehicles, and back in their jobs \nwhere they belong.\n  The numbers are not sufficient to tell the whole story, but those \nnumbers are staggering. This bill will invest $30 billion to support \nState and local jobs which otherwise would be lost. These efforts to \nretrain, rehire, and recruit\n\n[[Page S6643]]\n\ngood people for these jobs in Connecticut and around the country are \nabsolutely essential. Connecticut had a budget shortfall of $2.9 \nbillion as a result of this fiscal crisis. We have been forced to slash \nfunding for programs, and the 3,600 teaching jobs lost in Connecticut \nwill take their toll in the form of a slowed recovery and an extended \ndownturn.\n  The Teachers and First Responders Back to Work Act will provide \nConnecticut with an additional $336 million to support 3,800 positions \nthat are essential to our children and the safety of our communities. \nThis money will give a boost to the State's economy and improve \neducation. And we know--it is undeniable--that we need these positions \nin Connecticut and we need them in the country. America needs to get \nback to work, and we know that teachers and first responders are the \nright place to begin.\n  Let me close by saying, as I go around my State, what people tell \nme--and they are not politicians; some of them could be not less \ninterested in politics--they are concerned that classes are canceled, \nthat teams are uncoached, that music and arts programs are ending, and \nthat their students are untutored. They want action. They want \ndecisions from this body. We have an obligation to meet those needs and \nto provide this response for teachers and first responders, and I urge \nthat we do so on a bipartisan basis in an effort that is fully funded.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Banning Tobacco Products\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, tomorrow night we expect 15 million \nAmericans--including a lot of children--to tune in to watch the first \ngame of the World Series. It is a big deal for a lot of people and a \nlot of families. We watch our heroes in the championship of that great \nAmerican sport of baseball. There are many fans on both sides, of \ncourse, with Texas and St. Louis facing off. I know where Senator Blunt \nwill be--rooting for his Cardinals--and I will be joining him in that \neffort. It will be a great contest and we look forward to it.\n  But I want to raise another issue related to baseball, which several \nof my colleagues joined in today, in a letter we sent to Major League \nBaseball and to the players association. Senators Lautenberg, Harkin, \nBlumenthal, and I today called on the Major League Baseball Players \nAssociation to ban the use of all tobacco products, including smokeless \ntobacco, on the field, in the dugout, and in the locker rooms at all \nMajor League Baseball venues.\n  You see, unfortunately, among those 15 million fans are a lot of \nchildren who watch every move their heroes on the diamond make. And as \nthey watch them, they undoubtedly note that little puff in the lip, the \ncan in the pocket, and they think that is part of being a great \nbaseball player. They decide they too want to be great baseball \nplayers, and so they imitate the conduct of those Major League Baseball \nplayers.\n  The 2009 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey found the use of \nsmokeless tobacco products has increased by 36 percent among high \nschool boys since 2003, and the proportion of high school boys using \nsmokeless tobacco is now an alarming 15 percent of all high school boys \nin America.\n  It is no wonder tobacco companies spend millions on advertisements \ntailored to attract young people to use tobacco products. The industry \nmore than doubled its marketing for smokeless products between 2005 and \n2008 to a record $547.9 million. The letter we sent points out that \nMajor League Baseball players who use smokeless tobacco at games are \nproviding celebrity endorsements for those tobacco products which \nencourage many young people to take up smokeless tobacco. It is a \ndangerous product. We know every year tobacco kills 443,000 Americans, \nmost of whom started their tobacco addiction as teenagers. The Surgeon \nGeneral, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the \nNational Cancer Institute have concluded that smokeless tobacco causes \ncancers of the stomach, larynx, and esophagus; oral cancers--which can \nresult in disfiguring surgery--and pancreatic cancer, one of the \ndeadliest forms of cancer. The use of smokeless tobacco is linked to \ncardiovascular disease, gum disease, tooth decay, and mouth lesions.\n  This is a battle I have been engaged in for a long time. I started \nbattling the tobacco companies over smoking on airplanes over 25 years \nago. I won that battle. I didn't know at the time, but that victory, \nfought with my colleague Senator Lautenberg, was a tipping point in \nAmerica. From that point forward, people started asking questions. If \nit is not safe to smoke tobacco in an airplane, why is it safe on a \ntrain, a bus, in an office, in school, or in a hospital? One by one \nthose opportunities to smoke in those places started to close up.\n  People today find it incredible--in fact, many young people still \ncan't believe it--that we allowed people to smoke on an airplane, but \nmany of us remember it well. America has changed. But when it comes to \nsmokeless tobacco, I am calling on Major League Baseball and the \nplayers association to be part of a positive change on behalf of their \nyoung fans. Let them set an example in their negotiations with Major \nLeague Baseball owners to eliminate tobacco from the baseball field, \nthe dugout, and all aspects of the game of baseball. That would be a \ngreat message. It would not only show responsible conduct on the part \nof the baseball players, but it would show their fans how much they \nlove them that they are willing to make an extra sacrifice to protect \nthem from the dangers of smokeless tobacco.\n\n  It is not a new battle. I have been involved in this before, and I \nhave called on Major League Baseball before. I can tell you that Bud \nSelig is strongly in favor of what I am asking for. I talked to him on \nthe phone just a few weeks ago. But it really comes down to this \nnegotiation--the contract between the players and the owners--and \nusually it becomes a bargaining chip at the table.\n  Let's not let the health and safety of young baseball fans across \nAmerica be a bargaining chip between the Major League players and the \nowners. Let's win one for the kids across America. I hope the Major \nLeague Baseball players will show the leadership, which I know they can \nshow, and eliminate smokeless tobacco from the game of baseball and \nreally give our kids across America--the greatest baseball fans in the \nworld--the help they need to avoid this deadly habit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 740\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to oppose a pending amendment, \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, and that \nis amendment No. 740.\n  This amendment would eliminate any funding under the Economic \nDevelopment Administration for trade adjustment assistance. Trade \nadjustment assistance, under the Economic Development Administration, \nis $15.8 million. This amendment would stop EDA from implementing the \nTAA for something called the firms program, which was just reauthorized \nlast week by the Senate.\n  The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms Program is the only program \nspecifically designed to help small manufacturers hurt by import \ncompetition. Let me emphasize. It is the little guys. It is the machine \ntool shop. It is the small to medium-sized business that we go \n``hoorah, hoorah'' for in the Senate all of the time. But when it comes \nto helping them when they have been hurt by trade imports or their \nintellectual property has been stolen, we are not going to give them \nhelp.\n  I oppose this amendment.\n  The Economic Development Administration is in the Commerce-Justice-\nScience Subcommittee. It was reauthorized by the Senate. Under the bill \nthat was passed, it would have provided technical assistance and \nmatching Federal funds to help develop and implement a plan to help \nthem get back on\n\n[[Page S6644]]\n\ntheir feet. It is a competitive grant program, and the largest grant is \n$75,000.\n  The trade adjustment assistance for something called the firms \nprogram was created back in 1974, under Gerald Ford, to help small \nbusinesses and small manufacturers adjust to increased imports and \nincreased international competition. The 2011 trade adjustment \nassistance bill passed last week authorized this program at $16 million \nand said the EDA should manage it. The CJS follows the authorizing \ndirection, as we should.\n  The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms Program, for small \nbusinesses, helps them adjust, retool, and stay competitive in an \nincreasingly global economy. In 2010, this program enabled 330 firms to \ndevise strategies to help get back on track. What did it help them do? \nIt helped them identify new markets, improve efficiencies in their \noperation, and also helped them identify additional financing. Ninety-\neight percent of the companies that participated are still in business \nafter 5 years. Without the TAA for Firms Program, many of these \ncompanies would be out of business.\n  Since 2006, it is estimated that over 50,000 manufacturing jobs were \nsaved because of this. Manufacturing is the backbone of America. One of \nthe reasons we are in the economic turmoil we are in now is that we \nhave lost so much manufacturing. We give all kinds of tax breaks to \nsend jobs overseas. We also do bailouts to help the really big boys, \nsuch as the automobile industry. And we had to help them. I understand \nthat. But these small to medium-sized businesses, some of which I have \nvisited in my own State, need this kind of help when they are whacked \nby often subsidized imports. Many Maryland companies know how to \ncompete with other companies, but they often feel they are competing \nwith other countries. They know what to do, and we need to be able to \nhelp them do it. Trade adjustment assistance is important. If we don't \ninvest in helping our manufacturers stay in the global game, we are \ngoing to lose out. So we would hope that we would defeat the McCain \namendment.\n  During the Senate consideration of the trade adjustment bill, our \ncolleague, the other Senator from Arizona, offered an amendment to \nstrike the program then. It failed 43 to 54. I hope this amendment \nfails again. Let's use some of the Federal help to help those who are \ncreating jobs. If we really want to talk about creating jobs and \ncreating jobs in manufacturing, let's leave this program--modest, \nsmall. For $15 million, we could really help small businesses and \nmedium-sized businesses learn how to get back on their feet after they \nhave been whacked often by unfair and anticompetitive trade practices.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 739\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. If it is agreeable to the managers, I will discuss two of \nmy amendments--one, the amendment to prohibit the use of transportation \nenhancement grants to fund certain projects, and the other, No. 740, to \neliminate funding for trade adjustment assistance for firms.\n  Is that agreeable?\n  I thank the Senator from Maryland.\n  First, I would like to talk about the amendment that would remedy the \nmisplaced priorities of Congress by focusing valuable transportation \ndollars on improving our Nation's crumbling infrastructure.\n  Under current law, 10 percent of funding provided from the Surface \nTransportation Program must be used for transportation enhancement \nactivities. Let me make it clear. When you pay your tax on a gallon of \ngasoline and send it to Washington, 10 percent--10 cents out of every \none of those dollars--has to be used for transportation enhancement \nactivities. If the State's priority is to rebuild a bridge, 10 percent \nof it has to go to transportation enhancement, but if the State's \npriority is to build a new freeway, then too bad--10 cents out of every \ndollar still must be spent on ``transportation enhancement \nactivities,'' such as transportation museums like the Corvette Museum \nin Kentucky, the White Squirrel Sanctuary in Tennessee, landscaping \nalong Las Vegas highways, walkways, and bike paths, and other \nactivities. Many of these programs may be valuable, and they could be \nvaluable, but rather than a mandated 10 percent be used for those \npurposes, shouldn't the States and the local authorities be the ones to \nmake those decisions if they think the money could be better spent on \nother priorities rather than we here in Congress mandating that 10 \npercent should be used for transportation enhancement activities?\n\n  Everybody knows and the President has spoken eloquently about our \nNation's highways, roads, and bridges that are crumbling and in need of \nrepair. So it doesn't make sense to mandate any Federal dollars to \nsomething other than those, especially since the priorities of the \nState and local governments may be very different.\n  The amendment would prohibit funding in the bill for 7 of the 12 \ntransportation enhancement activities. Specifically, funding would be \nprohibited for scenic or historic highway programs, including tourist \nand welcome centers, landscaping and scenic beautification, historic \npreservation, rehabilitation, and operation of historic transportation \nbuilding structures or facilities, control and removal of outdoor \nadvertising, archeological planning and research, and establishment of \ntransportation museums. I will be the first to say some of those are \ngood programs. Some of those may be necessary. But none of them need to \nbe mandated.\n  This amendment does not prohibit funding for pedestrian and bicycle \nfacilities, pedestrian and bicycle safety and education activities, \nconversion of abandoned railway corridors to trails, environmental \nmitigation of highway runoff pollution, reducing vehicle-caused \nwildlife mortality, maintaining habitat connectivity, and acquisition \nof scenic easements and scenic or historic sites. Frankly, I would like \nto see it all eliminated, but I can understand an argument for the five \nthat are not included in this amendment.\n  We are talking about real money. According to the Department of \nTransportation, almost $1 billion was slated for transportation \nenhancement funds in 2011. Since 1992, more than $12 billion has gone \nto these programs. My colleagues can argue that these are important. I \nargue that it makes more sense to stop forcing States to spend this \nmoney on flowers and museums and allow them to spend it on 146,633 \ndeficient bridges in this country. My home State of Arizona alone has \n903 deficient bridges. If the State of Arizona should want that money \nspent to repair bridges, it seems to me they should be allowed their \npriorities rather than 10 percent of it being mandated for any purpose, \nmuch less those seven that are outlined in the amendment.\n  We know what the debt is--$14.8 trillion. We have to spend our money \nin a fiscally responsible manner and not on special interest projects. \nFor example, the State of Tennessee has more than 3,800 deficient \nbridges. Because of this Federal mandate, however, States are forced to \nspend valuable and limited transportation dollars on transportation \nenhancement projects such as the White Squirrel Sanctuary in Kenton, \nTN. Kenton, the home of the white squirrel, has spent $269,404 on the \nsanctuary. The funding for the White Squirrel Sanctuary was used for \nconstruction of walking trails, including brick crosswalks, a foot \nbridge, and trailhead parking within Kenton to provide for the safe \nobservation of white squirrels.\n  The Lincoln Highway, a 200-mile roadside museum in Pennsylvania, \nreceived $300,000 in enhancement funding to commemorate the historical \nroadway with several items along the 200-mile route. These funds were \nused for items such as signs, ``colorful vintage gas pumps painted by \nlocal artists,'' and this refurbished coffee pot pictured on this \nposter board. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania ranks first out of all States for \ndeficient bridges. Yet it seems to be more important to furbish large \nroadside coffee pots.\n  Instead of spending money on fixing California's 7,091 deficient \nbridges, federally mandated tax dollars were spent on antique bike \ncollections, a dragon gateway, and a sculpture for a parking lot in \nLaguna Beach. Specifically, the University of California received \n$440,000 to purchase and display 60 antique bikes for its bicycle \nmuseum collection. Los Angeles spent $250,000 to aid in the \nconstruction of the Twin Dragons Gateway entrance to the Chinatown \narea.\n\n[[Page S6645]]\n\n  The National Corvette Museum in Kentucky received $198,000 to build a \nnational Corvette museum simulator theater, while over 1,300 bridges in \nKentucky are deficient and 3,000 are functionally obsolete, meaning \nthey do not meet current design standards.\n  I must say, in the interest of full disclosure, I have a special \nfeeling for the Corvette. My first means of transportation on \ngraduation from the Naval Academy was a modest model of the Corvette, \nand I almost wanted to take this out. But since a national Corvette \nmuseum simulator theater has very little to do with transportation \nenhancement, I felt compelled to add this.\n  Nevada spent millions of Federal transportation dollars to make \nVegas's highways beautiful. In 2008, Nevada received $2.6 billion in \ntransportation grants. Instead of spending money on road upgrades or \nrepairing 804 deficient bridges, the money was used for landscaping \nprojects, for instance $498,750 went for ``decorative rocks, native \nplants, some pavement graphics, a few walls and some great big granite \nboulders'' to beautify an interchange to Las Vegas's 215 Beltway.\n  I think it is a very beautiful boulder.\n  Nevada also spent $319,000 on more landscaping projects that included \nmore rocks and more plants on a highway beautification project only a \nfew miles down the road.\n  Let me say again, I think highway beautification projects are very \nimportant. When local and State officials wanted to have that kind of \nbeautification along many of the freeways in my State, we planted \ncactus and bougainvillea and others. I think that is wonderful. But the \nfact is, when we have bridges that are actually dangerous for our \nconstituents to use, then obviously we have to make some \nprioritization. As I mentioned, local officials who discussed the \nprojects were quoted as saying--I am talking about the Nevada graphics \nand big, giant boulders and rocks--``We applied for the Federal \nenhancement dollars and those can only be used for landscaping and \npedestrian-type improvements.'' In other words, local officials in \nNevada said they had no choice as to what to spend the money on.\n  In addition, the N-DOT Nevada transportation deputy director for \nsouthern Nevada was quoted as saying: ``It's really getting out of hand \nto where these pots of money have those constraints associated with \nthem and you can't spend money where you want to.''\n  Florida spent $3.4 million of stimulus transportation enhancement \nfunding for a wildlife ecopassage. The wildlife crosswalk will be used \nby turtles and other animals that live in Lake Jackson, FL. The turtle \ntunnel will consist of a series of fences that will direct all the \nanimal traffic to a 13-foot tunnel that will go under the road. Even \nthough Florida has received millions in stimulus funds for the tunnel, \nthe permanent ecopassage is only in the design stage and is not fully \nfunded. It needs $6 million more, and it is unclear how long it will \ntake to get the project built. Meanwhile, Florida has over 1,800 \nbridges in need of repair or improvements.\n  Other examples of wasteful and unnecessary mandated transportation \nenhancement projects include: $400,000 for a Pennsylvania trolley \nmuseum; $23 million for a Tennessee bicentennial history memorial; \n$234,000 for an Art Walk in Vermont; $160,000 for a Roman bathhouse \nrenovation in West Virginia; $500,000 for the renovation of the Toledo \nHarbor Lighthouse in Ohio; $150,000 for a salamander crossing in \nVermont; $1 million for the North Carolina Transportation Museum; \n$78,000 for a railroad caboose relocation and renovation; $210,790 for \nthe Merchant and Drovers Tavern Museum in New Jersey; $40,000 spent on \na new town sign in Iowa; $216,000 for fencing around oil wells in \nOklahoma; $500,000 for a Santa Ana train station mural; $120,000 to \nrestore Crandall Farm in Rhode Island; $44,500 on welcome signs in \nSouth Carolina; $150,000 to print and produce brochures on landscaping \nand replace a brochure display case in Kansas; $3 million on \nlandscaping and a pedestrian walkway at the Indiana State Fairgrounds.\n  So here we are with $1 billion spent just last year, more than $12 \nbillion gone since 1992, and the numbers go up. I hope my colleagues \nwill vote to find it necessary that these kinds of funding would be \nprohibited for the programs such as I have outlined.\n  I have to be honest with my colleagues. If I had my way, about 80 \ncents out of every $1 in gas taxes would stay in my home State of \nArizona and in every State of America where it is collected and then we \nwould let the Governors and city councils and mayors and county \nauthorities make the decisions as to what that money should be spent \non.\n  I remind my colleagues that we enacted the gas tax during the \nEisenhower administration in order to build a national highway system. \nLong ago, the National Highway System was completed. Yet the money \nstill goes from our citizens directly to the Federal Government, when \nit should be going to the States to make the decisions which they can \nmake best. I doubt if many State authorities would have made the \ndecisions such as I have just described there. I also believe a lot of \nthe authorities and officials in various States would agree with the \ndeputy director of the Nevada Department of Transportation, director \nfor southern Nevada, who was quoted as saying:\n\n       It is really getting out of hand to where these pots of \n     money have these constraints associated with them and you \n     can't spend money where you want to.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will vote in favor of that amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 740\n\n  Madam President, according to a previous agreement, I will discuss \namendment No. 740, which is to eliminate funding for trade adjustment \nassistance for firms--I emphasize for firms. Again, in the interests of \nfull disclosure, I believe trade adjustment assistance is a compromise \nthat was made back under President Clinton's administration, when \ncertain free-trade agreements, specifically as I recall NAFTA, was \nagreed to. The Trade Adjustment Assistance Program was set up for \nindividuals who would be adversely affected as a result of the \nenactment of free-trade agreements.\n  We would not have enacted the free-trade agreements if we did not \nbelieve that the overwhelming effect of free-trade agreements would be \nbeneficial to business in the United States and would result in hiring \nand jobs and a better economy. But I also understand there may be \nindividuals in specific cases where these free-trade agreements hurt \nthe businesses in certain places in the country.\n  I must say I opposed the increase in the trade adjustment assistance \nwhich was part of the deal made in order to ensure passage of the three \nfree-trade agreements that were just concluded in this body a short \ntime ago--the free-trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia, and \nPanama. But I do believe there are some aspects of this program we \nshould examine more carefully.\n  The TAA for Firms Program provides matching grants of up to $75,000 \nto firms that have been impacted by trade so the firms can hire private \nsector consultants to help them become competitive. The program is \nadministered through a network of regional nonprofit trade adjustment \nassistance centers that are chosen noncompetitively. It is my \nexperience that wherever the Federal Government abandons competition, \nthe American taxpayer usually loses. These TAACs have been known to \ncharge exorbitant overhead rates of 60 percent of grant funding, and \nthe Government Accountability Office has questioned the program's \neffectiveness and administrative costs. According to the President, \nthis President, this administration sent over a termination list with \nits fiscal year 2012 budget. According to the President's own proposal \nin his own fiscal year 2012 budget: ``The Administration proposes to \neliminate the Economic Development Administration Trade Adjustment \nAssistance for Firms program.''\n\n  That is not the proposal of the Senator from Arizona, although it is \nin this amendment. It is the proposal of the President of the United \nStates. I think it would be hard for my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle to argue he is insensitive to the plight of firms and \nindividuals and companies that are affected by free-trade agreements.\n  According to the President's termination list, a message he sent over \nto Congress, the justification goes on to say: ``The Administration \nbelieves that\n\n[[Page S6646]]\n\nit would be more effective to concentrate EDA's resources on public \ninvestments in infrastructure and institutions that promote innovation \nand entrepreneurship.''\n  The inclusion of this program in the President's termination list is \nstrong evidence we should no longer be funding the program. It also \nbegs the question: Why are we choosing to spend almost $16 million on a \nprogram we don't need and has consistently had its effectiveness \nquestioned? This is money we don't have and don't need to spend.\n  As I said before, I have always been skeptical of trade adjustment \nassistance and similar programs such as this one for firms. I believe \nthese programs are potential vehicles for government waste, where \nmarket interference unfairly puts the government in the position of \nchoosing winners and losers. I believe the evidence stating that trade \nadjustment assistance and similar programs achieve their goals is \nsuspect as well.\n  That fight is over, at least for the time being. But I might add \nthere are still many questions about the TAA Program. We need to \nanalyze whether the TAA Program is doing what it was intended to do. \nThe following are some of the questions and concerns we should \nconsider.\n  Does the TAA Program provide overly generous benefits to a narrow \npopulation? According to analysis from the Heritage Foundation, based \non statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in the third quarter \nof fiscal year 2009, only 1 percent of mass layoffs were a result of \nimport competition of overseas relocation.\n  Another question: Is there evidence that trade adjustment assistance \nbenefits and training helped increase participants earnings? An \nanalysis by Professor Kara M. Reynolds of American University found \n``little evidence that it (TAA) helps displaced workers find new, well-\npaying employment opportunities.'' In fact, TAA participants \nexperienced a wage loss of 10 percent.\n  The same study found that in 2007 the Federal Government appropriated \n$855.1 million to TAA programs. Of this amount, funding for training \nprograms accounted for only 25 percent.\n  In 2007, the Office of Management and Budget rated the TAA Program as \n``ineffective.'' The OMB found that the TAA Program fails to use tax \ndollars effectively because, among other reasons, the program has \nfailed to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of achieving its \ngoals. The American people are hurting. Unemployment remains at \nunacceptable levels and is estimated to continue to grow. We need to \ncut unnecessary spending, such as this program, at a time when our \nnational debt has reached this unsustainable level. The American people \nface painful choices about how to cut our Federal budget.\n\n  I wish to conclude again by saying I don't believe the trade \nadjustment is a viable program. I also understand what was decided by \nboth sides of the House, with the support of some of my Republican \ncolleagues, that trade adjustment was the price for passage of the \nthree trade agreements that have been signed by the President of the \nUnited States. I think, in this case on this particular program, where \nthe President of the United States has asked for its termination \nbecause of its ineffectiveness and its--and I believe it would be more \neffective to concentrate these resources on public investment in \ninfrastructure and institutions that promote innovation and \nentrepreneurship--I hope we would abide by the recommendation of the \nPresident of the United States with whom, as my colleagues know, I am \nnot always in total agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. I wished to respond to my colleague from Arizona on a \ncouple points. I rise in opposition to his amendment. I think there is \na lot we agree on, based on the remarks he gave about making sure the \nprogram works and is efficient and delivers results for taxpayers. I \ndon't agree with eliminating the program in this case.\n  I appreciate the words he said about trade adjustment assistance and \nhis recognition that workers are going through a tough time right now. \nThis amendment is a disagreement about what we do about firms. In this \ncase, it is pretty simple. We have trade adjustment assistance that \nhelps individual workers, and I think there is a lot of agreement on \nthat. This particular program is about individual companies. Basically, \nwhat we are talking about is 265 firms in the country. The average \nquantum of assistance is a little more than $62,000 per firm. Part of \nthat is as simple as having an expert come into a company--because of \nforeign competition and I would say unfair foreign competition--and \nhelping them with their process, being able to produce a product in a \nmore efficient way, changing an assembly line or giving advice in a way \nthat a company is not able to figure out on its own. It provides that \ntechnical assistance.\n  The other part about this is, it is an effort to make sure these \nfirms can better compete in a very tough environment, frankly, that has \noften been undermined by trade agreements. That is my perspective. I \nknow some don't share that.\n  The other number I would point to, in terms of the effectiveness of \nthe program, is that 90 percent of the companies that received this \ntrade adjustment assistance help for their technical assistance or \notherwise are in business more than 5 years later. So I would debate \nthe question about the effectiveness. It is the same spirit or the same \nbelief that underlies trade adjustment itself. When a worker is thrown \nout of a job because of unfair foreign competition or the ravages of a \ntough economy, we say to that worker we are going to retrain them to \nget them back into the workforce and that is the purpose of the worker \npart of this.\n  The same is true of a company. Sometimes a company gets its legs \nknocked out from under it in a bad economy, and we say we will have a \nprogram to allow an expert to come in and help them get through this \nperiod. It is not unlimited. There is a limited amount of money \navailable nationally for those 265 firms. I think there is a lot of \nagreement about a basic disagreement about the need for a particular \nTrade Adjustment Assistance Program for the companies.\n  I would respectfully rise in opposition to the amendment of my friend \nfrom Arizona.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania, and I will be very \nbrief.\n  The President of the United States weighed in heavily in favor of \nrenewal and even expansion of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program. \nThis amendment only applies to portions of the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Program that the President and the administration \nspecifically pointed out as being ineffective and sent over as a \nprogram for which they recommended termination. I hope my colleagues \nare not confused that this is an attack on an amendment which would \ndestroy TAA. It would not. It only focuses very narrowly on the trade \nportion of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program that the President \nand the administration pointed to as being ineffective and a program \nthey requested be terminated. Frankly, I don't think it would have a \ndramatic effect on the entire Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, I am \nsorry to say.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                               Alaska Day\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. I first wish to say I know my colleague from Alaska was \non the floor talking. Today is Alaska Day. It was a great day for our \ncountry when the final transfer from Russia to the United States \nresulted in the great State of Alaska, which has incredible resources \nfrom which this country has benefited. I want to wish all the people \nback home a great Alaska Day.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 739\n\n  I came down to the floor because I know my friend from Arizona, \nSenator McCain, has offered an amendment on elimination of \ntransportation enhancements. Let me speak about two parts.\n  One, as a former mayor who dealt with this issue over and over but \nalso as someone whose family has been in the business industry and \nunderstands the power of a great community and what it can do for the \nlong-term economic health of the community when the infrastructure is \ndesigned and built right and also someone who was in the real estate \nindustry.\n\n[[Page S6647]]\n\n  First, as a former mayor, we debated these issues a great deal on \ntransportation enhancements. I know there will be issues at times, and \nit doesn't matter if it is this program or the Defense Department or \nInterior Department, I can name any department over the years that has \nhad issues that have come up that have not had the most appropriate \nexpenditure of the dollar. When we look at transportation enhancements, \nthey are an incredible asset. I will tell you, from the aspect of \nAlaska and having served as the mayor of Anchorage for 5\\1/2\\ years, we \nbuilt more roads than the last three mayors combined. In 5 years, we \nbuilt a ton of roads to enhance our communities. But the roads of the \n1950s and 1960s are no longer the viable roads of the future.\n\n  In the old days, they built them, paved them, maybe put a curb on, \nmaybe a sidewalk, and that would be considered the road, the \ntransportation network. Things have changed quite a bit. The roads we \nbuilt in Anchorage not only had the curb, the sidewalk, the \ntransportation enhancements, the landscaping that goes along with it--\nbecause when we put all of that into play, the net result is we get a \nbetter transportation network. One can utilize it, as we have done with \na couple roads in our neighborhoods, to slow down traffic so they will \nnot be a danger to the children within the zone. In the case of some, \nwhere we built pedestrian multi-use trails--which I can point to \nseveral within our own area when I was mayor in Anchorage--where these \ntrails became huge enhancements for the neighborhood but also to our \nvisitors.\n  When the visitors came and spent money on our economy, maybe they \nwent to a place to visit or they went out fishing, but maybe they came \nback and went out after dinner to take a walk. These trails that were \nwell designed and landscaped properly would be another experience they \nwould see and feel and take back to their home and hometown.\n  This amendment Senator McCain has brought forward is opposed by not \nonly the U.S. Conference of Mayors but the National Tour Association, \nthe U.S. Travel Association, the Southeastern Tourism Society, and many \nothers are growing on the list because they see not only the value for \nimproving the road infrastructure, but they see the value of attracting \nquality of life that makes the property values better around these \nenhancements, the tourism that comes along with it, and the value of \neconomic development. I think there is just a lack of understanding by \nsome Members because they like to pick one or two--and I would agree we \nhave to constantly review these programs to make sure they are used for \nthe right purposes. In this case, I will tell you--and I can show you \nproject after project in Alaska where we saw a great value. It could be \nthe Water Street improvements in Ketchikan, which during my time in the \nSenate in the last 2\\1/2\\ years, I have seen that development change \nthe Front Street of their community; the Kenai River Trail \nimprovements--which many people know the great Kenai River has \nincredible fishing for salmon--to ensure that the trails are safe.\n  Why do we want the trails improved? If people are crawling over the \nbanks, they deteriorate the banks, they create erosion and they destroy \nthe habitat and destroy the great Salmon Creek. In Anchorage, where we \nimproved Ship Creek with the same kinds of enhancements, why did we do \nthat? Again, to make it safer for the pedestrians who viewed it and \nalso to ensure that the $600 million fishery that was and is in \nAnchorage would thrive because we are not damaging the habitat.\n  I can go on and on about project after project, where we saw great \nimprovement of the road projects. I know some will believe the road \nprojects are asphalt and maybe a little drain and that is it. I can \ntell you, from putting my hat on from the real estate industry--I spent \nmany years in the real estate industry--what people looked for is the \nquality of the environment around them. If you were on a strip-paved \nroad or barely a paved road with a little drain or curb, it had a \ncertain value. If you were on a road that had a nice pedestrian \npathway, nice curb and gutter and landscaping, I guarantee you those \nproperty values were stronger and better. The local community benefited \nfrom that because it now had stronger property taxes because of the \nhigher property value. The homeowner benefited because they had an \ninvestment that would maintain its value because of the quality of the \ninfrastructure. The roads, water, sewer system, in this case, the \nenhancements were of high quality.\n  Those who brush it off as wasteful expenditures, I can show you again \nproject after project where we took substandard roads, enhanced them \nwith transportation enhancement resources, dollars, and the net result \nwas we had economic development occur around it. We had quality of life \nimprove. We had better values in our properties that are owned by the \nprivate sector, whether it be commercial or residential.\n  Again, I would strongly recommend to my friend from Arizona that I \nknow it is easy--because the staff who run around here always want to \ngive the worst-case scenario of everything. We can always do that. That \nis easy to do. We can always find one project somewhere about \nsomething. But that is not what this is about. It is about the 90-plus \npercent or the 98-percent of projects that are incredible enhancements \nto the community. As a mayor and someone who was in the real estate \nindustry, I have seen the value of these.\n  As I mentioned also, the organizations that don't support these, the \ntourism industry folks I mentioned who don't support these because they \nunderstand that when one is traveling to a community, it is not just \nabout the one item. They go in there--and let's use Alaska as an \nexample--for king salmon fishing or maybe in the wintertime skiing, \nwhatever it might be, there are these other pieces people experience.\n  In Alaska, we have some great trail systems that people rave about \nand they talk about. Whenever I go around the country and I run into \nsomeone who visited Alaska, they will tell me the name of the community \nthey were visiting or talk about this trail or that trail. Ship Creek \nTrail is a beautiful trail that at lunchtime tons of people utilize. It \nis a huge benefit for producing the quality of life for downtown.\n  I would encourage--and I recognize there are things I agree with, \nwith Senator McCain, multiple things that I worked on with the Defense \nauthorization, but this one I beg to differ on his rationale of getting \nrid of this resource. It is important for local communities. I wish to \nemphasize, the best part of this is these are not congressional \nearmarks. It is money set aside that the local communities, through \ntheir metropolitan planning efforts or in the State, through their \nefforts, decide on how to spend this money. It is the best way to allow \nlocal communities less Federal control to do the right thing based on \nsome framework and guidelines here.\n  If we want less Federal Government, this is one of those programs \nthat allows flexibility on the local end to do the right thing and do \nwhat they think will enhance our road improvements and communities, be \nit small neighborhoods or major highways.\n  As I have always done, I invite Senator McCain to Alaska. I will take \nhim on the bypass where we can drive, see some incredible beluga \nwhales, go down to Girdwood and see an incredible rain forest at the \nsame time. I will take him to four or five of these projects. He will \nwant to pull over and take photos. Those will be federally funded \nprojects that made it possible for him to do that.\n\n  Why is that important? Because if you drive the new Seward Highway \nfrom Anchorage to Girdwood, it is not the safest highway. These \npullouts, these waysides, these enhancements have made it a safer \nplace. You can pull over and see Dall sheep walking on the side of the \nmountains right there. Instead of stopping on the road and pulling off \non the side there a little bit, you actually pull off into a wayside. \nIt is safer, better for tourism. It does the right thing, ensuring that \nthe project is a better project.\n  Again, I would challenge my friend from Arizona that I will gladly \ntake him on many of these projects and show him the value of what we \nhave done with them, the economic opportunity that goes along with \nthem, the jobs that are created with them, the long-term benefit to the \nvalues of the properties that is associated with these\n\n[[Page S6648]]\n\nimprovements that are in the private sector.\n  Madam President, I thank you for allowing me a few minutes. I again \nwish my friends and all my constituents back home a great Alaska Day. \nBut I also wanted to talk about an important amendment that I think \nwould be the wrong direction if we vote for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4:35 p.m., \nthe Senate proceed to votes in relation to the following amendments: \nCornyn No. 775, as modified with the changes that are at the desk; and \nMcCain No. 740; that the time until 4:35 p.m. be equally divided \nbetween the two leaders or their designees; that no amendments or \npoints of order be in order prior to the votes other than budget points \nof order; and that there be 2 minutes equally divided between the two \nvotes; further, after the votes in relation to those amendments, the \nfollowing Senators be recognized to offer the amendments listed: Vitter \nNo. 769, Collins No. 804, Sanders No. 816, and Landrieu No. 781.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 775), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       After section 217 of title II of division B, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 218.  No funds made available under this Act shall be \n     used to allow the knowing transfer of firearms to agents of \n     drug cartels where law enforcement personnel of the United \n     States do not continuously monitor or control such firearms \n     at all times.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is not a good idea to legislate law \nenforcement tactics on an appropriations bill. To the extent the \namendment by the Senator from Texas that has been modified with the \nhelp of the subcommittee chair restates Department of Justice policy, \nit is unneeded. To the extent it seeks to create a well-intentioned \nimplementation of that policy, it does so in a way that may adversely \naffect FBI operations and other law enforcement efforts, including \njoint task forces among Federal, State, and local law enforcement, \nwithout really adding to what the Attorney General has already said and \ndone to ensure that certain tactics from Operation Fast and Furious not \nbe used again.\n  The Department of Justice's Inspector General's Office has not yet \ncompleted its independent investigation of Operation Fast and Furious, \nwhich was a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives \noperation in Phoenix that apparently followed on the practices used in \nTucson during the Bush administration in Operation Wide Receiver. I \nexpect to examine the inspector general's report through briefings, and \npossibly a hearing, when that investigation is concluded. It is \nimportant to remember that there are ongoing and highly sensitive \ncriminal investigations involved here, and I do not think anyone wants \nto unduly hamper the efforts of law enforcement agents to stem the \nfight against violent drug cartels in Mexico.\n  I appreciate that the Senator from Texas, like all of us, is deeply \nconcerned. When he wrote to me asking for a hearing about the southern \nborder, I asked Senator Durbin, who then chaired the Crime \nSubcommittee, to work with him and accommodate his request. I certainly \nhope that congressional attention did not add to the pressure felt by \nlaw enforcement officers and agents to utilize aggressive and risky \nmethods with inadequate resources.\n  Of course, we all mourn the loss of all of the agents who have died \nin the line of duty, including members of our Customs and Border Patrol \nand Immigration and Customs Enforcement. I have spoken previously about \nthe loss of Jaime Zapata. This year we also mourn Hector Clark and \nEduardo Rojas. Last year we lost five Department of Homeland Security, \nDHS, agents: Vincent Gallagher, John Zykas, Mark Van Doren, Floyd \nCollins, and, of course, Brian Terry. The year before that we lost \nanother four agents: Nathaniel Afolayan, Cruz McGuire, Robert Rosas, \nJr., and Trena McLaughlin.\n  Senator Cornyn has offered an amendment he describes as prohibiting \nfunding for intentional ``gun walking'' programs. The Department of \nJustice already has a longstanding policy against the knowing transfer \nof firearms to criminals without proper monitoring or controls. I \nappreciate that the Senator from Texas, like all of us, is deeply \nconcerned about law enforcement operations that could allow firearms to \nfall into the hands of violent criminals in Mexico.\n  I was concerned that the original text of his amendment would \nactually make it more difficult to investigate and prosecute gun \ntraffickers. I am glad to see that Senator Cornyn has worked with \nSenator Mikulski to address some of my operational concerns with his \namendment concerns that were also voiced by the Department of Justice. \nI am not sure that in the short time available to us that we have been \nable to rectify all of the unintended, collateral consequences this \nlanguage might occasion, however. For example, I know the FBI has \nvoiced serious operational concerns about the impact this amendment \ncould have on their system of background checks through the National \nInstant Criminal Background Check System, NICS. I hope Senator Cornyn \nand others will continue to work with the Department of Justice, the \nFBI, and other law enforcement agencies to ensure that whatever final \nlanguage may be included in law does not unduly hamper the ability of \nlaw enforcement, including efforts against violent drug cartels in \nMexico.\n  The Attorney General recently reiterated that longstanding Department \nof Justice policy already prohibits the transfer of firearms to known \ncriminals without the proper monitoring or controls by law enforcement. \nIndeed, when Attorney General Holder testified about Operation Fast and \nFurious before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee for Commerce, \nJustice, and Science in March, he stated that he had made it clear to \nthe Department of Justice, including the U.S. Attorney's Offices and \nATF agents nationwide, that ``letting guns walk is not something that \nis acceptable.'' I also understand that earlier this year, this policy \nwas expressly reiterated to prosecutors and agents in the field through \nguidance issued by the Deputy Attorney General. Accordingly, this \namendment attempts to legislate a policy that is already in effect.\n  I am also concerned that Senator Cornyn has offered this amendment \nwithout the benefit of all of the facts. As I have noted, there is an \nindependent investigation by the Department of Justice inspector \ngeneral that is ongoing. Moreover, there is an ongoing criminal \ninvestigation and prosecution related to the tragic murder of Agent \nBrian Terry. I am sure Senator Cornyn would agree that we should all \nensure that the FBI and the prosecutors assigned to the case can \ncontinue that criminal investigation without any interference or \nimpediment. Contrary to Senator Cornyn's statement, there has been no \nconclusive evidence indicating that either of these guns connected to \nOperation Fast and Furious were ``used'' to murder Agent Terry.\n  Although the revised text of Senator Cornyn's amendment has addressed \nsome of my operational concerns, I remain concerned with language that \npurports to require U.S. law enforcement personnel to continuously \nmonitor and control any firearms that may be transferred during an \noperation. I cannot believe that is what is really intended. Many law \nenforcement operations are joint operations through joint task forces \nwith State and local law enforcement. I do not believe the Senator from \nTexas means to construct a rigid protocol of tactics for such \noperations. Given the potential for operational problems that might \narise from a overly literal application of the language, I am left to \nwonder whether this language is intended to apply to joint operations \nat all, since it would not make sense on the ground.\n  Again, I appreciate the intent of Senator Cornyn's amendment, and as \nI have demonstrated, I share his concern with the violence, drugs, and \nillegal gun trafficking along our borders. The strategy and tactics \nbeing used to fight these problems need to be both smart and effective. \nAt the same time, I am confident the Senator from Texas would agree \nwith me that we must also continue to support and honor the efforts of \nthe thousands of Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers who \nare working tirelessly to keep our border safe.\n\n[[Page S6649]]\n\n  Mr. KOHL.

I ask unanimous consent to waive the reading of the \nwhole.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the Food and Drug Administration from preventing \nan individual not in the business of importing a prescription drug from \n        importing an FDA-approved prescription drug from Canada)\n\n         On page 83, between lines 20 and 21, insert the \n     following:\n         Sec. _.  None of the funds made available in this Act for \n     the Food and Drug Administration shall be used to prevent an \n     individual not in the business of importing a prescription \n     drug (within the meaning of section 801(g) of the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 381(g))) from \n     importing a prescription drug from Canada that complies with \n     the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, let me briefly explain what this amendment \nis about, and I will be very brief. It will allow for personal use drug \nreimportation from Canada only. In doing so, this amendment is nearly \nidentical to an amendment I proposed previously on the Senate floor \nlast Congress which passed in a very strong bipartisan vote.\n  Americans spend hundreds of billions of dollars a year on \nprescription drugs. Prescription drug prices are skyrocketing, and they \ncontinue to skyrocket, and that causes real hurt and angst among many \nAmerican families, particularly American seniors. They shouldn't have \nto choose between lifesaving medicine and other basic needs of life, \nsuch as food and electricity, and yet often the reality is that they do \nhave to make that choice.\n  My amendment would help ease a little bit of this pain by giving \nAmericans more options. But in doing so, it is very narrow, it is very \ncautious, it is very specific. It applies to only individual \nconsumers--not wholesalers--bringing in for their personal use FDA-\napproved prescription drugs, and only from one country; namely, Canada.\n  As I said, in doing so the language is nearly identical to the Vitter \namendment to the DHS appropriations bill that passed the Senate last \nCongress with a strong bipartisan majority, 55 to 36, with 9 members \nnot voting.\n  This would provide real relief to millions of Americans, including \nseniors. It would allow reimportation from Canada--a very safe source \ncountry--including through mail order and over the Internet. The \nlanguage, again, was restricted to personal use reimportation. \nWholesalers cannot participate. It only applies to a consumer who gets \na valid prescription from a doctor. So this amendment would \nspecifically prohibit funding to the FDA to the extent that they would \ncrack down and prohibit and police against this narrow activity.\n  Back home and in Washington, Members of Congress on both sides of the \naisle often talk about doing something about skyrocketing prescription \ndrug costs. This is a very specific, narrowly tailored, cautious but \neffective means where we can do something, where we can have an impact, \nwhere we can help tens of millions of Americans, including many \nvulnerable seniors.\n  I hope Democrats and Republicans will come together again, as we did \nlast Congress, and give a strong, healthy bipartisan majority to this \nidea. It is the right thing to do. It would help Americans, it would \nhelp seniors, and it is a very careful, cautious approach: personal use \nonly, not wholesalers, Canada only.\n  Again, I urge that we adopt this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 781\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I know there may be other Senators who \nwant to call up their amendments. I only want to speak for 2 minutes on \nthe amendment I just proposed and explain to the Senate why this \namendment is necessary. And I look forward to working with the \nchairwoman of the Agriculture Committee, Senator Stabenow from \nMichigan, and others, to work through the details.\n  It seems as though there is an inconsistency in the law between the \n404 process that the Corps of Engineers uses when anyone, public or \nprivate, wants to build anything in a wetlands. Of course, you have got \nto get a permit. We are getting used to that. It is not an easy \nprocess, but it works, for the most part. You have got to mitigate; in \nother words, there is a no-net-loss rule, and we are all supporting \nthat. However, there is a discrepancy\n\n[[Page S6651]]\n\nin the Farm and Rural Development Act that actually prohibits some very \nworthy nonprofit entities that are building community projects--this is \nnot for profit--to even apply for a permit, even if they could \nmitigate, and that is what my amendment seeks to correct.\n  The chairperson on the Agriculture Committee and others who have \njurisdiction have committed to work with me to tailor this amendment so \nthat it provides the help some of these loans need through the Rural \nDevelopment Agency, but it doesn't open a whole new area of policy. I \nthank the Chair.\n  That is basically a very short but concise and complete description \nof what I am trying to do. It is about as simple as that. I look \nforward to when the Senator from Wisconsin allows us to get in line for \na vote on this committee. I thank Senator Kohl for allowing us to offer \nthis amendment at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 791 to Amendment No. 738\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and amendment No. 791 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 791 to amendment No. 738.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be considered \nas read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to provide direct payments to \n  persons or legal entities with an average adjusted gross income in \n                         excess of $1,000,000)\n\n         At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n         Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Secretary of Agriculture to provide direct \n     payments under section 1103 or 1303 of the Food, \n     Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 8713, 8753) to \n     any person or legal entity that has an average adjusted gross \n     income (as defined in section 1001D of the Food Security Act \n     of 1985 (7 U.S.C. 1308-3a)) in excess of $1,000,000.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. This is a straightforward amendment. We have had a lot of \ntalk about millionaires in the country, but what most people don't \nrealize is that there are a lot of farmers in this country whose \nadjusted gross income is well in excess of $1 million whom we are \nmaking direct payments to.\n  What I would put forward is if you are making over $1 million, I \ndon't think you need a lot of help from the Federal Government to be \nprofitable. So what this amendment will do is it will put a limit of $1 \nmillion or greater from receiving direct payments from the Department \nof Agriculture. You could say somebody making $980,000, but we have \nchosen this. Right now it is supposedly $2.5 million adjusted gross \nincome.\n  What we have done is, of all the people who make more than $2.5 \nmillion, 75 percent of their income outside of the farming income comes \nfrom some other areas. In other words, this is not their main business. \nTheir main business isn't farming. So if they make $2.5 million \nfarming, and they make 75 percent more than that in other areas, again, \nI would say we should have trouble justifying to the American people \nthat we are sending their tax dollars--actually, borrowed money that is \ngoing to be charged to their kids and grandkids--to those individuals.\n  Of the 1.8 million people who received farm payments from 2003 to \n2006, 2,702 of them exceeded the income limits that were established at \nthat time, greater than $2.5 million. GAO reported that the USDA does \nnot have management controls in place to verify that payments are not \nmade to individuals who exceed the program's income eligibility limit. \nSo we have a limit of $2.5 million, but they are not enforcing it. They \ndon't know whether they are enforcing it.\n  What this amendment will do is, first, we are going to cut it back to \n$1 million and say put it in action so you know who you are paying and \nhow much they are making. GAO found that participants in the program in \n2006 were three times as likely to have an adjusted gross income in \nexcess of $500,000 as individuals who did not participate at all in the \ndirect payment program. In other words, 21 of every 1,000 farm program \nparticipants reported in excess adjusted gross income of $500,000 or \nmore, compared with 7 of every 1,000 tax filers in the general public. \nInstead of taking more of what wealthy individuals have earned, \nCongress would be wise to first end unsolicited subsidies in the farm \nprogram to those individuals.\n  Studies show that direct payments went to wealthy individuals who \nlive in urban areas but own or have partial interest in their farms. In \nother words, they are absentee landlords who live in U.S. cities with \npopulations 100,000 or more, but they were paid $394 million in farm \npayments in terms of the direct payment in 2010 alone. So that is $\\1/\n2\\ billion.\n  The top 10 percent of direct payments in 2010 received 59 percent of \nthe money under the program. In other words, the top 10 percent got 59 \npercent of the direct payment money. These 88,000 people got an average \nof $30,000. But if you look at those with adjusted gross income, they \ngot far in excess of that. Some examples include 23 Members of Congress \nin the 112th Congress; 109 individuals living inside Washington, DC; \n203 individuals in Miami; 179 individuals inside the city limits of San \nFrancisco received over $1 million in payments; 290 New York City \nresidents received $800,000 on average in payments.\n  President Obama's fiscal 2012 budget proposes to reduce the per-\nperson cap on direct payments to wealthy farmers by 25 percent or more \nand reduce the adjusted gross income eligibility limit by $250,000 over \n3 years. Well, what this amendment does is in the spirit of what the \nadministration wants to do, but it goes further. It says if you are \nmaking over $1 million in adjusted gross income, you should not be \neligible for direct payments through the farm program. It is \nstraightforward. It is a way for us to change what we are doing. It is \na way for us to save a significant amount of money, almost $\\1/2\\ \nbillion.\n  I dare say that if you poll the average American and you said we are \npaying out hundreds of millions of dollars every year to people making \nmore than $1 million who are farming, they would say, We don't agree \nwith that. That can't be the original intent of that program.\n  That program is designed to help those people who are truly \nundercapitalized, who truly are having a difficult time even when we \nhave great markets. And I am not opposed to the payment program. But \nthe fact is, to have a significant percentage of that go to individuals \nwho are making far in excess--33 times what the average individual in \nthis country makes--I think is something we ought to end, and we ought \nto end right now.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 792 to Amendment No. 738\n\n  Mr. President, I ask that the pending amendment be set aside and \namendment No. 792 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 792 to amendment No. 738.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be considered \nas if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To end payments to landlords who are endangering the lives of \n                      children and needy families)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.  The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development \n     may not make a payment to any person or entity with respect \n     to a property assisted or insured under a program of the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development that--\n        (a) on the date of enactment of this Act, is designated as \n     ``troubled'' on the Online Property Integrated Information \n     System for ``life threatening deficiencies'' or ``poor'' \n     physical condition; and\n       (b) has been designated as ``troubled'' on the Online \n     Property Integrated Information System at least once during \n     the 5-year period ending on the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. This is another fairly straightforward amendment. We have \nsignificant housing for people who have\n\n[[Page S6652]]\n\na need in our country. But inside that program, in HUD, there are \npayments being made for housing complexes with life-threatening \nconditions or in absolute poor physical condition. Yet people are \ntrapped there. We keep sending the money. The money doesn't go to \nimprove the housing; it goes into the pockets of those who own the \nhousing through this subsidized housing.\n  Thousands of needy families have turned to the government for stable \nhousing. They have been placed in properties with health and safety \ndeficiencies, including some that are life-threatening. There are 3,847 \nproperties with life-threatening deficiencies as determined by HUD--\nlife-threatening--that are currently or previously designated as \n``troubled'' by HUD during the past 5 years. Of those, 2,297 are in \npoor physical condition and were designated as ``troubled'' by HUD. \nSome of these are for the same properties that appear year after year \non HUD's registration list of troubled properties. These numbers will \nnot reflect all the deficient housing provided by HUD and other Federal \ndepartments and agencies. This is just a taste of a portion of what is \nout there.\n  What this amendment would do is cut off aid to the greedy slumlords, \nwhile protecting needy families by prohibiting HUD from making any \npayment to any person or entity with respect to a property assisted or \ninsured by HUD, currently designated as ``troubled'' on the Online \nProperty Integrated Information Suite for ``life-threatening \ndeficiencies'' or ``poor'' physical condition and that has been on the \nOnline Property Integrated Information Suite's troubled property list \nat least one time during the past 5 years.\n  What we are saying is, if someone has been taking advantage of this \nprogram as the owner of the property and not making it a safe property, \nnot making it inhabitable, yet people have no choice but to live there, \nwhat we are saying is HUD should not be giving them any money. HUD \nshould not be giving them any money.\n  Over the past several years, there have been far too many examples of \nslumlords receiving hundreds of millions of Federal tax dollars. In \nmany cases, those without stable housing sought help but were put at \nhealth and safety risk by those entrusted to care for them with \ntaxpayer funds. A recent ABC News ``Nightline'' reported that the \nFederal Government's low-income housing programs are plagued by theft, \nmismanagement, and corruption at local levels, including millions spent \non housing for sex offenders and dead people, and all too often fail \nthe 3 million families who rely on them for a clean, safe place to \nlive.\n  Specifically, the report found the Philadelphia Housing Authority \nspent housing funds on lavish gifts for its executives, $500,000 to \nsettle sexual harassment claims, $17,000 of housing funds to throw an \nextravagant party for the executives. The same month at a belly-dancer \nparty, a 12-year-old girl living in Federally subsidized housing \nsuffered a near-fatal asthma attack that left her unable to speak or \nwalk, secondary to dangerous mold in that apartment complex because it \nwas not taken care of with the dollars that were paid by American \ntaxpayers to help those who are dependent on us.\n  The New York Daily News recently found some of the city's landlords \nreceived $81 million in Federal housing funds, even though their \nbuildings were riddled with housing code violations. The report stated \nmillions of dollars have been doled out to buildings where tenants have \nrepeatedly complained about rats, roaches, nonworking elevators, lack \nof heat and flaky lead paint. The Federal Government provided $350 \nmillion to more than 60 housing authorities that have been repeatedly \nfaulted by auditors for mishandling government aid. In Indiana, \ninvestigators found the poor forced to live in substandard housing that \nlocal authorities knew was unsafe, yet did not fix. In Indianapolis \nalone, more than $5.2 million a year has been spent on housing \nresidents in unsafe conditions, according to the Fort Wayne Journal \nGazette.\n  About $2.2 million of the Federal funds intended to support low-\nincome housing on the Navajo Nation Indian lands in New Mexico was \nspent on gaming, furs, jewelry, racehorse training, according to the \nLas Vegas Sun. There is no oversight at HUD to make sure the landlords \nwill meet the eligibility requirements for receiving these funds. What \nwe are actually doing is we are saying, if they do not meet the \ncriteria, they should not get the money. That is hardly a novel idea. \nYet we continue to spend hundreds of millions of dollars supposedly to \nhelp those who are neediest among us. Yet it does not help them at all \nbecause the money is misdirected and not reinvested in the housing.\n  HUD continues to subsidize repeat offenders with a history of placing \nfamilies in unsafe living conditions. There were 6,100 properties \ndesignated as ``troubled'' during the past 5 years. Some of these \nproperties appear year after year on the same list. There is no change. \nThey are still getting the money. These include properties in my own \nState of Oklahoma. Needy families should not be put in dangerous \nconditions as a result of neglect by the slumlords but, more \nimportantly, as a result of neglect in our oversight of HUD.\n  What we would propose to do is to ensure the Federal housing benefits \nfor the needy, rather than the greedy, and to prevent slumlords from \nabusing taxpayers and the disadvantaged and the aged. This amendment \nwould bar HUD from paying landlords whose properties are in poor \nphysical condition or have life-threatening deficiencies, according to \ntheir own analysis.\n  In other words, they already know it, but they are still paying it. \nWhat this amendment would say is: They are on the list; they do not \nqualify. It will send a great signal. Not only will we not pay as much \nmoney to properties and put people in better properties, but we will \nchange the expectation of the people who are making all the money off \nthe HUD moneys for the properties. We will make a big difference.\n  There may not be many who actually lose the money, but there will be \nmany people who are depending on it, living in far better conditions, \nfar safer conditions, if we pass this amendment.\n  I wish to take just a moment, if my colleague does not mind, to talk \nabout where we are. I have a total of 12 amendments. I was allowed to \nbring up two. I understand they do not want to get in a hurry, but the \nfact is, these are all good-government amendments, every amendment I \nbrought up. They may not pass, but that is our fault. But the fact is, \nwe should not be limiting amendments. Let's get them out there. Let's \ndo them. There are money savings, there are quality savings, there are \nways to make the agencies work better, and we should not be afraid of \nthat.\n  We stand right now as a nation in the worst shape we have ever been. \nThe risks to our country are great. We need to quit thinking about \npartisanship. We need to quit thinking about advantage in the political \narena and start doing what is necessary to fix our country. We passed a \nbudget bill that allowed a debt increase that the average American does \nnot realize actually did not save any money. Over the next 10 years, we \nare actually going to spend $800-some-odd billion more than what we \nspent last year on discretionary programs. It is time we start being \nhonest with the American public. These 12 amendments are simple and \nstraightforward. One of them copies the amendment of Senator Mikulski \nfor CJS, that ties down and makes more responsible the agencies on \ntheir conference spending.\n  Conference spending is out of control. The Department of Agriculture \nis absolutely out of control on the money it spends. So we ought to be \nabout moving things through that make a real difference so we can start \nrebuilding the confidence. Fifteen percent of the people have \nconfidence in us, and I understand why. It is because we spend most of \nour time around here in quorum calls. I was prepared tonight to put up \nall these amendments, see which ones could be taken, not necessarily \nhave a vote on every one, but we are not going to allow that to happen. \nWe are not going to allow that to happen not for any good reason; we \nare not going to allow it to happen for political reasons, and that is \nkilling our country. Whether Republicans do it or Democrats, none of it \nis any good. The country is on to us.\n\n  Eighty-five percent think we are doing a lousy job. I wonder why it \nis that low. I cannot find anybody in the State of Oklahoma who thinks \nwe are\n\n[[Page S6653]]\n\ndoing a good job. I can't find anybody around the country who thinks we \nare doing a good job. But I say to my colleagues, let's start moving \nstuff through that actually changes things, that is actually going to \nmake a difference. One does not have to agree. Vote it down. None of \nthese are trick amendments. None of these are meant to be political \namendments. They are just straightforward, good-government amendments \nwe ought to consider. If one disagrees, disagree. Fine. But let's not \nnot vote on them and let's not quit making attempts to try to fix what \nis wrong in our government.\n  HUD's oversight of housing is a disaster. When we have this many \nproperties year after year on this list, why would we not want to fix \nthat? It is not that we don't want to fix it. It is we do not want to \ngive somebody an opportunity to put out the real reason our country is \nin trouble. The real reason is us. We have not done our jobs. We have \nnot done the oversight. We have not cleaned up things. We can have \ngreat arguments and great discussions and great debates but to not have \nthe debate at all means we deserve every bit of that 85-percent lack of \nconfidence in what we are doing.\n  Tomorrow, I hope I will be able to offer the rest of these \namendments. I will work. I have talked with almost every one of the \nmanagers on the amendments. None of them are controversial. Some they \nmay disagree with and want votes on, others can be accepted. But to not \nmove forward and then say it is taking too long to get the bill, when \nwe are here ready to work, is not an excuse the American people are \ngoing to buy anymore.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the permanent \nchange to interstate weight limits for Maine and Vermont, an issue I \nhave worked on for more than 10 years. I could not be more pleased with \nthe inclusion of this commonsense legislation that puts large trucks \nback where they belong--on the highway.\n  Regrettably, the current treatment of truck weights on interstate \nhighways is a glaring example of a provision of law that creates both \nsafety hazards on secondary roads and tangible barriers to job growth \nat a time when the Nation's unemployment rate remains above 9 percent \nand Maine's mill towns are struggling to thrive, and I hope this bill \nis a step towards a solution to this glaring disparity. The Senate's \nconsideration of this remedy is long overdue. The patchwork exemption \npolicy that currently exists has penalized Maine and created a serious \ninequity that has burdened our commerce with needlessly onerous and \ncostly regulation.\n  The language included in this appropriations bill mirrors legislation \nthat Senator Collins and I have introduced together since 2001. Indeed, \nthis simple change has taken more than a decade to implement. It is my \nhope that this Congress, and this bill will finally resolve a \nlongstanding inequity that has granted other States the same privilege \nthat Maine requests--the ability to shift truck traffic to conflict-\nfree highways where commercial traffic can efficiently travel without \nincreasing the danger to pedestrians and drivers at crosswalks and \nintersections.\n  Maine Department of Transportation engineers have certified on a \nnumber of occasions that Maine's interstate bridges are safe to carry \n100,000-pound, six-axle trucks. The bridges along the interstate are in \ngood condition, and the impact of fatigue caused by these trucks is \nlikely near zero. The State estimates that a permanent change to weight \nlimits would reduce pavement costs by more than $1 million per year. It \nwould also reduce bridge rehabilitation costs by more than $300,000 per \nyear.\n  In addition, the pilot program implemented in 2009 demonstrated \nsignificant safety improvements when these large trucks returned to the \nhighway. There were 14 fewer crashes--a 10 percent improvement--\ninvolving six-axle vehicles, even with increased traffic volume on \nMaine's interstate system. In fact, there were no fatal crashes on the \ninterstate during the pilot program, and five fewer injuries on \nsecondary roads.\n  Maine's Department of Transportation collects fatal accident data \nregarding large trucks, and more than 96 percent are on secondary \nroads, not the interstate, including the portion of I-95 that has a \npermanent exemption. Crash rates for Maine trucks on secondary roads \nare 7 to 10 times higher than on interstate highways.\n  Trucks belong on the highway, but interstate weight limits are \ninconsistent across State lines, and shippers are forced to use \nsecondary roads to move goods through States still restricted by weight \nlimits established in the 1950s. For example, in the 122 miles between \nHampden and Houlton, ME, a common route for shippers, these legal \n100,000-pound trucks are forced to pass by 9 schools, 270 \nintersections, and more than 3,000 driveways.\n  Maine's highways are particularly suited for six-axle truck traffic, \nas most of the interstate system was designed to carry freight--\nincluding munitions and heavy equipment--to and from the former Loring \nAir Force Base. Time and time again, the Maine Department of \nTransportation has stated that it endorses an increased weight limit, \nand Maine's roads can safely manage heavier trucks with six axles. If a \nState's chief highway engineer can certify the safety of a route, and \nthe condition of a road, a State should have the flexibility to change \nits weight limit on interstate highways.\n  The significance of this permanent change cannot be overstated. \nMaine's secondary roads will be significantly safer when trucks are \nreturned to the highway with stop lights and pedestrian interactions. I \nthank my colleagues for their continued support of this measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my colleague from Oklahoma was addressing \nthe frustration that exists on the part of the American public with \nthis Chamber for not doing its job. I must say, on that point, we are \nin complete agreement. I hear in every townhall, in every conversation \nwith constituents, the question of why is it that when what we need \nmost in this Nation are jobs, this Chamber, the Senate, is unable to \nhold a debate over a jobs bill? Just last week we had a debate not over \na jobs bill but whether to proceed to the jobs bill. Unfortunately, it \nwas defeated, not because the majority did not want to get to the bill \nbut because the minority opposed it and invoked a 60-vote hurdle, a \nhurdle that was never routinely used in this Chamber in the past.\n  The fear of debating a jobs bill in this Chamber by my colleagues is \nirrational. The American people want us to wrestle with creating jobs. \nHave people not gone out and talked to their constituents? Do they not \nknow the unemployment rate in this Nation? Do they not hear from \nfathers and mothers who are worried about keeping shelter over their \nfamily or worried about their mortgage, their rent, their utilities?\n  I do not understand how anyone could say: Let's not have a debate \nabout jobs on the floor of the Senate. Yet it was a unanimous ``no'' \nvote from across the aisle when we proposed having the debate over the \njobs bill. I think it is so important that all of us in this Chamber \nwho actually receive a paycheck understand the challenge and the plight \nof American citizens who either are working part time in multiple jobs \ntrying to make ends meet or who have lost their job and are completely \nunemployed.\n  Over the past 10 years, we have lost 5 million manufacturing jobs in \nthis country. Over the last 10 years, we have lost 50,000 factories in \nthis country. Working families are in a tremendous crunch. I thought I \nwould simply share some stories from back home because there does not \nseem to be many people listening to folks back home and their concern \nthat this Chamber debate and produce a jobs bill and get it to the \nPresident.\n  Jerry from Linn County says:\n\n       I was laid off in April, 2009. It took me 2 years and 2 \n     months to find a contracting job. I appreciate having a job, \n     however I have no\n\n[[Page S6654]]\n\n     benefits, no holiday pay, no vacation pay, no medical or \n     dental coverage. My wife recently suffered a badly broken \n     leg. We have no insurance. Her injury required surgery and a \n     hospital stay. Now we are in danger of losing the house that \n     I bought in 1993.\n       I am told that my contract has been renewed for another \n     year. That will bring us to May of 2012. Then I have to leave \n     for three months before I can return. I am given no promise \n     of being able to return to work there.\n\n  That is Jerry's story that he sent in to share.\n  Virginia from Hillsboro writes:\n\n       In February 2010, my department at my company was advised \n     we would be laid off after transitioning our job duties to a \n     replacement staff in India. It felt like quite a blow.\n       Prior to the layoff, the company had not given us raises \n     for 3-4 years, even though they were reporting profits. Half \n     of our department was laid off within a few months.\n       I filed a TAA petition to attempt to attain additional \n     funds or schooling for the people at our department, but it \n     was denied.\n       The year before I was laid off, my daughter, who lives with \n     us with her son, changed jobs and then was laid off from the \n     new job. Four months after my layoff, my husband was advised \n     the rest of his department is being laid off after their job \n     duties were transitioned to an off-shore site; hopefully, he \n     will have work until March.\n       My daughter, myself, and my husband are all looking for \n     work.\n       We moved my mother up with us three years ago, so now we \n     have four generations living in our home. I have no idea what \n     will happen if none of us can find work. My husband served \n     his time in the Army and he and I have always worked full-\n     time, steady jobs. It feels like we're being punished for \n     spending our lives working to take care of our family and to \n     keep a roof over our heads.\n       I read in the papers this morning that things are improving \n     in Oregon, but, honestly, I don't see it. Americans are \n     hurting.\n       Americans need jobs! We want to work and need to work! We \n     are not lazy--we are innovators and always have been! We need \n     to regain our pride in our country, help each other and quit \n     focusing on greed.\n\n  That was Virginia from Hillsboro. And if you didn't catch the \nbeginning, her letter started by saying that she and her team were laid \noff after training replacements in India to take over their jobs. This \nterrible economy is resulting in multiple generations of her family \nwithout work.\n  Julio from southwest Portland says:\n\n       I am 31 years old with my first baby on the way and I can \n     honestly tell you I am nowhere where I thought I would be at \n     this point in my life. Upon graduating high school, I joined \n     the Navy. I did a 6-year enlistment. My mother was a \n     housekeeper and my father was an ordained minister and they \n     were unable to help me with the expenses of higher education, \n     so I took full advantage of the GI bill once I was honorably \n     discharged in 2004.\n       I completed my degree in three years and nine months and \n     graduated with a bachelor's in business management and a \n     minor in economics. I strongly felt that as a 6-year veteran \n     of the Navy, with a degree in business, and being bilingual, \n     that I would have no problem finding employment.\n       Unfortunately, I had the misfortune of graduating just as \n     the financial world collapsed in 2008. Three years later, I \n     work two jobs and still make less than $30,000 a year. I have \n     interviewed for several great jobs, but due to the same \n     amount of people applying for the same position I have lost \n     out to individuals with a great amount of experience.\n       I know I can do well, but in our current environment I feel \n     as though I don't even have a chance. Anything you can do to \n     create better paying jobs in Oregon would be greatly \n     appreciated.\n\n  That was Julio from southwest Portland.\n  These stories that are coming from our single parents, coming from \nour husbands, our wives, are coming from folks who are taking care of \ntheir parents. They are coming from folks who are trying to take care \nof their children, and you can feel the sense of frustration. You can \nfeel the sense of panic in this economy.\n  Last week this Chamber debated whether to have a debate about \ncreating jobs. My colleagues across the aisle said, no, we will not let \nthe jobs bill come to the floor. I must say I am extraordinarily \nfrustrated that at this time in this economy, with so many Americans \nhurting, my colleagues are unable to summon the connection to the \nchallenge of the American family so that we can have a full debate on \nthis floor on a jobs bill.\n  These families that are writing, as you can tell from the letters, \nserved their country. Several of them were in the service. They played \nby the rules. They worked hard. But they have been let down again and \nagain by a political system that has protected tax breaks for the \nwealthy over creating jobs and opportunities for working families.\n  I hope we will have another chance to decide whether to debate a jobs \nbill, and I hope every Member of this Chamber will say yes to taking \nand shutting down tax breaks, $20 billion a year for oil companies that \nare stashing that money in the bank and not creating a single job with \nit, and instead take that $20 billion and put it to work on energy \nretrofits, which is, according to every economist, the best bang for \nthe buck we could possibly have in creating jobs. You cannot outsource \na single bit of the labor, and virtually all of the products are made \nright here in our economy, from the pink cotton candy insulation to the \ndouble-paned windows to the caulk. That is just one example of the kind \nof conversation we should be having.\n  We should be having a conversation about whether we should be helping \nour school districts hire teachers. Some will agree, some will not, but \nlet's have the debate. If someone wants to propose an amendment and say \nwe don't want to help our school districts, we can do something better \nto create jobs, let's have that debate. Let's not sit on our hands when \nAmerican families are suffering. Let's get to work and create jobs that \nthe families across America need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/18/senate-section/article/S6654-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6654-S6656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            EDUCATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am delighted the Senator from \nColorado is in the chair when I speak. I want to speak on a subject \nwhere he is the foremost expert on the day-to-day operation of school \nsystems. He will appreciate and understand what I am about to say in \nways that many people will not.\n  Yesterday I had a telephone conversation with a member of an \neditorial board of a prominent newspaper in this country who asked me \nthis question. She said: Senator Alexander, how can you and the \nNational Education Association possibly be together on the teacher \nevaluation question? How can you justify that? Then she said: When has \nthe NEA ever done anything to encourage the evaluation of school \nteachers? That is a good question. Both questions are good questions. \nWhat she was referring to, of course, was the draft announced yesterday \nby Senator Harkin and Senator Enzi, who are the ranking members of the \nSenate committee that handles education.\n  It included a provision on evaluation of teachers and principals. At \nmy suggestion, and that of others, but contrary to the suggestion of a \nnumber of people, it does not include an order from Washington that all \n15,000 school districts have a teacher and principal evaluation system. \nIt does not include a definition of what it should be, and it doesn't \ninclude the opportunity for the Education Secretary, whoever it may be, \nto then issue a number of regulations defining what a teacher and \nprincipal evaluation system would be in Denver or in Maryville or in \nNashville. What it does include is the following: For the first time it \nspecifically allows a State to spend its title II money that is the \n$2.5 billion of Federal funds that goes to States. It allows that money \nto be spent to design and implement a principal-teacher evaluation \nsystem that is related to student achievement.\n  In my view, that is the holy grail of public education. If we could \never figure out how to do that and to get everybody to do it, I think \nit would do more than any other single thing we could do to help our \nchildren learn what they need to know and be able to do, except some \nlaw that would make everybody better parents, and I don't know how to \npass such a law. So that is the first thing the Harkin-Enzi draft \nincludes about teacher and principal evaluation.\n  In Tennessee, for example, that would mean there would be about $41 \nmillion this year that could be spent for that purpose. There are about \n63,000 teachers in Tennessee, so that is about $660 per teacher per \nyear of Federal funds that could be used to design and implement a \nteacher and principal evaluation system related to student achievement. \nThis is the first time that has been specifically allowed.\n\n[[Page S6655]]\n\n  Secondly, there is something in the draft legislation called the \nTeacher Incentive Fund. Many school superintendents, such as the \ndistinguished Senator from Colorado, know that program very well. We \nknow in Tennessee because of the work in Memphis. Basically it is a \ngrant that was included as a result of language in No Child Left \nBehind. Secretary Spellings then beefed up the program, got the money \nappropriated, and it recognizes the difficulty of figuring out how to \nreward and evaluate teachers in a fair way, especially if you are going \nto base compensation on that. It says, if you want to do it, we will \ngive you some money to help you try to do it. So you can do it one way \nin Knoxville, another way in Denver, another way in Los Angeles. \nHopefully what will happen over time is we will find lots of fair ways \nto reward outstanding teaching and determine outstanding teaching, and \nsmaller school districts and other school districts can borrow ideas \nfrom one another. That has been a big success. Secretary Duncan \nsupports it. It has support all the way around. President Obama has \nsupported it.\n  The third thing that is available for helping develop teacher \nevaluation systems is a program called Race To The Top. There is $700 \nmillion in Federal money for fiscal year 2011. That is a lot of money. \nStates had to compete based upon, among other things, their ability to \ndevelop teacher and principal evaluation systems. I can brag about this \nbecause I had nothing to do with it, at least recently. My State of \nTennessee won that competition. It won $500 million, which has been \nspent to develop and implement an evaluation program for all the \nteachers in Tennessee.\n  Then there is another item in this draft which fits in here. I would \ncall it the Secretary's report card. All previous Education \nSecretaries--and I am one of them--have tried to use the bully pulpit. \nSo have Presidents. When I was Governor of Tennessee and we were \nworking on a master teacher program, President Reagan came to Tennessee \nto say it was a good idea. That was very helpful to me at that time. He \ndidn't say this is how you should do it. He said, I recognize what you \nare doing and I applaud it and encourage it.\n  Bill Bennett, when he was the Secretary of Education for President \nReagan, went to Chicago and said they had the worst schools in the \ncountry. That made a lot of news.\n  But when a Secretary uses that bully pulpit, he can make a \ndifference. We have a very good Education Secretary right now, Arne \nDuncan. What he now has at his disposal no one else has had before. He \nhas 8 or 9 years of reporting requirements of schools all across the \ncountry, and there are about 100,000 public schools for which he has \nthis information. He can go around the country and say: This is good. \nThis is bad. I will put the spotlight here. I will brag on this. Let's \ndo more of this. He can do that in a way that nobody ever could before.\n  So this is what is in the draft we are talking about that would for \nthe first time get the Federal Government significantly involved in \ncreating an environment for teacher-principal evaluations related to \nstudent achievement. One is $2.5 billion of Federal dollars in title \nII. All of it can be used for this purpose if States want to. No. 2, \nthere is the Teachers Incentive Fund. That was $399 million this year. \nRace to the Top was nearly $700 million. Then there is the Secretary's \nReport Card.\n  I responded to my editor, who called me, and said: Look, I know \nsomething about this. In 1983 and 1984, when I was Governor of \nTennessee, we became the first State in the country to create a \nstatewide system for rewarding outstanding teaching and paying those \nteachers based upon that.\n  At that time, in Tennessee--or anywhere in the country--not one \nteacher made one penny more for being a good teacher. Not one teacher \nmade one penny more for being a good teacher. So that is what we did in \n1983 and 1984.\n  She said: How hard could that be? Everybody knows some teachers are \nbetter than others. We all know that when we put our children into \nschool. Everybody knows that. Why can't we evaluate teachers? How hard \ncould that be?\n  Well, I was a little bit amused by that because those were exactly \nthe same kinds of questions I was asking in frustration 30 years ago. I \nwould say it to every college of education in the country. I could not \nfind a single one that would help me in any significant way evaluate \noutstanding teaching.\n  Now, that may sound like an overstatement. But it is not much of an \noverstatement.\n  I had dean after dean, education professor after education professor \nsay: You cannot do that. You cannot determine that one teacher is \nbetter than another one, especially if you plan to reward them, \ncompensate them based upon that.\n  I found that patently ridiculous--patently ridiculous.\n  Just like the editor was trying to tell me every parent knows that. \nMy mother put me in one first grade instead of another first grade in \nMaryville, TN, because she thought one teacher was better than the \nother. She had an opinion about that. She was a teacher herself, so \nperhaps she knew.\n  We all have those judgments to make. IBM hires a lot of education \npeople. They have teachers and they know some are better than others \nand they pay them correspondingly. Colleges and universities hire a lot \nof teachers. They pay teachers all the way up the ladder, from lower \namounts to very high amounts for distinguished professors. They can \nfind a way to make a distinction, but somehow we got into this rut 30 \nyears ago that said: We cannot make any distinction among teachers \nbased upon their ability to teach, especially related to student \nachievement, and then we especially cannot take the next step and pay \nsome more than others.\n  The reason I thought that was such an urgent problem 30 years ago was \nbecause we cannot trap women in our schools anymore to teach. Women are \nin the marketplace now. That is what we did for many years. So if we \nwant to attract and keep the very best men and women teaching in our \nclassrooms, we need to be able to recognize excellence when we find it, \nto encourage it, and to reward it with compensation.\n  I can remember sitting around with a group of Governors in 1980 when \nthe late Bill Clement, Governor of Texas, said to mostly a group of \nDemocratic Governors: When is one of you--and he used another word--so-\nand-sos going to get the courage to take on the NEA? What he meant was, \nevery single one of us knew that the National Education Association had \nits foot on everyone who tried to pay some teachers more than others.\n  Well, I was young and maybe did not know better, so in my second term \nI created a bipartisan commission with the Democratic leaders of the \nlegislature, and we set out to figure out a number of things about \neducation, including a master teacher program. The long and the short \nof it was, we did that. It took a year and a half of my time as \nGovernor. I must have spent 40 or 50 percent of my time every day \nengaged in an ongoing brawl, mainly with the National Education \nAssociation, as to whether we could do this.\n  They defeated my proposals in the first year. I came back in the \nsecond year and won by one vote, and we put in place a voluntary \nprogram that before long up to 10,000 Tennessee teachers voluntarily \nwent into a career ladder program, became master teachers, and many got \n10-month and 11-month and 12-month contracts. It raised their pay. It \nimproved their retirement. It gave them distinction. I have teacher \nafter teacher come to see me today to thank me for that, including the \ncurrent leadership of the Tennessee Education Association, whose \norganization killed the program after I left office.\n  So it is appropriate to ask: Senator Alexander, why are you and the \nNational Education Association in cahoots on any sort of teacher \nevaluation proposal?\n  Well, I want to say briefly why. A lot has happened since 1983, 1984. \nGovernor Hunt, Democratic Governor of North Carolina, and others have \nworked to create the National Board for Professional Teaching \nStandards. The NEA and the American Federation of Teachers both \nparticipated in that. That was a step forward in recognizing and \ncertifying outstanding teachers.\n  AFT, the American Federation of Teachers, has always been open to \nthis proposal. I remember the late Albert Shanker telling me: Well, if \nwe have master plumbers, we can have master teachers, especially if you \nare going to pay them more. He invited me to come out to his national \nconvention in Los Angeles to talk about it.\n\n[[Page S6656]]\n\n  President Bush and Secretary Spellings, with the Teacher Incentive \nFund, and President Obama and Secretary Duncan, who have taken a lead \non this, despite the fact that it is not popular with many of the \nconstituents of their party, have stuck their necks out on this, and I \napplaud them for that.\n  The Gates Foundation has put money behind it. Bill Gates has told me \npersonally this is one of the two things he wants to do in education \nwith the time and the money he has.\n  So there is a consensus. Everybody might not say, as I do, it is the \n``Holy Grail'' of K-12, but there is a consensus that finding fair ways \nto reward outstanding teaching through teacher and principal evaluation \nrelated to student achievement is urgently important.\n  So it is very tempting just to pass a law in Washington to say: Let's \norder it. Let's just do it. Well, that is not the way things work in \nthe United States of America. We did that with professional \ndevelopment. The law now says, with all that $2.5 billion: Do it. Have \nprofessional development programs.\n  I do not know what the Senator from Colorado thinks, but my view--and \nI do not think Secretary Duncan would mind my repeating his comments \noften--that is the biggest waste of money we have in the Federal \neducation program. It is not well used. We say: Do it, and so they have \nall these programs. Teachers know it is a waste of time, and everybody \nknows it is a waste of time. We are not spending that money wisely.\n  So why are we to think, if we just say, create a teacher evaluation \nsystem all across the country in 15,000 school districts, people will \njust say, OK, they have to do it to get the money, and they will just \ndo it? I think it would be the kiss of death for the whole movement. \nAlthough it is tempting to do it that way.\n  Then, yesterday, on my way up here, in my little hometown of \nMaryville, TN, I picked up the newspaper and it reminded me of why I so \nstrongly believe it is a good idea to create an environment in which \nschool districts and States can create teacher and principal evaluation \nsystems and it is a bad idea to order it, define it, and regulate it \nfrom Washington.\n  Here is the headline. I mentioned this yesterday in my remarks on the \nfloor: ``Evaluation of Teachers Contentious.''\n  Now, here is the State of Tennessee--Mr. President, could I ask \nunanimous consent for 3 more minutes?\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I certainly have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Kansas, and I will kind of \nspeed up my comments a little bit. But I might take 4 minutes, unless \nthat is a problem.\n  Mr. MORAN. I certainly have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Kansas because I would like \nto make my point, if I may.\n  Remember, the State of Tennessee won Race to the Top. It has been \nworking on teacher evaluation for 25 years. It developed the Sanders \nModel, which was the first real way that we related student achievement \nto teacher performance. May sound easy. It is pretty hard. Nobody else \nwould do it.\n  This professor at the University of Tennessee's Agriculture \nDepartment, a statistician, said: I think I can do it. He did it, and \nit is being used all around the country in many places--but not \neveryplace. Some do not have confidence in it.\n  So Tennessee wins $500 million in Race to the Top--to do what? Have a \nteacher and principal evaluation program. Here they are doing it. \nTwenty-five years of experience, and it is the front page news: \n``Evaluation of Teachers Contentious''--all the struggles with that \nprogram.\n  Then we get here into what is involved. It says:\n\n       Under the new system--\n\n  This is the Tennessee system of evaluation--\n\n     tenured teachers will be evaluated at least four times each \n     year. Nontenured teachers will be evaluated at least six \n     times each year. . . .\n       Teacher effectiveness ratings are calculated using a \n     formula that is 50 percent qualitative and 50 percent \n     quantitative. The quantitative portion combines student \n     growth (35 percent) and student achievement (15 percent).\n\n  Now, they are having a tough time down in Maryville, TN, and \nNashville, TN, about implementing their own proposal. It says:\n\n       State officials are also traveling across the state to meet \n     with stakeholders.\n       The state Department of Education's Advisory Group will \n     bring revision recommendations to [the] Education \n     Commissioner. . . .\n\n  That's Kevin Huffman, one of the best in the country.\n\n       Based on the proposed revisions, the recommendations might \n     need to be brought before the State Board of Education.\n\n  Do we really want them to come to Washington after they get through \nwith that and say: OK, now we have it figured out. We are having a \nreally hard time doing it. You tell us what to do. You define what we \nought to do. And may we please have your permission to do things this \nway instead of that way? I think not. I think that would be the kiss of \ndeath for any movement for teacher-principal evaluation.\n  So my plea is that we show some restraint, that we recognize that \njust a little movement here makes a big difference there when we are \ndealing with 3.2 million teachers, when we are dealing with 100,000 \nschools, and 15,000 school districts.\n  Secretary Duncan, whom I greatly admire, says:\n\n       A comprehensive evaluation system based on multiple \n     measures, including student achievement, is essential for \n     education reform to move forward. We cannot retreat from \n     reform.\n\n  He is exactly right. But that does not mean we need a national school \nboard. That is what a Governor, a legislator, a school district, local \npeople ought to be doing, working with teachers.\n  So the NEA and I may have the same position today on whether to have \na mandate definition and regulation from Washington on teacher \nevaluation. We may agree. I cannot speak for them. But I will be \nwatching--as I did 30 years ago, as I did 15 years ago, as I did 20 \nyears ago as Education Secretary--to see what they are doing in \nTennessee.\n  Are they making it easier for Kevin Huffman and the Governor and the \nlegislature to implement this award-winning teacher evaluation program \nor are they making it harder?\n  So I hope we will have a good, full debate as we move to the markup \nin the next few days. I respect the enthusiasm of all those who want to \nbegin a process for teacher and principal evaluation. I would like to \nbelieve that no one wants it to move more than I do. I have watched it \nfor 30 years. I have fought everyone who is against it for 30 years, \nand I strongly believe the right way to do it is to recognize that \neducation is like jobs. Both are national concerns, both are of \ninterest to the Federal Government, but we cannot create them from \nhere. We have to create an environment in which local people, State \npeople, can create better schools and create better jobs, and, in this \ncase, a mandate definition and regulation from Washington, a national \nschool board, would be a terrible error.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I thank the Senator from Kansas \nfor his courtesy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Tennessee for \nhis remarks. I believe that while what happens in Washington is \nimportant, we really do change the world one person at a time, and it \nhappens at home in classrooms across America each and every day, and \nthere is no more noble profession, other than parenthood, than that of \na teacher. They make a tremendous difference in the lives of Americans \neach and every day, and I commend them for that. I also commend the \nSenator from Tennessee for his passion for education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/18/senate-section/article/S6656-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6656-S6657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING THE ARTHUR D. SIMONS CENTER\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I want to talk about education that is \noccurring at Fort Leavenworth, KS. I want to call my colleagues' \nattention to the important work that is being done in our Nation's \nheartland to educate the next generation of military leadership at the \nCommand & General Staff College. The CGSC is the intellectual center of \nthe U.S. Army and has trained\n\n[[Page S6657]]\n\nmany of our Nation's legendary leaders: Generals Marshall, MacArthur, \nPatton, Eisenhower, Arnold, and Bradley. Today, the college continues \nto prepare a new generation of leaders who are tasked with protecting \nour country from threats here at home and abroad, around the world.\n\n  The 21st-century national security challenges we face are often \ncomplex and require the cooperation of several Federal agencies. It is \nnot uncommon for officials from the Department of State to be working \nalongside the Department of Homeland Security or Department of Defense \non the same project. From the provincial reconstruction teams in \nAfghanistan to responding to hurricanes or manmade disasters, the \ncapability of agencies to work together is vital to the success of this \nmission. By working together and learning from previous mistakes, our \ngovernment will become better prepared to keep our country safe and \nsecure.\n  To improve coordination within agencies tasked with our national \nsecurity, the Command and General Staff College Foundation, under the \nleadership of retired COL Bob Ulin, established the Arthur D. Simons \nCenter for the Study of Interagency Cooperation at Fort Leavenworth in \nKansas. Thanks to a very generous financial gift from Ross Perot, the \ncenter was created last April and named after Mr. Perot's good friend, \nretired COL Arthur ``Bull'' Simons, who led a rescue mission of U.S. \nSpecial Forces to free American prisoners in Vietnam in 1970. The \nSimons Center focuses on generating solutions to challenges often \nencountered when government agencies must work together. By drawing on \nreal-world experience, the Simons Center works to facilitate broader \nand more effective cooperation within our government at the operational \nand tactical levels through research, analysis, publications, and \noutreach.\n  The center is also actively engaged in working with Members of \nCongress. Most recently, the center has been working with the Senate \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, of which I am a \nmember, and on legislation to help facilitate better communication and \ncoordination among personnel in the national security and homeland \nsecurity fields.\n  The Interagency Personnel Rotation Act is scheduled to be considered \nin committee tomorrow and would give security professionals the \nopportunity to work alongside one another in a different agency for a \nperiod of time. The bill reminds me of the old saying ``Before you \njudge a man, walk a mile in his shoes.'' By giving staff the \nopportunity to work within another agency--to walk within his shoes--I \nimagine perspective will change and cooperation will increase. If the \nlegislation is approved by Congress, the Simons Center will play a role \nin implementing these policies.\n  In addition to offering policy recommendations, the center also \npartners with several organizations to host conferences focused on how \nto improve interagency coordination. For example, the center recently \ncohosted a symposium on interagency transitions in Iraq, Afghanistan, \nand beyond with the Combined Arms Center and the U.S. Institute of \nPeace. Conferences such as these help provide senior government \nofficials a helpful forum to further analyze ongoing challenges and \ndevelop practical solutions.\n  I wish to thank the center's executive director, Ted Strickler, who \njoined the center after a 30-year career in the State Department, for \nhis hard work over the past year to get the center up and running. I \nalso wish to recognize retired COL Bob Ulin of the Command and General \nStaff College Foundation for his ongoing dedication to this important \ninitiative. Under the colonel's leadership, the foundation has \nsuccessfully supported our country's oldest and largest military staff \ncollege in its mission to educate the next generation of our military \nleaders.\n  Finally, I urge my colleagues to take a closer look at the valuable \nwork taking place at the Simons Center. We all recognize the importance \nof improving our government's ability to harness the strength of its \nvarious agencies. By promoting interagency cooperation, the Simons \nCenter is helping to strengthen our national security capabilities so \nthat our country and its citizens are better prepared for their future.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

TAPP\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the Honorable \nJudge David A. Tapp, an exemplary Kentuckian and recent recipient of \nthe National Association of Drug Court Professionals, NADCP, \nprestigious ``All Rise Leadership Award.'' Judge Tapp currently serves \nas a circuit court judge for Lincoln, Pulaski, and Rockcastle Counties \nin my home State of Kentucky.\n  Judge Tapp was honored at the NADCP Annual Training Conference that \nwas held in July in Washington, DC. The annual conference is considered \nthe world's largest on substance abuse and the criminal justice system. \nChris Deutsch, director of communications for the NADCP, praised Judge \nTapp for being an outstanding ambassador for drug courts both in \nKentucky and around the world saying, ``It is an honor for the NADCP to \npresent Judge Tapp with this award.'' Judge Tapp was recognized \nalongside actors Martin Sheen, Matthew Perry, and Harry Lennix during \nthe closing ceremony of the event.\n  Let me add here that I had the pleasure of seeing Judge Tapp here in \nWashington this past July when he attended the NADCP conference. I was \nhonored to be presented with the NADCP's ``All Rise Leadership Award,'' \nand one of those presenters was Judge Tapp himself. I am a longtime \nsupporter of Kentucky's drug courts and was pleased to meet with Judge \nTapp and his fellow Kentucky drug court judges on this important issue. \nHe is truly an impressive fellow.\n  In addition to his regular duties as a circuit judge, Judge Tapp \nvolunteers his time in presiding over the drug court for the three \ncounties and has been doing so since 2005. The drug court is similar to \nsome 2,700 others nationwide and serves seriously drug-addicted \nindividuals through intense treatment and supervision, says Judge Tapp.\n  ``I do drug court for the small moments,'' said Tapp. ``At some point \nduring the process you look at them and you see a new confidence. You \nsee a gleam in their eye that wasn't there before, and you know that \nthey get it. I take great pride in these efforts and applaud the hard \nwork and dedication of all drug court staff members. These people \nvolunteer their time and effort to do good deeds for thousands of \npeople within the Commonwealth annually and they get almost no \nrecognition for these efforts. They deserve a great amount of credit.''\n  I would ask all of my Senate colleagues to join me in congratulating \nthe Honorable Judge David A. Tapp in receiving such a distinguished \naward for his efforts in rehabilitating drug offenders. Judge Tapp's \nwork in drug court is commendable and he has served as a model for \nothers in Kentucky and around the country. The Pulaski County \nCommonwealth Journal published an article in September highlighting \nJudge Tapp's accomplishments. I ask unanimous consent that the full \narticle be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S6658]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     [From the Pulaski County Commonwealth Journal, Sept. 30, 2011]\n\n                  Tapp Wins Prestigious Judicial Award\n\n       A local judge received a prestigious award earlier this \n     summer for his efforts as part of a national program that \n     aims to rehabilitate drug offenders.\n       Pulaski County Circuit Court Judge David A. Tapp was \n     awarded with the National Association of Drug Court \n     Professionals ``All Rise'' award during a star-studded \n     conference in Washington, DC.\n       ``Judge Tapp is an outstanding ambassador for Drug Courts \n     both in Kentucky and around the world,'' said National \n     Association of Drug Court Professionals Director of \n     Communications Chris Deutsch in a press release. ``His work \n     in Drug Court has affected countless lives and his interview \n     with Congressman Rogers will be critical to helping Drug \n     Courts maintain funding in the coming budget cycle.\n       ``It is an honor for NADCP to present Judge Tapp with this \n     award,'' Deutsch continued.\n       The NADCP Annual Training Conference is considered the \n     world's largest on substance abuse and the criminal justice \n     system, according to a press release provided by the NADCP. \n     This year's event took place from July 17 to July 20 and \n     brought nearly 4,000 state and federal justice leaders, \n     celebrities, judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, \n     clinicians, police and probation officers, military veterans, \n     business owners, Drug Court graduates and their family \n     members to the nation's capital. Tapp was recognized along \n     with actors Martin Sheen, Matthew Perry and Harry Lennix \n     during the closing ceremony of the conference on July 20.\n       Tapp was honored for his role in securing and conducting an \n     interview with Congressman Hal Rogers (R-KY), Chairman of \n     Appropriations in the U.S. House of Representatives, last \n     December for NADCP's All Rise Magazine.\n       ``The interview was so successful that it was featured as \n     the cover story of the quarterly,'' stated the press release.\n       During the interview, Tapp asked Rogers if he felt it was \n     important to further expand Drug Courts to reach more \n     individuals.\n       According to the press release, Rogers responded, ``Yes, \n     I'd like to see Drug Courts available everywhere. I've seen \n     how effective they are. We did not have Drug Courts in my \n     district and now that we have them, I've seen the difference \n     that they can bring.''\n       Tapp's remarks ``brought nearly 3,700 attendees to their \n     feet,'' stated the press release.\n       ``I do Drug Court for the small moments,'' said Tapp upon \n     receiving the award. ``When you look at an offender who has \n     struggled . . . and at some point during the process that \n     small moment comes where you look at them and you see a new \n     confidence.\n       ``You see a gleam in their eye that wasn't there before, \n     and you know that they get it. That's why I do Drug Court.''\n       Tapp, who serves Pulaski, Lincoln and Rockcastle counties, \n     has presided over Drug Court since 2005. Circuit Court Judge \n     Jeffrey T.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a native \nLouisville business that is celebrating its 100th anniversary this \nyear, Louisville Plate Glass, and the company's owner, my good friend, \nBill Stone. Louisville Plate Glass specializes in custom glass products \nsuch as laminated and insulated glass and was founded in 1911. The \ncompany is among an elite group of Louisville firms that have survived \n100 years of business success.\n  Louisville Plate Glass has been hit hard by the struggling economy \nand faltering housing market that we are all familiar with, due to its \nclose attachment to the real estate industry. Owner Bill Stone, 75, \nreclaimed ownership of the business in 2009 in order to ensure the \nbusiness stays afloat. At the time, Bill was a partner in parent \ncompany United Glass Corp. when it announced its plans to sell \nLouisville Plate Glass to consolidate the company's business into other \nholdings outside the State.\n  Bill's pride took control however, and he decided to trade in a \nportion of his shares in United Glass Corp. to independently reacquire \nLouisville Plate Glass. ``It's not about money,'' Bill said. ``It's \nabout pride now. It's about making it a success again.'' Bill says he \nis taking a ``survive-and-advance'' strategy with the business until \nthe real estate market picks up again, and he rarely takes a salary \nfrom the company to further help company profits.\n  Louisville Plate Glass has recently had major projects at William \nPaterson University in Wayne, N.J., and also an outlet mall in New \nHampshire, and Bill is optimistic that the real-estate industry will \npick up soon and the business will grow. The company is also \nresponsible for work on other notable projects in my hometown of \nLouisville, including Churchill Downs, the Humana Building, Louisville \nSlugger Field, Preston Pointe, and the University of Louisville Medical \nFaculty Building.\n  Bill is currently flirting with the idea of adding a tempering plant \nto grow the business. He says there is a ``50-50'' chance that he will \ninvest in the new plant, which would add 20 employees and would bring \nin-house the production of safety and architectural glass work that is \ncurrently outsourced. The new plant would require several million \ndollars in investment, and Bill says his decision will be based upon \nwhether he can secure State or local funding for the project.\n  ``I take a great deal of pride in this business,'' says Bill, as he \nis determined to protect the 30 employees currently working at the \ncompany's headquarters on West Broadway. For anyone who is concerned \nwith surviving the current down economy in similar fashion, Bill has \nthree suggestions: always keep a strong balance sheet with cash \nreserves even when times are good, build the best product and provide \nthe best service and the money will follow, and finally, answer every \nclient phone call and customers will take notice.\n  Mr. President, I would ask all of my Senate colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating Louisville Plate Glass as it celebrates its 100th \nanniversary. Owner Bill Stone's wisdom and effective business practices \nwill, I hope, provide the company with great opportunities for success \nmoving forward. Louisville Plate Glass is an inspiration to the \nbusinesses of Louisville and the people of Kentucky, and it is my hope \nthe company will continue to prosper in the years to come. The \nLouisville publication, Business First, recently published an article \nrecognizing the company's accomplishments over the past 100 years. I \nask unanimous consent that the full article appear in the Record as \nfollows.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From Business First, Aug. 26, 2011]\n\n    Louisville Plate Glass Strives to Survive as It Marks Its 100th \n                              Anniversary\n\n                             (By Ed Green)\n\n       Louisville Plate Glass Co. owner Bill Stone admits that he \n     should be celebrating a major milestone.\n       His business, which traces its roots to 1911, is among an \n     elite group of Louisville firms to last 100 years.\n       Stone, a longtime Louisville businessman, recognizes the \n     achievement and said he is proud the firm has lasted this \n     long. But he's not exactly jumping for joy. Louisville Plate \n     Glass produces custom glass products, designing and \n     assembling products such as insulated and laminated glass.\n       Its business is closely attached to the commercial real \n     estate industry, so the company has seen declining business \n     in recent years as real-estate development and construction \n     practically halted, he said.\n\n\n                            Back In Business\n\n       That's one reason Stone, 75, took back ownership of the \n     business in 2009 from Louisville-based United Glass Corp., a \n     partnership in which he was involved.\n       Now, he said, he is working to get the business back on its \n     feet and protect the about 30 jobs remaining at the company's \n     headquarters and plant on West Broadway.\n       ``In our 100th year, we're taking a licking but keep on \n     ticking,'' Stone said.\n       He declined to say whether the business remains profitable \n     but said sales are in the ``mid-seven figures'' range and \n     about 40 percent of the record levels set in 2007.\n       Employment has dropped from its peak of about 50, but none \n     of the job cuts has come from layoffs.\n\n[[Page S6659]]\n\n       Stone, who has been taking a salary from the business only \n     rarely, said he doesn't want to sound like the situation is \n     dire. But the last few years have been tough, he said.\n       ``I feel a great deal of pride in the business,'' he said, \n     adding that he could have retired with the money he earned \n     from the business and other investments.\n       Instead, in 2009, he traded in a portion of his shares in \n     United Glass, a company he helped found that owned several \n     glass businesses, to re-acquire Louisville Plate. He declined \n     to disclose the value of the sale, which was a cashless \n     transaction, he said.\n       Stone's decision, he said, came after his partners said \n     they were considering closing Louisville Plate Glass and \n     consolidating its business into other holdings outside the \n     state.\n       The partners sold the other United Glass assets earlier \n     this year to Florida-based private-equity firm Sun Capital \n     Partners Inc. for an undisclosed amount, and Stone now is \n     involved only in Louisville Plate Glass, he said.\n       Officials with United Glass could not be reached for \n     comment.\n       Stone said he is taking a ``survive-and-advance'' strategy \n     with his business until commercial real estate picks up.\n       ``It's not about money,'' he said. ``It's about pride now. \n     It's about making it a success again.''\n\n\n                   Business Starting to Pick Up Again\n\n       Stone said that although there is no clear end in sight to \n     the recession's impact on the real estate industry, he is \n     optimistic that business will return.\n       The company recently had major projects at William Paterson \n     University in Wayne, N.J., and at an outlet mall in New \n     Hampshire.\n       Stone said much of the work in the past couple of years has \n     come from the public sector, but he is starting to see more \n     plans coming together for private commercial real estate \n     projects.\n       There also is a lot of interest in improving the efficiency \n     of windows, which is one of the company's niches.\n       And Louisville Plate Glass has started selling fire-rated \n     glass that acts as a barrier to heat and is required in many \n     large buildings, such as schools, hospitals and public \n     institutions.\n\n\n                         Opportunity for Growth\n\n       Stone has not decided whether he will invest in growth but \n     said the chances are about ``50-50'' that he will add a \n     tempering plant to his Louisville operation.\n       The project would require an investment of several million \n     dollars and would add about 15 to 20 employees.\n       The plant would bring in-house the work, which creates \n     safety and architectural glass through heat treatments. The \n     company currently outsources the tempering work.\n       Stone said his decision likely will be based on whether he \n     can secure state or local incentives for the project. He \n     added that he has not yet sought help.\n       ``I just haven't decided if, at this point in my career, I \n     want to make that kind of investment.''\n\n\n                            Notable Projects\n\n       The following local structures have used Louisville Plate \n     Glass Co.'s products:\n       Churchill Downs\n       Fleur de Lis condominiums\n       The Green Building\n       The Humana Building\n       Louisville Slugger Field\n       Preston Pointe\n       University of Louisville Medical Faculty Building\n\n\n           Three Tips to Help Make it Through the Tough Times\n\n       Bill Stone offered these suggestions for how small \n     companies can survive when business is off and profits are \n     down.\n       1. Don't take all the profit out of a business when times \n     are good. Make sure the business keeps a strong balance sheet \n     with cash reserves. ``Almost every mistake can be traced to \n     instant-gratification desires,'' Stone said.\n       2. ``It sounds trite, but build the best product and \n     provide the best service, and the money will follow,'' he \n     said, adding that young businesses often are too focused on \n     the bottom line.\n       3. Answer all phone calls, letters and other forms of \n     communication promptly, and clients will take note. ``Do not \n     screen calls,'' he said, adding that staff at his office \n     never asks callers who they are. Instead, he said, he takes \n     all calls if he is available.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/18/senate-section/article/S6659-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL.

Mr. President, I wish to congratulate and \ncommend the Honorable James W. Symington and the American Russian \nCultural Cooperation Foundation on the success of their exhibit ``The \nCzar and the President, Alexander II and Abraham Lincoln.'' Housed in \nthe magnificent Palace of Catherine the Great in St. Petersburg, \nRussia, and the State Archives of the Russian Federation in Moscow, the \ndisplay included an impressive collection of documents, art, and \npersonal artifacts of Czar Alexander II and President Lincoln.\n  The exhibit debuted in St. Petersburg with great fanfare on April 26, \n2011, with representatives from the American Russian Cultural \nCooperation Foundation, ARCCF, and Russian government officials in \nattendance. Russian Minister of Culture, Mr. Alexander Avedyev, and \nARCCF chairman James W. Symington, presided over the ribbon cutting, \nwhile the Kremlin's Presidential Band provided entertainment. The \nexhibit was widely covered by the Russian media, and featured in the \nWashington Post and the New York Times.\n  Timed to correspond with the 150th anniversary of the emancipation of \nthe serfs and the beginning of the Civil War, the exhibit explored the \ncommonality of Czar Alexander II and President Lincoln as liberators \nwho ultimately met a tragic end. Although they never met personally, \nthey exchanged warm correspondence, and shared a somewhat unexpected \nfriendship. Through a study of these two leaders, visitors became \nacquainted with the often unexplored history of mutual respect and \nfriendship during the Civil War era.\n  ``The Czar and the President'' closed on July 31 after receiving rave \nreviews. Reviews of the exhibit can be read below. I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in congratulating Mr. Symington and the ARCCF, and thank \nthem for their continued dedication in preserving the cultural and \nhistorical ties between the United States and Russia.\n  Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record a copy of the text \nof the guest book.\n  The material follows.\n\n    The Guest Book from the Exhibition, The Czar and the President, \n  Alexander II and Abraham Lincoln, The Liberator and the Emancipator\n\n\n                                FOREWORD\n\n       Years ago I came across an obscure amount of US-Russia \n     relations during our Civil War. Tsar Alexander II's favorable \n     disposition toward our Union and his friendly correspondence \n     with President Lincoln were pages missing from my school and \n     college textbooks. Even the goodwill visits Russian fleets in \n     1863 to New York and San Francisco during our time of trial \n     had been erased from memory to say nothing of the eloquent \n     dispatch sent in 1861 by Russia's Chancellor, Prince \n     Gorchakov to his Minister in Washington, Gustav Stoekl which \n     reads in part:\n\n       ``For the more than eighty years that it has existed the \n     American Union owes its independence, its towering rise, and \n     its progress, to the concord of its members, consecrated \n     under the auspices of its illustrious founder, by \n     institutions which have been able to reconcile order with \n     liberty . . . In our view, this Union is not only a \n     substantial element of the world political equilibrium, but \n     additionally, it represents the nation towards which our \n     Sovereign and Russia as a whole, display the friendliest \n     interest. . .\n       In all cases the American Union may count on the most \n     heartfelt sympathy on the part of the Sovereign in the course \n     of the serious crisis which the Union is currently going \n     through . . . ''\n\n       These sentiments *, made manifest by the good will visits \n     of Russian fleets to New York and San Francisco in 1863, had \n     to be reassuring to a President rightly concerned over the \n     possibility of foreign intervention inimical to his cause.\n       It was the purpose of our Tsar and President exhibit to \n     acquaint Russian citizenry and officialdom with this vivid \n     history of accord and mutual respect. I trust the attached \n     citizen reaction warrants the claim, ``mission \n     accomplished''.\n       James W. Symington\n       Chairman\n       American Russian Cultural Cooperation Foundation\n       *Translated from Russian by Dr. Jay Strickland Ryfa, \n     Counselor to the American Russian Cultural Cooperation \n     Foundation\n                                  ____\n\n       A wonderful exhibition from an educational point of view \n     and as a general idea.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 100th \nanniversary of Palmyra State Bank. I am honored to have the opportunity \nto celebrate this extraordinary milestone.\n  The Bank of Palmyra, founded in 1893, was the first lending \ninstitution to be established in the town of Palmyra, followed soon \nafter by the chartering of the Farmers State Bank in 1911. In 1931, \nfollowing the turmoil of the Great Depression, the town's two banks \nmerged to form the Palmyra State Bank.\n  For over a century, Palmyra State Bank has dedicated itself to \nproviding its customers with the highest quality banking services. As a \nlocally owned institution, Palmyra State Bank has been a tremendous \nasset in helping promote economic growth throughout the community and \nthe region. Even in the face of today's difficult economic times, \nPalmyra State Bank continues to flourish and has achieved a well-earned \nreputation for providing their customers with financial security and \nhighly personalized service.\n  As you know, I have long held both personal and professional \nadmiration for independent banks that are focused on strengthening \ncommunities in both the best and worst economic times. For more than \n100 years, Palmyra State Bank has done just that and embodied the \nimportance of building strong local connections.\n  It is for this commitment to providing every customer with the \nhighest quality banking services, and for this bank's crucial role in \ncommunity development, that I am proud to recognize 100 years of \nservice that Palmyra State Bank has provided to the people of the State \nof Wisconsin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/18/senate-section/article/S6662-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REMEMBERING GOVERNOR ALBERT D.

The son of \nItalian immigrants, he was born Jan. 21, 1910, in Tacoma, WA. His \nfather, Giovanni, opened a saloon but was forced to close it during \nProhibition. The family then moved to Seattle's Rainier Valley.\n  Rosellini was a graduate of the University of Washington law school \nin the early 1930s and was hired by King County prosecutor Warren G. \nMagnuson. He was elected to the State senate in 1938 and served for 18 \nyears, during which time he championed the creation of the medical and \ndental schools at the University of Washington.\n  Rosellini was elected Governor of Washington in 1956 and reelected in \n1960. His first term has been praised as one of the most effective and \nprogressive in our State's history. In particular, he was credited with \nimproving conditions in State prisons, mental hospitals, and juvenile \nhomes. Rosellini fought for more modern facilities, training of staff \nmembers, jobs for inmates, and forestry camps for low-risk offenders. \nHe also helped push for the creation of the SR 520 floating bridge \nacross Lake Washington, from Seattle to Medina, WA, that bears his name \ntoday.\n  Governor Rosellini passed away on October 10, 2011, in Seattle at the \nage of 101. Rosellini's wife of 64 years, the former Ethel McNeil, \npassed away in 2002. Survivors include five children and 15 \ngrandchildren. He will be missed dearly.\n  In addition to his many years serving the people of Washington State, \nGovernor Rosellini also used his time and energy to mentor a new \ngeneration that wanted to get involved in government. He was one of the \nfirst supporters in my corner when I got into politics, and I know \nthere are countless others across our State who benefitted from his \nadvice and support over the years.\n  While the legacy Governor Rosellini leaves will be forever engrained \nin the State he loved so much, it will also be preserved through the \nmen and women he boosted and supported who will continue building on \nhis great work for Washington State families and communities.\n  I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in paying homage to \nGovernor Albert D. Rosellini. He lived a long and full life and the \npeople of Washington State will always be indebted to him for his role \nin shaping the future of our State. Our thoughts are with his loved \nones at this time of great loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/18/senate-section/article/S6662-3", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6662-S6663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING NORTHAMPTON COMMUNITY COLLEGE\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY.

A bill to permit Mexican nationals who legally enter the \nUnited States with a valid border Crossing Card through specific ports \nof entry in New Mexico to remain in southern New Mexico for up to 30 \ndays, to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nalong with Senator Tom Udall, aimed at increasing economic activity in \nNew Mexico communities situated along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n  Currently, Mexican nationals holding biometric Border Crossing Cards, \nalso known as Laser Visas, may travel up to 25 miles into the United \nStates for a period of up to 30 days. The purpose of this initiative is \nto promote border commerce by allowing frequent, low-risk visitors to \ntravel to U.S. border communities to conduct business, visit family, \nand shop.\n  Unfortunately, New Mexico has not benefited under this program to the \nextent that other border states have. The three largest cities along \nthe New Mexico border--Las Cruces, Lordsburg, and Deming--are all \noutside of the current 25-mile geographical limit, and Mexican \nnationals with BCCs must acquire additional permits to visit these \ncities.\n  In order to address a similar situation, an exception was made for \nArizona in 1999 to allow BCC holders to travel to Tucson. This change \nresulted in increased economic activity without in any way jeopardizing \nsecurity. Tailoring the program to maximize its impact in the \nrespective border states is the right approach, and I fail to see why a \nsimilar modification should not be made for New Mexico.\n  The legislation we are introducing today, the Southern New Mexico \nEconomic Development Act, would expand the geographic limit from 25 \nmiles to 75 miles to permit visitors coming to New Mexico to reach the \nlarger cities in the southern part of the state. This change would \nfacilitate economic activity at a crucial time as border communities \nare looking to increase tourism and create growth.\n  Changing this regulation wouldn't cost taxpayer money, it will \nincrease economic activity in communities that have been hit hard by \nthe economic downturn, and will do so in a manner consistent with our \nborder security efforts.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1730\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Southern New Mexico Economic \n     Development Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. TEMPORARY ADMITTANCE OF MEXICAN NATIONALS WITH BORDER \n                   CROSSING CARDS.\n\n       The Secretary of Homeland Security shall permit a national \n     of Mexico, who enters the United States with a valid Border \n     Crossing Card (as described in section 212.1(c)(1)(i) of \n     title 8, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on the \n     date of the enactment of this Act), and who is admitted to \n     the United States at the Columbus, Santa Teresa, or Antelope \n     Wells port of entry in New Mexico, to remain in New Mexico \n     (within 75 miles of the international border between the \n     United States and Mexico) for a period not to exceed 30 days.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator \nBingaman in introducing the Southern New Mexico Economic Development \nAct, legislation that will bring additional business from Mexico to \ncities and towns in southern New Mexico.\n  Our bill would increase economic opportunities for southern New \nMexico businesses by extending the distance that Mexicans who are \nissued Border Crossing Cards, BCC, by the U.S. State Department can \ntravel in New Mexico without the need to obtain a Form I-94 and pay an \nadditional fee.\n  The BCC is a credit card-style document with many security features \nand 10-year validity. BCCs are only issued to applicants who are \ncitizens and residents of Mexico. Applicants must meet the eligibility \nstandards for B1/B2 visas and undergo fingerprinting and an interview \nat the U.S. Consulate and they must demonstrate that they have ties to \nMexico that would compel them to return after a temporary stay in the \nUnited States.\n  Currently, BCC holders who are authorized to enter into the United \nStates can remain up to 30 days and travel no more than 25 miles beyond \nthe border, except in Arizona where they can travel up to 75 miles. \nThose who wish to travel farther or remain longer must request an I-94 \nform, arrival/departure record, at the port of entry and pay a small \nfee. Our bill would extend the distance BCC holders who enter the \nUnited States from New Mexico ports of entry can travel within the \nState from 25 miles to 75 miles.\n  Arizona provides a precedent for making this change. In 1999, the \nborder zone in Arizona was extended from 25 miles to 75 miles because \nthere were no large Arizona cities within 25 miles of the border. This \nwas done through the Federal rulemaking process. The extension was \ndesigned to specifically include Tucson within the zone so that it \ncould get the economic benefit of BCC holders entering Arizona. Tucson \nconducted a study indicating that, after implementation of this rule, \nthe commercial gain from Mexican visitors was estimated to reach $56.3 \nmillion a year.\n  However, in Texas, New Mexico, and California, the border zone limit \nremains 25 miles. This doesn't hurt Texas and California since El Paso, \nSan Diego, and many smaller towns in those states are within the 25 \nmile zone. However, like Arizona, New Mexico does not have a city \nwithin 25 miles of the border. This means BCC holders cannot travel to \nsouthern New Mexico cities like Las Cruces, Deming, and Lordsburg \nwithout additional paperwork and paying a fee. Because of this, many \nvisitors face the inconvenience\n\n[[Page S6668]]\n\nof having to drive all the way to Juarez and enter the U.S. at an El \nPaso port of entry, despite living closer to a port of entry in New \nMexico.\n  Extending the zone can be done through rulemaking, as it was with \nArizona, and I am happy to work with Secretary Napolitano and CBP \nCommissioner Bersin to make that happen. However, if we are unable to \nresolve this issue through rulemaking, I believe it will be necessary \nto push for passage of the legislation we are introducing today.\n  There is strong support from elected officials and the business \ncommunity in southern New Mexico for extending the border zone to 75 \nmiles. Just recently, Luna County Commissioner Jay Spivey worked with \nState Senator John Arthur Smith and Representative Dona Irwin to \nintroduce a Joint Memorial calling on DHS to extend the border zone to \n75 miles. The Memorial unanimously passed both houses of the New Mexico \nstate legislature in September.\n  This is fundamentally an issue of fairness--New Mexico should have \nthe same opportunities the other three Border States enjoy because of \nthe economic benefits of BCC holders visiting their cities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 1732. A bill to amend section 552a of title 5, United States Code \n(commonly referred to as the Privacy Act), the E-Government Act of 2002 \n(Public Law 107-347), and chapters 35 and 36 of title 44, United States \nCode, and other provisions of law to modernize and improve Federal \nprivacy laws; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Privacy Act \nModernization for the Information Age Act of 2011.\n  In 1974, Congress enacted the Privacy Act to protect Americans' \npersonal information from improper disclosure by the Federal \ngovernment. Broadly, the Privacy Act requires that government agencies \nallow individuals to see any records an agency keeps on him or her, \nwith some exceptions for security and law enforcement, limits the \nextent to which the government may share data with and agencies and \nthird parties, allows individuals to access and correct their records, \nrequires agencies to provide notice of what data is collected and how \nit is used and to keep records of disclosures, and provides individuals \nthe ability to enforce their rights under the act.\n  With the expansion of technology and the proliferation of personally \nidentifiable information in the hands of government agencies, the risk \nof losing, abusing, or misusing information has grown exponentially. In \nparticular, over the last 10 years security needs have created pressure \non agencies to use existing personal information in new ways, not \ncontemplated when the information was collected. The growth in the \nbusiness of buying and selling individuals' information also raises new \nquestions about the extent to which the Privacy Act applies to these \nsources of data on individuals used by the government. Meanwhile, there \nhave been few updates to the Privacy Act, leaving it better suited to \nfile cabinets and clunky 30 year old databases than the modern \ninformation technology systems in use at agencies today.\n  In 2008, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, released a report \nthat I requested entitled, ``Privacy: Alternatives Exist for Enhancing \nProtection of Personally Identifiable Information'', GAO-08-536. GAO \nlater testified about its findings at a Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee hearing where it identified issues in \nthree main areas that could be enhanced: applying privacy protections \nconsistently to all Federal collection and use of personal information; \nensuring that collection and use of personally identifiable information \nis limited to a stated purpose; and establishing effective mechanisms \nfor informing the public about privacy protections.\n  After examining these recommendations and consulting with outside \nprivacy experts, working groups, and privacy and civil liberties \nadvocates, I am introducing the Privacy Act Modernization for the \nInformation Age Act of 2011. This bill addresses the issues raised by \nGAO, adds stronger privacy leadership at the Office of Management and \nBudget to ensure effective execution of the Privacy Act, and extends \nauthority for privacy officers to investigate possible violations of \nprivacy laws.\n  This bill updates the Privacy Act in several ways. It simplifies some \nof the definitions to apply them to modern information technology \nmanagement ideas that were in their infancy in 1974. It also tightens \nrequirements for agency controls and maintenance of records to ensure \ntheir use is authorized, and that personally identifiable information \nis not misused.\n  Agencies would also be more accountable to the public in protecting \ninformation. Notifications of systems with personally identifiable \ninformation would be more relevant, transparent, and accessible, \nallowing Americans to know which agencies may have what information \nabout them and in what systems. Importantly, the bill would create a \ncentralized privacy website containing System of Records Notices and \nother related privacy information.\n  If civil or criminal violations of the Privacy Act do occur, the \npenalties have been updated to reflect similar penalties in other laws. \nThe bill would also clarify Congress's intent in the statutory damages \nprovision in the Privacy Act by overturning Doe v. Chao, in which the \nSupreme Court, I believe wrongly, held that an individual has to show \nactual damages resulted from an intentional or willful improper \ndisclosure of personal information in order to receive an award.\n  My bill also builds on important new privacy protections introduced \nin the E-Government Act of 2002, which established a requirement for a \nPrivacy Impact Assessment on certain new systems developed at agencies \nthat contain personally identifiable information. It also codifies the \nterm ``personally identifiable information,'' which has been defined by \nthe Office of Management and Budget, OMB, for years in conjunction with \nthe Privacy Act. This will let us focus on protecting personally \nidentifiable information rather than defining it.\n  The Privacy Act Modernization for the Information Age Act of 2011 \nwould expand a successful tool given to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, DHS, Chief Privacy Officer, CPO, to other major agency CPOs. \nIn 2008, I championed the POWER Act, which gave the DHS CPO the \nauthority to investigate possible violations of privacy laws if an \nInspector General declines to investigate. I am pleased to say this \nauthority has not been abused, and in fact has been used only once at \nDHS where its Inspector General inadvertently experienced a minor data \nbreach, and the CPO investigated the issue. This is a useful tool that \nI believe other privacy offices overseeing massive amounts of \npersonally identifiable information could benefit from.\n  Finally, my bill would create a strong Federal Chief Privacy Officer, \nFCPO, at OMB as well as a government-wide Chief Privacy Officers \nCouncil, to fill the wide gaps in government-wide privacy leadership \nand ensure consistent development of policies and guidance on the \nPrivacy Act across agencies. The FCPO position existed under President \nClinton, but it has not been replicated by subsequent administrations. \nI have been impressed with DHS's leadership on privacy issues, thanks \nto tools we have put into law and the resources we have provided. It is \nequally important to enhance government-wide leadership through the \nFCPO and the Chief Privacy Officers Council, which will create a better \nenvironment to share ideas across agencies.\n  This bill would be an important step forward in modernizing how \ngovernment agencies execute their obligations to protect the personal \ninformation provided to them by all Americans. With the proliferation \nof data about every one of us online, and possibly creeping into \ngovernment databases, we need more transparency so the average person \nhas a place to go to learn about what information the government is \nkeeping and how they can access that information. I urge my colleagues \nto support this effort and to continue to work with me and the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee to produce legislation to \nimprove Federal privacy before this Congress adjourns.\n\n[[Page S6669]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1732\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 296\n\n       Whereas the Combined Federal Campaign was established \n     pursuant to Executive Order 10927 (26 Fed. Reg. 2383) signed \n     by President John F. Kennedy on March 18, 1961;\n       Whereas the Combined Federal Campaign is the only \n     authorized charitable fundraising campaign for Federal \n     employees, employees of the United States Postal Service, and \n     members of the armed forces;\n       Whereas the Combined Federal Campaign operates in more than \n     119 localities throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, the \n     United States Virgin Islands, and overseas military \n     installations;\n       Whereas more than 20,000 nonprofit charitable organizations \n     participate annually in the Combined Federal Campaign;\n       Whereas the men and women of the Federal Government, the \n     United States Postal Service, and the Armed Forces have \n     contributed approximately $7,000,000,000 to local, national, \n     and international charities over the past 50 years, making \n     the Combined Federal Campaign the largest and most successful \n     workplace charitable drive in the world; and\n       Whereas commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Combined \n     Federal Campaign will thank public servants whose generous \n     contributions over the years have helped to feed hungry \n     children, cure disease, comfort the sick and dying, protect \n     the environment and natural resources of the United States, \n     and offered hope to people and communities across the United \n     States and worldwide: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate:\n       (1) commemorates the 50th anniversary of the Combined \n     Federal Campaign;\n       (2) commends public servants of the United States for their \n     unyielding dedication, generosity, and spirit of charitable \n     giving;\n       (3) calls upon the new generation of Federal employees, \n     employees of the United States Postal Service, and members of \n     the Armed Forces to participate annually in the Combined \n     Federal Campaign;\n       (4) encourages all Federal employees, employees of the \n     United States Postal Service, and members of the Armed Forces \n     to continue their philanthropic efforts for the betterment of \n     the less fortunate; and\n       (5) urges the people of the United States to observe the \n     50th anniversary of the Combined Federal Campaign with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 50th \nanniversary of the Combined Federal Campaign, CFC. In 1961, President \nJohn F. Kennedy established the CFC, which has grown over the last 50 \nyears to become the world's largest and most successful workplace \ncharity campaign. Pledging to donate through the CFC gives charities \nsteady streams of revenue throughout the next year, lowers overhead \ncosts so more money goes directly to the charity's work, and is a \nconvenient way for Federal employees to donate to their charities of \nchoice.\n  Federal employees have dedicated their lives to serving and \nprotecting the American people, and that call to service extends far \nbeyond their professional lives. Each year, Federal employees together \ngive millions of dollars through the CFC to help support the work of \nover 20,000 non-profit, charitable organizations in the United States \nand around the world. Since 1961, Federal civilian, military, and \nPostal employees have donated nearly $7 billion through the CFC, \nincluding $282 million in 2010.\n  In today's economy, contributions through the CFC are essential to \nmany organizations that receive them. A great number of these \norganizations have seen an increase in the need for the important \nservices they provide, while fewer Americans are able to give the \nfinancial support on which these organizations rely. I applaud the \ngenerosity of our Federal community and encourage each of you to \nconsider what you can pledge to give in the upcoming year. Our combined \nefforts can ensure that Americans and others across the globe have \naccess to the important support and services that these charities \nprovide. The 50th anniversary CFC campaign season has already begun and \nruns until December 15.\n  I thank my colleagues Senators Lieberman, Levin and Carper for \ncosponsoring this legislation and I encourage my colleagues to join me \nin celebrating the 50th anniversary of the CFC and highlighting the \nsupport these contributions bring to non-profit, charitable \norganizations throughout the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/18/senate-section/article/S6672-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6672-S6673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 297--CONGRATULATING THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORTIVE \n            HOUSING ON THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF ITS FOUNDING\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. Portman) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Today, there is a celebration in Alaska. Tonight is \nthe 144th anniversary of Alaska Day. This is the day that commemorates \nthe first raising of the Stars and Stripes over Lord Baranof's castle \nin Sitka, AK. At the time, Sitka was called New Archangel. Until that \nmoment, it was the capital of Russian America.\n  We celebrate Alaska's statehood today, October 18, and we also \ncelebrate our 52-year-old compact with the United States and its \npromise to grant Alaskans the opportunity to participate equally with \nthe other States of the Union. Together with Hawaii, statehood for \nAlaska marked the last chapter in America's great westward expansion. \nOf course, that expansion began well before Alaska's statehood, well \nbefore the purchase from Russia. It goes back to Thomas Jefferson's \nNorthwest Ordinance, which promised an equal footing for a State \ngovernment to stand on its own and to make that leap out of territorial \nstatus. This resulted in States such as Ohio and Indiana forming as \nsovereign governments with the Federal Government, relinquishing almost \nall control over the lands within those borders. So people came to \nlive, to build their lives in these new States; and with their new \nlives came the infrastructure--the roads, bridges, factories, and the \nindustry.\n  That set things in motion for expansion into the Far West frontier \nStates such as Wyoming, Nevada, Utah, and Montana. And then gold in \nCalifornia and Colorado brought an urgency to the expansion. We saw the \nrailroads that helped accelerate and accommodate it.\n  In times past, the terms began to change. Precedents were \nincreasingly set for vast Federal land withdrawals in the form of \nnational forests, monuments, parks, and preserves. The promise and \ndefinition of ``equal footing'' changed during these times. Ultimately, \nmore States had more of an equal footing than others, as we saw the \nnewest western States would soon have to contend with Federal land \nmanagers.\n  None of this, though, took away from the hope that Alaskans felt when \nSecretary of State William Seward negotiated the purchase of Alaska \nfrom Tsar Nicholas, and he negotiated this purchase for $7.2 million. \nWe are talking a lot about money nowadays, and usually we are talking \nin billions rather than millions. Think about it. The purchase of \nAlaska came at the price of $7.2 million. That is about 2 cents an \nacre, which is clearly a deal under anybody's terms.\n  Back in Sitka today, this day is always commemorated by the town's \nbiggest parade of the year as a time of\n\n[[Page S6694]]\n\ncelebration, when many Alaskans remember the hope they felt for a \nbrighter future when we became the 49th State in the Union back in \n1959. In 1959, I was only a year old, and so when President Eisenhower \nsigned that statehood act into law, it didn't have much of an \nimpression at that point in time. But I have felt--and I still feel--I \nhave grown up with Alaska, that we have both matured over the years. \nThose who know me know I can go on and on extolling the virtues of my \nState--something as simple as potatoes. I will brag that while we might \nnot have the biggest potatoes in the country, ours are germ free. We \nare bigger, better, and we have more sun, more darkness, and it is \ncolder, and it is warmer. We are a land of extremes. We are an \nincredible place.\n  Alaska is unparalleled in its beauty and its potential. There has \nalways been something that is very classically American about Alaska. \nIt is truly our Nation's last frontier--a place where it is still \npossible for adventurous men and women to live the greatest version of \nthe American dream. I think that is what draws so many people to our \nState. They still believe there is a place where you can live on the \nedge of a lot of possibility, and that continues to make us a \nremarkable place to be.\n  Statehood itself was a dream for many years among our pioneers and \nnative people. It didn't come quickly and certainly not easily. Prior \nto statehood, we only had territorial status in the United States. That \nleft us without any votes here in the Congress. We weren't entitled to \nreceive funding for many programs, including highways. We were at the \nmercy of the generosity of the Federal Government. We were at the mercy \nof those out-of-State interests, which had locked in a foothold over \nmany of our resources.\n  I was born and raised in southeastern Alaska. My grandparents raised \ntheir families there. I can remember the stories about the push for \nstatehood, stemming from the desire to control our fisheries--the \nsalmon wars that went on at that time.\n  Ultimately, statehood came about after 92 long years and only after \nheroic efforts from a great many individuals--too many to do justice \nthis evening. But for purposes of my statement tonight, I want to \ninvoke three names that some in this town and some in this Chamber may \nstill remember.\n  The first is our former Governor and Senator Ernest Greuning, whose \nseat in this Chamber I am humbled to hold. Senator Gruening was an \nintellectual titan, the consummate public servant. He was an alumnus of \nHarvard Medical School, a prolific journalist who served as editor to \nboth the New York Tribune and the magazine The Nation. He also \ncontributed to the Atlantic Monthly.\n  In the epic novel ``Alaska,'' written by James Michener, he credited \nSenator Gruening with publicizing the cause for Alaskan statehood at \nthe national level. He called him ``perceptive and gifted.'' As a \ntestament to his legacy, Ernest Greuning's statue now stands just a few \nsteps away from here in the Capitol Visitor Center.\n  Another individual, a man who truly built our State, was Wally \nHickel, a former Governor. He was the man with whom President Nixon was \nso impressed that he named him as his Secretary of the Interior.\n  Wally was a former boxer from Kansas. He arrived in Alaska with--the \nlegend goes--about 37 cents in his pocket. He rose to prominence in \nboth business and politics. He was at the forefront of negotiating \nstatehood. He understood the critical balance between the Federal \ninterests and the State interests, between the corporate interests and \nthe public interests.\n  Governor Hickel is important to this conversation because Alaska is \nwhere he saw and realized the American dream, all the while with a \nclear eye and vision toward the future of our State. We lost Wally \nHickel last spring, but his writings and his vision clearly continue to \nguide our State.\n\n  A third name I want to bring up this evening is a man I was \nprivileged to work for and to serve with, and that is the late Senator \nTed Stevens.\n  I hold Senator Stevens--or Uncle Ted, as many in the State referred \nto him--in great personal and professional regard. He was a World War \nII pilot, a Harvard lawyer, who served as prosecutor in the territorial \ndays. He was a congressional liaison to President Eisenhower. He was an \nattorney for the Interior Department. Much of the leg work that is \nassociated with statehood was Ted's, and much of what Alaska has become \nis directly attributable to his work here in this Chamber.\n  Ted's work and his influence carried so much farther beyond Alaska. \nHis work in matters of national defense, telecom, and fisheries shaped \nnational and global politics. He was truly larger than life. He made \nAlaska matter in a way that nobody could have imagined. Without him, it \nis indisputable that we would not have the opportunities we have now.\n  The reason I invoke these names is to remind my colleagues about the \nconsequential nature, the gravitas of great men and women who made sure \nthat Alaska became our 49th State. These were exceptional Americans \nwith an exceptional vision. They qualified as the founding fathers of \nmy home State. They knew what Thomas Jefferson knew at the time of the \nNorthwest Ordinance--that the new State of Alaska didn't have the \npopulation at the time and wasn't likely to get the population; that \nthey didn't have the infrastructure to support an economy, and that it \nwould not succeed without open access to this huge natural resource \nbase. This is why they negotiated 104 million acres of pure State land \nand a 90-percent share of revenues from resource development on Federal \nlands, compared to the 50 percent that is enjoyed by the rest of the \nStates.\n  There was no clear path to Alaska's self-sufficiency without these \nterms. As a matter of fact, there still isn't. In 1958, the U.S. \nSenate's official committee report on the Alaska Statehood Act promised \nAlaska that it would be given great latitude to develop its resources. \nIt read:\n\n       Some of the additional costs connected with statehood will \n     be met by granting the State a reasonable return from Federal \n     exploitation of resources within the new State. In the past, \n     the United States has controlled the lion's share of \n     resources and, in some instances, retained the lion's share \n     of the proceeds. This situation, though, has not proved \n     conducive to development of the Alaskan economy. The \n     committee deems it only fair that when the State relieves the \n     United States of most of its expense burden, the State should \n     receive a realistic portion of the proceeds from resources \n     within its borders.\n\n  There is more to this. Secretary of Interior Fred Seaton, while in \nAlaska in the summer of 1958, said that the statehood compact \n``reaffirms Alaska's preferential treatment in receiving 90 percent of \nall revenues from oil, gas, and coal leasing on public domain.'' In \nFairbanks, he went further, promising ``since early this year, the \nterritory has received 90 percent of all these oil lease revenues, and \nthe State of Alaska will continue to do so.''\n  These statements are remarkably clear. Alaska would be allowed to \ndevelop these resources and receive most of the revenues from that \ndevelopment. I truly wish I could stand here tonight, all these years \nlater, and say these promises have been upheld. I wish I could go to \nsleep tonight or any night knowing the Federal Government had kept its \npromises to the people of Alaska and that my children and their \nchildren will surely see our State continue to prosper and come into \nits own.\n  But the reality is that Alaska's relationship with the Federal \nGovernment has become strained. The Federal Government has always had a \nsignificant presence in the last frontier, from the first Alaska Day to \nthis one. But today, at a time when Alaskans need the Federal \nGovernment to act as our partner, it has become an obstacle. Its \ndefault position is no longer to enable prosperity for Alaskans. More \noften than not, the Federal Government now delays or denies those \nopportunities.\n  That leaves me concerned about the future of my State, not because of \nthe global economy, not because of high unemployment levels, but \nbecause of the treatment we receive at the hands of our own Federal \nGovernment.\n  I am here today to say that this treatment cannot go on like this. I \nwant to ensure that my colleagues in the Senate understand why.\n  I have asked for a large block of time tonight, and I don't usually \ntake a lot of floor time, particularly to go back into history. But \nthis is important to not only my State's past but my State's future.\n  I wish to explain some of what we are dealing with. Some of this may \nnot be\n\n[[Page S6695]]\n\neasy for some to see. Some believe that Alaska--and the rest of the \ncountry, for that matter--is past the point where we need to develop \nour resources. Many of our newer Members may not understand the \npromises that were made to Alaska upon statehood. Therefore, they don't \nunderstand what has been happening since then.\n  Adding to the complication is that our resource options have been \ngreatly restricted over the course of decades, not individual months or \neven years. So to understand what has changed, we can't look back to \nthe start of this administration.\n  I will not single out the President and the administration and say \nyou are not letting us do something. The fact is that we have to go \nback many administrations. We have to go all the way back to the late \n1970s, a time when much of Alaska had already been withdrawn into \nFederal wilderness status. President Carter and his Interior Secretary \nhad decided that, well, that wasn't enough. They designated over 56 \nmillion more acres of new national monuments, 40 million more acres of \nwildlife refuges, and 11 million more acres of restricted national \nforest. Now that in and of itself would have been unprecedented, \nunprecedented in terms of the amount of land for the Federal Government \nto unilaterally withdraw if it were nationwide, but this land was all \nin Alaska. Every acre of it was in Alaska. So, not surprisingly, this \ncame over the State's objection.\n\n  Congress reacted to this tremendous Federal overreach so that \nAlaska's Senators and lone Congressman, together with a few sympathetic \ncolleagues, could at least try to control that impact. That negotiated \ntruce was the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. We call \nit ANILCA for short. In no uncertain terms, ANILCA was a compromise. It \nwas clearly a compromise.\n  For his part, when he signed ANILCA into law, President Carter \nstated:\n\n       100 percent of the offshore areas and 95 percent of the \n     potentially productive oil and mineral areas will be \n     available for exploration or for drilling.\n\n  Again, that is President Carter saying that 100 percent of offshore \nareas and 95 percent of potentially productive oil and mineral areas \nwill be available for exploration or for drilling--a pretty strong \nstatement, and it seemed pretty clear and very reassuring at the time \nof this compromise. But today it stands as probably the worst broken \npromise the Federal Government has ever made to the State of Alaska. As \nthe Department of the Interior reported just this past spring, less \nthan 1 percent--less than 1 percent--of Federal lands in Alaska is \ncurrently producing oil or natural gas. I would suggest that is an \nindictment. A significant portion of our lands have been placed off \nlimits, and then where development is allowed, it is often stalled by \nFederal redtape. That is wrong. It is wrong, it is unacceptable, and it \nis to the detriment of both Alaska and our Nation as a whole.\n  Alaska is nearly 4,000 miles from where we are here in Washington, \nDC. I know because I log that trip on Alaska Airlines quite frequently. \nI know that what makes news back home doesn't always make news here. So \nI would like to use part of my time tonight to provide the Senate with \nsome of the many examples of how resource development in my home State \nis being held back. Let's start with mining.\n  Back in 2009, the EPA attempted to halt the Kensington Gold Mine from \nproceeding in southeast Alaska, and this happened after two decades--\ntwo decades--of agency review and legal challenges. It happened even \nthough the Supreme Court had ruled that a crucial permit for the mine \nwas indeed valid. But the EPA was so unhappy with this decision, it \njumped back in. It sought to nullify the plan that had just held up to \nthe scrutiny of the Supreme Court. This was not the Alaska Supreme \nCourt, this was the U.S. Supreme Court. This was not an effort to \nprotect the environment by the EPA. The EPA proposal was demonstrably \nworse for the environment. This was an effort to stop the mine at all \ncosts, regardless of the consequences for the local economy or the \nhundreds of Alaskans who were depending on jobs from this particular \nmine.\n  More recently, we have seen Senators within this body from other \nStates challenge a mine that could one day be located in southwest \nAlaska. Those Senators have asked the EPA to consider a preemptive veto \nof the mine. This is even before a plan has been proposed. I have said \nthat a preemptive veto makes no more sense than a preemptive approval \nand that we should provide a robust environmental review when and if a \npermit application is going to be submitted.\n  I will remind everyone here that we don't have a habit of hastily \napproving mines in this country. In fact, we rank dead last--dead \nlast--among all the countries in the world in the amount of time it \ntakes to review permits. This mine will have to secure at least 67 \ndifferent permits, approvals, and authorizations from Federal, State, \nand local governments. That represents about 67 chances for the mine to \nbe delayed, modified, or halted. But some apparently believe that \nprocess is still not sufficient.\n  Now let's talk about timber and the wholesale destruction of the \ntimber industry in southeast Alaska. At this point, I feel once again \nas though I need to put my Alaska bona fides out there and remind \neverybody how big Alaska is. We are more than twice the size of Texas. \nPeople forget that. We have a lot of room up there. We could produce a \ntremendous portion of our Nation's timber and pulp if we were only \nallowed to do so. We could do that while leaving the vast majority of \nour lands untouched. But that hasn't been possible. Southeast Alaska is \nnearly all Federal lands, so our ability to conduct logging there is \nvery heavily dependent on the Federal Government's willingness to grant \naccess.\n  When ANILCA passed, the timber industry, in return for accepting the \ncreation of more than 5 million acres of new national monuments closed \nto timber harvesting, was assured that the Forest Service would make \n450 million board feet of timber available in the future--half of what \nwas being produced prior to the bill's passage. We accepted that as a \ncompromise. ANILCA also guaranteed $40 million worth of funding each \nyear for road building, for precommercial thinning to allow the \nexisting industry to survive on a smaller land base.\n  So you might ask the question, what happened? Alaska's timber \nindustry has not thrived. It struggles. Go down to the southeast and \ntalk to people in Ketchikan or out in Thorne Bay, and it is worse than \nstruggling. They are on life support. They are struggling to survive as \noutside forces repeatedly attempt to shut it down. At the urging of the \nWashington, DC, environmental community, the funding within ANILCA was \nrepealed and the allowable harvest level was cut in half again over the \nfollowing decade. But even that reduced amount of logging seems \nexpansive today because the Forest Service has made far less than 50 \nmillion board feet available for timber harvest within the past 3 \nyears. So far this year, the Forest Service has amazingly sold just 2 \nmillion board feet of new timber offerings. This is a dramatic decline \nfor an industry that once provided thousands of well-paying jobs for \nresidents in southeast Alaska, as well as the revenue that came in and, \nby the way, some really world-class quality wood and pulp resources for \nthe rest of our country.\n  Given these restrictions, it probably comes as no surprise that \nemployment in the industry has plummeted from about 6,000 total jobs in \n1980 to where we are today, which is about 450, and that includes all \nof the support structure as well. So for those of us who grew up in the \nTonkas--I was born in Ketchikan and raised in places such as Juneau and \nWrangell--to see an economy be truly just cut off to the point that it \nis no longer existent because of Federal policies is very difficult to \ndeal with.\n\n  Then, of course, we can take a look at Alaska's oil and gas industry, \nwhich currently provides nearly 90 percent of the revenues for Alaska's \nState budget and historically as much as 20 percent of our Nation's \npetroleum supply. We are pretty proud of this. We feel as though we \nhave done a pretty good job. Here more than anywhere else we see the \nscope and the consequences of Federal decisions to restrict resource \ndevelopment.\n  Just to put things in context so that people know what I am talking \nabout--and I don't have the rest of the country on here, Mr. President, \nbecause that\n\n[[Page S6696]]\n\nchart is coming later--in understanding where Alaska's resources lie, I \nthink it helps to understand the management and the division within our \nState in terms of our lands. I don't expect most can see this map, but \nit is kind of a jumble of colors. What I will direct your attention \nto--and those who are looking at this--is all of the green areas, which \nare Forest Service, and the orange and tan areas are our BLM parklands. \nThe areas that are in blue are the State lands. The small areas where \nyou have red are areas held in private lands, whether it is Native \nlands or whether it is held in private lands.\n  Up here, in the National Petroleum Reserve at the top of the State, \nis an area that Congress explicitly designated--they have singled out \nand explicitly designated--for producing oil. But Federal regulators \nwill not allow a simple bridge to be built over a remote river, and \nwithout this bridge, it is not possible or it is exceptionally \ndifficult to begin commercial production. So you have production within \na National Petroleum Reserve that is remaining off limits at this \nmoment.\n  I have asked the question--and it is not a rhetorical question but \none clearly worth repeating--if we can't get petroleum from the \nNational Petroleum Reserve, from where can we get it? This is an area \nthat was specifically designated by the Congress. Yet we are being held \nup from accessing this because we cannot get approval to place a bridge \nover the Colville River. So we continue to work this because it is \nextraordinary that we would be held up these many years.\n  Offshore, in the Beaufort and the Chukchi, are areas estimated to \ncontain more than 20 billion barrels of oil. Production in these areas \ncould help us refill our pipeline, which is running dangerously low, \nand create many thousands of good-paying jobs. But Federal regulators \nhave held this up over really, of all things, air permits needed for \nexploratory operations to begin miles offshore in the Arctic Ocean. We \nhave seen some steps in the right direction, and that is good. But the \nfact is, drilling has been canceled each of the last four seasons, and \nnext year is still uncertain.\n  I had an opportunity to quiz Director Bromwich today. He is trying to \ngive me the assurance that this might be on track for next season. But \nit has been almost 5 years and cost almost $4 billion, all in an effort \nto get to the point where we can proceed to begin exploration. Alaska \nhas already lost hundreds of jobs and millions in revenues because of \nthese federally imposed delays.\n  Of course, I cannot not talk about Alaska's oil and gas resources \nwithout discussing Alaska's coastal plain, which is this area right \nover here adjoining Canada. We have an area up north that is estimated \nto hold 10.4 billion barrels of oil. This is the mean estimate, so it \nis quite possibly much more than that. I have sponsored legislation to \nallow responsible development in the nonwilderness portion--not in the \nwilderness portion--of ANWR. We are not going to touch the wilderness \nportion, just the nonwilderness portion of ANWR. I have offered this \nfor several Congresses now.\n  But even limiting that development to 0.1 percent of the refuge has \nproven unacceptable to many Members of this Chamber. We repeatedly hear \nfrom others that this area is too sensitive, despite Alaska's very \nstrong record of environmental stewardship in nearby Prudhoe Bay. We \nrepeatedly hear it is just going to take too long for this oil to come \nto market. They will say it is going to take 10 years to get ANWR oil. \nThat is too long.\n  The ``10 years away'' argument has been made for over 20 years now. \nSo instead of continuing to delay, let's figure out how we make this \nhappen. But instead of any promotion in Congress and from the Fish and \nWildlife Service, we face efforts to put all the Coastal Plain into \npermanent wilderness restriction.\n  To anyone who thinks the nonwilderness portion of ANWR was never \nmeant for energy development, I would point you to President \nEisenhower's original designation creating not a refuge but the Arctic \nRange. I would also remind you that President Eisenhower had both an \nassistant to the Secretary of the Interior Department and a \ncongressional liaison, and that individual was named Ted Stevens. Ted \nwas in the room with Interior Secretary Seaton, drafting the Executive \norder for the Arctic Range Conservation Program. If you think he would \nhave considered locking up Alaska's resources, I don't think you know \nhim as I did.\n  The order clearly provided that oil and gas development would be \npermitted so long as there were reasonable protections in place for the \nflora and the fauna. I would encourage any of my colleagues, look up \nthis Executive order of December 6, 1960, if you have any further \nquestions.\n  For all of its broken promises, ANILCA is still law, and it contains \ntwo very important provisions that were negotiated by Senator Stevens. \nThe first is for an oil and gas exploratory program to occur in the \n1002 Area. This is this small portion of the Coastal Plain that I have \nsought to open. But I wish to repeat this. Existing law provides for \noil and gas exploration, and exploratory drilling has already occurred \nin ANWR. In fact, in the two winters in 1984 and 1985, seismic \nexploration was conducted along 1,400 miles of survey lines in ANWR. \nThere were several companies that were also permitted to conduct other \ngeologic studies, such as surface rock sampling and mapping and some \ngeochemical testing. This resulted in a report from the Interior \nDepartment based on what it learned about the resource and the ability \nto develop it responsibly, recommending that Congress take the next \nstep and authorize oil and gas leasing for the entire 1002 Area.\n  We have to ask the question: Why is this relevant? To begin with, it \nis worth noting that the current law already provides for exploratory \ndrilling in ANWR. All that is prohibited is development leading to \nproduction. I doubt many people realize we have actually already \nauthorized drilling in ANWR, and Congress's real decision is to decide \nwhether we leave the oil in there or whether we let it come to market.\n  The second major provision in ANILCA is probably better known. It is \ncalled the ``no more'' clause, and we talk about it a lot in Alaska. It \nis an express prohibition on any more wilderness withdrawals in Alaska. \nIncluded is a congressional finding that Alaska has unequivocally \ncontributed enough of its lands to conservation purposes. I am going to \nquote directly from this law. It has been upheld in court, it remains \nin place today, and it provides as follows:\n\n       This act provides sufficient protection for the national \n     interests in the scenic, natural, cultural, and environmental \n     values on the public lands in Alaska, and at the same time \n     provides adequate opportunity for satisfaction of the \n     economic and social needs of the State of Alaska and its \n     people. Accordingly, the designation and disposition of the \n     public lands in Alaska pursuant to this Act are found to \n     represent a proper balance between the reservation of \n     national conservation system units and those public lands \n     necessary and appropriate for more intensive use and \n     disposition. And, thus, Congress believes that the need for \n     future legislation designating new conservation system units, \n     new national conservation areas, or new national recreation \n     areas has been obviated thereby.\n\n  I don't think it could be any more clear than that. It troubles me a \ngreat deal when people in Washington then take it upon themselves to \nlook for more wilderness in Alaska.\n  In 2004, the General Services Administration reported that more than \n60 percent of Alaska was owned by the Federal Government--about 250 \nmillion acres in total. Again, if we look at the map, outside of the \nblue areas, pretty much all that we are seeing the green, the kind of \ntan, the orange, these are all Federal areas. So about 250 million \nacres are owned by the Federal Government. Compare that with some of \nthe other States.\n  I don't mean to pick on the smaller States, but Connecticut, 0.4 \npercent of Connecticut, about 14,000 Federal acres. New York is 0.8 \npercent, about 230,000 acres. Illinois is 1.8 percent. They have about \n640,000 Federal acres. But, again, according to that report, the State \nof Alaska has about 250 million acres of land under Federal control.\n  So we would say: Where are their private lands? Less than 1 percent \nof Alaska's lands are privately held. People have a tough time with \nthat because they think: They have so much land. They have so much \nacreage. It is so huge. Surely, they must have some of that in private \nland.\n\n[[Page S6697]]\n\n  It is less than 1 percent. It begs the question, when we are looking \nto add more wilderness, how fair is it to look to Alaska for more \nwilderness, when we have some 250 million acres in Federal control \nalready, more wilderness in Alaska, in one State, than in the rest of \nthe Nation combined? It is an important question to be asked.\n  We would at least suppose that the vast areas where Alaska cannot \ndevelop our resources would give us a silver lining of more \nrecreational access. I know the Chair enjoys the great outdoors, as do \nI, and we like to get out and hike and be part of what we have with the \nland. But with Alaska's land management, even access to our lands makes \nit complicated, and that promise too has been broken.\n  Under ANILCA, Alaska's outdoor recreational enthusiasts were promised \naccess to the 120 million acres of new parks, refuges, and wilderness \nareas. Again, whether it is our Forest Service lands, our Park Service \nlands, our refuge lands, it was all promised that, OK, it is there. It \nis for all to enjoy. But as we feared, soon after the bill was passed, \nafter ANILCA passed, Federal agencies closed access. They closed access \nby snow machines, they closed access by road, and they closed access by \nplane to some of the lands. In other words, we can enjoy access, we can \nenjoy this if we can walk there. That is good for those of us who are \nstill able-bodied, and we are much stronger when we are going up those \nmountains. But the fact is, it is limited if we can't access it by any \nother means other than walking there.\n\n  The access further went when Glacier Bay was shut off to commercial \nfishing entirely. It especially hurt where Alaskans, whose property \nthen became in-holdings within these new conservation areas, they faced \nregulations just 5 years after this law was passed that made permission \nfor access into their lands much more difficult, clearly, much more \nexpensive, and sometimes shutting them out altogether. To this day, I \ndeal with constituents who are out here in the McCarthy area, a great \npark area, but there are in-holdings, private in-holdings. But in order \nto gain access to their property that is rightly theirs--and the \nFederal Government recognizes it--they say: They can be there, but we \nare going to make it extraordinarily difficult for them to gain access \nto their own property.\n  So the promise that we as Alaskans would be able to enjoy this \nincredible land we have, even that has been hindered.\n  I have chosen to speak about these broken promises today because I \nwish to make clear that both history and the law point squarely to \nAlaska's right to the use and enjoyment of its lands. While the law \nshould be well enough, we can't forget why good public policy weighs in \nfavor as well.\n  The decisions to block Alaskan development have come to a head at the \nworst possible time. We have high unemployment. We have record Federal \ndebt. We have global financial distress. Alaska could help on all these \nfronts. We stand ready to create tens of thousands of jobs. We can \ncreate hundreds of billions of dollars in new Federal revenues. We can \nhelp relieve the staggering costs our Nation pays for foreign oil, but \nwe need permission from the Federal Government.\n  At times it seems that many in this Chamber have forgotten why we \nneed to produce our natural resources in the first place. The answer is \npretty simple: It leads to economic growth, it leads to prosperity, and \nit helps us compete in a rapidly changing world. But because we have \nslowed down resource production, because we have locked down so much of \nour lands, our Nation is increasingly--and I believe needlessly--facing \nscarcity issues and dependency, dependent on foreign sources, for so \nmany of the resources we depend upon. In terms of many of these crucial \nresources, whether it be energy, timber, minerals, Alaska is not just \nthe last frontier; it is truly the best option.\n  I am not overstating the case to say that much of our Nation's \ncompetitiveness rests on our ability to access our resources. Right \nnow, though, we are constantly blocked. Production is happening all \naround us. Just look at what is going on. We had a hearing today in the \nEnergy Committee discussing what is happening offshore of Cuba. It is \nnot just happening offshore of Cuba. It is offshore in Russia. It is \noffshore in Canada. It is down in Mexico. It is in Cuba. We can look to \nChina for our rare earth elements, but why would we do that when we \nhave the prospects in this country in Alaska? Alaska has these \nresources.\n  The positive benefits that would result if we reversed the current \ndynamic are not up for debate. Countless studies clearly show that \ndevelopment in Alaska, because of its grand scale and high resource \nvalues, will create jobs and economic benefits for literally every \nsingle State--for the Chair's State of Colorado, for all our States. \nThis does not require clear-cutting the State or drilling every inch of \nour State or every acre or every region--not even close. We are asking \nto pursue development on a very small amount of land, especially when \nwe consider Alaska's prolific standards.\n  To put it into context of the whole, and I hope everyone can see the \noutline of the lower 48 States here and Alaska is superimposed. I \ndidn't put Alaska in the middle there because it looks better in the \nmiddle. What I am trying to show is, this is a proportionate picture of \nhow Alaska, if it were superimposed over the lower 48--where we extend \nto: all the way in southeastern Ketchikan over here, which sits in \nFlorida, to fully the furthest part of the west coast, which is the \nAleutian Islands, all the way down here, going all the way up to the \nNorth and into the South.\n  The reality is, Alaska is a State the size of which can't easily be \nmeasured or even understood. As I mentioned, its most distant points \nstretch from Florida to California. Lay it across the continental \nUnited States like this, and people say we must be making it up.\n  Mr. President, you have had the opportunity to travel to my State. \nYou appreciate that when you are flying in an airplane for hours and \nstill looking down and realizing, I am still flying over the same \nState--you can appreciate the size and scope of what we are dealing \nwith. Within this area lies a tremendous natural resource base, \nconventional and nonconventional, renewable and nonrenewable.\n  When you see Alaska on a map, you never see it represented in \nproportionate size. You never realize just how unbelievably large it \nis. Unfortunately, for years when I was in school, Alaska was always in \na little box down off of California or off of Mexico, that little piece \ndown there. Our kids did not know where the exact spot on the map was. \nThey did not know the size. We are continuing to educate and educate in \nan important way because it does make a difference.\n  Before I go off this chart, I want to again put in context the \nmanagement issues we deal with. Look at this green area. This would be \nabout 64 percent of Alaska under Federal management. State management \nis about 24.5 percent, about 90 million acres; 10 percent is Native \nheld; and then less than 1 percent, about 1 million acres, is in \nprivate hands. That gives you an appreciation of what it is we are \ndealing with.\n  Mr. President, you and I have had an opportunity to talk about some \nof the truly magical places you have enjoyed in Alaska. I appreciate \nyour perspective and the special places you have been. There is no \nargument--you will not find argument from this Alaskan--that major \nportions of Alaska are truly worth protecting and should not be \ndeveloped. Those are some pretty spectacular areas. You may see them \nadvertised. Oftentimes you will have environmental groups that will \nadvertise them. The photographs may or may not always reflect the \nactual proposed sites, but they are beautiful. We will not ever dispute \nthat they are beautiful.\n  The current Deputy Secretary of the Interior has said we are not \ngoing to drill in our pristine wilderness any more than we are going to \nbuild a dam in the Grand Canyon. We are not proposing that, not by any \nlegal or commonsense definition.\n  We have in our State five major oil-bearing regions that remain \nnonproducing. We have a pipeline that is dwindling at one-third of its \ncapacity. This pipeline literally bisects the State of Alaska. It is \nthe spinal cord of our State's economy. It is a critical artery for \nAmerica's energy security. Right now, that pipeline is running low, it \nis running slow, and we are being prevented from accessing the \nresources to\n\n[[Page S6698]]\n\nbuild it up. We have negotiated, pleaded, and begged for access to our \nresources for more than a generation. We have even been willing to \nsacrifice some of the revenues Alaska is clearly entitled to by law, \nand it has fallen on positively deaf ears here in Washington, even at a \ntime when those dollars would mean quite a lot in terms of avoiding \npainful tax hikes or program cuts. When you look back on the past 50 \nyears, it is more than a little astonishing that opposition to \ndevelopment continues to be so just dug in.\n  I think what has been borne out from Alaska's resource development is \na very strong record of environmental stewardship. We have produced our \nnatural resources for generations. For my entire life there, we have \nbeen producing our resources, whether it is our timber, whether it is \nour fisheries, whether it is mining and now oil. We have produced them \nfor generations, and we have preserved our pristine qualities and the \nnatural beauty perfectly. We are a world-class vacation destination for \neveryone who wants to come up on the big cruise ships, to those who \nwant to do the ecotourism. We are a genuine paradise for the trophy \nfisherman, for the hunters who want to come to Alaska. We have a fish \nand game management program that is the most productive, the most \nsustainable model for the entire world.\n  I have people tell me: The one thing I want to do before I die is go \nto Alaska and see it. So if we have been producing all of our resources \nfor all these years, for all these generations--if we really had been \ndoing that terrible of a job, why does everybody want to see this \nincredibly beautiful land we have? I suggest it is because we have been \ndoing a pretty good job of resource development as we have gone along \nthe course.\n  Resource production has yielded substantial social and economic \nbenefits to the State. More than 16 billion barrels of oil have been \nsent to the lower 48, with minimal environmental impact. Our oil also \nsupplies refineries near Fairbanks and Anchorage. It allows us to serve \nas an international cargo hub. Our refineries produce the fuel for \nfighter jets and other military needs at our four bases. The strategic \nvalue of Alaska's geographical position--we sit literally at the top of \nthe world there--for military purposes alone is sufficient to justify \naccess to the resource, even if we were to ignore the jobs, ignore the \nrevenue and the energy security benefits that come along with it. Yet, \nas I stand here today, virtually every extractive industry in Alaska \nhas been disrupted by the Federal Government. Mining, timber, oil and \ngas--all these productions are well below or well behind the levels \nthat would best serve Alaska and our country. No matter the project, it \nseems we have to fight the Federal Government for access and permission \nevery single step of the way.\n  Federal agencies are attempting to subvert Supreme Court decisions. \nSenators from other States are attempting to halt mines that have not \neven been proposed. Permits are delayed, they are withheld, and they \nare outright refused. Drilling cannot take place in places Congress has \nexplicitly designated for drilling, including our National Petroleum \nReserve.\n  At the root of these troubles really is Alaska's treatment by the \nFederal Government. Because we have so much land and because we do \ndepend on the development of these lands to thrive as a State, Alaska's \nfuture truly rests in the Federal Government's hands. But at the very \nmoment--at the time when we most need the Federal Government to be \nacting as our partner, it has become an obstacle to progress and to our \nprosperity. The promises that were made at statehood and under ANILCA \nseem to be remembered only by Alaskans.\n  So it is apparent to me that the system of Federal land management \nand land use that used to work has now turned against us. Instead of \nfacilitating new development and working to ensure it is carried out \nresponsibly, the Federal Government now routinely denies our \nopportunities and locks up Alaska's lands. No matter where we look, we \nface this gauntlet of land use and environmental statutes that have \nbeen twisted into permitting delays, project denials, endless \nlitigation. Put at risk is the sound economy we have worked very hard \nto build, the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of Alaskans, and our \nability to live up to our obligation at statehood to remain financially \nsolvent as a State. We are in this position for, I believe, one reason, \nand that is because the promises that were made to Alaska by the \nFederal Government have been broken. We have asked nicely--perhaps too \nnicely--for a long time for those promises to be honored.\n\n  So, before I close, I would like to draw one more quotation from \nSenator Gruening, of whom I spoke earlier. This is a rather lengthy \nquote, but it is one worth hearing. Senator Gruening states:\n\n       We Alaskans believe passionately that American citizenship \n     is the most precious possession in the world. Hence we want \n     it in full measure; full citizenship instead of half-\n     citizenship; first class instead of second class citizenship. \n     We demand equality with all other Americans and the liberties \n     long denied us that go with it. To adapt Daniel Webster's \n     famous phrase uttered as a peroration against impending \n     separatism, we Alaskans want ``liberty and union, one and \n     inseparable, now and forever.''\n       But the keepers of Alaska's colonial status should be \n     reminded that the 18th century colonials for long years \n     sought merely to obtain relief from abuses, for which they--\n     like us--vainly pleaded, before finally resolving that only \n     independence would secure for them the ``life, liberty and \n     pursuit of happiness,'' which they felt was their natural \n     right.\n       We trust that the United States will not, by similar \n     blindness to our rights and deafness to our pleas, drive \n     Alaskans from patient hope to desperation.\n\n  That is pretty lofty language, I grant you, but I think it is suited. \nI think it is suited to this conversation this evening. Just as Ernest \nGruening had to have this same fight from this same Chamber over 50 \nyears ago, I am compelled to remind this body that the greatness of \nthis Nation, the ultimate and true greatness of the experiment, depends \non the greatness of the individual States which comprise it. As we look \nat our States and what they are capable of achieving, I would bet \nAlaska's potential against any other.\n  Today, on the 144th anniversary of Alaska Day, I ask the Senate to \njust think, to consider the promises that were made to the State of \nAlaska, to realize that those promises have not been kept but broken to \nthe detriment of both Alaska and our Nation as a whole. This must be \nchanged with the realization that partnership, not abject denial, is \ntruly the best path forward. If the Federal Government keeps its \npromises, Alaska will realize its potential, grow as a State, and \nsecure its future.\n  We would not be doing this just for Alaska alone. The rest of the \nNation will benefit greatly as well. That is something we need. It is \nsomething we should all agree to work for. There is probably no better \ntime to start than today as we recognize Alaska Day.\n  I thank the Chair for the attention of the Presiding Officer and for \nthe opportunity to share a little bit of Alaska's history and our \nfrustration with the present.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/18/senate-section/article/S6698-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M TOMORROW\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
