Madam President, yesterday my friends, the chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee and the ranking member of the Armed \nServices Committee, submitted a resolution supporting the U.S. \ninvolvement in the NATO action in Libya.\n  I commend my friends who have submitted a strong bipartisan \nresolution with an impressive list of cosponsors, including Senators \nMcCain, Levin, Durbin, Kyl, Feinstein, Graham, Lieberman, Blunt, \nCardin, and others. This should have overwhelming support, and I am \nconfident it will.\n  Some Republicans in the House of Representatives and on the campaign \ntrail have expressed concern over our involvement in this conflict. \nThey have clearly decided to use the War Powers Resolution as a \npolitical bludgeon to pursue a partisan agenda.\n  But I also believe there is a larger question we must each ask \nourselves as Senators as we consider this military action: Was our \nparticipation in the international effort to stop mass murder and chaos \nin Libya a just decision? I am confident it was.\n  Muammar Qadhafi's repressive dictatorship is a threat to the region \nand to U.S. national security. Our support of this mission is crucial \nfor our NATO alliance that is leading this mission and for the people \nof Libya who lived far too long under Qadhafi's brutal regime.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts and the senior Senator from \nArizona for beginning to deliberate. These two senior Senators have \nbegun a deliberate, bipartisan discussion of this important matter in \nthe Senate. Working together, this bipartisan group of Senators has \nmade a clear statement to our allies, to the world, to the Libyan \npeople, and to Qadhafi that we support the people's action in Libya.\n  The Senate is truly at its best when bipartisan lawmakers work \ntogether. That is why it is so unfortunate that yesterday Republicans \nwere unwilling to join us in our efforts to create jobs for Americans \nwho need them so very badly. For the fourth time this year, my \nRepublican colleagues stalled a jobs bill that could have put hundreds \nof thousands of Americans to work now.\n  This was the second jobs bill Republicans have killed by piling on \nunrelated amendments--the EDA bill that I\n\n[[Page S3982]]\n\njust referred to, almost 100 amendments, none of which related to the \nlegislation at hand. Two more jobs bills passed the Senate but are \nwasting away in the House. All four of these bills are commonsense \nefforts to spur innovation, investment, and hiring by private \ncompanies. All four had a proven track record of creating jobs. The \nmessage the Republicans have sent is clear: They care more about \npartisan politics than they do about putting Americans back to work.\n  Later today, Democrats will talk about our plan to reduce the jobs \ndeficit, a problem just as critical to Americans as our budget deficit. \nWe hope our Republican colleagues will join us to tackle the problem. \nSo far, they have put politics first.\n  I don't know what it will take for Republicans to get the message \nthat people in Nevada and across the country care more about jobs than \nany other issue. It is the most important issue on which Congress \nshould focus. Instead, Republicans are focused on the one thing \nAmericans don't want to change: ending Medicare as we know it. It is \nwrong that Republicans are trying to end Medicare as we know it. The \nAmerican public does not support this.\n  The vast majority of Americans say they oppose the Republican plan to \nbalance the budget on the backs of seniors by killing Medicare. The \nnumber amongst seniors and Independents is sky high in opposition to \nthe Republican plan to change Medicare as we know it. There is no \nmystery to why they oppose it. The Republican plan to end Medicare \nwould put insurance company bureaucrats between seniors and their \ndoctors. It would raise drug prices from day one. It would increase the \ncost of cancer screenings and treatments for 7 million seniors and do a \nlot more damage to our Medicare recipients.\n  Seniors cannot afford this dangerous plan nor can America. The Senate \ncan't afford to waste any more time. It is our job to create jobs. It \nis time for Republicans to leave Medicare alone and let us get back to \nwork creating jobs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/22/senate-section/article/S3982-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I wish to pick up a little bit again in \nmy remarks on what the majority leader was just talking about; that is, \nthe lack of focus on jobs in this country.\n  I am disturbed by the growing disconnect between Washington's \nobsession with austerity and retrenchment and cutting and slashing and \nthe disconnect from that with the dramatically different needs, \npriorities, and anxieties of ordinary working Americans. The so-called \nchattering class here in Washington has persuaded itself that the \nbiggest issue is the budget deficit. But Americans outside the Beltway \nare most concerned with a far more urgent deficit, the jobs deficit, \nand their concerns are well founded.\n  Our Nation remains deeply mired in the most protracted period of \njoblessness since the Great Depression. Real unemployment is close to \n16 percent. Tens of millions of people who are employed are \nincreasingly anxious about being able to hold on to their jobs and to \nmake ends meet.\n  The American people get it. They want to get this economy moving \nagain, and they know the best way to reduce the budget deficit is to \nhelp 25 million unemployed Americans get good, middle-class jobs and \nbecome taxpayers once again. With the private sector engine sputtering, \nthere is an absolutely critical role for the Federal Government in \ncreating demand and preventing a double-dip recession.\n  We have to wonder, is Washington listening to working middle-class \nAmericans? Is Washington listening to the legions of unemployed and the \nunderemployed who are desperate for solutions to their plight? Sadly, I \nthink the answer is, no, Washington is not listening.\n  Many of our political leaders are treating the jobs crisis as \nyesterday's news. They are putting deficit reduction above all else. \nThey are demanding extraordinary--in fact, unprecedented--cuts to \ngovernment funding and government investment. It is akin to a bidding \nwar, driven by the hysteria of the auction rather than the value of the \nlot: Let's cut $1 trillion. No, $1.5 trillion here. No, I have $2 \ntrillion over here. How about $4 trillion? It is akin to a bidding war \nto see how much we can cut government funding and investment.\n  I have to ask, has Washington lost its mind? Don't we realize these \nDraconian cuts are the economic equivalent of applying leeches and \ndraining blood from a sick patient? Don't we realize this will make \nboth the jobs deficit and the budget deficit far worse?\n  Of course, we must act aggressively to bring deficits under control. \nBut we have to do this in ways that continue to create more jobs while \nalso improving the long-term competitiveness of the American economy.\n  We have reached the point of maximum danger in the fragile economic \nrecovery. We are at the point of maximum danger. Employment growth is \nweak and threatens to stall out altogether. Businesses remain reluctant \nto invest and hire for the simple reason that there is not sufficient \ndemand for goods and services. All those unemployed and underemployed \npeople are only spending enough to make ends meet. If they are getting \nunemployment compensation, they are barely making ends meet. There is \nno excess money. The middle class is tapped out, with stagnant incomes, \ninsecure jobs, high levels of mortgage, and high levels of consumer \ndebt. The threat of a double-dip recession is far too real, and the \nfear of more unemployment also hangs right over tomorrow's horizon.\n  In this context, to insist that we slash Federal funding by trillions \nof dollars is beyond foolish. It is government malpractice. It flies in \nthe face of everything we know and have learned about how economies \nwork.\n  Two weeks ago, Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke stated the obvious. \nHe warned us:\n\n       A sharp fiscal consolidation focused on the very near term \n     could be self-defeating if it were to undercut the still-\n     fragile economy.\n\n  Again I ask, is anyone listening? The alarm bells are ringing all \nover America.\n  Recently, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York published an online \narticle about what it called ``the mistake of 1937.'' What is that all \nabout? The New York Fed was referring to the premature fiscal and \nmonetary pullback in 1937 just as the economy was beginning to get its \nlegs to get out of the Depression. That premature retrenchment was a \nhistoric mistake. It killed the recovery then in progress and sent us \nback into the Great Depression for another almost 4 years until it was \nfinally ended with the stimulative spending of World War II.\n  Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, says that in \nimportant ways we have already repeated the mistake of 1937. We have \ntaken our eyes off of what should be our No. 1 priority--creating \njobs--and we have pivoted to an obsession--again I repeat, an \nobsession--with deep, short-term budget cuts which by their very nature \nwill destroy jobs and weaken the economy.\n  Let me cite another glaring example of the disconnect between \nWashington and the rest of the country. Here in Washington Republicans \nassert that the Recovery Act was a failure. Why do they claim that? \nBecause they claim President Obama promised the Recovery Act would \nreduce unemployment to 8 percent and because that has not happened, it \nwas a failure. We have researched this. The Republican talking point on \nthis President Obama promise has no basis in fact. Independent fact \ncheckers in the media have tried to find such a promise or a statement \nby President Obama, and they have come up empty.\n\n[[Page S3983]]\n\n  I say again to my Republican friends, if you have some proof of \nPresident Obama saying the Recovery Act would reduce unemployment to 8 \npercent, please bring it forward. All we have found in checking this \nwas an illustrative table from a report that was published--are you \nready for this?--before President Obama took office, speculating that \nsome future stimulus program might reduce unemployment to 8 percent \ndepending on how big the stimulus was.\n  Those same fact checkers found that President Obama did promise one \nthing of the Recovery Act: He said it would prevent a new Great \nDepression and prevent unemployment rates of 12 or 13 percent. That did \nhappen.\n  Fortunately, ordinary Americans have a better understanding of the \nRecovery Act. They know hundreds of billions of dollars in middle-class \ntax cuts in the Recovery Act gave them a modest but a significant boost \nin income. They know that because of the Recovery Act's assistance to \nthe States, many tens of thousands of teachers, police officers, and \nother essential employees were able to keep their jobs. They have seen \ncountless highway and other infrastructure projects funded by the \nRecovery Act. All of these have either preserved jobs or created new \nand more jobs. They provided significant benefits for our people, \nincluding better roads, better bridges, better schools, and other \ncritical infrastructure for the future of our country.\n  Thanks in large part to the Recovery Act, we have gone from losing \n700,000 jobs a month in late 2008 when President Obama took office to \nadding new jobs now for 16 consecutive months building the \ninfrastructure of America. I know a little bit about this. If you go \nover to my office, you will see hanging on my wall in my office my \nfather's WPA card. To all of you young people who do not know what WPA \nstands for, it stands for the Works Projects Administration. It started \nunder Franklin Roosevelt during the Great Depression to hire people who \nwere unemployed to work on infrastructure projects.\n  I know my father worked on three of those projects. One was Lake \nAhquabi near Indianola, IA, which is still a State park and \nrecreational area enjoyed by people all year-round, especially in the \nsummertime. Another was a high school in Indianola, still in use, built \nby WPA. The other was the Maffitt Reservoir built by the WPA for a \nholding of the city of Des Moines reservoir. All three were built by \nthe WPA, still in use today. We can see countless examples of this all \nover America. We have schools in Iowa which have been modified and \nupgraded but still were built by the WPA. That is true all over the \ncountry.\n  What happened is they built an infrastructure that helped the private \nsector be more efficient and more productive and make lives better for \nour people. We need to do that again, and we need to invest all over \nAmerica. The Recovery Act started that, but now we know it was not \nenough and it was not long enough. Just as in 1937, we are about to \nrepeat that same mistake. If we had kept the stimulus going through \n1937 and 1938, we would not have fallen back as we did at that time.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that through \nthe end of 2010 the Recovery Act had raised the gross domestic product \nby as much as 3.5 percent and increased the number of employed \nAmericans by as many as 3.3 million people--employed in the public \nsector but also in the private sector.\n  Business columnists and pundits have no doubt that the Recovery Act \nhas boosted the economy. You can go to CNBC or Bloomberg on cable TV. \nIn recent months, it has almost become a cliche for commentators to say \nthis: Sure the economy is growing again, but this is largely because of \nthe Recovery Act and the easing by the Federal Reserve. As those things \nwind down, the economy will be in danger once again.\n  OK, it seems to me, then, that we do not want to wind them down. Why \nwind them down and throw us into a tailspin again? These business \npundits are correct. The shot in the arm provided by the Recovery Act \nis now winding down. It threatens our fragile recovery. In the absence \nof Federal assistance, many States are making deep budget cuts or \nlaying off their employees. In Texas, Governor Perry has proposed to \ncut education funding by a staggering $10 billion. In New York City, \nMayor Bloomberg has proposed laying off 6,000 teachers. Total State and \nlocal government layoffs just in the last 6 months have been nearly \n350,000--350,000 people who were working no longer work. They are laid \noff. Where will the demand be for goods and services from the private \nsector from all these laid off individuals? Now, if the Federal \nGovernment follows suit, after what is happening in our States, with \nthese massive short-term spending cuts, the prospect of a more severe \nrecession will be very real, and we will go off that cliff.\n  So I reject the false choice between addressing the budget deficit \nand addressing the job deficit. We can and must do both. As I said \nearlier, the budget deficit is in large part caused because of the high \njobs deficit. High unemployment over the last 3 years has ballooned the \ndeficit by hundreds of billions of dollars because tax revenues have \nfallen. Federal spending has increased for things such as food stamps, \nnutrition assistance, unemployment benefits, Medicaid. How often do we \nhear that Medicaid spending is skyrocketing? You know, before you get \nMedicaid, you have to fall under certain poverty guidelines. The reason \nMedicaid is going up is because people are not working. People are not \nworking because there aren't any jobs. And there aren't any jobs \nbecause the Federal Government will not prime the pump, because the \nFederal Government--now we are being told we must cut back with huge \ncuts, tremendous cuts that will further make more people get laid off \nand will further make the problem even worse than it is now.\n  The smartest approach is to take measures to sharply reduce the \ndeficits in the medium and long term but to invest in job creation in \nthe short term. We have it backward. Washington now has it backward. My \nRepublican friends have it backward. They are going to slash and cut, \nand that is going to push us into another recession. Better we invest \nin the infrastructure and keep new jobs and more jobs out there that \nwill create the pent-up demand we need for goods and services. That \nwill help us reduce the deficit in the medium and the long term.\n  We have to do it right, a balanced way--some spending cuts, revenue \nincreases. People say: How can we invest, Senator Harkin, in all these \nroads and new schools and new infrastructure, new energy systems--how \ncan we do that when we are broke? Will we just have to borrow more \nmoney from China, go further into debt, put more debt on our kids and \ngrandkids' heads?\n  I thoroughly reject the premise under which the Ryan budget and the \nRepublican budget is based. It is based on the premise that we are \nbroke, that we are poor, that we can't afford to have teachers and we \ncan't afford to have more medical personnel out there taking care of \nour elderly, that we can't afford more roads and bridges and sewer and \nwater systems and better school facilities and better technology and \nnew energy systems--we can't afford to do that because we are broke. I \nreject that. We are not broke. We are not poor.\n  The United States of America is the richest nation in the history of \nmankind. We are the richest nation on the face of the Earth. We have \nthe highest per capita income of any major nation in the world. So one \nhas to ask the question, if we are so rich, why are we so broke? Why \nare we so poor? The reason is because the system is broken.\n  This really started with the massive tax cuts enacted under the \nGeorge W. Bush administration in 2001. Need I remind anyone that we had \n3 straight years of budget surplus? CBO said that if we kept on the \ntrack we were on, we would pay off the national debt by 2010. But as \nsoon as President Bush was in office, Republicans took control of both \nthe House and the Senate and gave, massive tax cuts mostly to the \nwealthy in our country. That, plus two unpaid-for wars and an unpaid-\nfor Medicare benefit, put us into the greatest deficit and biggest debt \nwe have ever had as a nation.\n  If 50 percent of the problem we have with the deficit was made \nbecause of the tax cuts that mostly went to the wealthy, then we have \nto think seriously--no, I will rephrase that. We don't have to think \nseriously; we must act decisively to raise revenues so we\n\n[[Page S3984]]\n\ndo not have to borrow more money. There are revenues there to be had. A \nfew people made a lot of money in the last 10 years. I don't think it \nis untoward to ask them to perhaps help rebuild America. The private \nsector companies, I am told, are sitting on about $2 trillion in cash, \nand they will not invest it. There is money there. Our tax system--our \nsystem is screwed up. So we need both--yes, to make targeted cuts in \ncertain programs. We can do that. But we also need to raise the \nrevenues necessary to invest in putting people to work and rebuilding \nthe infrastructure of this country.\n  Republicans are saying we need more tax breaks for the wealthy. If \nworking people and the middle class are taking a hit in tough times, it \nshould not be to pay for more tax breaks for the wealthy. As our leader \njust said, after weeks of debate, Republicans blocked passage of a \nbipartisan small business bill, and just this week they killed the \nEconomic Development Administration development bill with a proven \nrecord of job creation. The key to renewing America and restoring our \neconomy is to revitalize the middle class. That means investing in \neducation, innovation, the infrastructure, boasting American \ncompetitiveness in a highly competitive global marketplace. How do we \ndo both? We do it by making certain targeted cuts but raising revenues \nby raising revenues. I would have to add, one of those ways we have to \nthink about cutting is, why we are continuing to spend billions of \ndollars and losing American lives in Afghanistan? What are we still \ndoing in Iraq? I saw a recent report that said we have spent over $87 \nbillion in Iraq. What do we have to show for it? Higher gasoline prices \nthan ever before and a country that is still torn apart by internal \nstrife.\n\n  If we want to move ahead and create these jobs, it means a level \nplaying field, fair taxation, an empowered workforce, a strong ladder \nof opportunity to give every American a shot at the middle class.\n  With the fragile economic recovery, we should not reduce fiscal \nsupport for job creation at this time. Deficit reduction efforts can \nstart but sequenced in. When the economy is recovering, that is when \nthey start taking place. Now is the time to invest in job creation. We \nneed to keep our priorities straight. The greatest challenge right now \nis not the budget deficit. The greatest challenge is the jobs deficit. \nThe greatest challenge is the erosion of the middle class, which is \nunder siege in America. The middle class is being dismantled every day. \nPeople are losing their savings, their health care, their pensions and, \nin many cases, even their homes. These proposed gradual budget cuts, \ndrastic budget cuts will destroy jobs and further damage the economy. \nThe people, the middle class of America, have every reason to believe \nthey are losing the American dream not just for themselves but for \ntheir children.\n  Instead of the Republican budget, which is being sold through fear \nand fatalism, we need a budget that reflects the hopes and aspirations \nof the American people. We need a budget that will invest to create \njobs, that will bring future deficits under control as more people come \nto work, as fewer people need Medicaid, as fewer and fewer people need \nfood stamps, as fewer and fewer people need unemployment compensation \nwhen they begin working and becoming taxpayers again. It is up to the \nFederal Government to take this step, and we should not be afraid to do \nso. It must be bold. It cannot be tinkering around the edges. It must \nbe something that is big and that is bold and that will jump-start our \neconomy. That is our No. 1 priority. I hope we can do this so it will \nnot happen that we go into another Great Depression or what happened in \nthe late 1930s; that we had to depend upon another war to stimulate \nGovernment spending and put people back to work. God help us if that is \nthe only thing we can look forward to, to get our economy going again. \nWe should have learned from the past, taken those lessons from the past \nand take the steps necessary right now to invest in jobs, to rebuild \nthe middle class of America, and to have a fair taxation system so \nthose people at the top who make so much--and I don't begrudge people \nmaking money, but I do begrudge if they are not paying their fair share \nin revenues to this country. That is our challenge. I hope Congress is \nup to meeting that challenge. The middle class is the backbone of \nAmerica, and it is time this Congress showed the backbone to stick up \nfor them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I also wanted to speak about the new \nNational Labor Relations Board rules that came out just yesterday. It \nalso has a lot do with the middle class in America and what happens to \nthe middle class.\n  In 1912, women went on strike at a textile plant in Lawrence, MA. \nThey inspired the Nation when they walked the picket lines with signs \nthat said: ``We want bread, but we want roses too.'' Well, what did \nthey mean by that? They meant they wanted jobs, but they didn't want \njust bear subsistence and slave jobs. As you know, many women died in \nthe terrible triangle shirtwaist textile plant fire. They wanted jobs, \nbut they wanted jobs that paid a living wage. They wanted jobs that did \nnot work people 12, 18 hours a day, 6 or 7 days a week. Those words \nhelped to shape the character of the country we created, a shared \nprosperity for the American people.\n  Almost 100 years later, we face the same fundamental question about \nwhat kind of country we want to be. When we imagine the America of our \ndreams or our children and grandchildren, is bread just good enough for \nthe middle class or should we have some roses too?\n  Republicans portray our country as poor and broke, and they have used \nthat as an excuse to rationalize an unprecedented attack on the middle \nclass. But, the reality is we are the wealthiest Nation in history. It \nis just more and more of our country's wealth is being concentrated at \nthe top.\n  Certainly, the American people do not begrudge the rich their good \nfortune and success. But they do resent it when the wealthy and the \npowerful manipulate the political system to reap huge advantages at the \nexpense of working people. Today, unfortunately, more and more people \nsense in their hearts that the rules of the game have are rigged in \nfavor of CEOs and big corporations, and nowhere is this more apparent \nthan the process by which workers form a union or, I should say, by \nwhich process workers are blocked from forming a union.\n  As it now stands, the union election process is a never-ending, \nbitter struggle marred by corporate intimidation and frivolous \nlawsuits. Workers have to walk through broken glass on their hands and \nknees to get the same basic rights that every wealthy CEO has the right \nto have the terms of their employment set out in an enforceable \ncontract. Right now, CEO's bargain extremely generous salaries and \ngolden-parachute retirements, but millions of hardworking Americans \ndon't have a way to guarantee from week to week that they will have \nenough hours to feed their family or that their health benefits won't \nbe cut without notice.\n  So the rules promulgated by the NLRB yesterday try to right this and \nto make it a fair and equitable process so people can form a union. The \nproposed rules are very modest. What it does is cut down on the number \nof frivolous lawsuits and removes unnecessary delays that prevent \nworkers from getting a vote in elections. Sometimes it takes months \nand, in some cases, years before workers even get a chance to vote on \nwhether or not they want to form a union. All the while, people are \nharassed and intimidated. These workers know first hand that justice \ndelayed is justice denied. That is not the\n\n[[Page S3985]]\n\nAmerican way. Workers deserve a fair shake and a fair election. If \npeople want to form a union, they deserve that right to do so.\n  The steps they took are common sense. It removes unnecessary delays, \ncuts down on frivolous legal challenges, gives workers the right to a \nfair up-or-down vote, in a reasonable period of time. These new rules \ndo not encourage unionization, and they do not discourage it. They just \ngive workers the ability to say yes or no. Again, what they seek is \nvalid.\n  The current system is broken. If a party takes advantage of every \nopportunity for delay, the average time before workers can vote is 198 \ndays, and, as I have said, it has taken 13 years before people were \nallowed to vote in a union election. A study by the Center for Economic \nPolicy Research found, among workers who openly advocate for a union \nduring an election campaign, one in five is fired. Madam President, 9 \nout of 10 employers require their employees to attend meetings on work \ntime to hear anti-union presentations. Workers are required to attend \n10 anti-union meetings. Well, it is time to right this imbalance.\n  That is what the NLRB did--not tilt it one way or another but to give \nworkers a fair right to have an election. The rules apply to secret \nballot elections, but make modest changes to not to have it dragged out \nfor years and years with frivolous lawsuits while preserving employer's \ndue process rights. The new rules standardize time lines for union \nelections so that both sides have a fair chance to make their case and \nthen employees have the right to a timely vote. They ensure that \nemployers and employees have a level playing field, where corporate \nexecutives and rank-and-file workers alike have an equal chance to make \ntheir case for or against the union. That is all it is. It is nothing \nmore, nothing less than that. This is a fair set of rules.\n\n  I am sure we are going to hear from the business community about \nthis, saying this is meddling and this is going to tilt toward the \nunions. No, it doesn't. For far too long it has been tilted on the side \nof the employer and against the unions. Now we bring it back to the \nmiddle, where we say we are neither pro nor against, but we are going \nto let workers have the right to say whether they want to form a union. \nSome workplaces will choose a union, some will not. But protecting the \nright of workers to make that choice brings some balance and fairness \nto the system, so the deck isn't always stacked in favor of the wealthy \nand the powerful.\n  America's future depends on the middle class having not just bread, \nbut roses too, just as was the case 99 years ago. Our government faces \na clear choice: do we stand for seemingly endless corporate power, or \ndo we stand for the basic rights of working people? Republicans keep \npushing for special favors for the wealthy and big corporations, \nclaiming this will create jobs and economic prosperity. Instead, over \nthe last decade, it has brought us high unemployment and the worst \neconomic downturn since the Great Depression. The problem with trick \ndown economics is that it failed to trickle down. Wealth has been \nincreasingly concentrated at the top.\n  There is a better way. Quality jobs that pay a living wage, provide \nhealth insurance and a secure retirement are the foundation of a strong \nmiddle class. Having a strong middle class that can afford to buy \nquality products made in America is the recipe for our economic \nrenewal.\n  I compliment the NLRB. I know I have heard there will be some \nchallenges to it on the floor of the Senate. I hope reason will prevail \nand the Senate will once again stand for the inherent right of people \nto be able to organize and bargain collectively for their wages, hours, \nand conditions of employment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/22/senate-section/article/S3985-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3985-S3987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  EDA\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, there was a vote yesterday on the Senate \nfloor about a bill that was pending. It goes directly to the topic just \nraised by the Senator from Iowa. It was the Economic Development \nRevitalization Act. The EDA is an agency created almost a half century \nago to create incentives for businesses to build, expand, and locate in \nplaces across America where there is high unemployment. It has been a \nsuccess in Illinois and almost every other State.\n  For every $1 the Federal Government puts on the table, it generates \n$7 in economic activity. There is not a lot to go around, so they pick \nthose projects that are the most promising, and it is a good agency. It \nis an agency that has enjoyed wide bipartisan support. Yet, when it \ncame time yesterday to vote on whether we go ahead and pass the bill to \nreauthorize the agency, unfortunately, we could not find 60 Senators on \nthe floor to vote yes. So the bill languishes and basically was pulled \nfrom the calendar.\n  It is the second time this year, when we face this recession and high \nunemployment, the Senate has refused to take up a bill that literally \nwill help businesses create jobs across America. It does not make \nsense, does it, that when we have so many people out of work, we cannot \neven agree on a bill to create jobs and help business. It does not make \nsense, unless the premise of this debate is understood.\n  The Republican minority leader, Senator McConnell, said his highest \nlegislative priority this session was to make sure President Obama is a \none-term President. It is that guiding force that led to the vote \nyesterday. It is that guiding force that has stopped us from passing \nmeaningful legislation when it comes to unemployment in America, time \nand again. You see, if we are destined and determined to stop this \nPresident and frustrate any efforts to build jobs, then the Senate will \ncontinue to languish.\n  How does this work? It works because when bills come to the floor, \nbrought by the majority leader, Harry Reid, Senators from the other \nside of the aisle start a steady stream procession to this desk to file \namendment after amendment, until we had literally 100 amendments filed \nto the Economic Development Administration bill. You say: Well, maybe \nthis bill needed some work.\n  The amendments had little or nothing do with the bill. They are about \neverything under the Sun--every issue a Senator can dream up or that \nhis or her staff thinks might be interesting. Believe me, 100 is a \nmodest number. We could certainly, our staff people and others, come up \nwith hundreds more. But at the end of the day we still would not pass \nthe Economic Development Revitalization Act. We would not help \nbusinesses locate, expand, and create jobs, and we will still continue \nto languish with millions of Americans unemployed.\n\n  I think it is time for us to face reality. The reality we face is \nthat America has two deficits. The one we talk about a lot is the \nbudget deficit, and it is serious. I was on the deficit commission, the \nBowles-Simpson Commission. We looked at it long and hard and realized \nit is unsustainable for America to borrow 40 cents for every dollar it \nspends in Washington. We can't continue to do this. The debt of our \nNation is growing dramatically, and we have to bring it to a stop. That \nmeans cutting spending and raising revenue. Those are the only two ways \nto reduce the deficit, and we have to do both. That is what the Bowles-\nSimpson Commission said--and I voted for it--a bipartisan vote for the \nCommission to move forward on the deficit. But they said something \nelse: Don't do this too quickly; don't do it precipitously; be careful \nthat we don't kill off the recovery we are engaged in.\n  The Bowles-Simpson Commission basically said to wait a year. Make a \nplan, make a commitment, but say for this year we are going to get \nAmerica back to work. The Bowles-Simpson Commission knew--and we all \nknow--we can't balance America's budget with 14 million people out of \nwork. These are folks who should be earning a paycheck and paying taxes \nbut instead are home looking for work, searching the Internet, \nsearching the classifieds, and drawing benefits from the government \ninstead of paying taxes. So as long as 14 million Americans are in that \nposition, then, sadly, we are going to have a deficit that is \naggravated rather than one that is cured.\n  So the Bowles-Simpson Commission said don't move too quickly to kill \nprograms that make a difference. They are\n\n[[Page S3986]]\n\nright. I happen to think they were right in many other respects.\n  When we deal with our budget deficit, let's be honest about it. It is \ngoing to take sacrifice from everybody. Maybe some of the poorest among \nus cannot sacrifice any more. I understand that. But for most of us a \nlittle change in our lifestyle, a little change in the government \nbenefits we might be receiving or the taxes we might be paying is not \ntoo high a price or too much to ask to put this economy on the right \ntrack.\n  I think a lot about sacrifices being made by Americans, and the first \npeople who come to mind are our men and women in uniform who are \nserving around the world. I think about the sacrifice they have \nvolunteered to make every single day. They are willing to risk and, in \nmany cases, give their lives for this Nation. If they are willing to \nmake that kind of sacrifice, can we honestly say with a straight face \nwe can make no sacrifice to make America stronger? I think we can. I \nthink we should. I think we ought to come together in a bipartisan \nfashion.\n  I am frustrated by the fact that for the last 5 months I have been \nmeeting with a bipartisan group of Senators and we have come up with \nthe basic outline of an approach which would dramatically reduce \nAmerica's deficit in a balanced and fair way. It would put everything \non the table. Let me underline the word ``everything.'' Many of my \ncolleagues don't want everything on the table. On this side of the \naisle they don't want to talk about our entitlement programs. On the \nother side of the aisle they don't want to talk about revenue. I \nunderstand that, but we both have to give a little for the good of this \ncountry. But after 5 months of long, tortured negotiation; after what I \nconsider to be a successful effort--95 percent successful--in producing \na plan for deficit reduction, I am sorry to report we are just not \nready to let the world in on what we have been doing. I wish we would.\n  I am prepared, and I hope other colleagues will be too, to come to \nthe floor and to lay this out and say: If this helps--if this helps our \ncountry, if this helps Congress, if it helps the President, if it helps \nthose who are working with Vice President Biden--then here is our \noffering. Here is our best effort. It is not perfect, and it won't be \nthe end product. But for goodness' sakes, the time is over for talking \nbehind closed doors. I appeal to all of my colleagues who believe we \nshould come forward with this Gang of 6--now down to Gang of 5--\nproposal, to let it be known: Come to the floor, talk to our \ncolleagues, let us break this logjam which has stopped us from bringing \nthese ideas forward.\n  I want to keep my good faith with those who are engaged in this \neffort. I am not going to stand here and describe in any detail what we \nhave been doing. I will, however, tell my colleagues I have reached a \nlevel of frustration. After all this work and all this time, all this \neffort and all the political courage I have seen exhibited behind \nclosed doors, we need to step forward and say something publicly. We \nneed to do it in a fashion that gives some guidance to those who are \nmaking critical decisions.\n  Let's not reach the point where we literally test the \ncreditworthiness of the United States of America by refusing to extend \nthe debt ceiling. That is a bill which goes largely unnoticed each \nyear. It is when America renews its mortgage. It comes due August 2 \nthis year. If we don't do it, I can tell my colleagues what is going to \nhappen. My projections are not based on any great expertise I have but \non what has been told to me by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, by \nthe Secretary of the Treasury, by the President.\n  Here is what will happen: If the United States does not show we are \nready to pay our debts in a timely fashion, what is going to happen \nautomatically is that interest rates will rise. The Federal Reserve is \nsupposed to report this week that they are going to keep interest rates \nlow because they want America's economy to recover. We can spoil this \nparty in a hurry if we get engaged in a political cat fight between the \nHouse and the Senate and both political parties and do not extend the \ndebt ceiling. Failure to extend the debt ceiling or creating \nuncertainty about its extension will raise interest rates. Who will pay \nthe price? Americans across the board.\n  When we want to buy a car, we will pay a higher interest rate. When \nwe want to buy a home, we will pay a higher interest rate. If we want \nto start a business and expand and hire more people, if we can borrow \nmoney, it will be at a higher interest rate. This will slow down our \nrecovery at a time when we need just the opposite.\n  So let me suggest that those who believe, as I do--and I think I have \nput up my beliefs for display when it comes to this deficit--that we \nneed a bipartisan approach that is serious, for goodness' sakes, let's \nnot bargain with the debt ceiling. Let's do what is right for America \nin a bipartisan fashion and then stand up together and accept the \nresponsibility of governing, the responsibility of reaching a decision \nand moving forward.\n  When we see a bill such as the Economic Development Administration \nbill die on the Senate floor, as we did last night, it is a reminder of \nhow partisanship run amok can hurt us when America needs leadership the \nmost. To put 100 amendments on the floor to a bill as simple as this--\nit used to pass with a voice vote--is an indication there are some in \nthe Senate who want to accomplish absolutely nothing except partisan \ndebate. That is not good for this country. If the best thing we can do \nat the end of the day, after all 100 Senators come filing through the \ndoor, is to pass some resolution extolling the virtue of someone across \nAmerica--if that is the best we can do--maybe we don't deserve these \npaychecks we are being sent. Maybe it is time for the American people \nto demand an accounting of those elected to office.\n  We have to be ready to not only make the speeches and make the \npolitical points, but we have to stand and make a difference. That \nmeans standing together. It means taking a risk of putting everything \non the table and getting America moving. If we can get this deficit \nresolved, we can convince people across this country and around the \nworld we are serious about it and we are going to launch an economic \nrecovery that will create jobs and help businesses and make us a \nstronger nation and give our kids a chance. The alternative is \nunacceptable.\n  Today, I hope my colleagues--if they believe we should move forward \non a bipartisan basis to deal with this deficit and to put everything \non the table now and get down to business--will come to the floor and \nsay as much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I understand I have 10 minutes to speak; \nis that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CORKER. If the Chair will show me the courtesy of letting me know \nif I happen to get within 2 minutes of that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I rise to speak on the same topic the \nSenator from Illinois was speaking about; that is, the discussions \ntaking place right now around the debt ceiling vote and what kind of \narrangement or what kind of agreement can take place. These are called \nthe Blair House negotiations. They are happening between the Vice \nPresident of the United States--the actual President of the Senate when \nhe is here--and leaders on both the Republican and Democratic side of \nthe House and Senate.\n  What I wish to speak about today stems from reading some of the \npublic comments. I am concerned the type of deal they may be trying to \nseek is not something many of us in this body would even agree to if \nthey reached it, meaning it is far more modest than I think most of us \nhave been looking at. It is my understanding they are going to be \nmeeting all week. It is my understanding they had hoped to reach an \nagreement by next week. So my reason for coming to the floor is to ask \nthe Vice President and those others who are involved in this to \npublicly tell us by the end of next week what deal it is they are \ntrying to accomplish and in what timeframe.\n  I think all of us are frustrated. We work in the Senate, and as the \nSenator from Illinois was just mentioning, we have done absolutely \nnothing in this body this year--nothing. We have voted on a few \nnoncontroversial judges--\n\n[[Page S3987]]\n\nmaybe we have done slightly more than that, but almost nothing--while \nour country languishes, worrying about what we are going to do with \nthese budget debates. As a matter of fact, we haven't passed a budget \nnow in something like 770 days.\n  So here we are shelling out taxpayer money each year--$3.5 trillion, \n$3.7 trillion--and we don't have a budget, which is about as \nirresponsible as one can be.\n  Actually, there are groups working on other solutions. I think it \nwould be good for this body to know what kind of arrangement is being \nlooked at, what kind of goals are trying to be achieved, and in what \ntimeframe they are going to be achieved so that people will know with \nsome degree of certainty whether there is going to be something \nachieved to which we would agree.\n  Let me give an example. One of the things I have heard is, we are \ngoing to have the same amount of debt limit extension as we do in \nreductions, meaning we will have $2.4 trillion in debt ceiling \nadditions and $2.4 trillion in cuts. The problem is, the debt extension \nis over an 18-month period and the cuts are over a 10-year period. So \nwe can see there is a vast discrepancy in what is taking place. The \nsemantics may sound good, but the result, candidly, is not near what I \nbelieve the American people would like to see, nor what I believe \nfinancial markets would like to see. So if our goal is something we \nknow on the front end is not even acceptable to this body, it seems to \nme it is not rational for us to be sitting here waiting on this group \nat the Blair House to make a deal we all know is not good enough.\n  So I hope by the end of next week this group who is negotiating will \ncome forth and tell us what it is they are trying to achieve, the \nlikelihood of achieving it, and in what timeframe.\n  I am also hearing there are discussions that we do not believe we \nwill reach a deal by the August recess. There have been some public \ncomments about short-term extensions. I cannot imagine going home to \nthe people of Tennessee for recess on August 6 and telling them: We are \non August recess, and I am here to tell you we haven't done a thing--\nnot one thing--to reach a deal on how many cuts are going to take place \nin spending relative to our debt ceiling extension. But I am here in \nTennessee to tell you that we are on recess, and we have accomplished \nnothing.\n  I cannot imagine us doing that as a body.\n  The other thing I am hearing is we may be looking at a short-term \nextension to move beyond the August recess, to get us back into this \nfall. Maybe that is a way of dealing with this issue. But, again, if we \nadopt a short-term extension to try to give us time to reach a deal we \nall know is unacceptable on the front end, why would we give a short-\nterm extension? So it just seems to me the most responsible happening \nwould be for negotiators on both sides to tell this body--this body \nwhich has done nothing of importance this year--maybe a few minor \nthings, not much; We spent no time dealing with serious issues; no time \ndealing with a budget; no time trying to deal publicly with the issues \nof deficit reduction--to let us know where they are.\n  It seems to me a number of people in this body are getting very \nrestless. They see what is happening. We have seen this movie before \nwhere we bump up against a deadline and we have to make a decision up \nor down because ``it is going to create havoc in the marketplace.'' It \nseems to me, again, the responsible thing for the Blair House group to \ndo is to let us know where they are at the end of this next week so if \nMembers of this body wanted to figure out a different route to go \nbecause they thought the route that was being taken was not acceptable, \nnot good enough--as a matter of fact, I noticed yesterday where the \nchairman of the Budget Committee on the other side of the aisle has \nsaid the things he has heard are not good enough for him. I can tell my \ncolleagues they are not good enough for me. So the goal we are trying \nto achieve is not something I would even agree to.\n\n  So maybe if we cannot get some degree of clarity as to what is \nhappening at the Blair House and some degree of update, maybe there is \nsome other route we should take or maybe the market should know well in \nadvance that this body does not have the discipline, does not have the \nability, does not have the courage to deal with what we know is an \nupcoming calamity--a calamity that is either going to occur because we \ncannot reach agreement and we do not raise the debt ceiling or a \ncalamity that occurs a little bit down the road because we have not \nshown the fiscal discipline in this body to put our house in order, \nknowing that at some point in time the markets will run from us, \ninterest rates will rise, people will no longer be willing to loan us \nmoney because we have shown how irresponsible we are and we have a \ncalamity on that end.\n  So let me restate, I am 58 years old. I came to this body to solve \nproblems. If there is going to be a calamity, I want the calamity to \noccur while I am here so I can deal with it and take responsibility for \nit versus kicking the can down the road for somebody else to have to \ndeal with the fact that we as a body are irresponsible.\n  In closing, Madam President, thank you for the time. I implore the \nfolks who are meeting behind closed doors--implore them--to come \nforward and to outline the goals they are trying to achieve and when \nthey think they are going to achieve them so all of us who are sitting \naround here cooling our heels, doing nothing--doing almost nothing of \nimportance for this country--the Senator from Illinois talked about the \nEDA bill. We all knew it was not going to pass. Everybody knew that. \nEverybody knew that bill was offered on the floor to kill time, to make \nit look as though the Senate was doing something. That is all it was \nfor. Everybody knew that. Everybody working up front knew that. The \npages knew that. Everybody knew that. So for people to come down here \nand act as if it is a shock that cloture was not achieved on EDA when \nwe knew it was here just for a filler is kind of surprising. We knew \nwhat it was about.\n  So I would like for us to get on with dealing with the most important \nissue our country has to deal with; that is, the huge amount of deficit \nspending, where every day we are spending $4.1 billion we do not have. \nEvery day we are borrowing 40 cents of that from other folks. Every day \nwe are causing this country, because of that, to be in decline--\nhopefully, we will rectify that, but to be in decline, lowering the \nstandard of living of all Americans because we in this body do not show \nthe capability, the will, the desire to solve that problem.\n  I am hoping--I am hoping--the Blair House negotiations yield a \nresult. I really do. That is why I think all of us are being patient as \nthey meet in private, sharing no details about what they are doing. But \nat the end of this week, the end of this work period, I think it is \ntime they come forth to give us a status as to where they are so that \nif there are other routes that ought to be taken, people have the \nability to do that.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise today to discuss Social \nSecurity and its future.\n  This is certainly an issue that affects all Americans, and now is the \ntime we can address it in a way that will not be horribly obtrusive to \nthe people who will be on Social Security in 25 years, when it just \nhits the bottom and we have stark realities that are going to hurt \npeople. We can avoid that.\n  Last Thursday, I introduced, with Senator Jon Kyl as an original \ncosponsor, S. 1213, the Defend and Save Social Security Act, a bill \nthat will secure Social Security for the next 75 years without raising \ntaxes and without cutting core benefits to anyone.\n  Madam President, 28 years ago this past April, Congress and President \nReagan came together in a bipartisan manner and acted decisively to \naddress Social Security's finances to save the\n\n[[Page S3988]]\n\nprogram for retirees. The men and women of that Congress, working with \nPresident Reagan, did it because at that time the program's \nexpenditures had begun exceeding revenues in 1975. By mid-1982, the \nSocial Security trustees warned:\n\n       Social Security will be unable to make benefit payments on \n     time beginning in the latter half of 1982.\n\n  So the President and the Congress, in a bipartisan effort, started on \na glidepath of raising the retirement age to meet the current actuarial \ntables.\n  Today, we are in roughly the same place. This spring, the trustees \nestimated that the Social Security trust fund reserves will be depleted \nin 2036, which is 25 years away. We have a little more time than \nPresident Reagan and Congress had back in 1982. The trustees today \nestimate that at that point in time, payroll tax revenue to the Social \nSecurity trust fund will only be able to pay out 77 percent of benefits \nto beneficiaries. In today's dollars, that would mean a cut in benefits \nof 23 percent, or $271 a month average, in core benefit cuts if we do \nnot do anything.\n  Last year, just to give you the numbers, 157 million American workers \npaid Social Security payroll taxes, totaling about $637 billion in \nrevenues.\n  However, a total of $702 billion in benefits was paid to the \napproximately 54 million beneficiaries. These numbers are clear. The \namount of Social Security benefits being paid out now exceeds the \nrevenues that Social Security is collecting. The trustees, when they \ngave their report a month or so ago, said that to increase the assets \nyou could increase taxes right now. The payroll taxes on employees and \nemployers could go from 12.4 percent to 14.5 percent right now during \nthis jobless economic situation. I would not vote to raise taxes on our \nSocial Security payers now or our employers. It would be unthinkable.\n  The other thing suggested by the trustees that would meet this \nshortfall is that you can have a cut in benefits right now. An \nimmediate cut of $150 a month from core benefits would do it.\n  Well, what kind of option is that? It is no option. We are not going \nto do that. Everyone knows we are not going to do that. We are not \ngoing to raise payroll taxes and we are not going to cut core benefits \nnow. We have more time today than the ``race against the clock'' that \noccurred in 1983. We have the option for 25 years of doing something \nthat would have a gradual reform to shore up Social Security and give \nfuture retirees sufficient time to prepare for the modest changes in \nraising the retirement age.\n  If we wait, we have a 23-percent cut in core benefits. So it is \nimperative for Social Security's financial future that we join together \nagain in a bipartisan effort to stabilize Social Security and ensure \nthat full benefits are paid out for the next 75 years. We can do it if \nwe do not delay.\n  In 1935, when Social Security was established, there were 40 workers \nsupporting each retiree. Twenty years later, in 1955, the ratio was \nnine workers supporting one retiree. Today, there are three workers \nsupporting one retiree. In tandem with these rapidly changing and \ntroubling demographics is the fact that we also must start taking the \nnecessary steps to pay down--not add to--our national debt.\n  We know Vice President Biden, along with members of the House and \nSenate, is negotiating. As we speak, the staffs are working and the \nMembers have been meeting. They are negotiating to try to do some kind \nof spending cuts before the debt ceiling is reached. The $14 trillion \ndebt ceiling will be reached around the first of August of this year. \nSo now the Vice President and the group from the House and Senate are \nmeeting to try to cut spending, because we are not going to raise the \ndebt ceiling unless there is real reform. A number of us on both sides \nof the aisle have agreed, we have got to have spending reforms so we do \nnot have to raise the debt ceiling again beyond $14 trillion.\n  Now is the time we can address the issue of the debt and do it in a \nresponsible way, because if we just use discretionary spending for the \nreforms needed, we will never get there. We will never have enough cuts \nin discretionary spending. Why is that? It is because discretionary \nspending is less than 50 percent of the spending of our government. It \nis the mandatory spending that is the vast majority of the spending.\n  Discretionary spending is in the 40-percent range--60 percent is \nmandatory. So we cannot get to responsible budgetary cuts without \nlooking at the entitlements. Now, what kind of entitlements do we have \nto work with? Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. I think we can \ndo a lot to reform Medicare. But it is complicated, and it will take \ntime. It will take time to work out all of the pieces because so many \npeople are dependent on Medicare. It is the people who use Medicare, \nand it is the providers who provide it, and it is the insurance \ncompanies that augment and supplement it, so there are a lot of moving \nparts in Medicare which we need to address.\n  But what can we do between now and August 2 that would make a real \ndifference, that would put us on a more responsible path, and begin to \nmake the reforms that would allow a responsible lifting of the debt \nceiling, knowing that we are going to cut those deficits so we will not \nhave to do this again, hopefully ever.\n  That is where Social Security comes in. My Defend and Save Social \nSecurity Act, which Senator Jon Kyl and I are sponsoring, will do the \nfollowing: It will raise the age gradually. Under my bill, with Senator \nKyl, anyone who is currently 58 years old or older will not be affected \nat all by the gradual increase of the retirement age. For everyone \nelse, the normal retirement age and the early retirement age would \nincrease by 3 months each year starting in 2016. The normal retirement \nage would reach 67 by 2019. Keep in mind that we are already on the \nglide path to go to 67. That is what President Reagan and the previous \nCongress did, and that was done with the Greenspan commission's input \nlater. So with that trajectory, we will go to the 67 age. My bill takes \nus to 67 in 2019. We would already be going in that direction anyway. \nIt then goes, by 2023, to age 68, and by 2027 to 69. The early \nretirement age would gradually increase to 63 by 2019 and, by 2023, 64. \nSo you have 3 months per year added to the retirement age. It is a very \ngradual increase, to 69 or 64.\n  The second part is the COLA. We do not cut core benefits at all. But \nthe cost-of-living increase is meant to hedge against rising inflation. \nWhen inflation gets above 1 percent, then you need, in my opinion, to \nstart helping people with COLAs. Under my plan, we would have COLAs \nafter inflation is over 1 percent. The average COLA has been 2.2 \npercent. The rate of inflation has been about 2.2 percent over the last \n10 years. So the average COLA would, under my bill, start after 1 \npercent. If it is 2 percent, you would get a 1-percent COLA. I believe \nthat a 1-percent reduction in the COLA, not for benefits, would be \npreferable to the drastic cuts in core benefits that will evolve if we \ndo not do something now.\n  In today's dollars, a 1-percent cost increase that you would get in a \nCOLA is about $11. So you would not get $11 of increase, but you would \nget your core COLA. Then after 1 percent, you would get the regular \nCOLA that would be expected. So my bill will generate cashflow for \nSocial Security, maintain a positive balance for the trust fund over \nthe next 75 years.\n  Social Security's deficits would be eliminated under my bill. We had \nthe Social Security Administration look at our proposal and give us all \nof our numbers. According to the Chief Actuary, my proposal would \nachieve, in the next 10 years, $416 billion in deficit reduction.\n  What that means is, in perspective for what we are dealing with in \nthe budget talks for the debt ceiling lift, we are talking about a 10-\nyear window. Within that 10-year budget window, we could take out $416 \nbillion in deficit reduction, along with the spending cuts in \ndiscretionary spending that are part of any kind of reform. So we can \naddress a responsible cut in the mandatory spending over the 10-year \nperiod with these very gradual and small adjustments, and help in our \ndeficit reduction, which we have to do if we are going to achieve the \nreductions that must be done. Every year we wait, we are going to have \nto shave more off the COLAs or the age.\n  There are some proposals out there that take the age to 70, and maybe \nover the next 25 years that will be part of our actuarial table, \nbecause today the average lifespan is 77, so people are wanting to work \nlonger. They are\n\n[[Page S3989]]\n\nhealthier longer. A lot of people are trying to keep working longer. I \nthink more and more of the companies and employers want that \nexperience, want the experienced people to stay longer. So it is part \nof our actuarial adjustment that we should be making.\n  Over the next 25 years, we would be going into the long-term \nadjustments that are necessary. If we look, say, out until 2085, we \nwill take $7.2 trillion off the Social Security requirements. So now \nyou are talking about fiscal responsibility looking at both sides of \nour spending equation, mandatory as well as discretionary, which gives \nus a real chance to make a difference and to say this Congress, \nhopefully working with this President, because it has to be \nbipartisan--we cannot pass a bill the President will not sign.\n  The Democrats are in the majority in the Senate. Republicans are in \nthe majority in the House. So this is going to take some compromising. \nThe Republicans do not control the Senate, and the Democrats do not \ncontrol the House. And the Republicans do not control the White House. \nSo it is not as though we are able to say: My way or the highway. You \ncannot do it, and neither can the President. So we have got to come \ntogether if we are going to make the very tough choices that will get \nour fiscal house in order for future retirees to have the cushion that \nSocial Security would be--it is supposed to be a safety net--to talk \nanother day. But we need a better retirement option for our retirees as \nwell, so they can save more in IRAs. Because Social Security is not \nsupposed to be a pension plan. It is a safety net. It is a supplement. \nSo if we can solve this, the next thing we ought to be doing is adding \nmore options for people to save. We have done some of that with the \nbill I sponsored with Senator Barbara Mikulski, the Democrat from \nMaryland, with spousal IRAs.\n  We have increased the amount you can save and that a stay-at-home \nspouse can save, and we have made some major good moves in the right \ndirection. But that is different from what we are talking about today, \nwhich is Social Security.\n  I have written a letter to the Vice President. I have asked him to \nput Social Security on the agenda, because when we finish all of these \ndiscussions, they are going to come back with cuts in discretionary \nspending, but it cannot be enough when it is less than 40 percent of \nour spending. We have to look at entitlements if we are going to be \nresponsible.\n  Since I have filed my bill last week, and have had the opportunity \nwith the Heritage Foundation and the media to talk about my plan, we \nare getting some good support. Of course, we are getting the people who \nsay: No cuts, no way, no how. We expect that. But it is burying your \nhead in the sand if you say: No way, no how.\n  So we are getting some support. The founder of the Association of \nMature American Citizens, Dan Weber, who on their Web site says they \nnow have 160,000 members--the fastest growing organization for older \nAmericans in our country--has stated his support for my proposal. They \nsee changes have to be made. They have even gone a step further and \ntalked about private accounts, which I certainly support, but it is not \nin my plan.\n  I appreciate the Association of Mature American Citizens being \nwilling to do what is right for their constituents, their retirees, but \nalso for the long-term, to say we know that if we are going to have a \nresponsible approach, entitlements must be on the table. And Social \nSecurity is one that we can do, if it is bipartisan, together.\n  My plan will address the issue now, with no tax increases and no cuts \nin core benefits. It will have the gradual rise in the retirement age, \naffecting no one before the year 2016 and after that just 3 months a \nyear in added age to be eligible for Social Security. The cost-of-\nliving adjustment would be adjusted 1 percent down, and after 1 percent \ninflation, then you would have the cost-of-living adjustment as well \nbut no cuts in core benefits. The amendments of the past--in 1983--the \namendments that have put us back on track with actuarial tables in the \npast can be done again.\n  It is my great hope that we can step up to the plate, as those who \ncame before us did, and do the right thing for the long term and burst \nthe bubble that we can reform spending only addressing the \ndiscretionary side. It is a myth. Anyone who tells you with a straight \nface ``I am not going to look at the entitlements'' is not being a \nresponsible steward of our problem. That is what we were elected to do, \nand I hope we can put together a bipartisan coalition, working with the \nPresident, to do it.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the Association of Mature American Citizens article by Dan \nWeber.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 20, 2011]\n\n       While AARP Waffles AMAC Proposes Change in Social Security\n\n                          (By Daniel C. Weber)\n\n       According to the Wall Street Journal AARP has decided to \n     accept some changes in Social Security to assure that it will \n     continue to be financially stable. However as soon as the \n     story came out and was broadly circulated its C.E.O., A. \n     Barry Rand issued a statement saying AARP has not changed its \n     position on being against changes in Social Security.\n       But, Mr. Rand in his statement said their position is \n     ``that any changes would be phased in slowly, over time and \n     would not affect any current or near term beneficiaries''.\n       In response, Dan Weber, president of AMAC, the Association \n     of Mature American Citizens, said ``that sure sounds like he \n     is in favor of making changes to me''.\n       AMAC, which bills itself as the conservative alternative to \n     AARP is the fastest growing organization for older Americans \n     according to Weber.\n       ``We have over 160,000 paid members and are growing \n     stronger each day.'' Weber said, ``And while AARP is waffling \n     AMAC has proposed serious changes in Social Security that \n     will stabilize Social Security and allow people to have more \n     money when they are retired than the present system.''\n       Weber explained the AMAC proposal was to incorporate the \n     change recommended by Texas Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and \n     others, to raise the age when a recipient would receive their \n     full benefit from age 66 to age 69. The new age would start \n     to be implemented in 2013 and won't be fully phased in until \n     2018.\n       The key difference between their suggested changes and ours \n     is that we would also incorporate the mandatory offering of a \n     new ``Social Security IRA'' to anyone who would be affected \n     by the change in age. The SS IRA would be tax deductible, \n     payroll deducted and put into an individual IRA owned by the \n     wage earner. The funds invested would not be accessible until \n     either age 62 or Security 65. It could be started with as \n     little as $5 per week and be put into a plan offered by the \n     same companies that presently offer IRAs and 401ks.\n       Fifty percent or more of the funds would have to be \n     invested in guaranteed interest accounts so the person would \n     be guaranteed to have gains in at least half of their funds.\n       Weber said ``It is unfair to force Americans to continue to \n     work until age 69, especially those who work in occupations \n     that require physical labor. People who are farmers, \n     construction workers, laborers, skilled tradesmen such as \n     carpenters, plumbers, electricians, masons and other workers \n     have punished their bodies after years of labor suffer from \n     various ailments that white collar workers generally avoid.\n       They should be able to stop working at a lower age and the \n     SS IRA would allow anyone to do that.\n       At the same time, extending the full age to 69 would make \n     Social Security stable for many years in the future. Weber \n     ended by saying ``It is time for the political leaders of \n     both parties to have courage, and stand up to solve this \n     problem by adopting the AMAC plan.''\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, the city of Minot, ND, in my home state, \nis facing a dire emergency. Minot and other communities on the Souris \nRiver in my home State are facing a flood of epic proportion. We have a \nwall of water heading toward the city. I am told the sirens have just \nsounded in that town alerting people to evacuate.\n  This is the headline this morning from that town's major newspaper. \nThe headline reads: ``Projection: Devastation. Minot residents evacuate \nas historic rise in the Souris River approaches.''\n  This flood is a result of overly wet conditions for an extended \nperiod of time, a record snowmelt, combined with record rainfall in the \nbasin above the city. We are now told that perhaps a third of the city \nwill be underwater, and unprecedented rains have filled upstream \nreservoirs to capacity, leading to a dramatic change in the forecast in \n48 hours.\n  On Saturday, we were told we could expect the river level to reach \nelevation 1,555 feet in the city. On Monday, we were told 1,566 feet--\nan 11-foot increase in 48 hours. The result is the defenses that have \nbeen built up over an extended period of time, that gave us about 3 \nfeet of freeboard, are absolutely incapable of dealing with a flood of \nthis magnitude and a rise happening this rapidly.\n  This is the headline from yesterday in the Minot Daily News, which \nkind of summed it all up: `` `It's a sad day.' Crest could be 10 feet \nhigher than June 1.''\n  It is staggering to understand what is happening here. There are four \nreservoirs above the city of Minot, all of them filled to capacity. In \nfact, we have been told the floodgates of the major reservoir in Canada \nare wide open. They cannot control the flow of water. Whatever comes in \nis going out because they have lost the ability to meter out the water \nmore slowly.\n  This is what we are seeing happen all over Minot as crews rush in to \ntry and provide secondary defenses, to protect as much of the city's \ncritical infrastructure as possible--schools, water treatment \nfacilities, other critical infrastructure--that is going to be \nnecessary to be able to continue to fight this flood menace.\n  This was the headline in the Bismarck Tribune: ``Crisis to the North. \nSouris Floods Force 11,000 Residents From Minot.'' It is a town of \n40,000. So when you have 11,000 people forced to flee, that has a \ndevastating impact.\n  This is the headline, again, from the Minot Daily News of June 20, on \nMonday: ``Water Woes Continue. People in danger zones advised to be \nprepared to evacuate.'' And as I have said, that evacuation is \noccurring as I speak.\n  The Fargo Forum, which is the biggest newspaper in our State, had \nthis headline: ``11,000 Forced Out. Rising Souris moves up evacuation \ntime. Residents in heart of city work fast to save what they can.''\n  My own cousin and her family have a home that is in danger. They have \nmoved everything from the basement to the first floor. Now they say \nthey will have 7 feet of water on the first floor of their house. This \nis happening to people throughout the Minot community.\n  These pictures that ran in the newspapers tell the story in a \npowerful and clear way. What we have is somebody trying to go into a \nneighborhood. You can see there is a police vehicle, because they are \nunder mandatory evacuation. This person tried to get over to perhaps \nrescue a pet or take care of some last-minute business; maybe turn off \nthe gas. And there he is, stuck in the water, as these floodwaters \nrise, and rise very rapidly.\n  This picture also gives a perspective on what we are confronting. \nHere is the dike, levee, that has just been raised, and you can see \nthere is maybe 2 or 3 feet of freeboard there. But what is coming is 10 \nmore feet of water, so there is absolutely no way these dikes can \npossibly hold. There is no way they can protect the city. These dikes \nare going to overtop, and thousands of residents will be displaced.\n  This picture shows another shot. In this place, they didn't have the \ndikes covered by plastic. You can see a couple of feet of freeboard \nthere. All these houses are at risk as this wall of water comes our \nway.\n  This is another shot showing a house, and you can see they have the \nmain dike and they have also built a secondary dike to protect their \nhome. All these efforts will prove to be for naught because of this \nunprecedented wall of water. In fact, this is five feet higher than in \nall of recorded history. That is what is happening to this community of \nMinot, ND--home to 40,000 people, home to one of the major Air Force \nbases of the United States, home of the Minuteman missiles, and home of \nthe B-52 bombers. Minot, ND, the fourth largest city in my State, is \nabout to experience the greatest devastation in the history of the \ntown--a flood worse than the 1969 flood by many feet, and that flood \nwas a modern-day record to that point, the 1969 flood.\n  This chart shows the evacuation zones. This gives you some sense of \nhow major the relocation of people is out of this city. These are the \nevacuation zones 1 through 8 that go right on the edge of the river, \nand you can see all of these people under mandatory evacuation.\n  They are going to have to leave, and they are going to have to leave \nvery quickly.\n  Madam President, I would like to end as I began, by showing the \nheadline this morning in the Minot Daily News. ``Projection: \nDevastation.''\n  There is no way around it. There is absolutely no way to respond when \nthe flood forecast changes this rapidly and the water is coming this \nquickly. The result is these people are going to face high water not \nfor just a day or two. Typically in a flood, the water comes and the \nwater goes. In this circumstance, the water is coming and it is not \nleaving anytime soon. They have told us as recently as yesterday that \nwe could expect high water until the middle of July. Can you imagine, \nto have your house under water from late June to the middle of July, \nthe devastation that will result.\n  So this headline, ``Projection: Devastation,'' says it very well. \nThat is what we are faced with in this community.\n  The bottom line is, we are going to need help. And we are certainly \ngetting it. We deeply appreciate the efforts of the Corps of Engineers, \nFEMA, and all of the other Federal agencies that are helping. The \nNational Guard, certainly hundreds of troops there are doing a \nfantastic job of patrolling these dikes, of helping people move, of \nmaking certain that people get out of harm's way because job number 1 \nis protecting people's lives. We also have an obligation to do \neverything we can to protect as much of the property as is humanly \npossible. We very much appreciate the assistance the Red Cross is \ngiving.\n  I just met with General Kowalski of the U.S. Air Force, a three-star \ngeneral who has as part of his command the Minot Air Force Base. I \ncalled the Secretary of the Air Force yesterday and the Chief of Staff \nof the Air Force the day before and asked them to be alert to the need \nfor that base to help us because there is so much they can provide in \nassistance, being out of harm's way. The base is 12 miles north of the \ntown.\n  General Kowalski came to me this morning to deliver the message that \nthe U.S. Air Force is prepared to help in every way possible. We deeply \nappreciate that commitment and that support. We remember very well in \n1997, when we had record floods in Grand Forks, ND--that is home to one \nof the other major Air Force bases of the United States--the \nextraordinary support and help they provided to us at that time.\n  The final board I will show is the headline from the Minot Daily News \nof June 21: ``It's a sad day.'' It is indeed a sad day. But the people \nof North Dakota are tough, they are resilient, and they are going to \ncome back. I have every confidence that we will rebuild this town. It \nwill be a tough slog, but the people of North Dakota are equal to it, \nand we deeply appreciate the help we are getting from people all across \nAmerica.\n  I have seen America at its best in a time of crisis. When people are \ndown,\n\n[[Page S3991]]\n\nwhen they are hurt, when they are devastated by natural disaster, the \npeople of the United States rally and help out.\n  That is the ethic of my State. When a farmer gets sick and can't \nharvest his crop, the neighbors pitch in. When a barn burns down, the \nneighbors pitch in. That is the best of community spirit. That is the \nbest of America. We are going to be relying on that generosity of \nspirit in the days ahead.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, we are going to hear tonight from \nPresident Obama about his plans for changes to troop levels in \nAfghanistan.\n  Last week I joined with a bipartisan group of my Senate colleagues on \na letter to the President urging him to begin a sizeable and sustained \nreduction in troop levels, and I hope he takes the opportunity to do \nthat tonight. But with all the talk about troop levels, I want to make \nsure we remember this isn't just about numbers. It is about real people \nwith real families, men and women who are fighting to defend our \ncountry and are depending on us to do the right thing for them now and \nwhen they come home.\n  As chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have an \ninside look into something that too often doesn't make the front pages: \nthe unseen costs of war, the costs that come after our men and women \ntake off that uniform.\n  We all hear about how expensive war is while we are fighting it. But \nfor so many of our servicemembers what happens on the battlefield is \njust the beginning.\n  We are seeing suicide rates that are much higher among Active-Duty \nservicemembers and veterans than among civilians. We are finding they \nare having trouble accessing the mental health care so many of them \ndesperately need. We are watching as these men and women are sent out \non tour after tour. Too often they are having a tough time finding a \njob when they come home. We owe it to them and their families to do \neverything we can to get them the support and services they need.\n  Far too many of our servicemembers have sacrificed life and limb \noverseas, and we must honor them and their sacrifices by making sure we \ntake care of them and their caregivers not just today, not just when \nthey come home, but for a lifetime. This is going to be expensive, and \nI am going to fight to make sure it happens. I think it ought to be \nconsidered as we think now about the war in Afghanistan.\n  The enemy we face is real. The Taliban and al-Qaida have demonstrated \nthrough their actions and their words they mean us great harm. I was \nsitting in the Capitol on September 11, 2001, when I saw the smoke \nrising from the Pentagon. It is a moment and a day I will never forget.\n  As Americans, we know what this enemy is capable of, and we need to \ndo everything we can to make sure something like that never, ever \nhappens again. That is why I believe American forces need to be \nprepared to fight terror and terrorists wherever they may be.\n  After September 11, Afghanistan was providing safe haven for them, \nand we are absolutely right to go in and take them out. But we know \nterrorism isn't a country; it is a network and a threat that exists \naround the world. We have seen that our terrorist enemies are not tied \nto a specific location. They are not bound by lines on a map. They are \nin Afghanistan, but they are also in Yemen, in Iraq, in Pakistan, and \nelsewhere. In fact, our top target in the war against terrorism, Osama \nbin Laden, was just killed in a brave operation in a safe house in \nPakistan.\n  It is absolutely critical we have a military that is prepared to take \non our threats wherever they may be. So as we consider the wars we are \nfighting now in Afghanistan and in Iraq, we need to make sure we aren't \noverextending the servicemembers we are counting on; that we continue \nto have the financial resources available to defend ourselves against \nthe very real threat of terrorism that continues to exist; and that the \ncosts and resources of boots on the ground for years on end doesn't \ninhibit our ability to go after terrorists wherever they are. We need \nto know our military and intelligence operations are nimble and have \nthe resources they need to keep our Nation safe from all threats.\n  We have been fighting in Afghanistan for 10 years. I voted for that \nwar. It was the right thing to do. Our brave men and women in uniform \nhave done everything we have asked of them, including finding Osama bin \nLaden. But we need to make sure today that our strategies are adapted \nto meet the threats of today. Leaving large levels of troops in \nAfghanistan is not the best use of our resources, especially in these \ntough economic times. It is time to redeploy, rebuild our military, and \nfocus on the broader war on terror.\n  I am hopeful President Obama will make an announcement tonight that \nreflects those current realities, and I am going to keep working with \nthis administration, the Pentagon, the Department of Veterans Affairs, \nand all others so that as we fight to keep America safe and to take \ncare of our servicemembers coming home, we do it right.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \nsubstitute amendment be agreed to and considered original text for the \npurpose of further amendment; that there be a period of debate only on \nthe bill until 3 p.m. today; that following the debate-only time, it be \nin order for any Senator to call up any relevant filed amendment, \nincluding a managers' amendment to be offered by Senators Alexander and \nSchumer; that no amendment offered to the bill be divisible; further, \nthat in addition to relevant amendments offered to the bill, the \namendments listed here also be in order: Vitter, relating to czars; \nDeMint, which relates to IMF bailouts; and Coburn, which relates to \nduplications; further, that the DeMint and Vitter amendments be subject \nto a 60-vote threshold and the Coburn amendment be subject to a two-\nthirds vote threshold; that upon the disposition of the amendments, the \nbill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of \nthe bill, as amended, if amended; that the vote on passage be subject \nto a 60-vote threshold; and that if the bill does not achieve that \nthreshold, the bill be returned to the calendar; that upon disposition \nof this matter, the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of \nCalendar No. 45, S. Res. 116, a resolution providing for expedited \nconsideration of certain\n\n[[Page S3996]]\n\nnominations; that only relevant amendments be in order; and that upon \ndisposition of the amendments to the resolution, the Senate proceed to \nvote on the adoption of the resolution, as amended, if amended.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, this means Senators will not need to \nobtain unanimous consent prior to setting aside the pending amendments \nfor amendments to be called up.\n  I would also say--I wanted to hold up saying anything about this \nuntil we got this agreement--the work done on this bill by Senators \nSchumer and Alexander has been work that has been ongoing for years and \ntook their partnership, working together as the two men who run the \nRules Committee, to move this forward. It has been very hard to get \nfrom here to there. I have every bit of confidence that we are going to \nmove forward and do, for the first time in decades, a streamlining of \nhow Presidential nominations are approved. This is good. This is what \nwe talked about doing at the beginning of this year, and we need to \ncontinue doing that.\n  I also express my appreciation to the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Homeland Security Committee, Senators Lieberman and Collins, for \ndoing additional hard work in sorting through what the committees \nshould do in approving nominations. They have done a good job because \nvirtually every committee chair says: Are you sure you want to do all \nthese? If we were back where we had been in years past, we would wind \nup getting nothing done because the chairs simply thought they needed \nto have a hand in everything that went on with all these nominations. \nSenators Lieberman and Collins did a good job getting us to this point.\n  When this is done, we will move to some rules changes that Senators \nSchumer and Alexander have approved.\n  I see my friend, the Senator from Tennessee, on the floor. Again, as \nhe does on virtually everything--he is a very thoughtful person--he is \nalways trying to work for the betterment of this body. I am grateful he \nand Senator Schumer have been able to do the good work they have on \nthis legislation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the majority leader and the \nRepublican leader, Senator McConnell, for the way they worked on this \nlegislation. Not just on this bill, but when they were the respective \nwhips of their parties several years ago, each of them working on \ntrying to help improve the Senate's ability to do its oversight by \ndoing a better job with our advice-and-consent responsibility. That is \none of our better known responsibilities. It is a constitutional \nresponsibility. It is in Article II, Section 2. But as a part of that \nadvice-and-consent responsibility, the Senate has the opportunity to \ndefine which other positions the President may appoint. That is what \nthis is about.\n  Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman have also worked for many \nyears, and they will be here in a few minutes to open the debate. \nSenator Schumer and I will come to the floor about at 2:40 and make our \nstatements on behalf of the Rules Committee.\n  I thank the majority leader and Republican leader for doing this \nbecause this is not the most glamorous piece of legislation. What I am \nabout to say is not so glamorous either. But this bill has come to the \nfloor by unanimous consent. That means there were 100 Members of this \nbody who could have objected, and none have.\n  I thank the Senators--many of whom have very different views on this \nbill--for agreeing to this agreement by which we are proceeding. We are \nnot proceeding under a cloture vote; we are proceeding the way the \nSenate really ought to work day-in and day-out. Members have the \nopportunity to offer relevant amendments. I am sure many will. I thank \nthe Republican leader and the majority leader for their forbearance in \nthat way. We have to have an element of trust for each other.\n  I am going to do my best to make sure the relevant amendments that \ncome before us, Democratic or Republican, are voted on.\n  I thank all those involved. I hope Senators will be preparing their \nrelevant amendments if they are not already filed and were not already \nenumerated in the agreement.\n  I will refrain from making my remarks until my colleague, Senator \nSchumer, the chairman of the Rules Committee, comes to the floor at \n2:40. We will await the arrival of Senator Collins and Senator \nLieberman, who are the chairman and ranking member of the committee \nthat reported the bill to the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, it is my honor now to rise as chairman \nof the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to speak on \nbehalf of S. 679, the Presidential Appointment Efficiency and \nStreamlining Act of 2011, and I do so with great gratitude toward \nSenator Alexander, who is now on the Senate floor, Senator Schumer, and \nothers who worked together to clear away procedural obstacles to focus \non this piece of legislation.\n  This is a noble effort that has been tried before and failed, but I \nam confident this time, with the support of our leaders--really our \nbipartisan leadership, Senator Reid, Senator McConnell, Senator \nAlexander, Senator Schumer, not to mention Senator Collins and me--we \nare going to, in our committee role, get this passed. This is a \nbipartisan effort to solve a problem, or at least help solve part of a \nproblem, that has been growing for a long time in Washington in our \ngovernment--certainly since the Kennedy administration--which is, it \ntakes too long for an incoming President and a sitting President to get \ntheir team in place, and there are too many vacancies throughout the \ncourse of an administration, as I will indicate during my remarks.\n  The average is 25 percent, one-quarter of the positions in the \nadministration, are empty at any one time because of the length of the \nprocess, the delays that occur in the executive branch, the White \nHouse, and in the Senate, and this is a direct attempt to try to lessen \nthat problem. One of my favorite descriptions of our current nomination \nand confirmation process--I have used this so often I forgot who said \nit; the gentleman in the chair might have said it--described the \ncurrent confirmation and nomination process as ``nasty and brutish \nwithout being short.'' So, hopefully, this will make the process at \nleast less nasty and brutish and shorter as well.\n  Mr. President, 100 days into President Obama's administration only 14 \npercent of the full-time Senate-confirmed positions had been filled--\nonly 14 percent. After 18 months, 25 percent of key policymaking \npositions were still vacant. This is not an unusual circumstance. \nPresidents Clinton and George W. Bush faced similar difficulties. It is \na problem that does have, however, a serious national and economic \nsecurity implication because crucial offices go unfilled for months and \nmonths.\n  President Bush actually did not have his national security team, \nincluding critical subcabinet officials, confirmed and on the job until \nat least 6 months after he took office. The 9/11 Commission pointed out \nhow dangerous this was and recommended steps to speed up the process \nfor national security appointments, some of which were adopted as part \nof the 9/11 Commission Act of 2004.\n  At the height of the financial crisis, which we are still working our \nway out of, Secretary of the Treasury Geithner was actually home alone, \nwith no other Senate-confirmed positions at the Treasury Department \nfilled for over 3 months. That is an outrageous result.\n  So what would the bill before the Senate now do? It would eliminate \nthe need for Senate confirmation for about 200 positions out of about \n1,200 that now need Senate confirmation. Of these 200 positions, most \nof them are in the areas of legislative and public affairs, internal \nmanagement positions,\n\n[[Page S3997]]\n\nsuch as, chief financial officers who report to others up the chain of \ncommand, directors, commissioners, or administrators at or below the \nAssistant Secretary level who, again, will report to another Senate-\nconfirmed official, and the members of a number of part-time advisory \nboards which, under the current state of the law, have to go through \nfull vetting and then full Senate consideration and confirmation.\n  The proposal before us is not by any means a radical proposal. \nRemoving these positions from the need for Senate confirmation would \nfree up both the Senate and future administrations to concentrate more \nfully on the nominations for those key positions where public policy is \nmade. I want to note, again, the bipartisan nature of these proposals.\n  In January, Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell \ndecided the nomination and confirmation process had become too slow and \ncumbersome. That was in January of this year. They established a \nworking group on executive nominations and asked leaders Schumer and \nAlexander to be in charge of that. Chairman and ranking member, \nrespectively, of the Rules Committee, Senator Collins and I were also \nprivileged to be part of that group as chair and ranking member of the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  The reforms proposed by Senators Schumer and Alexander in our group \nhave really been carefully crafted, and I cannot thank them enough for \nboth their legislative intellectual work on this but also for sticking \nwith it right to this moment. They introduced their legislation on \nMarch 30; that is, Schumer and Alexander, with a bipartisan group of 15 \ncosponsors. On April 13, our Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, again, on a bipartisan vote, reported the bill favorably to \nthe Senate.\n  Senators Schumer and Alexander are also proposing an important Senate \nResolution, S. Res. 116, that would streamline the confirmation process \nfor approximately 200 other Presidential appointments that receive \nSenate confirmation by allowing their nominations to bypass the \ncommittee process and come directly to the Senate floor as long as no \nSenator objects. This is an important companion proposal.\n  So if all goes well, we will have 400 of the current 1,200 \npositions--that is about one-third of the current nominations requiring \nfull Senate consideration, Senate proposal, committee consideration, et \ncetera--to be in a different status. These 200 positions that will be \nthe subject of S. Res. 116 come from 30 bipartisan Federal advisory \ngroups and councils, such as the Social Security Advisory Board and the \nIRS Advisory Board.\n  This is the way the Senate should work. A problem is identified, both \nsides of the aisle work together to craft a solution, then bring it to \nthe floor for debate. Hopefully, it is a model for what we can and \nshould do in a lot of other areas that are pressing not just on the \nSenate but on the country and the people of the country.\n  On March 2, Senator Collins and I--just speaking a bit more in \ndetail--held a hearing which we called ``Eliminating the Bottlenecks: \nStreamlining the Nominations Process.'' We heard from a group of former \nexecutives, really White House officials, both parties, and from some \nexperts in the private sector. They made a compelling case for change, \nand here is some of what we learned.\n  When President Kennedy entered office in 1961, there were 850 Senate-\nconfirmed positions that the President had to fill. By the time \nPresident George W. Bush took office, that had increased to 1,143. When \nPresident Obama was sworn in just 8 years later, that was already up to \n1,215. Not surprisingly, with more positions it takes longer to fill \nthem. The delay is not, fortunately, at the Cabinet level. Between 1987 \nand 2005, it took Presidents an average of only 17 days from the time \nof a vacancy to nominate a Cabinet Secretary, and the Senate took an \naverage of just 16 days to confirm the nominee. But it is at the \ncritical subcabinet level where things slow to a crawl.\n  It took Presidents an average of 95 days--that is, of course, more \nthan 3 months--to nominate Deputy Cabinet Secretaries, and the Senate \ntook 62 days to confirm them, another 2 months. Now we are up to more \nthan 5 months for Deputy Cabinet Members which are critical to the \nfunctioning of their departments. Noncabinet agency heads waited an \naverage of 173 days for nomination and 63 additional days for \nconfirmation. So we are up to over 230 days, over 7 months, approaching \n8 months. Noncabinet agency deputy heads fared even worse, an average \nof 301 days before nomination and 82 days before confirmation. That is \nmore than a year to go through this process while those offices are \neffectively unfilled, and the people's business is not being done.\n  Part of the problem is a large number of appointments that need to be \nmade at the outset of an administration can overwhelm the resources \navailable within the executive branch and the Senate to review and vet \nthese nominees. So eliminating the requirement for Senate confirmation \nfor nonpolicymaking or lower level positions should allow an incoming \nadministration and the Senate, as well as the FBI and the Office of \nGovernment Ethics, which do the vetting, to focus on more important \npolicymaking positions, speeding up the process.\n  Other problems contributing to the delay are the numerous duplicative \nand time-consuming forms that potential nominees are required to fill \nout. Most nominees actually submit to at least four reviews, each \nrepresented by a separate packet of government forms, including a White \nHouse personnel data statement, questionnaires from the FBI, Office of \nGovernment Ethics, and at least one questionnaire from the Senate \ncommittee of jurisdiction.\n  There is a very interesting study done by Professor Terry Sullivan at \nthe University of North Carolina that found half the questions asked in \nthose four reviews for each nominee are redundant. They are repetitive. \nThis act would establish, therefore, an executive branch working group \nto study and report to the President and the Congress the best ways to \nstreamline all this paperwork, along with a detailed plan for creating \nand implementing a smart reform. An example would be an electronic \nsystem for collecting and distributing background information for \nnominees requiring Senate confirmation. With a ``smart form'' such as \nthis, a nominee could answer a question once and the information would \nbe filled in for all of the relevant forms.\n\n  The need for reforms in the Federal appointments process is not a new \ntopic. Over the past three decades, an abundance of commissions, think \ntanks, good government groups, and individual academics have turned \ntheir sights on this problem.\n  I will not list them all, but here are just a few: the National \nAcademy of Public Administration in 1983 and 1985; the President's \nCommission on the Federal Appointments Process in 1990; the Twentieth \nCentury Fund in 1996; the Brookings Institution's Presidential \nAppointee Initiative, cochaired by former Senator Nancy Kassebaum and \nformer Director of the Office of Management and Budget Franklin Raines \nin 2001; and the bipartisan National Commission on the Public Service, \nheaded by Paul Volcker, in 1989 and 2003.\n  The Senate has looked into making changes as well. In 2001, our \ncommittee--then called the Governmental Affairs Committee and chaired \nby former Senator Fred Thompson--held a 2-day hearing titled ``The \nState of the Presidential Appointment Process,'' which looked at many \nof the ideas we are considering today.\n  The committee also reported out a bill--``The Presidential \nAppointments Improvement Act of 2002''--that sought to make modest \nimprovements to the appointments process, including streamlining \nfinancial disclosure requirements. But the full Senate never considered \nit.\n  Then, as I mentioned, Congress passed the 2004 Intelligence Reform \nand Terrorism Prevention Act, which included some improvements to help \nspeed up the consideration of critical members of a new President's \nnational security team.\n  Now it is time to take a modest next step. We have reasonable, \nbipartisan legislation in front of us and it is time--in fact, past \ntime--to act.\n  Now let me address the question that seems to be of concern to some \nof our colleagues, which is: Is the Senate, in limiting by 200, and in \nsome sense limiting another 200, giving away its\n\n[[Page S3998]]\n\npower to advise and consent? I say the answer is a resounding no, and I \nwish to explain why. Let me read directly from article 2 of the \nConstitution:\n\n       [The President] shall nominate, and by and with the Advice \n     and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other \n     public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, \n     and all other Officers of the United States, whose \n     appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which \n     shall be established by Law.\n\n  This part of the quote is crucial:\n\n       But the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such \n     inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President \n     alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.\n\n  The very first Congress, in which, of course, many of the Framers of \nour Constitution sat, did precisely what they authorized in the \nConstitution when they created the State Department, which was then \ncalled the Department of Foreign Affairs. The Secretary--a man by the \nname of Thomas Jefferson--was subject to Senate confirmation, but the \nlegislation creating the Department also called for the hiring of a \n``chief clerk'' who would be second in command--essentially the deputy. \nThat position was not subject to confirmation and Jefferson hired a man \nnamed Henry Remsen, who had held the same job under the previous \nArticles of Confederation.\n  So right from the beginning--from the Founding Fathers, the drafters \nof the Constitution--it was clear they understood there had to be \nlimits on the number of offices the Senate would be called on to advise \nand consent to.\n  Incidentally, I think it is also worth noting that in that first \nCongress, on a single day in 1789, the Senate took up 102 nominations \nsent to it by President Washington 2 days earlier and approved them all \nbut one. Needless to say, President Washington complained about the one \nnominee whom the Senate did not confirm. But Washington, obviously \nacknowledged as the Father of our Country, was unique, and no \nPresident--appropriately, I would say--has received exactly that kind \nof deference since. The nominations process can be a rough and tumble \none, and that is to be expected under our separation of powers.\n  This legislation, however, I wish to emphasize, does nothing to \nchange that. In fact, I would argue this legislation enhances the \nSenate's authority regarding advice and consent by enabling us to focus \nour energies on the qualifications of those who would shape national \npolicy. If we don't fix this system, which almost everybody regards as \nbroken, I think we risk what has already begun to happen, which is that \nsome of our Nation's most talented people will simply not accept \nnominations for these important positions because of the time involved, \nthe redundancy involved, and they will go unfilled.\n  There has been a lot of work done to support this effort, some of \nwhich was done by some of our former colleagues, including Senator Bill \nFrist and Chuck Robb and former White House officials Clay Johnson from \nthe Bush administration and Mack McLarty from the Clinton \nadministration. For the past year, the four of them have headed up a \nbipartisan commission to reform the Federal appointments process and \nthey have all endorsed this bill as well as S. Res. 116, and so too has \nthe Partnership for Public Service.\n  I know there is a natural tendency--notwithstanding all the reasons \neverybody understands to limit the number of nominees that come before \nthe Senate for advice and consent--when we come to that moment where \nindividual chairs of committees and ranking members don't want to yield \nwhat seems to be any authority. But, honestly, this is not an authority \nworth fighting to retain, and it works against the general functioning \nof the Senate, against the functioning of our government and, in my \nopinion, actually undercuts the vitality of the advice and consent \nclause.\n  I call on my fellow chairmen, ranking members, and of course all of \nour colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote yes on this \nlegislation so future Presidents can recruit the best nominees to serve \nus and the Senate can make sure it does its full job under the advice \nand consent clause to investigate and confirm them before they take \noffice and deal with the Nation's business.\n  As always, I have been privileged on the committee to be working with \nSenator Collins as my ranking member, and I yield to her at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am delighted to join with the chairman \nof the Homeland Security Committee, my dear friend Senator Lieberman, \nin rising today in support of the Presidential Appointment Efficiency \nand Streamlining Act of 2011.\n  First, let me join Senator Lieberman in commending Senators Schumer \nand Alexander for their leadership on this bill. Senator Alexander, in \nparticular, has worked so hard on this issue. In fact, I am convinced \nwe would not be where we are today without his persistent leadership. \nHe deserves great credit for his patience and his dogged determination \nto bring this bill and this issue to the floor. Senators Reid and \nMcConnell also deserve great credit. They made the commitment in \nJanuary to make reform of the nominations process a priority.\n  Finally, I wish to recognize Senator Lieberman, the chairman of the \ncommittee, on which I have the privilege of being the ranking member. \nHe and I have also been part of what has truly been a bipartisan effort \nto craft this bill. It is an effort we need to see more often in this \nSenate if we are to tackle and actually solve the many problems facing \nour Nation.\n  This bill before us addresses shortcomings in the process of \nconfirming Presidential appointees without diminishing the \nconstitutional roles of the President or of the Senate. The fact is \nthis is a very modest bill that takes limited but much needed steps to \nreform the confirmation process. When we look at the full-time \npositions that now require Senate confirmation, this bill would \neliminate only approximately 85 full-time positions, a truly modest \nnumber. These positions were selected because either they do not have \nsignificant policymaking authority or funding responsibilities or \nreport directly to a Senate-confirmed official.\n  To be clear, not included in these numbers are almost 3,000 officer \ncorps positions that would no longer require Senate confirmation under \nthis bill. But let me quickly explain exactly what those officer \npositions are, because when many people hear the words ``officer \npositions,'' they are going to think the Department of Defense and that \nwould raise the issue of civilian control of the military. Let me say \nthese are not military or Department of Defense positions. Rather, they \nare members of the Public Health Service and the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration Corps of the Department of Commerce.\n  Apart from these officer corps positions, more than 83 percent of all \ncurrently confirmed positions and more than 90 percent of all the full-\ntime positions will continue to require Senate approval under this \nbill. Let me emphasize that again because, unfortunately, there is some \nmisinformation about this bill. More than 90 percent of the full-time \npositions in the Federal Government that have required Senate \nconfirmation will continue to require Senate approval under our bill. \nFurthermore, nothing in this bill limits the ability of Congress to \ncreate new Senate-confirmed positions in the future. It may be that \nthere is a new department created someday or a new position that is \nvery important. The Senate can choose to exercise its will to make \nthose new positions subject to Senate confirmation.\n  The companion standing order reported by the Rules Committee proposes \nthat some additional 240 positions go through a new expedited \nconfirmation process. Although that resolution is not now before us, it \nwill be, I hope, shortly after we conclude our work on this bill. So I \nwish to explain briefly what the process would be under that \nresolution.\n  That expedited process would still require nominees to respond to all \ncommittee questionnaires and would still\n\n[[Page S3999]]\n\nprovide the opportunity for closer scrutiny of a nominee if requested \nby a single Senator--any Senator. The confirmation process must be \nthorough enough for the Senate to exercise its constitutional duty, but \nit should not be so onerous as to deter qualified people from public \nservice, particularly when they are being asked to serve as a part-time \nmember of an advisory board.\n  A letter from three of our former colleagues, one House Member and \ntwo Senators, put it well. The bipartisan Policy Center in endorsing \nthis bill sent us a letter that is signed by former Congressmen and \nSecretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman, Senator Pete Domenici, and \nSenator Trent Lott, who of course served as the majority leader of the \nSenate. Here is what they said, and here is what we heard over and over \nat the hearing Senator Lieberman and I conducted before our committee. \nThis is the bipartisan Policy Center's conclusion:\n\n       Many public spirited people are discouraged from serving in \n     appointed office because of the length and the extreme \n     adversarial nature of the confirmation process.\n\n  This is an issue the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs has been working to address for a long time. In fact, in 2001, \nwhen Senator Fred Thompson chaired the committee, we held two hearings \nfocusing on the state of the Presidential appointment process. As a \nresult of those hearings, the committee reported favorably reform \nlegislation. A few of the provisions of that bill were later \nincorporated into the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act \nof 2004, which I, along with Senator Lieberman, authored.\n\n  Let me give our colleagues some more background, some of which has \nbeen covered by the chairman of the committee but I think is important \nto repeat to counter some misimpressions about this bill that somehow \nit undermines our constitutional obligations. In fact, the \nConstitution, in the appointments clause, makes the appointment of \nsenior Federal executive officers a joint responsibility of the \nPresident and the Senate. The President determines who in his judgment \nis best qualified to serve in the most senior and critical positions \nacross the executive branch of our government. Then we, the Senate, \nexercise our independent judgment to determine if these nominees have \nthe necessary qualifications and character to serve our Nation in these \nimportant positions of public trust. But at the same time, the \nConstitution envisions the appointment of lesser officers by the \nPresident alone. Specifically, the Constitution provides that \n``Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior officers, \nas they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or \nin the Heads of Departments.'' So that process is spelled out in the \nConstitution.\n  The National Commission on the Public Service, commonly known as the \nVolcker Commission, gathered some very illuminating statistics. They \ndiffer a bit from some of the statistics the chairman has given because \nhe is using CRS, but what they show is the enormous increase in the \nnumber of positions that are now subject to Senate confirmation and \napproval.\n  When President Kennedy came to office, he had just 286 positions to \nfill that had the titles of Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Under \nSecretary, Assistant Secretary, and Administrator. But using those \ntitles, there were only 286 when President Kennedy assumed office. By \nthe end of the Clinton administration, there were 914 positions with \nthose titles. Today, according to the Congressional Research Service, \nthere are between 1,200 and 1,400 positions in total that are appointed \nby the President that require the advice and consent of the Senate. Too \noften, that large number of positions requiring confirmation leads to \nlong delays in vetting, nominating, and confirming these appointees.\n  I would also point out that there is a great expense that goes along \nwith this process. Having an FBI background check is expensive. Having \nour congressional investigators do their own vetting process is \nexpensive. And many a nominee will tell you how expensive it is for the \nnominee to go through this process. The result of the length of this \nprocess is that administrations can go for months without key officials \nin these many agencies. That is why you will find there is bipartisan \nsupport from previous administrations urging us to finally tackle this \nissue.\n  The 9/11 Commission found that ``[a]t the sub-cabinet level, there \nwere significant delays in the confirmation of key officials, \nparticularly at the Department of Defense,'' in 2001. It was not until \n6 months after President Bush took office that he had his national \nsecurity team in place. Our enemies take note of that fact. That is \nwhat the 9/11 Commission found. And it creates a national security \nvulnerability that terrorists can and have exploited. We have seen that \nin the United States, we have seen that in Madrid, that when there is a \nchange in administration, it is a particularly difficult time, \nparticularly if we do not have our appointees in place.\n  As I have mentioned, Senators Schumer and Alexander have been the \nbipartisan authors of this bill, which has been cosponsored not only by \nSenator Lieberman and myself but by members of the leadership of the \nSenate on both sides of the aisle. But I believe, of all members of the \nworking group, Senator Alexander may have the best perspective. In \nfact, I believe he does have the best perspective because he is one of \nthe few Members of the Senate who have served as a Cabinet Secretary \nand as a Senator. He has endured the nominations process himself, and I \nam sure he will explain what he went through in his comments later, but \nhe will talk about how long it was, that it was 9 months before he had \na chief financial officer. It took him 6 months, I believe, to be \nconfirmed, and he could not get his team in place because the process \nwas so bogged down.\n  The nominations reform bill we take up today removes only 203 \npositions out of an estimated 1,200 to 1,400 from the Senate \nconfirmation requirement, and most of those positions are part-time \nadvisory board members. I would ask my colleagues, should the Senate \nreally spend its time and its resources confirming 10 part-time members \nof the National Institute for Literacy Advisory Board? I am not in any \nway denigrating the work of this board or the people who are willing to \nserve on it. I am just suggesting that I do not think that board \nrequires our confirmation. What about the National Board of Education \nSciences or the National Museum and Library Sciences Board, which has \n20 part-time members, all of whom have to be confirmed by the Senate?\n  Again, I would point out there is a cost involved for my colleagues, \nand that involves everyone here who is concerned about the amount of \nmoney we are spending in the Federal Government. There is a cost to an \nFBI background investigation. There is a cost to having a sufficient \nnumber of staff to go out and do the kinds of background checks and \nvetting that we do. There is a cost to the nominees involved, who have \nto fill out all these forms, who have to be very careful that they are \ndivesting themselves of certain assets. And it makes sense for the \nOffice of Government Ethics, which already has a system in place to \ncheck for those kinds of conflicts, to not have its work duplicated, \nand that is what happens now far too often.\n  This legislation will free the Senate and enable us to focus on those \nnominees whose jobs are absolutely critical to our Nation, who do have \nsignificant policy responsibility, who do have significant control over \nFederal funds, and that will make a difference. It will also enable the \nSenate to spend more time on the critical work of how can we best \ncreate more jobs in this country, how can we reduce our unsustainable \n$14 trillion debt, how can we strengthen our homeland security, and how \ncan we conduct more effective oversight of the executive branch. Isn't \nit a better use of our time to be holding oversight hearings to examine \nthe enormous duplication the Government Accountability Office has found \nacross government that wastes hundreds of millions, perhaps billions of \ntaxpayer dollars, rather than spending our time worrying about the \nconfirmation of 20 part-time members of the National Museum and Library \nServices Board?\n  Over the years, our committee has continued to hear from experts on \nthe executive nominations process. In April of this year, we received a \nletter from the bipartisan Commission to Reform the Federal \nAppointments Process, which is chaired by our former colleagues, \nSenators Frist and Robb, as\n\n[[Page S4000]]\n\nwell as we have heard from the former Director of Presidential \nPersonnel for the Bush administration, Clay Johnson, and the former \nChief of Staff for the Clinton administration, Mack McLarty. They \nwrote--and I think this puts it well--that ``[m]ost everyone agrees the \nfederal appointments process is broken.'' They underscored that the \nbill before us will help the next administration ``to put in place very \nearly in its first year the . . . people that the new Department heads \nneed to get off to a fast start . . . working effectively with \nCongress.''\n  I hope we can agree to undertake the modest reforms we have included \nin this bill. I hope we do not let this legislation and the Rules \nCommittee resolution get caught up in the turf battles and the power \nstruggles that too often sink good government initiatives in this body. \nThis bill is a step in the right direction and a step we should take \ntogether by an overwhelming margin.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, if they have not already been \nprinted in the Record, that letters endorsing the bill from the \nBipartisan Policy Center, the Partnership for Public Service, Senator \nFred Thompson, former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, and former \nSenators Bill Frist and Chuck Robb be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Bipartisan Policy Center,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 21, 2011.\n     Re S. 679 and S. Res. 116--Support.\n\n       To Legislative Directors: As former senators and \n     presidential appointees of both parties, we fully support the \n     Senate's efforts to improve the nomination and confirmation \n     process by reducing the number of political appointees who \n     require senate confirmation, forming a commission to make \n     recommendations for a more efficient financial disclosure and \n     background check process, and streamlining the senate \n     confirmation process for nominees to advisory boards and \n     commissions.\n       The problem and the solution are truly bipartisan. \n     Presidents of both parties and senates controlled by both \n     parties have seen the increasing difficulties in the \n     presidential appointment and senate confirmation process. \n     With each recent presidency, the length of time to select, \n     nominate and confirm appointees has lengthened. [Many public \n     spirited people are discouraged from serving in appointive \n     office because of the length and extreme adversarial nature \n     of the process.]\n       In S. 679 and S. Res. 116, the Senate proposes modest \n     improvements in the system. These bills will not alter the \n     fundamental character of the appointment and confirmation \n     process. The president will continue to make nominations and \n     the senate will exercise its advise and consent role for \n     hundreds of appointments. But for some lower level nominees, \n     the senate confirmation process will be eliminated or \n     streamlined and the financial disclosure and background check \n     process will be simplified and improved.\n       Beyond these immediate measures, we hope that in the future \n     the Senate will continue to work to improve the confirmation \n     process by coordinating senate committee financial disclosure \n     forms with executive branch disclosure forms. And we \n     encourage consultation between the executive and legislative \n     branches to find ways to limit the use of the recess \n     appointment power.\n       S. 679 and S. Res. 116 are small and important steps in the \n     right direction. We encourage the Senate to pass these two \n     measures.\n           Best Regards,\n     Secretary Dan Glickman,\n       Senior Fellow, BPC.\n     Senator Pete Domenici,\n       Senior Fellow, BPC.\n     Senator Trent Lott,\n       Senior Fellow, BPC.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Partnership For Public Service,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 20, 2011.\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Lieberman and Collins: I commend you, as \n     Chairman and Ranking Member of the Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs Committee, for your leadership in moving \n     forward legislation to streamline the presidential \n     appointments process. S. 679, the Presidential Appointment \n     Efficiency and Streamlining Act, and S. Res. 116 will \n     contribute to better, more effective government by reducing \n     the number of presidential appointees subject to Senate \n     confirmation and doing much to fix a broken nominations \n     process that takes too long, is too complex and discourages \n     some of our nation's best talent from serving.\n       This legislation is urgently needed, and I applaud you for \n     your efforts to ensure our federal government has the right \n     talent in place to face our nation's many challenges. The \n     Partnership for Public Service strongly supports S. 679 and \n     S. Res. 116 and urges their swift passage.\n       Very best wishes.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Max Stier,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    Hermitage, TN, April 12, 2011.\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     Ranking Republican Member, Committee on Homeland Security and \n         Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Joe and Susan: In 2001, when I was Chairman of the \n     Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, we held hearings \n     reviewing the nominations process and potential options for \n     reforms. President George W. Bush had been in office 10 \n     months and only about 60 percent of the government's top \n     political jobs had been filled--which created national \n     security concerns.\n       That's why I want to commend you for your work on the \n     Presidential Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act of \n     2011 which would eliminate the need for Senate confirmation \n     of approximately 200 relatively low level positions. We tried \n     to fix this problem when I was chairman, and it still needs \n     to be done.\n       My experience was that our confirmation process led to \n     substantial delay and extraordinary expense for nominees as \n     they are vetted beyond what is necessary even for the least \n     sensitive positions. I believe that this will result in an \n     increasingly narrow pool of potential public servants who are \n     more likely to be wealthy, and already live in the \n     Washington, DC, area.\n       In 1960, President Kennedy had 286 positions to fill in the \n     ranks of Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Under Secretary, \n     Assistant Secretary, and Administrator and by the end of the \n     Clinton Administration there were 914 positions with these \n     titles. Reform would not diminish oversight. It would make \n     oversight more effective.\n       Comprehensive reforms throughout the presidential \n     appointment process are needed so that the Senate can spend \n     its time focusing on senior nominations and on major \n     priorities such as national defense and tackling our budget \n     problems.\n       The Senate should take its advice and consent powers \n     seriously, but the number of nominations have grown and \n     expanded over time--much like the rest of the federal \n     government. I hope your committee will take quick action on \n     this legislation and send the bill to the full Senate for its \n     consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     U.S. Senator Fred Thompson.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            Frank C. Carlucci,\n\n                                         McLean, VA, June 1, 2011.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles Schumer,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Lamar Alexander,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Reid, McConnell, Schumer and Alexander: I am \n     writing to commend you for your leadership and bipartisan \n     approach to tackling one of the great challenges facing our \n     government--presidential appointments and nominations reform. \n     There is little dispute that the current nominations process \n     has grown too cumbersome and complicated, and the number of \n     political appointees is too large. S. 679, the Presidential \n     Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act, and S. Res. 116 \n     are a promising show of progress, and I encourage all \n     Senators to support this bipartisan legislation.\n       As former Secretary of Defense (under President Reagan), I \n     know the importance of having high quality leaders in place \n     within an agency. Leaving positions vacant indefinitely as \n     appointees wait to be confirmed is not smart management, and \n     is frankly a threat to our national security. We need strong \n     leaders installed quickly in agencies to ensure our \n     government is ready to meet the many challenges it faces. S. \n     679 and S. Res. 116 together present a common-sense solution \n     that preserves the important role of the Senate in confirming \n     key nominees, but unburdens the process by relieving the \n     advice and consent requirement for less critical positions.\n       Congress would be wise to act now, before the politics of \n     the next election cycle get in the way of practical reforms \n     to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our federal \n     government. I urge the Senate to swiftly pass both S. 679 and \n     S. Res. 116 to ensure our government has its senior leaders \n     in place within agencies to carry out critical missions.\n           Sincerely,\n     Frank Carlucci.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    June 17, 2011.\n     Senator Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: We write today to encourage your \n     support for the Presidential Appointment Efficiency and \n     Streamlining Act of 2011 (S. 679). Having served in the \n     Senate and participated in this process firsthand, we believe \n     this bill would constructively improve the federal \n     appointments process, which we all know is broken.\n\n[[Page S4001]]\n\n       We believe that this bill will dramatically improve \n     government operations, especially in the first months of a \n     new administration. S. 679 will make it possible for a new \n     administration to more quickly put into place the roughly 70 \n     vital communication and operations personnel needed by \n     department heads to effectively work and communicate with \n     Congress, the public, and federal employees.\n       S. 679 will create more time and capacity for the Senate \n     within an administration's early months to confirm or deny \n     the appointment of senior-most, operational and policy-making \n     officials, whose qualifications clearly warrant Senate \n     scrutiny.\n       Importantly, S. 679 will create a working group to develop \n     a specific plan to improve the efficiency, manner and speed \n     with which background data are collected from potential \n     nominees. The goal is to streamline and better coordinate the \n     now cumbersome process whereby the FBI, Office of Government \n     Ethics, and the Senate receive and consider a nominees' \n     information; vetting would begin sooner, critical especially \n     in the first few months of a new administration. Furthermore, \n     the unnecessary and duplicative data-gathering burden on the \n     individual nominee can be reduced significantly. The \n     Executive Branch will similarly develop a plan to accelerate \n     the process by which they receive nominees' background \n     information, so that nominees can be submitted for Senate \n     approval in a more timely fashion.\n       We believe the Act does not diminish the institutional \n     influence or Constitutional duties of the Senate, as it will \n     retain the power to advise on and consent to the appointment \n     of some 1200 policy-making and senior officials, including \n     those officials to whim the subject positions of S. 679 \n     report. Through the use of hearings, reports to congress, \n     Inspector General and GAO reports, the Senate will continue \n     to hold responsible offices accountable for performance \n     expectations, regardless of whether or not the appointed \n     individuals in those offices are confirmed by the Senate. The \n     Senate will still maintain the high performance standards \n     sought for all government functions and programs.\n       Moreover, in no way does the Act diminish the stature of \n     appointed positions that will no longer require Senate \n     confirmation, a process which we all know makes it more \n     difficult to attract highly qualified candidates. Currently a \n     number of comparable positions are Senate confirmed in one \n     agency, yet not in another. We believe there is no evidence \n     to suggest those appointees requiring Senate confirmation are \n     more qualified and talented than those having the same job at \n     other agencies only not requiring Senate confirmation.\n       It is noteworthy that leaders from both parties have come \n     together to develop this legislation to improve the working \n     of the Senate confirmation process and markedly improve \n     government operations, especially in the first year of a new \n     administration. We highly encourage you to join Senators \n     Reid, McConnell, Schumer, Alexander, Lieberman and Collins to \n     pass S. 679 to make the Senate confirmation process more \n     effective.\n           Respectfully yours,\n     William H. Frist, M.D.\n     Charles S. Robb.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senators from \nMaine and Connecticut not just for their comments today but for their \nwork for nearly a decade on this issue. This is hard, slogging work in \nthe Senate. It is not easy to do. As I mentioned earlier, it is not one \nbit glamorous, but it helps make the Senate a more effective \ninstitution. If we are more effective, then we can deal better with our \ndebt, then we can deal better with Libya, then we can deal better with \ncreating jobs, then we can earn more respect from the people who elect \nus. So I thank them for their leadership.\n  I thank Senator McConnell and Senator Reid for creating the \nenvironment in which this can happen.\n  I thank all my colleagues, many of whom did not exercise all their \nrights, and allowed the bill to come to the floor in this agreement by \nunanimous consent. We have not had this privilege very often in the \nSenate. It is a good way for the Senate to work. It is the right way \nfor the Senate to work. What it means is, over the next day or two, \nhowever long it takes, Senators may bring their relevant amendments to \nthe floor and they may call them up without asking unanimous consent to \nset aside a pending amendment.\n  Then we will have a debate, and then we will vote on them. When we \nare through voting, we will vote on the bill. I would encourage my \ncolleagues to prepare to bring their amendments to the floor. I am \ngoing to defer my remarks until this afternoon, when Senator Schumer, \nthe chairman of the Rules Committee, will come to the floor at 2:40. I \nwill speak following him. We will talk about the resolution, which is \nthe other half of the bill.\n  But this is legislation about making Senate oversight, as Senator \nLieberman said, more effective, not less effective. It is about putting \na stop to the trivializing of our constitutional duty for advice and \nconsent. It is about ending the phenomenon of innocent until nominated, \nwhich is what happens to distinguished citizens of this country who are \nasked to serve in the Federal Government and, to their great horror, \ndiscover they are heading through a maze of conflicting forms and \nquestionnaires, until finally they are dragged before a tribunal in the \nSenate and caught in an inadvertent error and made out to be a \ncriminal, when they thought they were an upstanding citizen, having \nserved in their hometowns for a long time.\n  We should stop that business, and every administration in recent \nyears has asked us to do it. So this is the right thing to do. It is a \nmodest step but an important step. It is a signal that we can do our \nbusiness well, that we can treat American citizens with respect, that \nwe can focus our attention where it needs to be focused and not focus \nour attention where it is not.\n  Senator Collins mentioned there are several thousand public health \nofficers and others who are now confirmed by the Senate. That is the \nrough equivalent of confirming forest rangers or staff members of the \nSenate or agricultural extension officers. I mean, they are all \nvaluable positions, but did our Founders expect that we would be \nsending the FBI to ask whether they lived beyond their means before \nthey took their job and then conduct diligent inquiries there and \nbefore some committee of the Senate?\n  Well, of course not. So we are going to end up with about 1,200 \nnominations from the President, to whom we need to devote advice and \nconsent. One indication of why it is so necessary to do this is, nobody \ncan tell us how many Presidential appointments there are that need \nadvice and consent. The Congressional Research Service at first said \n1,200, and then when our staffs began looking at it, it is more like \n1,400.\n  In the last Congress, how many of these important advice-and-consent \npositions actually deserved a rollcall vote? Three percent. So we only \nhad time to give a rollcall vote to 3 percent of the men and women whom \nwe have decided need the extraordinary constitutional process of advice \nand consent. We need to elevate the advice-and-consent process back to \nwhere it ought to be, do our jobs correctly, treat people who are \nnominated by the President with dignity and hope the President can \nstaff his government appropriately so we do not have to. As Senator \nCollins said, it has been 6 months while we wait to get the President's \ndefense team in place.\n  That is partly the President's own fault, but it is partly our fault, \nand we need to work together. We have a process in this bill where we \nwill work together to try to speed that up. So I am glad I had the \nopportunity to hear Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins. This is not \nthe first time they have tried to do this. But they will succeed in \ndoing this because they have broad bipartisan support and an era of \ncooperation within the Senate.\n  We will have some debate. We still have some disagreements about \nwhich positions should be in and which positions should be out. That is \nwhy we have relevant amendments. That is why we bring them up. That is \nwhy we vote on them. That is why we will eventually come to a final \nresult on the bill.\n  I thank them for their leadership, for their eloquence, and for their \npublic spiritedness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank our friend and colleague from \nTennessee for his statement and even more for the hard work he has \ndone, along with Senator Schumer--the hard work, the steadfast work, \nwithout which we would not be on the floor right now.\n  Senator Collins and I both agree this is one of those rare cases \nwhere I would not say we gave up, but we were beginning to grow \npessimistic about our capability to achieve these reforms. It is \nunusual for us because we are usually so stubbornly persistent.\n  But Senator Alexander and Senator Schumer, working with the \nencouragement and blessing of the two leaders,\n\n[[Page S4002]]\n\nSenators Reid and McConnell, have put us in a position to get this \ndone. It would be a real step forward. So I thank the Senator. \nObviously, the work begins now.\n  The floor is open for debate, as of 3 o'clock, for amendment. If \neither of my colleagues do not have anything more to say, I would \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         North Dakota Flooding\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to my home \nState of North Dakota where we have terrible flooding occurring. We \nhave flooding today on the Souris River and the community of Minot is \nnow in the process of evacuating more than 11,000 people from their \nhomes. In truth, we have had tremendous challenges with flooding all \nspring, throughout the State of North Dakota--the Red River Valley, \nCheyenne River Valley, James River Valley around Devil's Lake, the \nMissouri River, Bismarck, Mandan area, up and down Missouri, all the \npoints throughout western North Dakota and today it is in north central \nNorth Dakota. The Souris River is flooding, not only in the community \nof Minot but also in communities upstream to the north, small \ncommunities, counties, rural areas, and downstream as well, creating \nreal hardship for citizens.\n  Even as I speak, more than 11,000 people are leaving their homes in \nand around the community of Minot. The Minot community is something \nover 40,000 people, so somewhere between a third and a fourth of our \ncitizens in that community and the region will be displaced from their \nhomes and their businesses. Our thoughts and our prayers go out to all \nof them.\n  At the same time we must do all we can to help them, both now at this \ntime of need but also in the days coming as we go forward. Minot and \nthe region have been in this flood fight for some time. In fact, \ntogether with the Corps of Engineers, with the National Guard, with \nlocal contractors, with the local officials, State support, the Federal \nagencies, the citizens have been fighting a battle against flooding for \nmonths this spring. They have built up their defenses. They have built \nlevees along the river, the Souris River that flows through the Minot \ncommunity and through the region. They built those levees up to an \nelevation of 1556. They built levees and dikes along the river.\n  In addition, years ago the community in fact levied a sales tax on \nitself to help build dams in Canada, Rafferty Dam and Alameda Dam, to \ntry to have permanent flood control in place. This is a community and \nthis is a region of our State that has worked very hard, using its own \nlocal dollars along with State and Federal sources, to build permanent \nflood protection--dams in Canada, as well as levees along the river.\n  Those defenses have stood for more than 30 years and protected the \ncommunity and the region from flooding but this time they are not \nenough. As I say, the elevation is about 1556 on those levees along the \nriver and it looks as though the crest will be 1563, 7 to maybe 10 feet \nhigher than the levees provide defense. That means people have to leave \ntheir homes and their businesses and their property.\n  Ironically, 3 weeks ago with the projections that we had at that \ntime, roughly 10,000 to 11,000 people were forced to leave their homes \nat that time. But fortunately the crest came in lower than was \nprojected and, with the work they were able to do on the levees, \nraising the levees yet again, they were able to keep the water within \nthe banks of the Souris River so people were able to return to their \nhomes and their property was not damaged. But unfortunately that is not \nthe case now. Already the water is rising to the very tops of the \nlevees and, as I say, the crest is projected to be well above those \nlevees.\n  The first priority must be to keep people safe, to protect lives and \nprotect people. The mayor, Mayor Zimbelman, is working with local \nofficials and our Governor, Governor Jack Dalrymple. The National Guard \nis there. On the order of 500 National Guardsmen are helping with this \nevacuation process. Local law enforcement, fire emergency responders, \nthey are all engaged. We truly appreciate their help and their efforts.\n  Minot Air Force base, a major Air Force base for our Nation, is \nlocated right near the community. I think there are on the order of \n12,000 more people who live at that Air Force base. Some of the air men \nand women who are stationed at the base of course live in the \ncommunity. Those men and women of the Air Force are helping the \ncommunity. Minot Air Force base is providing a place for shelter for \nour citizens and providing help. I have spoken with the Air Force \nofficials and we truly appreciate their help with manpower, with \ntransportation, and with shelter.\n  Also Minot State University, our local university, is providing \nshelter for people who need it in the community. We have the relief \norganizations there as well, the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, and \nothers.\n  Of course, in addition to all of that, we have citizens helping each \nother. That is truly the North Dakota way and they are doing a fine \njob. As a matter of fact, in the recent evacuation I mentioned several \nweeks ago, even though more than 10,000 people were evacuated, very few \nended up staying in the shelters because friends and family, caring \npeople in the community and in the region, provided a place for so many \nto stay. Of course, we know that will happen again as people open their \nhomes to help others in a time of need. But clearly more help will be \nneeded and help with recovery will be needed as well. That means \nHomeland Security, that means FEMA, that means the other Federal \nagencies as well. Many homes and many businesses will be flooded and \nthose homes and businesses will be likely in floodwaters until into \nJuly. That assistance will be very much needed, very much required.\n  That means programs such as public assistance and individual \nassistance through FEMA to help with public infrastructure that is \ndamaged, to help individual homeowners with damage to their homes, will \nbe necessary, along with flood insurance, SBA disaster assistance for \nbusinesses--because this flood is right through the very central part \nof the community so it affects not just homes and property but many \nbusinesses as well. Of course, it will affect public infrastructure.\n  To that end, I am already meeting with the Director of FEMA Craig \nFugate this afternoon. We must be committed to that process, to help \nall we can, both in this flood fight and in the ensuing recovery.\n  It has been a real challenge this year. As you look around the \ncountry, look around our State, the flooding I described, not just here \nin Minot but throughout the State, and as you look around the country \nwith flooding up and down the Missouri, up and down the Mississippi, \nand you look at the tornadoes and now look at fires occurring in the \nSouthwest--this has been a tough year. It is a challenging year. So we \nneed to pull together and we need to help each other. I know we will, \nbecause that is the American way. That is the way we have always done \nit and I know we will be there to help each other, to help our citizens \nin Minot, in the Minot region, throughout the State of North Dakota, \nbut in other places around the country as well. As I say, that is the \nAmerican way. We will prevail in this endeavor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I know the issue before us is to change the \nway the nominations are handled. I wish to express my appreciation for \nthat act and ask my colleagues to support it. A number of the \nnominations come through the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee. I have been the chairman of that committee, and am now the \nranking member. There have been times when nearly 350 appointments have \ncome through at one\n\n[[Page S4003]]\n\ntime, none of which are accompanied by any paperwork. This situation \nrelates to the Public Health Service Corps nominees, which the \nCommittee is required to report and confirm. However, there is no way \nto check on any of them because HELP Committee rules specifically state \nthat routine paperwork does not need to be filed for these nominees. So \nit is a waste of time to take these nominees through the committee \nprocess and then to the floor. This bill would eliminate that need.\n  Now, under the proposal, there are about 250 positions where any \nSenator can call for a nominee to go through regular order. So for \nthese nominees, anybody who has a concern about a nominee the President \nappoints has the leverage to be able to take a look at that person, to \nvoice their comments, and to have it considered in the regular order.\n  I do see a great capability for us to be more productive under this \nnew system, and that is what I would like to see. I would like to ask \neverybody to support the bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I rise in support of S. 679, a \nbipartisan effort that will streamline Presidential appointments and \nreduce the number of Senate confirmations for certain types of \npositions, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  First, I want to praise my colleague and friend, Senator Alexander, \nwho has been a leading, if not the leading, force in this effort. We \nhave worked together well in a bipartisan way to try to come up with a \nproposal that meets the agreement of the Chamber. He has done a great \njob, and it has been a pleasure, I would say to my friend from \nTennessee, to work with him, as it always is.\n  I also want to thank, of course, Senator Reid, who has encouraged us \nto get involved in this process and has been right there with us all \nthe way, as well as Republican Leader McConnell, who, again, has from \nthe beginning been on our side and agreed that this is a worthwhile \nendeavor.\n  So we formed a bipartisan working group at the behest of Senator Reid \nand Senator McConnell to try to figure out how to try to reduce the \nnumber of Presidential appointments that require Senate confirmation \nand to create new procedures to improve the pace of confirmation for \nexecutive branch nominees, as part of an overall reform of the Senate \nrules.\n  Senators Alexander, Lieberman, Collins and I, in conjunction with the \nleaders, worked closely to develop this bill and the accompanying \nresolution, which we will turn to immediately after the bill, to \nimprove how the Senate deals with executive nominations.\n  Throughout this entire process, we have partnered with folks from \nboth sides of the aisle, and many have significantly contributed to \nthis process. This package is an essential piece of the bipartisan \nrules reform we began at the start of Congress, and Senators Lieberman \nand Collins have had a lot of experience in this regard. They have \ntried it before, and their advice to us has been invaluable as well.\n  The Senate was designed to be a thoughtful and deliberative body. But \nthe confirmation process is often slowed to a near standstill. This \nlegislation will clear some of the more noncontroversial positions so \nthe Senate can focus on its constitutional advise and consent power as \nit was intended, to confirm the most important positions.\n  The bill is not intended to take away or diminish the Senate's advise \nand consent power. The power will remain and still be used for the \nconfirmation of senior policymaking appointments. The purpose of this \nlegislation is to help the Senate function better and more efficiently.\n  Rather than spending time in committee and on the floor confirming \nnominees who have part-time appointments, nonpolicymaking \nresponsibilities, or who directly report to Senate-confirmed \nindividuals, we can alleviate ourselves of this burden and make these \nindividuals nonconfirmable.\n  With that said, I recognize that some of our chairmen would like to \nsee certain positions remain confirmable. We are continuing to work \nwith them on their concerns, and we want to be flexible. We will be \nworking with some of those Senators from both sides of the aisle who \nhave voiced some objections and think the list is too large.\n  However, we also want to avoid the hollowing out of this bill so it \nno longer represents real reform. Over the past few decades, hundreds \nof these positions have been created which have contributed to a \nclogging of the Senate and a delay in getting good mid-level candidates \nin place to help the government function effectively.\n  The bill will eliminate from Senate confirmation 200 executive \nnomination positions. It covers several categories of positions, \nincluding legislative and public affairs positions, information \ntechnology administrators, internal management and administrative \npositions, and deputies or nonpolicy-related assistant secretaries who \nreport to individuals who are Senate confirmable.\n  Additionally, we have removed thousands of positions from the Public \nHealth Service Officer Corps and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration Officer Corps from the confirmation process. These \npositions are noncontroversial and their removal will further prevent \nthe possibility of gridlock. Removing those positions from the Senate \nconfirmation process will allow a new administration to be set up with \nmore efficiency and speed, thus making government work better for the \npeople.\n  The public should not be harmed because we are not able to get \nqualified people confirmed in a timely manner. The bill will also \ncreate a working group that will provide recommendations to the \nPresident and the Senate to further improve the confirmation process. \nThe group will focus on offering guidance on the paperwork process for \nnominees through examining the creation of a single searchable \nelectronic smart form and will also conduct a review of the current \nbackground investigation requirements.\n  In conclusion, this will help make the confirmation process less \ntedious for nominees by preventing them from having to submit the same \ninformation in several different forms to several entities. The bill \nwas successfully passed by the Homeland Security and Government Affairs \nCommittee, and S. Res. 116, which we will turn to immediately after \nthis bill, was marked up in the Rules Committee unanimously.\n  We are confident that this bill, in conjunction with the resolution, \nwill eliminate many of the delays in the current confirmation process. \nIn conclusion, these delays are very detrimental to the efficient \noperation of government and to the efforts to recruit the most \nqualified people to these Federal jobs.\n  The public deserves a focus of our deliberation on confirming the \nmost important positions and not to hold up those generally \nnoncontroversial positions which more closely resemble appointments \nthat are currently made without Senate approval.\n  I yield the floor, and I know my colleague, Senator Alexander will \nspeak next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Schumer for his \ndiligent work on this effort to help the Senate do a better job with \nits responsibilities of advice and consent.\n  As the chairman of the Rules Committee, he and I have been working \ntogether at the direction of Senator Reid and Senator McConnell to come \nup with a consensus about how to do this. Our colleagues, all 100, have \nagreed that we can move on to the bill and debate any relevant \namendment, which has not happened very often around here, and is \nexactly the way the Senate ought to work.\n  So I thank Senator Schumer for taking on this difficult task. It is \nnot a glamorous task, but it is one that hopefully will make the Senate \nmore effective. If we are more effective, we can do a better job of \ndealing with the debt, of helping to make it easier and cheaper to \ncreate private sector jobs, of\n\n[[Page S4004]]\n\ncoming up with an energy policy that helps us find more American energy \nand use less, and regain respect from the American people who have \ngiven us the privilege of serving here.\n  I start this discussion with our Constitution, which, as the late \nSenator Byrd used to suggest, we should all carry around with us. \nPerhaps the most celebrated constitutional duty of the United States \nSenate is our responsibility to provide advice and consent. It is in \narticle II, section 2, of the Constitution. It talks about the \nPresident there, but it says: ``He shall nominate, and by and with the \nAdvice and Consent of the Senate'' and among other things--to appoint a \nnumber of people. But it also says:\n\n       . . . the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such \n     inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President \n     alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.\n\n  So this discussion is about that part of our constitutional \nresponsibility, deciding what inferior officers should be vested--the \nappointment of which should be vested in the President alone or in \nheads of departments. I will talk more about that in a moment. But \nthere are really three major goals of this legislation.\n  One is to stop the trivializing of the constitutional duty of advice \nand consent. We are providing our advice and consent on so many \nPresidential nominations that the President is not able to spend as \nmuch time as he should on getting them to us rapidly.\n  It is slowing down the organization of government. We, in turn, are \nnot able to spend as much time as we should reviewing the \nqualifications of the important officers of the government that the \nPresident needs to appoint, and we are not serving ourselves well. We \nare trivializing the constitutional duty of advice and consent.\n  The second thing we are doing--and in this, the Executive, the \nPresident and the Congress, are equally to blame--is creating an \nenvironment that I would describe as being ``innocent until \nnominated'' in which we take some self-respecting U.S. citizen, and the \nPresident invites them to come take a position in the Federal \nGovernment of honor and dignity, and suddenly they find themselves \nimmersed in a series of duplicative interrogations from all directions \nin which they must fill out forms that define words such as ``income'' \nin different ways, all of which is designed to lead them before a \ncommittee, not to really assess their qualifications but to see if they \ncan be trapped and turned into an apparent criminal. In other words, \nthey are innocent until nominated.\n\n  Every former administration's officials in recent memory have come to \nus and said we need to work together. No. 1, we need to stop the \ntrivializing of the Senate's advice and consent responsibility; No. 2, \nwe need to do something about this environment of innocent until \nnominated.\n  Finally, this legislation--which, as I said, has been moved to the \nfloor for debate with the consent of all 100 Members of the Senate--is \nreally the third step in the discussion that began in January about \nwhat steps we can take to make the Senate a more effective place. One \nstep was to get rid of secret holds. Another step was to limit the \nreading of the minutes as a dilatory tactic.\n  This is the third step, appointed by the majority leader, Senator \nReid, and the Republican leader, Senator McConnell. They asked Senator \nSchumer and I to form a working group. We have come forward with a bill \nand a resolution, which we will debate today and tomorrow--until we \nfinish--and it will streamline executive nominations and hopefully give \nus a chance to do more oversight on the positions that need the \noversight and not waste our time with positions that don't. At the same \ntime, it will make it easier for the next President to staff his or her \ngovernment promptly so that they can deal with questions of war and the \neconomy as they come up and not have to wait 6 months or 9 months after \nthey have taken office to deal with those questions. And it will make \nit more inviting for good citizens of this country to accept a \nPresident's invitation to come serve in the Federal Government.\n  As I mentioned, this came about earlier this year when we were about \nto have a showdown over the filibuster. The Senator from Oregon was \npart of that debate. I hope he feels some credit for moving this \ndiscussion to where it is today. This is not all that the Senator from \nOregon or the Senator from New Mexico or others want, but I think what \nwe quickly learn in the Senate is that a few small steps in the right \ndirection is one good way to get where you want to go. This will be a \nthird step.\n  Basically, this is what we will be doing. We are affecting about 451 \nPresidential appointments. This represents about one-third of all \nSenate-confirmed positions. That sounds like a lot, and it is a lot. \nLet me qualify it in this way. Here is what has happened over the last \nseveral years.\n  In 1960, President Kennedy had to fill 286 positions in the ranks of \nSecretary, Deputy Secretary, Under Secretary, Assistant Secretary, and \nAdministrator.\n  By the time President Clinton came into office, there were 914 \npositions with those titles. That is according to the Volcker \nCommission Report, which recommended the kinds of things we are \nconsidering today.\n  Since then, CRS has counted more than 1,200 Presidential appointments \nrequiring the advice and consent of the Senate, and our staffs on the \nRules Committee and the Homeland Security Committee found more than \n1,400. So we are in the embarrassing position of having to answer the \nquestion--if somebody were to say: Here is this enormously important \nposition of the Senate, this constitutional duty to provide advice and \nconsent, and how many Presidential appointments are subject to advice \nand consent? The answer would be that we don't know. CRS says it is \n1,200. Our staffs say it is 1,410.\n  Another indication that we are not giving them sufficient attention--\nat least to the ones we should--is the number of rollcall votes on \nPresidential appointments requiring advice and consent. You would think \nthat if a Presidential appointment were important enough to require a \nfull FBI check, which is very expensive, time consuming, and takes \nseveral months; and then a nomination by the President and all of the \nvetting that goes with that; and then the work of the White House \npersonnel office and all the time spent with that; and then it comes to \nthe Senate and goes to our committees, and our committees have their \nown questionnaire and their own investigator and their own schedule for \nhearings and their own schedule for voting, and then they report it to \nthe floor--you would think if it were important enough to go through \nall of that in order to get our advice and consent, we would take time \nto vote on it, would you not? Well, in the last Congress, this Senate \nvoted on 3 percent of the nominations that require advice and consent. \nThat is one indication that we are doing too many--we are trivializing \nthe duty. So not only do we not know how many there are--we think, now \nthat our staffs have worked through this, there are about 1,410--97 \npercent of them are not important enough to vote on; we just pass them \nby unanimous consent.\n  As Senator Enzi said earlier today in another setting, and I don't \nthink he minds my bringing this up, sometimes we approve these \nnominations in blocks--280 at a time--without knowing anything about \nthem. So we are pretending we are giving advice and consent when we are \nnot.\n  An example of that would be the positions of the several thousand \nmembers of the Public Health Service Officer Corps and the National \nOceanic Atmospheric Administration Officer Corps. They are all subject \nto advice and consent. They come through in the box loads. They are all \nvery valuable public servants, I am sure, but to subject the Public \nHealth Service Officer Corps and the National Oceanic Administration \nOfficer Corps to a full Senate advice and consent would be the \napproximate equivalent of requiring advice and consent of agricultural \nextension officers or forest rangers or members of the Senate staff. \nThey all have important jobs, but they are not supposed to rise to the \nlevel of advice and consent, which is why the U.S. Constitution \nspecifically said that we should select ``inferior officers,'' in its \nwords, whom the President himself--the President alone--or heads of \ndepartments may appoint.\n  Now, what is an ``inferior officer''? Well, words have meaning, and \nJustice\n\n[[Page S4005]]\n\nScalia gave a definition to the words ``inferior officer'' in the case \nof Edmund v. United States in 1997. Justice Scalia said:\n\n       We think it is evident that inferior officers are officers \n     whose work is directed and supervised at some level by others \n     who were appointed by the Presidential nomination with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate.\n\n  That makes pretty good sense. If you are working for someone who is \nappointed by the President and subject to the advice and consent of the \nSenate, then you are accountable to the Senate and the people of the \nUnited States through your superior. That makes you an inferior \nofficer. You may be important, but you are subordinate to someone else \nwhose appointment was subject to advice and consent.\n  Here is what we have done in the legislation.\n  First, we have a bill from the Homeland Security Committee, and then \nwe have a resolution that comes from our Rules Committee. Of the 451 \npositions that are affected, in addition to the thousands of members of \nthe officer corps I mentioned, 248 are part-time board and commission \npositions that could be expedited and would keep their advice and \nconsent rolls and remain Senate-confirmed. I will talk more about that \nin a minute. Then 118 other part-time board and commission positions \nwill no longer require Senate confirmation. And then 85 positions that \nare full-time would not require advice and consent for confirmation.\n  After all is said and done, when you include the fact that 248 \npositions we affected are merely expedited and still subject to advice \nand consent if a single U.S. Senator says it is necessary--they are \nstill subject to it under any event and to the full investigation if a \nsingle Senator says it is necessary--we will still have more than 1,200 \nSenate-confirmed executive branch nominations. So, as Senator Collins \nsaid on the floor today, after this is done, if our bill and resolution \nare passed, more than 90 percent of the full-time positions that now \nare subject to advice and consent will still be subject to it, as will \nmore than 85 percent of the part-time positions.\n  Why is it important that we have so many positions that are subject \nto advice and consent? One could argue, why don't you narrow it simply \nto the Cabinet members or the Cabinet members and their deputies? Why \nslow the President down in his work by requiring so many to come over, \nbecause even after we are through this, after everything Senators \nSchumer, Collins, Lieberman, and I recommended to the Senate was \nadopted, the Senate will have 1,200 persons it could put through this \ngauntlet of advice and consent and make its point.\n  Many Senators choose to use these confirmation proceedings to \nexercise our prerogative as elected Members of Congress to get \ninformation, to assert our views or to influence the direction of \ngovernment. For example, Senator McConnell has been holding President \nObama's trade nominees until President Obama sends his free-trade \nagreements to Congress. Senator Grassley and Senator Chambliss held up \nthe Solicitor General's nomination because it had been 2 years and \ntheir request for documents from the Department of Justice had not been \nforthcoming. After they held up the Solicitor General's nomination in \nthe advice and consent process, they got their documents.\n  I suggest that having 1,200 opportunities to hold a Presidential \nnominee hostage is enough for any Senator to work his or her will in \norder to make a point and that to go beyond that is to begin to \ntrivialize the whole process.\n  As I mentioned earlier, our legislation has two parts. In the first \npart--the part we are debating now, the bill--there are approximately \n200 positions that now are subject to Presidential confirmation that \nwould not be subject to Presidential confirmation. These would be 85 \nfull-time positions, including legislative affairs and public affairs \npositions, chief financial officers, information technology positions, \nand others. These are all important positions, but let's think of it \nthis way:\n  I was once a Cabinet member. It took me about 3 months--well, 4 or 5, \nfrom December through March--after I was announced and confirmed by the \nSenate, and then I had the opportunity to ask the President to send to \nthe Senate all of the subordinate officials who required Senate \nconfirmation. That means the President had to vet those people. That \nmeans the Senate had to go through its whole process, once information \ngot here, and vet those people. It had to schedule a hearing. It had to \nreport out the name. That had to come to the Senate. That had to be \nvoted on on the floor.\n\n  So there I was, sitting--confirmed in March or April, after I had \nbeen announced in December as the President's Education Secretary--but \nit took me until toward the end of the year to get most of the \nPresident's team in place in the Department of Education. Who does that \nserve? Who does that serve well? Wouldn't it be better if I could \nappoint my own legislative affairs officer who could then come up and \ndeal with Congress from April on instead of having to wait until later?\n  This is important for citizens to know. If you are in a position \nsubject to advice and consent, you are not to go to the Department \nuntil you are confirmed or you will not be confirmed because it would \nbe considered to be an insult to the Senate. So you have Cabinet \nmembers, particularly at the beginning of an administration, sitting \nthere almost alone, without any new members of the President's team to \nhelp them implement policy.\n  That affects the voters in a bad way. Let's say all the voters in a \ncountry get upset with President Obama and elect a Republican President \nwhose job it is to bring the deficit down. Let us pose a hypothetical. \nIn comes the new Republican President and it takes 2 or 3 months to \nconfirm the Secretaries of the Treasury, the Office of Management and \nBudget, and then with other key people it might take 6 or 8 months. The \npeople of this country are saying: Wait, I voted in November and here \nwe are coming into the next summer and the government still isn't \nformed and the deficit is still bad. I am very frustrated with my \ngovernment.\n  This legislation is set to deal with that. The bill itself takes \nabout 200 positions and removes advice and consent, with 118 of those \nbeing part-time advisory commission members.\n  The second part of the bill we will be discussing takes 248 \nnominations and expedites them. These are all part time. This might be \nthe Goldwater Scholarship Foundation or the National Council on the \nArts. What it does is create a new procedure in the Senate, where the \nPresident's nomination simply comes to the desk--the President has \nalready vetted this person; the person has to answer the questions of \nthe relevant committee in the Senate--and unless some Senator objects, \nonce that is done, the vote can come to the floor within 10 days. Yet, \nif one Senator objects, all 248 of those nominations can go through the \nfull process. So with those we believe we are, at least, speeding up \nthings.\n  To summarize, for 451 nominations in this bill, we take about 118 \npart-time positions and remove them from advice and consent. These \ninclude, for example, 15 members of the National Board of Education \nSciences, 20 members of the National Museum and Library Services Board, \nand 7 Commissioners of the Mississippi River Commission.\n  I am sure the National Museum and Library Services part-time advisory \nboard does good work for us and for this country, but is it necessary \nfor the Senate to spend its time providing advice and consent on these \npart-time advisory members of the National Museum and Library Services \nBoard when we ought to be reducing the debt, inquiring into the \npolicies of a Cabinet member or working on some other legislation?\n  Then, in the resolution, 248 part-time positions are expedited. As I \nmentioned earlier, nearly 3,000 members of the Public Health Service \nCorps are taken out of the process of advice and consent.\n  Let me speak for just a moment about the other part of the \nlegislation. I talked about how the bill and the resolution will take \n451 of approximately 1,410 Presidential nominees subject to advice and \nconsent and take about half of those and expedite them and take the \nother half and take away the advice and consent requirement, leaving \n1,200 persons whose nominations actually require advice and consent. \nWhat happens to those persons? Let me give an example, and it is a \npersonal example I have repeated on the Senate floor before.\n\n[[Page S4006]]\n\n  In December of 1990, President Bush announced in the White House that \nhe was going to nominate me to be the U.S. Education Secretary. I was \nexcited about that. I was then the President of the University of \nTennessee. I sold my house, my wife and I packed up, and we moved our \nchildren to schools in Washington. I came up here prepared to serve and \nhelp the President be the education President, but I forgot about \nSenate confirmation. I should have known. I should have known because I \nused to work in the Senate years ago. But I forgot about the Senate \nconfirmation and all its splendor. So when I got up here, I was, after \na while, summoned before the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee--on which I now serve--and with my family sitting there, the \nSenator from Ohio, the late Senator Metzenbaum, said: Well, Governor \nAlexander, I have heard some very disturbing things about you, but I \ndon't think I will bring them up here.\n  Well, Senator Kassebaum from Kansas turned around and said: Howard, \nyou did just bring it up so why don't you go ahead and talk about it. I \nsaid: Senator, if you have heard any disturbing things, I would like to \nknow about them because I would like to answer the question. But he \ndecided not to do that, and in his wisdom--and it was his right--\nSenator Metzenbaum held my nomination up for 3\\1/2\\ months. I didn't \nknow what to do about that so I went around and finally saw Senator \nWarren Rudman of New Hampshire and told him the story of what had \nhappened. I said: What is your advice? He said: Keep your mouth shut. \nYou have no cards to play. I said: What do you mean? He said: Let me \ntell you my story. He said President Ford had nominated him to be on--I \nthink it was the Federal Trade Commission in the 1970s. Warren Rudman \nwas then the attorney general of New Hampshire, a well-respected \ncitizen. The Senator from New Hampshire put a secret hold on Warren \nRudman's nomination and so days and weeks went by and no action was \ntaken in the Senate on the attorney general of New Hampshire. He was \ngreatly embarrassed by the whole thing. I said: Well, what did you \nfinally do? He said: Well, I asked the President to withdraw my name. I \nsaid: Is that the end of the story? He said: No. I then ran against the \nso-and-so in the next election and beat him, and that is how I got in \nthe Senate.\n  Well, not every citizen can run for the Senate and defeat the Senator \nwho they think doesn't treat them fairly in the confirmation process. \nBut there is a lot about the confirmation process that can be fixed and \nstill leave all of us with the right to hold up, to vote against, and \nto defeat 1,200 different nominations by the President.\n  Take, for example, what happened in President Obama's first year. \nAccording to news accounts, in March of 2009, there were key vacant \npositions at the Treasury Department--an Assistant Secretary for Tax \nPolicy, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy, the Deputy \nAssistant Secretary for Tax Analysis, the Deputy Assistant Secretary \nfor Tax, Trade and Tariff Policy, and the Deputy Assistant Secretary \nfor International Tax Affairs. The first choice for Deputy Secretary of \nthe Treasury withdrew her name from consideration 4 months after the \nPresident's selection in the biggest economic crisis we had had since \nthe Great Depression.\n  According to one news source, the list of vacancies on the Treasury \nDepartment Web site showed:\n\n       The Main Treasury building is a lonely place, conjuring up \n     visions of Geithner signing dollar bills one by one . . . \n     watering the plants, and answering the phones when he is not \n     crafting a bank rescue plan.\n\n  Of course, there are other career employees available--at least one \nholdover Assistant Secretary and various Czars in the White House. This \nkind of delay actually encourages the unhealthy appointment of Czars in \nthe White House because the President can just do that, but even one of \nthe Czars expressed concern about the slow filling up of the Treasury \nDepartment.\n  Of course, whether you are a Republican or a Democrat and voted for \nPresident Obama or not, you certainly don't want a President whose \nTreasury Secretary isn't equipped to deal with the biggest economic \ncrisis since the Great Depression.\n  The President brought some of this difficulty on himself, and our \nlegislation recognizes that--not just this President but previous \nPresidents and the next President. Part of the President's difficulty \nin filling jobs--and this is one that has afflicted every President \nsince Watergate--is the maze of investigations and forms that \nprospective senior officials must complete and the risk they run of \nthen being trapped and humiliated and disqualified by an unintentional \nand harmless mistake.\n  I voted against Secretary Geithner's nomination because I thought it \nwas a bad example for the man in charge of collecting taxes not to have \npaid them, and I didn't think his excuse for not paying them was \nplausible. But that doesn't mean I think that every minor tax \ndiscrepancy in our Byzantine Tax Code--that reaches 3.7 million words \nand is badly in need of reform--should disqualify any citizen for \npublic office. I think very few Americans with complex tax forms can \nmake their way through our maze of investigations and come out without \na single change in what they did.\n  Take the case of the former mayor of Dallas, Ron Kirk. He was \nPresident Obama's nominee to be the U.S. Trade Representative. \nHeadlines in the newspaper said Kirk paid back taxes. Why? Primarily \nbecause he had failed to list his income and then take a charitable \ndeduction on speaking fees he gave away to charity. Let me say that \nagain. He failed to list his income and then take a charitable \ndeduction on speaking fees he gave away to charity.\n  Common sense suggests Mr. Kirk and his tax adviser did what was \nappropriate. After all, he didn't keep the money. The IRS apparently \nhas a more convoluted rule for dealing with such things. In any event, \nthe matter is so trivial as to be irrelevant to his suitability to be \nthe Trade Representative.\n  Tax audits are only the beginning. There is an FBI full field \ninvestigation. Should we be having FBI field investigations for part-\ntime advisory board members on the Museum Library Corporation? Instead \nof investigating terrorists or catching bank robbers, should we be \npaying FBI agents to go out and ask your neighbors: Does he or she live \nbeyond their means--all this in order to serve on a part-time advisory \nboard for the Federal Government?\n  Then there is the Federal financial disclosures, the White House \nquestionnaire, and of course the questions from the confirming Senate \ncommittee. All these are different, and the definitions they ask for \nare different. An unsuspecting nominee, as I mentioned earlier, might \nactually fill out a form that says what is your income in the same way \neach time, but the question might have been different each time. It is \neasy to make a mistake. Then, when you finally appear before the \nconfirming committee, you are innocent until nominated.\n  Washington, DC, has become the only place where you should hire a \nlawyer, an accountant and an ethics officer before you find a house and \nput your child in school. The motto around here has become ``innocent \nuntil nominated.'' Every legal counsel in the White House since \nPresident Nixon agrees with what I have just said.\n  In the name of effective government, this process ought to be \nchanged. There are some limits as to what we can do in the Senate. We \nhave to respect separation of powers. In the end, the President has to \nconduct his own vetting process and, in the end, the Senate must \nconduct its own investigations. But we might work together to look at \npossible ways of reducing burdens and delays in the appointment \nprocess, and that is what the executive branch working group provided \nfor in our legislation says. It will be chaired by the Director of the \nOffice of Presidential Personnel, and members would include \nrepresentatives from the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of \nGovernment Ethics, the FBI, individuals appointed by the chair who have \nexperience and expertise, individuals from other agencies, and other \nindividuals from previous administrations, and they would report to us \nin 90 days on a smart form. A smart form would simply be a single form \nthat would make it possible for a nominee to answer duplicative vetting \nquestions one time.\n  That makes pretty good common sense. Why can't the government do \nthat? It would submit those findings within 90 days to the President \nfor his\n\n[[Page S4007]]\n\nconsideration and to our relevant Senate committees for our \nconsideration.\n  In addition, Senator Collins has asked the working group within the \nnext 270 days to take a look at the background investigations. A big \npart of the delay in forming a government is the President's own \nbackground investigations.\n  We wish to know if somebody used to be a member of al-Qaida or has \nsome other serious problem before they come into a government, but \nthere are gradations of that. Whether you are Secretary of the Treasury \nor a member of the part-time advisory board might have a little \ndifferent level of vetting, I would think. But in any event, Senator \nCollins wants the working group to report back to the President and to \nus the feasibility, in appropriate circumstances, of using non-FBI \npersonnel to conduct background investigations for Senate-confirmed \npositions.\n  These will simply be reports, an effort between the Senate and the \nExecutive to take a look at streamlining the process so that we can \nstaff the government more quickly, so we can stop wasting so much time \nhere in duplicative ways, so we can stop the expense of that wasted \ntime, and so we can treat with respect the men and women any President \ninvites to become a member of the administration.\n  Since our bill was first drafted, we have made a number of changes in \nresponse to suggestions by our colleagues both on the Democrat and \nRepublican sides of the aisle. I suspect that is one reason why all 100 \nSenators have agreed to allow this bill to come to the floor and to be \ndebated with any relevant amendment, because we are open to that. We \nhave made some changes.\n  For example, I mentioned the 248 expedited part-time appointments. \nThe concern was that while there is a Democratic President, there is a \nrequirement in the law that a minority of those appointees be \nRepublican members of the part-time advisory board. Well, what if a \nDemocratic President said, I am going to appoint Republican members who \nI define as Republicans? We Republicans didn't like that very much. The \nDemocrats wouldn't like it very much if they were on the other side of \nthe fence in another administration. So the solution was this expedited \nprocess whereby we can send those 248 nominations through the Senate \nmuch more quickly; and if a single Senator thinks the President is \nplaying games with minority nominations, he or she can insist that the \nnominee go through the whole advice and consent process. In fact, for \nany reason a single Senator can do that.\n  Another change we have made is to say all relevant amendments are \nopen for debate and for voting. I am hopeful my colleagues will bring \nsome of those to the floor this afternoon and we will begin to debate \nthem, perhaps to vote on them today; if not vote on them today, start \nvoting on them tomorrow.\n  We have also agreed that Senator DeMint, Senator Vitter, and Senator \nCoburn can each offer a specific amendment. I know Senator Schumer has \nbeen meeting with Democratic Senators, just as I have been meeting with \nRepublican Senators, to see if there are any other changes. We will \nhave the amendments. I may oppose them all, I may support them all, but \nat least we will be doing what the Senate ought to do, which is to \nbring them up. If they are good amendments and the majority of us agree \nor 60 of us agree, then we will change the bill and eventually vote on \nthem.\n  Senator Collins mentioned earlier the amount of support we have \ngotten from outside groups who worked on this, and especially from \nthose who once served in the Senate or once served in the White House \nin positions that had to do with personnel. My work with the White \nHouse goes back a long time. I was a young staff aide in the Nixon \nadministration and I was a Cabinet member in the first Bush \nadministration. So I know a lot of the men and women who have been the \ngeneral counsels to Presidents, who have been the personnel directors \nwho watched the process closely.\n  I think it was Boyden Gray who was counsel of the first President \nBush who gave me the phrase ``innocent until nominated.'' But every \nsingle one of those men and women--I don't know of one, without \nexception, who doesn't think the system is broken, who doesn't think we \nare trivializing the advice and consent process of the Senate, who \ndoesn't think we are doing a great disservice to our country and to \nindividuals when we allow this ``innocent until nominated'' syndrome to \npersevere, and they have watched over the last 10 years as very good \nSenators have tried to change this without success.\n  Senator Reid and Senator McConnell, when they were whips, tried to do \nit, and they didn't succeed. Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins \ntried a few years ago. They didn't succeed. Senator Thompson tried to \ndo it when he was chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, and he \ngot a few changes made but not very many. It is only this year in \nresponse to our general discussion about how to make the Senate a more \neffective place, and because of the strong support of Senator Reid and \nSenator McConnell, and because of the battle scars Senator Lieberman \nand Senator Collins have, having tried before and their willingness to \ntry again, that we have gotten to this place. I think we will get to \nwhere we need to go, but I want to make sure that in this debate we \ndon't succumb to the desire to say, oh, well, my committee wants to \nhave this person go through the process of advice and consent for the \nprestige of it.\n  I think it is more important for a new Cabinet member to have an \nappointee who can serve the President and serve the country and do his \nor her job, and then let the Secretary and the Deputy Secretary and the \nUnder Secretary be the ones who are accountable to the President. At \nleast that is the recommendation of former Senator Fred Thompson who \nwas chairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs. That is the \nrecommendation of a task force formed by the Aspen Institute, which \nincluded Senator Bill Frist, our former majority leader, Chuck Robb, a \nDemocratic Senator, Clay Johnson, who was George W. Bush's Director of \nPresidential Personnel, Mack McLarty, who was the White House Chief of \nStaff for Bill Clinton. They all said this urgently needs to be done.\n  Frank Carlucci, the former Secretary of Defense, weighed in with his \nsupport. The Bipartisan Policy Center, including former Secretary of \nAgriculture Dan Glickman, a Democrat, Trent Lott, our former whip and \nmajority leader, Pete Domenici, our former Senator, and Dirk \nKempthorne, former Governor, Cabinet member, and Senator, all urged us \nto do this.\n  Senator Collins asked that all these letters of support be placed in \nthe Record, and so I will not.\n  I would simply conclude by saying there has been a little information \naround that somehow this is legislation to reduce oversight. This is \nlegislation to make oversight more effective. If we were to propose \nusing advice and consent for every Senate staff member, for every \nagricultural extension servicemember, and every forest ranger, that \nwould be less oversight because we wouldn't have time to do anything. \nThat, in effect, is what we are doing now with advice and consent by \nthe bucketload of officer corps members and of part-time advisory \ncommission members whom the President can vet and appoint, and all of \nwhom report to somebody over whom we do have advice and consent \ncontrol.\n  I look forward to this discussion and this debate. I am very grateful \nto my Republican colleagues, some of whom have questions about the \nbill, who have allowed the bill to come forward in the way the Senate \nshould operate. Senators can bring their relevant amendments to the \nfloor as long as they and the Parliamentarian agree they are relevant. \nThey can call it up, we will debate it, and we will either vote on it \nthen or set a time for a vote in the near future.\n  I expect there to be several amendments. I would urge Senators to \ncome to the floor, and hope at the end of the day that we complete \nthese modest but important steps toward making the Senate more \neffective by reducing the trivializing of advice and consent, our \nconstitutional duty, and by reducing the syndrome that Presidential \nnominees are innocent until nominated.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PROHIBITION OF FUNDS FOR OFFICES HEADED BY CZARS.\n\n       (a) Definition.--In this section, the term ``Czar''--\n       (1) means the head of any task force, council, policy \n     office, or similar office established by or at the direction \n     of the President who--\n       (A) is appointed to such position (other than on an interim \n     basis) without the advice and consent of the Senate;\n       (B) is excepted from the competitive service by reason of \n     such position's confidential, policy-determining, policy-\n     making, or policy-advocating character; and\n       (C) performs or delegates functions which (but for the \n     establishment of such task force, council, policy office, or \n     similar office) would be performed or delegated by an \n     individual in a position that the President appoints by and \n     with the advice and consent of the Senate; and\n       (2) does not include--\n       (A) any individual who, before the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, was serving in the position of Assistant Secretary, \n     or an equivalent position, that requires confirmation by and \n     with the advice and consent of the Senate, or a designee; or\n       (B) the Assistant to the President for National Security \n     Affairs.\n       (b) Prohibition of Funds.--Appropriated funds may not be \n     used to pay for any salaries or expenses of any task force, \n     council, policy office within the Executive Office of the \n     President, or similar office--\n\n[[Page S4009]]\n\n       (1) that is established by or at the direction of the \n     President; and\n       (2) the head of which is a Czar.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I thank Senators Paul and Heller and \nGrassley for cosponsoring this amendment, which is about czars--this \nadministration, any administration, usurping the appropriate role and \nauthority of the Senate in the advice and consent process. This is, \nobviously, directly relevant to this legislation.\n  As we debate this legislation designed to reduce the number of \npositions in the government that require Senate confirmation, we should \nalso ensure that the Senate's role is not eroded by unconfirmed Federal \nczars in very significant positions which should be subject to advice \nand consent. That is what my amendment is about. That is what my \namendment would correct.\n  This amendment would ensure that any administration--not just this \none, any administration, Republican, Democrat, other--is prevented from \nusing so-called czars for similar positions to perform duties that are \nthe responsibility of those positions subject to confirmation by \nprohibiting funding of those so-called czar positions. Specifically, \nthe amendment would prohibit funding for these czar positions.\n  The amendment does not unduly restrict Presidential advisory staff. \nWe all agree the President is entitled to direct advisers. Instead, it \nfocuses on ``the head of any task force, council, policy office or \nsimilar office established by or at the direction of the President.'' \nIt is aimed squarely at positions created in order to circumvent the \nadvice and consent role of the Senate. Unfortunately, that is exactly \nwhat has happened at greatly increasing frequency over the last several \nyears.\n  It also carves out of the prohibition and allows two things: No. 1, \nany individuals who are serving in the position of Assistant Secretary \nor the equivalent position that requires Senate confirmation, that \nsituation is living by the normal, appropriate advice and consent \nrequirement. It also carves out the assistant to the President for \nNational Security Affairs, and we include this carve-out simply to \nensure that national security concerns are not impacted.\n\n  As a result of these carefully crafted exemptions, my amendment would \nnot remove the President's ability to have advisory staff and keeps the \nfocus on the intended targets and the real abuses--czars created to \ncircumvent the scrutiny of the Senate and the advice and consent and \nthe confirmation process.\n  Under the current administration, we have seen dramatic increases in \nthis practice--in the amount of power given to these so-called czars \nappointed directly by the President and not subject to advice and \nconsent and confirmation by the Senate.\n  Politico has written that President Obama ``is taking the notion of a \npowerful White House staff to new heights'' and he is creating \n``perhaps the most powerful staff in modern history.''\n  President Obama has created many of these new czar positions. Some \ninclude a climate czar, a health care czar, a pay czar, and more.\n  The power of implementing policy and directing Federal agencies was \nnever meant to be put in these czar positions, subject only to the \ncontrol of the President. That was always meant to be put in high-level \nadministration positions, subject to the advice and consent role of the \nSenate and subject to Senate confirmation.\n  So in this bill, which is all about advice and consent and which is \nall about the confirmation process, we should certainly address the \nsingle biggest problem with that process in the eyes of the American \npeople, which is recent administrations--particularly the current \nadministration--just doing a straight end run around the Constitution, \ntrying to ignore the genius of the Constitution, trying to ignore one \nof the fundamental balances created by the Constitution through Senate \nconfirmation.\n  With that in mind, I urge all my colleagues, Democratic and \nRepublican, to support this Vitter amendment. This isn't an amendment \nagainst the Obama administration; this is an amendment for the advice \nand consent role of the Senate. This is an amendment in support of \nbalance of powers. This is an amendment to preserve the significance of \nthe confirmation process. Every Member of this Senate should be for \nthat, no matter whose administration it is. Unfortunately, this czar \npractice has reached new heights recently, which is all the more reason \nwe need to act. But we need to act to preserve and defend the \nConstitution, to preserve and defend the appropriate role of the Senate \nunder the Constitution, advice and consent and confirmation.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Enumerated Powers Act of 2011\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, in a few minutes, I will offer an \namendment, but first I wish to speak about a bill that myself and 26 \nother Senators have introduced today, and it is called The Enumerated \nPowers Act. Our Founding Fathers understood the only way to preserve \nour freedom for future generations was to limit Federal authority. They \nunderstood the tendency of government to seize increasing power, and \nthus they created protections in our Constitution for posterity.\n  Earlier this year, newly elected and returning Members of the Senate \ntook an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United \nStates. In my case, that oath never mentioned the State of Oklahoma or \nany other State an individual Senator might represent. Rather, the oath \neach of us took was to uphold the Constitution for the betterment of \nthe country as a whole.\n  Yet every day, Members of Congress ignore their oath and the \nprotective principles embodied in the Constitution, trampling both the \nfreedom and the prosperity of the American people. This has never been \nas evident as in the congressional spending spree we have seen over the \nlast 3\\1/2\\ to 4 years.\n  At the beginning of the 111th Congress, our national debt stood at \n$10.6 trillion. Today it is over $14.4 trillion, an increase of nearly \n$4 trillion in the last 3-plus years. How did we get there? How did we \nget into such deep debt? How did we shackle our children and \ngrandchildren to an increasing deficit and an inevitable decreased \nstandard of living? It doesn't lie with any President having done that. \nWhere it lies is with the Congress of the United States.\n  Today, along with the Senator from Kentucky, Dr. Rand Paul, and 23 \nother cosponsors, I am introducing the Enumerated Powers Act. This \nlegislation ensures Members of Congress truly follow article I, section \n8 of the Constitution. That section plainly lists the enumerated powers \ngiven to Congress, of which there are 18, and they are very well \ndefined.\n  One of the major reasons why we are facing such tough economic times \nand such tough fiscal challenges is because Congress routinely in the \nrecent past has ignored this aspect of the Constitution. Until we \nreconnect Congress with its limited and enumerated powers, we will \nnever put our Nation back on a sustainable basis.\n  James Madison stated in Federalist 51:\n\n       If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If \n     angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal \n     controls on government would be necessary. In framing a \n     government which is to be administered by men over men, the \n     great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the \n     government to control the governed; and in the next place, \n     oblige it to control itself.\n\n  Clearly, we have a government administered by men over men, and the \ngovernment has failed to control itself. The best way for the Federal \nGovernment to appropriately restrain itself is for Congress to abide by \nthe enumerated powers of the Constitution.\n  The Supreme Court noted at the beginning of the 21st century:\n\n       Every law enacted by Congress must be based on one or more \n     of its powers enumerated in the Constitution. ``The powers of \n     the legislature are defined and limited; and that those \n     limits may not be mistaken or forgotten, the constitution is \n     written.''\n\n  In an 1831 letter, James Madison also stated:\n\n       With respect to the words ``general welfare''--\n\n  Which is what is so often used to justify new government programs--\n\n\n[[Page S4010]]\n\n\n       I have always regarded them as qualified by the detail of \n     [enumerated] powers connected with them. To take them in a \n     literal and unlimited sense would be a metamorphosis of the \n     Constitution into a character which there is a host of proofs \n     was not contemplated by its creators.\n\n  Moreover, the 10th amendment states:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n\n  In other words, everything outside of those 18 enumerated powers are \nreserved for the States and the people. They are not ours to deal with.\n  Our Founding Fathers intended for the Federal Government to be one of \nlimited powers that cannot encroach on the powers reserved to the \nStates or to the people. What this bill does is highlight the \nimportance of those principles embodied in our Constitution and gives \nMembers of Congress a new procedural tool to stop unconstitutional \nlegislation.\n  A former Representative from Arizona, Congressman John Shadegg, took \nthe lead on this issue starting in 1994, and introduced it every year \nup until he left Congress this last year. I joined Representative \nShadegg in offering this bill, starting in the 110th Congress, and \nagain in the 111th. Today I am delighted, along with these 24 \ncosponsors--and many other Republicans joining me--to reintroduce an \nupdated version of this important legislation.\n  The Enumerated Powers Act requires each act of Congress, bill, and \nresolution to contain a concise explanation of the specific authority \nin the Constitution under which the measure would be enacted. It also \nstates Members cannot merely mindlessly invoke subsections of article \nI, section 8, such as the Commerce, General Welfare, or Necessary and \nProper Clauses to meet that test.\n  The goal of this legislation is to ensure Congress is accountable to \nthe American people for its actions. The very least we can do--if we \nare going to violate article I, section 8--is explain our \nconstitutional basis to the American people for that.\n  With a sufficient two-thirds vote of the Senate, a point of order \nraised against a bill for failure to cite specific constitutional \nauthority for the legislation can still be overcome. However, the \nEnumerated Powers Act requires both Houses of Congress to debate that \npoint of order. The American people need to see the transparency when \nwe violate the Constitution and what our basis is for doing that.\n  As I mentioned earlier, as Members of the Senate, we have each taken \nan oath to uphold the Constitution, not to put our individual States \nfirst. If each of us abides by that oath, we will improve our country \nas a whole. For Oklahoma, Kentucky, Maine, or any other State to fare \nwell in our country, they cannot do so if the country as a whole is not \nfaring well.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 500\n\n  Madam President, let me take a moment and use as an example one of \nthe reasons I would like the Enumerated Powers Act passed, but also why \nI am going to discuss the amendment I have at the desk.\n  Here is what we know right now from the first third of the Federal \nGovernment that was studied by the Government Accountability Office. \nThey just looked at the first third of the Federal Government. We asked \nthem in the last debt limit increase to give us the list of \nduplications of programs that do essentially the same thing across that \nfirst third. We will get the next third about 6 months from now, and \nthe final third a year from then.\n  But what you see and what they came up with is we have more than 100 \ndifferent Federal programs for surface transportation. That is 100 sets \nof agencies. That is 100 sets of bureaucracies. That is mindless and \nthousands upon hundreds of thousands of rules and regulations just on \nsurface transportation. Nobody in Congress knew we had 100 agencies.\n  Teacher quality. We have 82 separate teacher quality programs across \n6 different government agencies. One question is whether that is a \nresponsibility of the Federal Government under the Enumerated Powers \nAct. But to have 82?\n  Or how about economic development. Eighty-eight programs, eighty of \nwhich are under four different agencies. We just had a bill on the \nfloor, the Economic Development Act, and it is one of 80 programs run \nby those four agencies. None of them have metrics to see if they are \neffective. They have anecdotal evidence, but there are no metrics to \nsee if they are. Again, 88 sets of bureaucracies within all these \nagencies--duplication after duplication after duplication.\n  Transportation assistance. Eighty different programs.\n  Financial literacy. A government that is $14 trillion in debt, \nrunning a $1.6 trillion deficit, has no business telling anybody about \nfinancial literacy. Yet we have 56 programs across multiple agencies \nteaching the American people about financial literacy. I think the \nsource of that wisdom is somewhat questionable.\n  We have 47 different job training programs that cost $18 billion a \nyear, run across 9 different agencies. Not one of them has a metric, \nand all but 3 duplicate what the other 44 are doing. Why would we do \nthat? Why would we have all that?\n  Homeless prevention and assistance. We have 20 programs out of the \nFederal Government for homeless prevention and assistance.\n  Food for the hungry. We have 18 separate programs.\n  Disaster response and preparedness through FEMA. We have 17 different \nprograms.\n  So the point is, we got there for two reasons. No. 1, we did not look \nat the enumerated powers; and, No. 2, too often we are trying to fix a \nproblem with great intent, with the right heart, even when it is \nconstitutional and would meet the demands of article I, section 8, and \nwe have no idea what else is out there, so when we see a problem, \nrather than go see what we are doing now, we create a new program.\n  I would ask consideration of my amendment, which is amendment No. \n500, which is an amendment to change the Standing Rules of the Senate. \nWhat it does is it mandates a rule in the Senate that every report that \ncomes to the Senate on every bill or joint resolution shall contain \n``an analysis by the Congressional Research Service to determine if the \nbill or joint resolution creates any new Federal program, office, or \ninitiative that would duplicate or overlap any existing Federal \nprogram, office, or initiative with similar mission, purpose, goals, or \nactivities along with a listing of all of the overlapping or \n[duplication]. . . . '' and ``an explanation provided by the committee \nas to why the creation of each new program, office, or initiative is \nnecessary if a similar program or programs, office or offices, or \ninitiative or initiatives already exist.''\n\n  So it is a rule change. The reason I bring it to this bill is because \nthis is a bill for rule changes. It requires 67 votes for this to pass. \nI understand we have heard some concerns from the Congressional \nResearch Service. But with the work the Government Accountability \nOffice has done, and will do, it will be very easy for them to look at \nthe results of the Government Accountability Office and their list of \nduplications. It is very straightforward. It is less than 100 pages. \nThey can see, and then they can advise the Congress on what we have.\n  If we cannot depend on the Congressional Research Service to tell us \nwhere we have multiple programs when that is available from the \nGovernment Accountability Office, and list what their intentions and \nwhat their budgets are, then we need to relook at the congressional \noffice and what it does.\n  They do great work for me. We ask them for things all the time, and \nthey do great. This is something they can accomplish. It is going to \nget easier as we go forward. But without this knowledge of what we are \nalready doing, we will never solve our problems.\n  I know my chairman has some concerns with this initiative in terms of \nhow it might affect this bill, but I plan on going right back to the \nCongressional Research Service to have a discussion with them after I \nhave been on the floor. But if we cannot do this, we cannot do \nanything. If we cannot change the rules so we actually know what we are \ndoing, so we can actually know if a new bill duplicates something that \nis already operating, when we have this tremendous list--and this shown \non the chart is just a small set of the list. I picked some of the \nobvious\n\n[[Page S4011]]\n\nones. There are hundreds of thousands of duplicate programs in the \nFederal Government, wasting billions if not trillions of dollars every \nyear. So if we cannot do something like this, then what can we do to \nsolve our problems?\n  Knowledge is power. Not knowing what programs are intended to do now \nbefore we create another new program to me is the height of insanity. \nWe should be aggressively asking for as much information as we can get, \nso we know what we are doing when we pass new pieces of legislation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I am not going to take long at this \npoint. I absolutely support the policy behind the amendment offered by \nmy friend and colleague Senator Coburn. In fact, I am a cosponsor of a \nstand-alone bill he has on this issue. My concern is that it is a rules \nchange, and the bill before us is not a rules change. It is not a \nresolution. It is not a rules change. It is legislation.\n  Coming up after this bill is the second half of the nominations \nreform package, and that is a rules change that is coming from the \nRules Committee.\n  My suggestion to my colleague and friend from Oklahoma is that his \namendment would be better directed to the second half than to this \nbill. But, again, I am a cosponsor of his stand-alone bill, so it is \nnot that I object to the policy.\n  I would note for the information of my colleagues, the Congressional \nResearch Service does have concerns about whether it has the resources \nand the ability to carry out the task the Senator would assign it.\n  From my many years of working both with GAO and CRS, this sounds to \nme like a job for GAO, which has the auditors and the experience to do \nthis kind of review and, indeed, has already started due to the good \nSenator's farsighted amendment which became law to identify \nduplication.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bingaman). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will call up my amendment No. 500. I \nalso tell the Senator from Maine, I will very much consider her \nrecommendation in terms of trying to put it on the second half of this. \nBut I wish to call it up now, and then maybe ask that we withdraw it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn], for himself, Mr. \n     McCain, Mr. Burr, and Mr. Paul, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 500.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To prevent the creation of duplicative and overlapping \n                           Federal programs)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     AMENDMENT TO THE STANDING RULES OF THE SENATE.\n\n       Paragraph 11 of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (c), by striking ``and (b)'' and \n     inserting ``(b), and (c)'';\n       (2) by redesignating subparagraph (c) and subparagraph (d); \n     and\n       (3) by inserting after subparagraph (b) the following:\n       ``(c) Each such report shall also contain--\n       ``(1) an analysis by the Congressional Research Service to \n     determine if the bill or joint resolution creates any new \n     Federal program, office, or initiative that would duplicate \n     or overlap any existing Federal program, office, or \n     initiative with similar mission, purpose, goals, or \n     activities along with a listing of all of the overlapping or \n     duplicative Federal program or programs, office or offices, \n     or initiative or initiatives; and\n       ``(2) an explanation provided by the committee as to why \n     the creation of each new program, office, or initiative is \n     necessary if a similar program or programs, office or \n     offices, or initiative or initiatives already exist.''.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Libya\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, yesterday Senator McCain and I introduced a \nresolution with respect to our engagement in a support role in Libya. I \nthink the majority leader is making a determination about exactly when \nthe Senate might consider this. But a number of colleagues on our side \nhave sort of expressed some questions about it, and because of those \nquestions, I thought it was important that we clarify for the record, \nas Senators consider this over the course of the next days, the answers \nto their questions.\n  With that in mind, I am happy to engage in a colloquy now with both \nthe Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, and the Senator from Illinois, \nMr. Durbin. I think Senator Boxer wishes to lead off.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, is it in order for me to ask some \nquestions of the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senators may engage in \na colloquy.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to say to my chairman, whom I sit next to on the \nForeign Relations Committee, how much I admire his work in the arena of \nforeign policy, and everything he has given to become one of the most \ninformed human beings on the planet in terms of the challenges this \ncountry faces.\n  I want to thank him so much for his hard work on a resolution \nregarding Libya. I also want to make sure today, by asking him a couple \nof questions, that the clear intent of this resolution, S. J. Res. 20 \nregarding our engagement in Libya, is that it does not authorize \nwhatsoever, any troops on the ground, any boots on the ground, any \nground forces of America in Libya. So I am going to ask him a couple of \nquestions, and assuming those questions are answered the way I hope \nthey will be, I will be much at peace with this resolution.\n  My understanding from reading this resolution is that while it does \nnot explicitly prohibit the use of U.S. ground forces in Libya, it also \ndoes nothing to authorize the use of U.S. ground forces in Libya. Is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from California, \nfirst of all, I am very appreciative for her generous comments at the \nbeginning of this colloquy. I thank her. I thank her for her support \nand involvement on the committee, which is critical.\n  Secondly, I fully understand and am very sympathetic with the \nconcerns of a lot of Senators, given our engagement in Afghanistan, \nPakistan, the Middle East, Yemen, Africa, and elsewhere. People are \ndeeply concerned about the question of where we are heading. So I would \nanswer her question very directly with respect to the authorization. \nUnequivocally, this resolution does not authorize ground troops with \nrespect to Libya operations. There is no affirmative language in this \nresolution authorizing the use of U.S. ground forces.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator. I also wish to ask this: Although \nthere is no authorization in this resolution for the use of ground \nforces in Libya, for which I am pleased, are there any circumstances \nwhere ground forces could be deployed?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the resolution states that Congress opposes \nthe use of forces on the ground in Libya, except in the exceptional \ncase where they might be needed for the immediate personal defense of \nU.S. government officials or for rescuing a member of the NATO forces \nfrom imminent danger. Those are the only circumstances in which it \nmight be contemplated.\n  The intent of this resolution is to authorize only the very limited \nmission--the continuation of the very limited mission--in Libya that is \na support role, and that does not include the use of U.S. ground \nforces.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have two more questions. If the President decides to \nchange the mission and order the use of U.S. ground forces for reasons \nother\n\n[[Page S4012]]\n\nthan the circumstances previously mentioned, does the chairman agree \nthat nothing in this resolution would authorize him to take that step?\n  Mr. KERRY. I agree.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is my understanding that the authorization provided \nfor under this resolution would expire 1 year after its enactment; is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Senator from California is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to say thank you very much to Chairman John Kerry \nfor his work on this. I also want to thank the others who helped work \non it. I know other Senators did, in addition to Senator McCain. On our \nside, I know Senator Durbin, Senator Cardin, and others had a lot to \nsay. This is important. I so appreciate the Senator's willingness and \nhis staff's willingness to work with us, because words matter, intent \nmatters, and I think we have cleared it up. I am feeling a lot better \nabout this resolution.\n  I yield back my time to Senator Kerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first let me thank my colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer. I want to associate myself with her remarks \nand her colloquy with Senator Kerry, because I believe we are making a \nclear record in the debate of this important resolution relative to \nAmerica's role in Libya. The pointed questions asked by Senator Boxer \nand the responses given by Senator Kerry are consistent with what he \nhas described to me as the legislative intent of this resolution.\n  I am a newcomer to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. This is my \nfirst year serving. I sit way at the end of the table, even though I \nhave been around Congress for a number of years. I want to salute the \nchairman of that committee. I do not think the American people can \nappreciate the hard work Senator Kerry puts into that committee and to \nhis responsibilities with this administration. It is an indication of \nthe trust which he has earned with the President and the Secretary of \nState that he has been called on often to visit important places around \nthe world at very critical moments to represent the United States and \nthe Congress.\n  The trip he made to Pakistan a few weeks ago could not have come at a \nmore important moment. He returned to not only brief the administration \nbut also his colleagues in Congress. I know he will be taking other \njourneys in his capacity with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I \nwant to tell him how much I appreciate it, as all Americans should. I \nalso want to tell him how much I appreciate the effort he put into this \nresolution relative to our assistance to NATO in Libya.\n  If you look back in terms of this debate on the floor of the Senate, \nyou realize it goes back to the origins of America, when the Founding \nFathers sat down and defined what this Congress had the power to do. I \ndo not think they wasted words. Those who will look at article I, \nsection 8, clause 11, will see that Congress is given the authority to \ndeclare war. It is one of the most awesome responsibilities given to \nCongress. But it was clearly given to Congress so, the Founding Fathers \nsaid, we would represent the feelings of the people of America, the \npeople whose children, sons and daughters, and husband and wives would \nbe called into combat, and we would make the decision: Will this \nAmerica go to war?\n  The President as Commander in Chief certainly has authority to defend \nAmerica and Americans, but when it came to involvement in war, Congress \nwas given the constitutional responsibility.\n  Throughout history, many Presidents have honored that clause and have \ncome to Congress asking for the authority to proceed to war. Probably \none of the most notable and historic was Franklin Roosevelt who came \nthe day after Pearl Harbor, in December of 1941, hobbled up to the \nrostrum in the House of Representatives, and declared ``a day that \nwould live in infamy'' and asked for a declaration of war against those \nwho had attacked the United States. It was a clear exercise of \nconstitutional responsibility given to Congress and exercised \naccordingly.\n  After that, though, there was a long period of uncertainty. The so-\ncalled Korean conflict, where two of my brothers served in the U.S. \nNavy, was characterized as a ``police action,'' some action that was \ninspired and authorized by the United Nations. Many men and women died \nin that conflict, but it was not an official declaration of war that \nled to it.\n  Then came the war in Vietnam, where Senator Kerry served with such \ndistinction in the U.S. Navy, literally risking his life in a conflict \nwhere there was no official declaration of war. The controversy that \ncame out of that Vietnam conflict led to proposed legislation called \nthe War Powers Act. The War Powers Act set out to describe in statute \nwhat we believe the Constitution said in its clear language. That is, \nat some point, a President must step forward and say to Congress: We \nneed your authority to go forward with this conflict involving \nhostilities.\n  There have been debates back and forth about whether it was to be \napplied. Some Presidents came here asking for authority. President \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush did before our invasion of Kuwait. George W. \nBush did before the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. But there were \nexceptions also--in Panama, Grenada, Bosnia, and other places.\n  This has been an ongoing battle between the White House--or executive \nbranch--and the Congress about when the President, as Commander in \nChief, has to come to Congress and ask for a declaration of war. It has \nbecome even more complicated because war has changed. There was a time \nin history when the onset of war was very visible: the marching of \ntroops, the weighing of anchors, planes lifting off in flight. You knew \na war was underway. Now we live in a different age--an age of no-fly \nzones, embargoes, predatory drones, and cyber security. The definition \nof war is one we need to look at in this new context.\n  I have felt from the beginning that President Obama handled this \nright in Libya. Senator Kerry and others, like me, were privy to early \nconversations before the decision was made, when the President briefed \nus on what we were setting out to do--stop Qadhafi from massacring his \nown individual citizens in that country, particularly as he said he \nwill march into Benghazi and kill the people of Libya like rats in the \nstreet. President Obama said to us: We cannot let this massacre of \ninnocent people continue.\n  But the President went on to say that the United States will play a \nspecific and limited role in this conflict. First, we come to it at the \ninvitation of the Arab League. This is significant because before the \nUnited States gets involved in anything of a military nature in a \nMuslim nation, we are looking for at least an invitation or cooperation \nfrom Arab nations. In this case, the President had it. Then, he went on \nto say we will use the NATO alliance in Europe to initiate this action, \nand we will support this. We may play a larger role in the beginning of \nthe conflict but a more diminished role as it continues.\n  The President went on to say there will be no ground troops from the \nUnited States committed to Libya. That was the early briefing. Of \ncourse, it has gone on for several months and the question is where it \ngoes from here.\n  I salute Senator Kerry. He has used the War Powers Act to authorize \nwhat the President is doing in Libya. That way there is no question \nabout the authority of the President to go forward, and he has done \nmore. Chairman Kerry has reached out, in a bipartisan fashion, to bring \nin Senators McCain, Kyl, Graham, and others from the Republican side of \nthe aisle, in a bipartisan approval of what we are doing in Libya.\n  I think this is consistent with the Constitution, with the War Powers \nAct, and with the finest traditions of the Senate, where we can fight \nlike cats and dogs night and day on many things, but when it comes to \nthe use of our military and our commitment to the men and women in \nuniform, we do our very best to come together in a bipartisan fashion.\n  What Senator Kerry offers is consistent with that. The answers he \ngave earlier to the questions by Senator Boxer satisfy my concerns that \nthere is no authorization in this resolution for the use of ground \ntroops, other than in the specific example given by Senator Kerry when \nit comes to rescuing government officials and military personnel of the \nNATO alliance. He goes\n\n[[Page S4013]]\n\non to say, in answers to Senator Boxer, that if this President wanted \nto use ground troops, it would take an additional passage of \nlegislation authorizing the President to do so.\n  For the record, President Obama has been clear in his statements. On \nMarch 18, he said:\n\n       I also want to be clear about what we will not be doing. \n     The United States is not going to deploy ground troops into \n     Libya.\n\n  On March 28, he reiterated that point in an address to America when \nhe said:\n\n       I said that America's role would be limited; that we would \n     not put ground troops into Libya; that we would focus our \n     unique capabilities on the front end of the operation and \n     that we would transfer responsibility to our allies and \n     partners. Tonight, we are fulfilling that pledge.\n\n  Finally, the administration's communication with Congress last week \nsummarizes the President's clear public statements against the \ndeployment of U.S. ground troops. That report, entitled ``United States \nActivities in Libya,'' reads, in part:\n\n       As President Obama has clearly stated, our contributions do \n     not include deploying U.S. military ground forces into Libya, \n     with the exception of personnel recovery operations as may be \n     necessary.\n\n  I will close by thanking Senator Kerry for those direct answers to \nSenator Boxer, and I will make one last point before I yield the floor. \nFirst, I thank my colleague from Maryland, Senator Cardin, who has led \nthe way. I was happy to partner with him in this effort to use the War \nPowers Act for approval of this action.\n  There are rumors afloat on Capitol Hill that some on the other side \nof the Rotunda are going to try to stop funding for our military \noperations that are supportive of the NATO alliance in Libya. I \nsincerely hope that does not occur. If that occurs, it will, \nunfortunately, give hope to this dictator, Qadhafi, that he can somehow \nsurvive. It will, unfortunately, undermine the efforts of innocent \npeople in Libya from risking their lives to end his administration and \nbring a new day to that poor, beleaguered country.\n  Finally, it would strike a blow at the NATO alliance, which is \ncritically important for the security of America, Europe, and the \nworld. So I hope the House will follow suit, in a bipartisan fashion, \nand follow this resolution Senator Kerry has authored and brought \nothers together on a bipartisan basis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I wish to begin by thanking the Senator \nfrom Illinois, and I thank him for his generous comments. Much more \nimportant to this effort, I thank him for the serious and entirely \nappropriate consideration he has given this very important issue. He \nhas been a leader in our caucus on making certain the Constitution, \nwhich he read from and cited, has been properly adhered to and lived up \nto by this body, which is our solemn responsibility. After all, we all \ntake an oath when we are sworn in to promise to uphold it. That is \nfirst and foremost.\n  This tension that has existed, as he rightly points out, going back \nto the Vietnam war, is real. President after President has declared \nthat they simply believe the law is unconstitutional, and they don't \nfollow it. President Obama, to his credit, has not asserted that. He \nhas, in fact, written a letter to the Congress in which he said he \nwould not assert that but, rather, he asked us for the appropriate \nauthorization. He did that, I might add, before the 60 days that \nexpired. So it is up to us to be responsible and to do our duty.\n  I thank Senator Durbin for the careful way in which he has taken the \npast slippages or problems, whether inadvertent or advertent, that have \nfollowed the War Powers Act through its history, and we have either \nseen the law not applied or simply ignored. He has been diligent in \ninsisting we have a responsibility we need to live up to. Together with \nSenator Cardin, they have been important voices in helping to structure \nthis resolution and together with Senator McCain, Senator Graham, \nSenator Kyl, and others on the other side of the aisle who have been \nequally committed to making certain we live up to our responsibilities. \nThis has been a bipartisan effort. That is when the Senate works best. \nThat is when our foreign policy, I might add, is strongest.\n  I hope the Senate will have some impact, perhaps, on the thinking in \nthe House. But no matter what, I hope the Senate will have its \nopportunity to be able to be heard with respect to this issue.\n  In response to the remarks of the Senator from Illinois, I wish to \nmake it clear that I agree with the statements he has made. It is the \nclear understanding of the Senate, based on the President's repeated \nstatements, as reflected in the resolution, that U.S. operatives, with \nrespect to Libya operations, will not involve the introduction of \nground troops, with the very narrow exception that I cited earlier to \nthe Senator from California with respect to rescue or grievous, \nimmediate danger to American Government officials--not military but \ngovernment officials. That language is very carefully structured in the \nresolution, where in section 2(a) it says:\n\n       The President is authorized to continue [by virtue of \n     raising the word ``continue,'' we are embracing the current \n     status] the limited use of the United States Armed Forces in \n     Libya, in support of U.S. national security policy interests, \n     as part of the NATO mission to enforce United Nations \n     Security Council resolution 1973, as requested by the \n     Transitional National Council, the Gulf Cooperation Council, \n     and the Arab League.\n\n  This resolution simply authorizes the President to continue the \nlimited support operations in which we are currently engaged in Libya. \nI think the resolution is explicit about what it entails, just as I \nthink it is explicit about what it does not entail.\n  The second to last whereas clause quotes the President in his letter \nto the Senate leadership on May 20 as describing exactly what we are \ndoing in Libya: ``Since April 4, U.S. participation has consisted of: \n(1) Non-kinetic support to the NATO-led operation, including \nintelligence, logistical support, and search and rescue assistance; (2) \naircraft that have assisted in the suppression and destruction of air \ndefenses in support of the no-fly zone; and (3) since April 23, \nprecision strikes by unmanned aerial vehicles against a limited set of \nclearly defined targets in support of the NATO-led coalition's \nefforts;''\n  Listen to those words: Non-kinetic support of the NATO operation and \nsupport of the no-fly zone. Folks, we are not in the lead here--we are \nplaying a supporting role to the NATO mission that is being led by the \nBritish and French.\n  And there is obviously no mention of ground troops in that \ndescription of the U.S. role, because the President has been crystal \nclear that there are not--and will not--be U.S. ground troops deployed \nin Libya.\n  But just so there is not the shadow of doubt on this point, the \nresolution quotes the President from his March 18 address as saying \nthat: The United States ``is not going to deploy ground troops into \nLibya.''\n  And the Senator from Illinois rightly points out, the President made \nthe same point in an address to the Nation on March 28, saying that \n``we would not put ground troops into Libya.''\n  Finally, the materials provided by the administration last week \nunequivocally reiterated this position, saying ``As President Obama has \nclearly stated, our contributions do not include deploying U.S. \nmilitary ground forces into Libya, with the exception of personnel \nrecovery operations as may be necessary.''\n  So I think it should be absolutely clear to Senators that is the \nlimited use of U.S. Armed Forces--with no involvement of ground troops, \nexcept in clearly defined circumstances--that the President authorized \nto continue under this resolution. And moreover, it should be \nabsolutely clear that the President has no intention whatsoever of \nputting ground troops into Libya.\n  But in fact, the resolution actually goes further in reinforcing this \npoint in section 3, which is entitled: Opposition, to the Use of United \nStates Ground Troops. It reads:\n\n       (a) Consistent with the policy and statements of the \n     President of the United States, the Senate does not support \n     deploying, establishing or maintaining the presence of units \n     and members of the United States Armed Forces on the ground \n     in Libya unless the purpose of the presence is limited to the \n     immediate personal defense of United States Government \n     officials (including diplomatic representatives) or to \n     rescuing members of NATO forces from imminent danger.\n\n  So I appreciate the opportunity to make sure Senators are clear on my \nunderstanding of what is being authorized here.\n\n[[Page S4014]]\n\n  Unless the Senator has additional questions, I think we are crystal \nclear about what the resolution says.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to join in the comments of Senator \nDurbin and Senator Kerry. First--and I think Senator Kerry will agree--\nSenator Durbin may be a new member of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nbut he is one of the most thoughtful Members of the Senate on foreign \npolicy issues and many other issues. He has been extremely helpful in \nworking our way through what is the proper responsibility of the Senate \nand the Congress relating to the deployment of our troops.\n  I concur completely in Senator Durbin's comments about Senator Kerry. \nWe are proud of the work Senator Kerry does. He has traveled around the \nworld representing our Nation and advancing the cause and issues of \nfreedom and democracy, giving hope to so many people. We have seen the \nuniversality of democratic aspirations springing up around the world. \nThey look to the United States as a facilitator to make those \naspirations real. He has been an incredible voice in their hopes. We \nthank him for the personal commitment he has made.\n  I thank Senator Kerry and Senator Durbin for their colloquy on this \nissue. I join in their view that we have a responsibility to act \nwhenever our military is placed in harm's way, when the President \ncommits our troops. I think we have a responsibility to act under the \nWar Powers Act. I understand there may be different views about this. \nBut I think most of us agree there is a responsibility for us to pass \nthe resolution.\n  I think the resolution brought forward by Senator Kerry clearly \ncomplies with that responsibility, first and foremost, making it clear \nwe are acting under the authority given to us by the War Powers Act.\n  Second, I appreciate the clarification the Senator made on the record \nabout how this resolution limits the authority of the President, \nconsistent with the current mission, which I think is very important. I \nagree with Senator Durbin that President Obama did the right thing in \ncalling on our military to join the international community. This was a \nmatter in which there was a clear will internationally to stop the \natrocities being committed by Qadhafi on his own innocent people. The \nU.N. Security Council acted by resolution. Many other countries stepped \nforward, and NATO was prepared to take the lead. The United States was \nnot going to have to take the lead. It is required of us to give some \nair support, which we are, in fact, doing.\n  I think the President did the right thing. We want to make sure our \nresolution not only complies with the War Powers Act but makes it \nclear--and it is consistent on the authority given under the U.N. \nResolution--that we are limiting our involvement. Senator Kerry has \nmade that point very clear. It is limited in time, limited to the fact \nthat U.S. ground troops cannot be deployed, except for the limited \ncauses Senator Kerry pointed out. It is clear our authorization is \nconsistent with the NATO mission to enforce Security Council Resolution \n1973, as requested by the Transitional National Council. We have made \nit clear it is continuing the current mission, it is limited in time, \nit is limited in scope, and it is the right and responsible thing for \nus to do as Members of the Senate.\n  I thank Senator Kerry and Senator Durbin for taking the time to \nexplain the intent of the legislation. I think we could not be more \nclear. The President has been very clear, as it relates to the use of \nground troops, and the Senate is very clear that ground troops cannot \nbe interjected into this conflict under the authorization we are given.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield to Senator Kerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and, for the purpose of \nmy colleagues, I will say we will wrap up very quickly.\n  Again, I think I said it earlier, but I want to thank the Senator \nfrom Maryland, whose thoughtful involvement in this and his leadership \nin the caucus has been critical to helping us build a consensus. He \nheads up our Helsinki Commission, travels himself significantly in the \ncause of human rights and carrying America's flag with respect to that, \nand I think he does a superb job. So I am grateful to him for his \ncosponsorship together with Senator Durbin in this initiative, and my \nhope is the Senate will be able to proceed to this relatively rapidly.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, when Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration \nof Independence, he produced an argumentative masterpiece. He announced \nto a candid world that all people--regardless of their circumstances--\nare created free and equal in their natural God-given rights to life, \nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n  After announcing these fundamental principles, this great lawyer then \nturned to proving his case--that King George III and Parliament had \nviolated these principles so repeatedly, and so extensively, that \nAmericans were justified in a revolution that would secure us as a free \nnation committed to the principles of the Declaration.\n  Though it does not compare to the ringing rhetoric of the \nphilosophical commitment to rights in the Declaration, we should not \nforget Jefferson's listing of the colonists' grievances--the long train \nof abuses that justified our revolution against King George.\n  Among those grievances, Jefferson and the Second Continental Congress \nclaimed that the King ``has erected a Multitude of new Offices, and \nsent hither Swarms of Officers to harass our People, and eat out their \nSubstance.'' Since 1776, even before our Constitution was conceived of, \nmuch less written, Americans have resented their subjugation to \nunelected and unaccountable bureaucrats. Americans strove to establish \nan accountable government that left them free to build their own \nfamilies and livelihoods.\n  King George had fair warning. A government that views the people as a \ndraft horse to be exploited for power and resources will be bucked off, \nand that is what the colonists did.\n  Following the Revolution, our Founding Fathers sought to construct a \ngovernment consistent with the principles of the Declaration of \nIndependence. In an effort to keep their new republic accountable to \nthe people, and to provide for the balance of powers between our three \nbranches of government, our forefathers were careful in their \nassignment of powers regarding executive branch personnel in article \nII, Section 2 of our Constitution. In speaking of the powers of the \nPresident, that section reads in part, ``he shall nominate, and by and \nwith the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, \nother public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and \nall other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not \nherein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law:''\n  Let me repeat that.\n  By and with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n  In our country, the people are sovereign, and that sovereignty is \nreflected in the accountability of executive branch officials not only \nto the President but to the people's elected representatives in \nCongress.\n  Even with these constitutional safeguards, we have met with only \nmixed success in making sure that government officials are accountable \nto the people. In remarks originally delivered in 1980, former-Senator \nJames L. Buckley--who also went on to be one of our Nation's great \nappellate court judges here on the DC Circuit--issued the following \nlament about the growing power of government bureaucrats. ``We have, in \nshort, managed to vest these individuals with a degree of authority \nover others that the Founders of the Republic went to great pains to \nprevent anyone from acquiring.''\n  Things have only gotten worse since Senator Buckley gave that \nwarning, and I think that in no small measure this growing lack of \naccountability is reflected in citizens' growing despair, and \noccasional anger, about the responsiveness of their government.\n  That is why I am very surprised that this body is considering \nlegislation that would further eliminate the accountability of roughly \n200 powerful executive branch positions.\n\n[[Page S4015]]\n\n  I can tell you that I am hearing from my constituents on this. For \nthem, this is more than an academic separation of powers, or checks and \nbalances, issue, where Congress further delegates authority to the \nexecutive branch. For them, it is another example of Congress \npermitting the government bureaucracy to operate with less and less \npublic accountability.\n  Quite simply, the Federal Government is massive.\n  And for all of the increases in its size since the founding, for all \nof the traditional powers of the States that it has displaced, the \nincreases of the last few years stand out as historic.\n  Congress passed a $1 trillion stimulus, on a largely partisan basis.\n  It has passed Dodd-Frank, massively burdening our financial and \nbanking sectors with new government mandates.\n  And the icing on the cake was ObamaCare, a $2.6 trillion spending \nbill that has resulted in tens of thousands of pages of regulations \ndrafted secretively by unaccountable Washington bureaucrats.\n  And in this environment, we are urging legislation that would \ndecrease oversight of the executive branch?\n  With a national debt of more than $14 trillion and deficits that have \ntopped $1 trillion in each of the last 3 years, we are ready to give \nthe President greater discretion?\n  We are going to give the administration more freedom to act without \nthe oversight of the people's elected representatives?\n  It is little wonder that the American people are increasingly \nconcluding that no matter what they say or do, Washington won't listen \nto them.\n  Commensurate with the increase in the size of government is the \nemployment by the executive branch of unelected and unconfirmed special \nassistants and advisers with substantial power. These positions are \ncommonly referred to as czars. President Obama is not the first \nPresident to appoint these so-called czars, but over the past few years \ntheir numbers seems to have increased. In a 2009 Washington Post \neditorial, current House Majority Leader Eric Cantor discussed his \nconcerns with the administration's reliance on 32 identified czars who \nhave not been examined by the legislative branch.\n  The legislation before us will only increase the number of executive \nbranch staff that are beyond the scope of effective congressional \noversight.\n  I appreciate the arguments of my colleagues who are promoting this \nlegislation, but I respectfully disagree with their conclusions. \nProponents believe that many of the positions where advice and consent \nis eliminated do not exercise a substantive policy role, have \nresponsibilities that are managerial in nature, or have \nresponsibilities that overlap or are duplicative of those of another \nconfirmed officeholder. I am not able to speak on behalf of other \ncommittees, but as ranking member of the Finance Committee I can say \nthat the Finance Committee was not consulted on this legislation until \nless than a week before the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernment Reform reported its bill.\n  I am concerned that, though well-intentioned, the architects of this \nbill did not have the detailed knowledge of the positions being \nimpacted to determine fully the appropriateness of advice and consent. \nA list of the positions that was circulated by the Rules Committee \nprior to the Homeland Security markup actually misidentified several \nFinance Committee nominees as falling within the jurisdiction of the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, and to my \nknowledge an updated list has not been made available.\n  Chairman Baucus and I sent a letter to the leadership of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee before their markup, and I will ask that the letter \nbe printed in the Record. That letter discusses the impact of this \nlegislation on seven positions currently subject to the Finance \nCommittees jurisdiction, and we both oppose this bill's removal of our \nconstitutional power of advice and consent with respect to these \nnominees.\n  However, the fundamental matter of accountability that we raise in \nthat letter is an issue far broader than the Finance Committee's \njurisdiction. I would like to highlight the position of Assistant \nSecretary for Legislation, and Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs \nat the Department of Health and Human Services. In light of the \ncontroversial passage, and now implementation, of ObamaCare, does it \nreally make sense to relinquish direct oversight over the Assistant \nSecretary of Legislation, a position which, according to the HHS Web \npage, ``is responsible for the development and implementation of the \nDepartment's legislative agenda''? Regardless of how one voted on the \npassage of the health care law, does anyone in this body really think \nthat it makes sense for Congress to deliberately minimize oversight of \nits implementation?\n  Additionally, I know some Members of this body have been concerned \nwith how HHS has publicly discussed health care reform and have taken \nissue with the accuracy of information provided to the public. \nRegardless of whether this applies to any particular Senators, don't \nall of us want to ensure that HHS provides accurate and substantive \ninformation to the public regarding health reform?\n  The Constitution in general terms provides Congress with the vital \nfunction of exercising oversight over the executive branch to ensure \nthat our laws are carried out appropriately.\n  Let me put that another way.\n  The people, in ratifying their Constitution, gave to their elected \nrepresentatives in Congress the solemn duty of supervising the \nadministration of the law.\n  And the constitutional power that guarantees this critical \nresponsibility is the power of Senate confirmation.\n  Some justify the legislation before us on the grounds that the Senate \ntakes too long to process nominations for various reasons. I'm not here \nto say that these claims are totally without merit.\n  However, I am confident that eliminating the constitutional \nrequirement for advice and consent for hundreds of positions is the \nwrong solution. Any issues with the nomination process could and should \nbe handled at the committee level, if not by the Senate as a whole, \nthrough the rules adopted by this Chamber. If some of us believe that \nwe could carry out our responsibilities better, I am open to those \nideas. However, I do believe that each Senate Committee should be able \nto determine how that committee will handle nominees, and then \nreexamine that decision as time passes. Enacting this legislation would \nsignificantly diminish, if not completely destroy, the possibility for \nreexamination of our decisions. If we surrender our jurisdiction over \nhundreds of executive branch positions and turn them into czars, that \ndecision will likely be permanent.\n  The choice we have to make now is whether we will abdicate part of \nour constitutional responsibilities or gives ourselves the opportunity \nto examine how we exercise those responsibilities. Will we share in the \nmadness of King George?\n  Or will we follow the trail blazed by or forefathers, like Thomas \nJefferson?\n  I think it is critical that we recommit ourselves to a government of \nthe people, one that guarantees the representative character of \nexecutive branch officials.\n  For that reason, I will be voting against cloture on the motion to \nproceed to this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous cnosent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 13, 2011.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Government \n         Affairs, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security and Government \n         Affairs, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Lieberman and Ranking Member Collins: We are \n     writing to express our concerns with S. 679, the Presidential \n     Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act of 2011, which we \n     understand the Committee on Homeland Security and Government \n     Affairs will consider at a business meeting on April 13. We \n     understand that if enacted, this bill would eliminate the \n     requirement of Senate confirmation for seven positions \n     appointed by the President that fall within the jurisdiction \n     of the Senate Committee on Finance (Finance Committee).\n\n[[Page S4016]]\n\n     We respectfully request that S. 679 be amended to remove \n     reference to these seven positions, which are: (1) the Deputy \n     Under Secretary/Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs, \n     Department of Treasury; (2) the Assistant Secretary for \n     Public Affairs and Director of Policy Planning, Department of \n     Treasury; (3) the Assistant Secretary for Management and \n     Chief Financial Officer, Department of Treasury; (4) the \n     Treasurer of the United States; (5) the Assistant Secretary \n     for Public Affairs, Department of Health and Human Services \n     (HHS); (6) the Assistant Secretary for Legislation, \n     Department of HHS; and (7) the Commissioner, Administration \n     for Children, Youth, and Families at HHS.\n       While we fully support the bill's goal of ensuring timely \n     confirmation of qualified Presidential nominees, we believe \n     that the seven positions described above fulfill important \n     policy roles that warrant continued Senate confirmation of \n     nominees chosen to fulfill those roles. And maintaining \n     Senate advice and consent for the seven nominees listed above \n     is important to ensure that the Finance Committee can \n     continue to exercise its robust oversight of two cabinet \n     agencies that directly impact the lives of hundreds of \n     millions of Americans.\n       The Treasury Department is responsible for implementing \n     numerous economic programs and collecting revenues on behalf \n     of the United States. HHS is responsible for administering \n     several health-related programs for millions of Americans. \n     Exempting the seven positions covered by S. 679 from Senate \n     confirmation would make it more difficult to exercise \n     effective oversight over the Treasury Department and HHS for \n     the reasons we describe below.\n       First, the Assistant Secretaries of Treasury and HHS for \n     Legislative Affairs advise the Secretaries of these agencies \n     on Congressional input to help formulate policy for their \n     respective agencies. These Assistant Secretaries serve as \n     Congress' conduit to the Treasury Department and HHS. And \n     they are the primary point of contact for Congressional \n     Members and staff, collect Congressional inquiries, and \n     coordinate agency responses. As such, Congress has a direct \n     interest in ensuring that the nominees who fulfill these \n     roles remain accountable to not only the Secretaries of the \n     Treasury and HHS, but also to Congress.\n       Second, the Assistant Secretaries of Treasury and HHS for \n     Public Affairs are responsible for communicating to the media \n     and the public information about the myriad policies and \n     programs implemented by these agencies. It is imperative that \n     these Assistant Secretaries carry out this role in an \n     objective and transparent manner that adequately provides \n     essential information to the public. Given the importance of \n     the media in communicating policy options and shaping public \n     opinion, it is appropriate for the Senate to continue to \n     provide its advice and consent on this position.\n       Third, the job description of the Assistant Secretary of \n     Treasury for Management and Chief Financial Officer notes \n     that the position ``is the principal policy advisor to the \n     Secretary and Deputy Secretary on the development and \n     execution of the budget for the Department of the Treasury \n     and the internal management of the Department and its \n     bureaus.'' Although it may appear that the Assistant \n     Secretary for Management has responsibility for matters that \n     impact only the inner workings of the Treasury Department, \n     this responsibility inherently impacts critical policy \n     decisions. For example, just last week the Assistant \n     Secretary for Management was involved in determining how \n     Treasury would continue essential operations, including the \n     administration of tax collection and tax refunds, in the \n     event of a government shutdown. These decisions immediately \n     impact Treasury's most vital functions and the Senate should \n     continue to confirm a position that carries out this \n     substantive role.\n       Fourth, the Treasurer of the United States also ``serves as \n     a senior advisor and representative of the Treasury on behalf \n     of the Secretary in the areas of community development and \n     public engagement.'' The Treasurer has effective oversight \n     over the U.S. Mint which creates U.S. coins and the Bureau of \n     Engraving and Printing, which prints U.S. currency. And the \n     Treasurer advises the Secretary on important policy decisions \n     such as when the United States should print a new currency. \n     As such, the Treasurer plays a policy role that warrants \n     Senate confirmation.\n       Fifth, S. 679 removes the requirement for Senate \n     confirmation from the Commissioner of the Administration on \n     Children, Youth and Families (Commissioner) at HHS. Although \n     the Commissioner is overseen by the Assistant Secretary of \n     HHS for Children and Families, the Commissioner has direct \n     responsibility for policies and programs dealing with child \n     welfare. These programs are critical not only to Members of \n     the Finance Committee, but also to Members of the Senate as \n     whole. The Members of the Senate have an interest in \n     confirming a position that oversees substantive policy \n     programs affecting millions of American children.\n       For the reasons discussed above, we hope that you will \n     modify any product reported by your Committee such that the \n     seven positions that fall within the jurisdiction Finance \n     Committee are not implicated.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 509.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Portman], for himself, Mr. Udall \n     of New Mexico, and Mr. Cornyn, proposes an amendment numbered \n     509.\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide that the provisions relating to the Assistant \n     Secretary (Comptroller) of the Navy, the Assistant Secretary \n(Comptroller) of the Army, and the Assistant Secretary (Comptroller) of \n     the Air Force, the chief financial officer positions, and the \n   Controller of the Office of Management and Budget shall not take \n                                effect)\n\n       On page 76, after line 6, add the following:\n       (c) Provisions Not Taking Effect.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of this Act, the amendments made by section \n     2(c)(2) through (6), (u), and (ll) shall not take effect.\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer amendment No. 509 \nto the underlying bill, S. 679, which is the Presidential Appointment \nEfficiency and Streamlining Act of 2011. I am pleased to have Senator \nTom Udall and other cosponsors of this bipartisan amendment.\n  The aim of the amendment is very simple and straightforward. It would \npreserve the Senate-confirmed status of our Nation's major chief \nfinancial officers. I appreciate very much the thoughtful efforts \nbehind the underlying legislation that is before us today. I want to \nparticularly commend my colleague, Senator Collins, who is on the \nSenate floor, Senator Lieberman, as well as Senator Alexander and \nSenator Schumer, for their hard work in being sure the nomination \nprocess is streamlined. Having been through the process twice myself, \nit could use some streamlining, and I know they will continue in their \nefforts to reduce even more some of the barriers to public service so \nmany people feel, and I look forward to working with them.\n  Having said that, in terms of the specific issue of the chief \nfinancial officers, I think it would be a mistake to take them out of \nthe confirmation process and a very unwise thing to do at this point in \nour Nation's history when we are facing such serious financial \nchallenges. These are, after all, the chief financial management people \nand the chief budget people in our agencies and departments. We need \nthem right now to be at the highest level possible.\n  Some of my colleagues will recall the Chief Financial Officers Act of \n1990 created or consolidated the financial or executive positions \nacross 23 Federal agencies. It specifically requires Senate \nconfirmation for the 16 most important departmental CFO positions, as \nwell as for the Controller of the Office of Federal Financial \nManagement in the Office of Management and Budget. As Director of the \nOffice of Management and Budget, I worked closely with that individual. \nIt also, by separate law, requires Senate confirmation of the Assistant \nSecretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force who serve as Comptrollers \nfor those military services.\n  In its current form, the legislation before us today would eliminate \nthe statutory requirement that those positions be Senate confirmed. The \nbasic principle behind the CFO Act of 1990 is that an agency's top \nfinancial officer should be a key influential figure in the agency's \ntop management. I believe that principle is more true and urgent today \nthan ever.\n  With our Federal deficits expected to reach over $1.4 trillion this \nyear, diligent and skillful stewardship of taxpayer dollars is more \ncritical than ever, and these CFOs are at the front lines of that \neffort. The nominations reform bill now pending would weaken the \ninstitutional accountability that is currently in law by denying the \nSenate a say and by lowering the stature of these individuals in their \ndepartments. The practical importance of Senate\n\n[[Page S4017]]\n\nconfirmation is that it gives individuals the stature and credibility \nthey often need to do their jobs effectively.\n  I don't believe we want to have a situation in which, for example, \nthe Energy Department's Assistant Secretary for Electricity Delivery \nand Energy Reliability is a Senate-confirmed appointee. Yet the CFO \ndown the hall--who is supposed to be working with this person on his \nbudget, and, frankly, directing this person in terms of financial \nmanagement--is not a Senate-confirmed individual or the Interior \nAssistant Secretary for Water and Science would be a Senate-confirmed \nappointee but not the Interior CFO down the hall.\n  When I served as the Director of OMB, I made it a point to meet \nregularly and personally with the CFOs of our major Cabinet \ndepartments. Their roles are critical, and we should be empowering \nthose individuals and giving them not less but more responsibility. \nThese officials do one of the most important jobs in our government. \nThey are responsible for ensuring the integrity of multibillion-dollar \nagency budgets.\n  I have spoken to CFOs about this amendment, and they make some very \ngood points. In fact, earlier today I spoke to the CFO of one of the \nmajor Cabinet agencies, and he was passionate and very articulate in \ntalking about this issue. As he told me, by law, CFOs oversee the \nfinancial management activities relating to all the programs and \noperations of their agencies, but they also play a lead role in \npreparing the agency budgets and presenting and explaining those \nbudgets to the Congress. Often this is a more political or strategic \nrole than many realize. During program execution, they are responsible \nfor cost management and auditing to detect and eliminate wasteful \nspending, and they are closely involved in determining which programs \nare effective and which programs should be terminated--a tough decision \nin an agency. You want to be sure that person has the stature to make \nthat argument and to be heard.\n  These duties are at the heart of sound financial management but also \nbudget policy and strategy, and I believe we should seek to strengthen \nthese positions not weaken them, particularly given the situation we \nare in with our fiscal problems.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, which simply \npreserves the stature of chief financial officers within Federal \nagencies and the accountability that is made possible through Senate \nadvice and consent.\n  Mr. President, I see one of my colleagues on the Senate floor, and so \nI yield the floor and again urge support of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes \nas if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Second Opinion\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I come to the floor, as I have each week since the \nhealth care law was signed, with a doctor's second opinion about the \nhealth care law because it does seem that each week there is more \ninformation that comes out about this health care law that is \nbothersome to the people of this great country. The more they learn \nabout it, the more concerned they are. And, as Nancy Pelosi said last \nyear: First, you must pass it before you get to find out what is in it. \nWell, the people of this country continue to learn what is in this \nhealth care law, and they continue to be opposed to it.\n  Last Friday, the administration released another round of waivers \nfrom the President's health care law. They issued waivers to another \n117,000 people, a total of 62 new waivers, which brings the total \nwaivers to well over 1,400 covering 3.2 million individuals. What does \nthat mean if they have a waiver? That means they don't have to live \nunder the specifics of the law the President signed.\n  Over 49 percent of these waivers have gone to union employees, to \npeople who get their insurance through union plans. These are many of \nthe people who actually lobbied to support the health care law. So \nisn't it interesting that these are the same people who have come out \nand, after they have read it and found out what is in it, have said: We \ndon't want this to apply to us. And it is interesting because that many \nunion members have gotten these waivers when the number of people in \nthis country who work as members of the union is actually a much \nsmaller percentage.\n  But then let's not forget how the President said in a radio interview \nwhile the 2010 elections were going on that he would remember and would \nreward our friends, he said, and punish our enemies. Well, by issuing \nthese waivers each month, this administration has reminded the American \npeople how flawed the President's health care law is. Waivers have \nturned into a nightmare for this administration.\n  In May, I explained that the waiver recipients got a waiver for 1 \nyear, and they would have to then apply again for a waiver year after \nyear, all the way through 2014 when ObamaCare fully kicks in. We just \nlearned last Friday that the administration is switching course. In \nfact, the Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services just announced \nthat employers and unions, even those with the 1-year waivers, must now \napply again by September of this year for a long-term waiver to take \nthem all the way to 2014. It seems to me this new scheme is designed so \nthe administration can dodge issuing more waivers leading up to the \n2012 Presidential election so the American people aren't reminded month \nafter month of the significant flaws of the health care law. It is \nclear that continuing to issue waivers in 2012 was going to be an \nembarrassment for the President.\n\n  It is also clear that this new change in policy means that even the \nadministration admits that the new health care law does not work. The \nPresident promised--promised all of us in Congress--that if we like the \nhealth insurance plan we have we can keep it. But what he meant was \nthat to keep the coverage that we have today we will need a waiver from \nWashington mandates. We will need to get permission from the Obama \nadministration to keep the insurance we like.\n  Companies and businesses across the country must apply before \nSeptember if they want to avoid the health care law's crushing costs. \nIn my opinion, I think we are going to see a tidal wave of waivers \nbefore this deadline in September. In fact, I predict that 5 million \npeople will eventually have to get waivers from this top-down \ngovernment mandate. There is going to be increased demand for waivers \nas more and more people see that they will lose what they have today. \nAs business owners look into this and see how the health care law will \ncause their cost of providing insurance to go up over the next 2 years, \nthey are going to be lining up for waivers over the next few months. \nOnce again, we are witnessing the horrible economic impacts of this new \nlaw.\n  I also want to talk for a minute about what happens after this \nSeptember deadline, after the door closes on waivers. Let's take a look \nat the economy--9.1 percent unemployment and job creators sitting on \nthe sidelines due to the significant expenses of trying to open a \nbusiness. Hard-working Americans who want to start a new business are \ngoing to be forced to choose between two less desirable choices. No. 1, \nthey can offer high-cost, government-approved health insurance, making \nit much more expensive for them to try to open a new business and hire \nworkers or, No. 2, they will not offer any health coverage because they \ncannot afford the health care law's out-of-touch and expensive \ninsurance mandates.\n  With the skyrocketing debt we are facing in this country and 9.1 \npercent unemployment, this administration's signature piece of \nlegislation, the President's health care law, discourages America's \nbest and brightest from starting new businesses and providing for their \nemployees. That is what the\n\n[[Page S4018]]\n\nPresident's health care law does. It stifles innovation, strangles the \nfree market, and saddles the American people with more debt.\n  Once again, this is another example of how the President's health \ncare policies are making things worse. His policies are making the \neconomy in America worse. His policies are making the standard of \nliving in America worse. His policies are making health care in America \nworse. And his policies are making America's debt worse.\n  Just this week we learned of another enormously expensive error in \nthe law. This has to be what Nancy Pelosi meant when she said: First, \nyou have to pass the bill before you find out what's in it. It turns \nout now the President's health care law will let several million \nmiddle-class people get insurance meant for people with low income. It \nwould allow 3 million, by the estimates--3 million members of the \nmiddle class to receive Medicaid. The Associated Press reported that \nthis would be like letting middle-class families get food stamps. The \nMedicare Chief Actuary, Richard Foster, said the situation keeps him up \nat night.\n  This health care law is not fixable. This health care law is bad for \npatients, it is bad for providers--the nurses and doctors who take care \nof those patients--and it is terrible for the taxpayers of this \ncountry. This health care law needs to be repealed and replaced. That \nis why I come to the Senate floor week after week with a doctor's \nsecond opinion about the President's health care law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 504\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up my amendment No. 504. I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 504.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To strike the provisions relating to the Comptroller of the \n   Army, the Comptroller of the Navy, and the Comptroller of the Air \n                                 Force)\n\n       On page 38, line 19, strike all through page 45, line 16.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I congratulate Senators Schumer and \nAlexander and Collins and others for working through this bipartisan \nlegislation. It is nice to actually have a piece of legislation we can \nwork on together, in this case to help streamline the appointment \nprocess for some of these lower level positions. I congratulate them \nfor their work.\n  I do, however, have an amendment that I think makes an important \ncorrection. I have discussed this with both Senator Alexander and \nothers. I think they understand and they tend to agree that this \namendment is important.\n  Under this bill, the Presidential Appointment Efficiency and \nStreamlining Act of 2011, three important Presidential appointments \nwithin the Department of Defense that are currently Senate-confirmed \npositions would no longer be subject to Senate confirmation. These \npositions within our military departments are aimed at a very important \ngoal; that is, to attain better stewardship of taxpayer dollars by our \nmilitary. I am talking about specifically the Assistant Secretaries of \nFinancial Management for the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force.\n  It is no secret that during these tough budgetary times, when 43 \ncents out of every dollar that the Federal Government spends is \nborrowed money, and we are looking at an impending debt ceiling vote \nsometime probably in July where we are going to be asked to vote to \nincrease the debt ceiling because we have maxed out the Nation's credit \ncard, there is no doubt in my mind we are going to be looking at all \nsources for budgetary cuts and elimination of waste and overspending. I \ndo not suggest for a minute the Department of Defense should be exempt \nfrom that kind of scrutiny. In fact, I think it should be scrutinized. \nBut it is important, if we are going to make sure that every dollar of \ntaxpayer money being spent by the Department of Defense for our \nsecurity is being spent efficiently and well, that the best way we can \ndo that is assure that professionals who are skilled in financial \nmanagement at the various departments of the Navy, Army, and Air Force \nare in place and subject to appropriate oversight by the Senate.\n  These officials oversee financial management processes that involve \nmore than $300 billion in taxpayer money. These are, in fact, the \nbudgets of the military services themselves. None of the military \nservices are currently able to render a clean audit opinion, something \nthat Congress has said must change and will change by the year 2017. \nBut we have been working on the sad reality that, frankly, the \nDepartment of Defense has been spending so much money that it doesn't \neven know where all the money is. We need to change that. We need to \nincrease transparency and accountability.\n  The only way we are going to be able to do that and to put them in a \nposition to produce that clean financial audit is by making sure that \nthe correct type of professionals, well-qualified professionals, are in \nplace.\n  Under the fiscal year 2000 Defense authorization bill, the Department \nof Defense is going to be required to produce those auditable financial \nstatements no later than September 30, 2017. I think most people are \ngoing to be shocked to find out that the Department of Defense cannot \ndo that today, but in fact that is the sad reality. Yet it is my \nunderstanding the Department of Defense is not currently on track to \nmeet this requirement of the law despite the fact that we are 6 years \naway from that deadline. Removing the officials in charge of \naccomplishing this objective from Senate oversight would make it even \nless likely to happen.\n  In accordance with the Chief Financial Officer and Federal Financial \nReform Act of 1990, the so-called CFO Act, these three Assistant \nSecretaries have been designated as the chief financial officers for \ntheir respective branches of the military service. As such, this law \ninvests them with certain financial management functions.\n  These Secretaries formulate, submit, and defend the budgets of these \nmilitary branches to Congress. They also oversee the proper and \neffective use of appropriated funds to accomplish missions and provide \ntimely, accurate, and reliable financial information to enable leaders \nto incorporate cost considerations into their decisionmaking and \nprovide reporting to Congress on the use of appropriated resources.\n  This is a high standard and, unfortunately, one that is not being met \ntoday, but one that Congress must, in the exercise of our stewardship \nover tax dollars and making sure that every dollar is spent efficiently \nin a nonwasteful way--this is a high standard we must insist is met.\n  I believe removing these key positions from the Senate confirmation \nprocess will inadvertently undermine the effort to reform financial \nmanagement at the Department of Defense. I am not alone. We received \ninformal comments from the Department of Defense Comptroller saying \nthat while they agree in principle with S. 679, this underlying \nlegislation with which I also agree in principle goes too far by \neroding the status and ability of these financial managers to manage \nthese dollars.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the comments received from the DOD \nComptroller be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. Let me conclude by saying these three Assistant \nSecretaries should remain Senate-confirmed, Presidential appointees. I \nask my colleagues to support my amendment to ensure they remain Senate \nconfirmable and subject to robust and much needed congressional \noversight.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n            DOD Feedback on Schumer-Alexander Bill (S. 679)\n\n                     (From DoD Comptroller Office)\n\n       The Department of Defense believes that it would be \n     appropriate to reduce the number of government positions \n     subject to Senate confirmation. We therefore agree in \n     principle with Senate Bill 679, which makes such reductions.\n       We disagree, however, with the provision of S. 679 which \n     eliminates Senate confirmation\n\n[[Page S4019]]\n\n     for the Assistant Secretaries (Financial Management and \n     Comptroller) in the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air \n     Force. By downgrading these financial management positions, \n     we believe that S. 679 will erode civilian control of the \n     military with regard to resources. Each of the military \n     departments manages huge amounts of federal dollars, ranging \n     from $166 billion to $216 billion in FY 2012. These sums far \n     exceed the funding for any non-defense federal agency. In the \n     military services, these dollars are managed by the most \n     senior military officers, and the Service Secretaries need to \n     have a Senate-confirmed political appointee to provide \n     appropriate civilian control. This legislation would be a \n     significant step back from the landmark Goldwater-Nichols \n     legislation, which sought to increase civilian control of the \n     military.\n       We also believe that downgrading these three Assistant \n     Secretary positions is inappropriate in view of the focus \n     being placed on improving financial management and achieving \n     auditable financial statements. Congress has established a \n     deadline for achieving auditable financials in each military \n     department and has indicated a strong desire to have the \n     departments comply. The three departmental Assistant \n     Secretaries have the lead responsibility for this challenging \n     task. Downgrading the positions may well slow down efforts to \n     achieve auditable financial statements, an outcome that seems \n     to contradict Congressional priorities.\n       Overall, the Assistant Secretaries have substantial policy \n     making authority over key aspects of defense financial \n     management. For all these reasons, we believe that the three \n     Assistant Secretaries should remain as Senate-confirmed \n     political appointees.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 11:30 a.m. \ntomorrow, Thursday, June 23, the Senate resume consideration of S. 679; \nthat the Vitter amendment No. 499 regarding czars and the DeMint \namendment No. 510 regarding Bureau of Justice Statistics be debated \nconcurrently; that there be up to 30 minutes of debate with Senators \nVitter, DeMint, Reid or designee and McConnell or designee, each \ncontrolling 7\\1/2\\ minutes; that upon the use or yielding back of time \nthe Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Vitter amendment and the \nDeMint amendment in that order; that there be no amendments, motions, \nor points of order in order to either amendment prior to the votes \nother than budget points of order on each and the applicable motions to \nwaive; further, that the motions to reconsider be considered made and \nlaid upon the table; finally, that provisions of the previous order \nregarding amendments remain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Tragically, Michael is the fifth Salem High School graduate \nkilled in action in the war on terror, and the third from his class.\n  Michael is remembered by his family as a devoted father and son. \nFriends described him as hardworking and dedicated to the service of \nothers. It was therefore no surprise when he answered the call to serve \nhis country and protect his fellow Americans.\n  While no words can diminish the loss of this brave New Hampshire son, \nI hope his family can find comfort in knowing that all Americans \nappreciate and respect his heroic service and sacrifice.\n  Michael is survived by his wife Samantha and their two children, \nHailee and Michael at Fort Riley, KS, and his parents Patti and Michael \nB.

Mr. President, 2 years ago today the Washington \nMetropolitan Area Transit Authority experienced the most tragic \nmetrorail accident the Greater Washington region has ever seen. With \ntime, the wounds of this tragedy's survivors continue to heal, but the \nloss and pain will never be forgotten. My heart goes out to the \nfamilies and loved ones of those who lost their lives in the tragic \ncollision of two Metro trains on the Red Line at the Fort Totten \nmetrorail station. My deepest sympathies remain with their families and \nfriends whose lives will forever be affected having lost someone dear \nto them in this tragedy.\n  Last summer, the National Transportation Safety Board, NTSB, and the \nFederal Transit Administration, FTA, concluded their investigations \ninto the crash. The investigations revealed many troubling findings \nwith the operation, maintenance, and management of the metrorail \nsystem, not the least of which is that the June 22, 2009, crash was \nentirely preventable and resulted from systemic failures to address \nongoing track signal problems and a work culture that ignored safety.\n  For several years WMATA failed to respond to or take adequate \noperational safety measures in response to repeated signal failures \nalong the section of track where the accident occurred. During WMATA's \nefforts to fix the problem, Metro refused to heed warnings from the \nsignal manufacturers about using third-party components to repair \nfailed track signal equipment and in doing so prolonged and exacerbated \nthe signal relay problems on the track.\n  These findings coupled with an extensive Federal Transit \nAdministration safety audit that revealed several shocking systemwide \nsafety lapses, which include systemic failures to notify train \noperators about the presence of track maintenance workers on the right-\nof-way in tunnels throughout the system, helped shed light on the \ninexcusable and tragic series of accidents that have taken 12 lives and \ninjured more than 80 people in the last year.\n  I am pleased to say that under new leadership in the general manager \nand CEO position as well as the placement of several new members of the \nboard of directors that Metro is working hard to resolve the safety \nissues that were becoming commonplace in the headlines of area \nnewspapers. Metro's new comprehensive safety plan outlines a number of \nprocedures that are being put in place to improve worker training and \nsafety preparedness and a zero tolerance policy for texting and cell \nphone use by vehicle operators. According to the general manager, every \nMetro employee, including himself, has gone through the safety training \nprogram. Management is clearly making an effort to establish a culture \nof safety that has been absent at Metro for many years. These are \nimportant steps in the right direction but developing safety measures \nfor employees to follow is just one piece of making Metro safer for \nyears to come.\n  There are, however, encouraging and lasting developments at Metro to \nimprove safety. A year ago, the Metro board of directors announced that \nit was placing an order for 428 new 7000 Series railcars. These new \nsafer railcars are in the prototype development phase and when the \norder is fulfilled, all of the remaining 1000 series that have been in \nuse since the system opened in 1976 will finally be replaced. The 1000 \nseries cars have always presented a safety hazard and it is the 1000 \nseries cars that buckled and sheared apart on June 22, 2009, \ncompounding the seriousness and costliness of the Red Line crash. \nRetiring and replacing\n\n[[Page S4020]]\n\nthese cars is a major step in the right direction towards improving the \nsafety of the system.\n  It is also worth noting that for the first time Metrorail cars will \nbe built here in the United States at a rail car manufacturing facility \nin Lincoln, NE.\n  Still, funding shortfalls hinder Metro's ability to make lasting \ninfrastructure repairs and replacements throughout the system. I have \nvisited the Shady Grove Station and witnessed firsthand how they \nliterally are using wood planks and iron rods to prop up crumbling \nstation platforms. Metro is forced to make improvised accommodations to \nkeep the system running in the safest way possible on a diminished \nbudget.\n  Seeing these unaddressed safety issues firsthand, combined with each \npassing revelation of management missteps and safety lapses, has grown \nmy frustration with how Metro handles safety issues, but has also \nhardened my resolve to improve Metro safety.\n  On this somber day of remembrance we as Federal policymakers and the \nWashington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority need to take inspiration \nfrom this tragedy and remember our responsibility to work to improve \nthe safety of the transit system that serves Greater Washington area \nresidents, tens of thousands of Federal workers, and members of the \nstaff of nearly every Senator in this body every day.\n  Last year's Metro tragedy has caused many of us, including the \nPresident, to address the safety crisis that looms at transit \nauthorities across the country. I am confident that we will find a way \nforward through: increased Federal regulatory authority and oversight, \nas called for by the Federal Transit Administration; and increased \nopenness and transparency at WMATA.\n  While the FTA has an established national transit safety program and \nis responsible for setting minimum program safety requirements for the \nStates, the FTA is prohibited by law from establishing enforceable \nnational safety standards, requiring Federal inspections, or dictating \noperating practices. In response to this lapse in public safety policy, \nlast Congress Senators Dodd, Menendez, Mikulski, and I introduced \nlegislation requiring the Transportation Secretary to establish and \nimplement a comprehensive transit public transportation safety program. \nOur legislation from last year would have given the FTA the ability to \ntake decisive actions such as conducting inspections, investigations, \naudits, and examinations of federally funded public transportation \nsystems.\n  It makes sense for public transit systems that receive Federal \nfunding to meet Federal safety requirements set by the FTA. It makes \neven more sense to grant FTA a degree of Federal authority to establish \nsafety guidance over WMATA given Metro's unique relationship to the \nFederal Government.\n  The Washington metrorail system is the second busiest subway system \nin America, carrying as many as 1 million passengers a day. It carries \nthe equivalent of the combined subway ridership of BART in San \nFrancisco, MARTA in Atlanta, and SEPTA in Philadelphia each day.\n  Every workday, Metro provides tens of thousands of Federal employees \nrides to work. During peak ridership, more than 40 percent of riders on \nMetro are Federal employees and 10 percent of the overall ridership \nserves Congress and the Pentagon alone. Metrorail's alignment was \ndesigned to serve the Federal Government, with more than half of the \nsystem's stations located at or near Federal buildings. GSA has also \nestablished guidance that requires all new Federal facilities in the \nGreater Washington area be metrorail accessible.\n  Traffic congestion in the DC metropolitan area is tied with Chicago \nfor the worst in the Nation. Some may wonder how, or even if, \nWashington could function without Metro. Sure enough, in the winter of \n2010 we learned that the Federal Government, in fact, cannot function \nwithout Metro. The Office of Personnel Management based its decision to \nshut down the Federal Government on WMATA's inability to operate above \nground rail lines during the February snowstorms. This not only points \nout the Federal Government's reliance on Metro, but also highlights \nMetro's lack of resources to operate under weather conditions that \nother city transit systems like Chicago, New York, or Boston manage to \ndo so.\n  More than three decades after the first trains started running, the \nsystem is showing severe signs of its age. Sixty percent of the \nMetrorail system is more than 20 years old. The costs of operations, \nmaintenance, and rehabilitation are tremendous.\n  It is not just the responsibility of the local jurisdictions that are \nserved by Metro--Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, DC--but it is also \na Federal responsibility.\n  Just like I believe that the Federal Government has a role in \nensuring the safety of Metro for its riders and employees, I also \nbelieve the Federal Government has a responsibility to help fund the \nsafe operation of the system since Metro provides the Federal \nGovernment and its employees vital transportation service.\n  I was proud to work alongside Senator Barbara Mikulski and Senator \nJim Webb and former Senator John Warner to pass the Federal Rail Safety \nImprovement Act, which was signed into law in October 2008. This law \nauthorizes $1.5 billion over 10 years in Federal funds for Metro's \ngoverning Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority, \nmatched dollar for dollar by the local jurisdictions, for capital \nimprovements. This arrangement will finally provide Metro with the \ndedicated funding the system needs.\n  President Obama's fiscal year 2011 and 2012 budget requests to \nCongress included $150 million for Metro. This builds on the \nsubstantial down payment Senators Mikulski, Webb, Mark Warner, and I \nwere able to secure for Metro in fiscal year 2010, and with the \nintrepid support of Chairmen Murray and Inouye we were able to secure \nthis essential funding for Metro again in fiscal year 2011.\n  While these are important investments, it is not nearly enough to \nfulfill all of Metrorail's obligations. Metro maintains a list of \nready-to-go projects totaling about $530 million and $11 billion in \ncapital funding needs over the next decade.\n  Federal Transit Administrator Peter Rogoff, in testimony before the \nHouse Oversight and Government Reform Committee, made special note of \nthe fact that WMATA does not have a dedicated revenue stream, rather it \nrelies heavily on congressional appropriations which can fluctuate from \nyear to year.\n  Fortunately, Congress has taken an important step forward to remedy \nthis situation. The Senate recently passed a new Metro Compact further \nadvancing the final step in authorizing a 10-year $1.5 billion \nauthorization providing Metro with a dedicated funding stream to ensure \nthe safe and efficient operation of the system.\n  For years, while Metro was a relatively new transit system, Metro was \nthe epitome of safe, reliable, and modern public transit. After 35 \nyears of operation, the results of placing disproportionate resources \ntowards expanding the system rather than attending to growing repairs \nand maintenance needs of the existing infrastructure, Metro's age is \nbeginning to take its toll on the safe operation and functionality of \nthe system.\n  I am hopeful that with the opportunities we have to establish better \nand more consistent funding for Metro, improved and enforceable Federal \nsafety requirements for transit systems across the country, and the \nestablishment of firm, accountable, and transparent leadership at WMATA \nwe will restore the public standing and reputation of ``America's \nSubway System'' as one of the safest and most reliable transit systems \nin the country.\n  I find it unacceptable that the transit system in our Nation's \nCapital does not have enough resources to improve safety and upgrade \nits aging infrastructure.\n  I would again like to extend my deepest sympathies to all those who \nwere affected by this horrific accident, especially to the families and \nloved ones of those who have been killed on Metro. I hope my colleagues \nwill join together with me in working to ensure that this body is doing \neverything it can to prevent similar tragedies in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/22/senate-section/article/S4020-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4020-S4021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           JOINT COMMITTEE ON THE LIBRARY RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to speak on \nS. Res. 212, congratulating the people and Government of Slovenia on \nthe 20th anniversary of their nation's independence. I am pleased that \nthe Senate passed this resolution yesterday by unanimous consent and I \nam grateful to my colleagues Senators Shaheen, Klobuchar, Barrasso, \nBrown of Ohio and Portman for joining with me in submitting this \nresolution.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the Republic of Slovenia holds a very \nspecial place in my heart. Ninety years ago, my mother came to America \nfrom the village of Suha in what is now Slovenia.\n  The modern Republic of Slovenia is only 20 years old. But more than \n1,000 years ago, in what is now the Slovenian state of Carinthia, there \nwas a duke who later served as one of Thomas Jefferson's inspirations \nfor American democracy. What inspired President Jefferson? It was the \ntradition that the dukes of Carinthia could take office only after \nbeing questioned by a simple peasant to test their worthiness. If the \npeasant was satisfied with the answers, then he gently slapped the duke \nas a symbol of accountability to the people. Imagine that: people \nslapping around politicians in a democracy!\n  I have been tremendously impressed by the great strides Slovenia has \nmade since breaking away from Yugoslavia two decades ago. In this short \nperiod of time, Slovenia has become one of the world's most successful \ndemocracies, which I witnessed firsthand during a visit 5 years ago.\n  Slovenia is what you might call an ``overachiever'' among new \nnations. In a short period of time, it has gained entry into NATO and \nthe European Union. Indeed, it has already held the rotating Presidency \nof the EU. Slovenia has built the most successful economy in Central \nand Eastern Europe and has been a force for stability and democratic \nreform in the Balkans.\n  On a personal note, I am especially grateful for the Republic of \nSlovenia's outstanding leadership in the campaign to rid the world of \nlandmines and to assist the victims, especially children. This is a \nhumanitarian mission of profound importance--a mission that I have \nworked on, with many of my colleagues, including Senator Klobuchar and \nformer Senator Voinovich, to secure support from the U.S. Congress.\n  The world looks at Slovenia's success, and wonders: How could a \nnation of just 2 million people accomplish so much in such a short \nperiod of time? As an American, I know the answer.\n  Bear in mind that, when Jefferson wrote the Declaration of \nIndependence, America was also a nation of just 2 million people. Like \nAmericans in 1776, Slovenians in 1991 dared to break away from a much \nlarger and more powerful mother country. Like Americans, Slovenians \npaid in blood for their freedom. Like Americans, Slovenians demanded a \ndemocratic course for their new country.\n\n[[Page S4022]]\n\n  Nine decades ago, my mother left Slovenia--a Slovenia that was \nimpoverished, ruled by autocrats, and dominated by foreign powers; a \nnation that sent forth immigrants desperate to find a better life. \nToday, a free, prosperous, and democratic Slovenia sends forth global \nleaders and humanitarians who are helping to build a better world.\n  This is a magnificent achievement--a testament to the vision, \ncourage, and talents of the Slovenian people. On this proud \nanniversary, I join with all of my colleagues here in the Senate in \nsaluting our friend and ally, the Republic of Slovenia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/22/senate-section/article/S4022-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE OHIO RIVER WAY PADDLEFEST\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Ohio River \nWay, a nonprofit, volunteer-led organization working to promote, \nprotect and celebrate the natural beauty and recreational benefits of \nthe Ohio River.\n  This year is the 10th anniversary of the Annual Ohio River Way \nPaddlefest, the largest paddling event in the country. Each year, \nPaddlefest attracts more than 2,000 paddlers to Cincinnati to canoe and \nkayak down the Ohio River and enjoy the gorgeous natural resources in \nSouthwest Ohio. I have been a regular participant in the canoe races as \npart of Paddlefest and plan to participate again this year.\n  Due in no small part to the efforts of the Ohio River Way and the \nwidespread popularity of Paddlefest, Greater Cincinnati has been \ndesignated as the Paddling Capital of The United States. Cincinnati \nenjoys a great selection of paddling-friendly waterways including the \nOhio, Great Miami, Little Miami, Whitewater and Licking Rivers as well \nas the Four Mile, Caesar, Stonelick, O'Bannon, Indian and White Oak \nCreeks. Additionally, Cincinnati is home to the largest number of \npaddling-access points with more than 25 places to launch canoes and \nkayaks.\n  I congratulate the Ohio River Way on the 10th anniversary of \nPaddlefest and thank Paddlefest chair Brewster Rhodes and the \nhardworking volunteers of the Ohio River Way for the tireless work they \ndo each year to ensure that Paddlefest is an enjoyable experience for \nall participants.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/22/senate-section/article/S4022-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM HAWKINS\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN.

Bill, who is retiring with \ndistinction as the chairman and CEO of Medtronic, has achieved great \nprofessional success through his dedication to and advancement of life-\nsaving innovations. Approximately every 4 seconds, the life of someone \nsomewhere in the world is improved by a Medtronic product or therapy.\n  Medical technology is an important solution to our Nation's health \ncare challenges. Under Bill's leadership, Medtronic has helped to \nmaintain Minnesota's world leadership in medical innovation.\n  Bill has nearly 35 years of career experience in the medical device \nindustry, serving in leadership positions at Novoste Corporation, \nAmerican Home Products, Johnson and Johnson, Guidant Corporation, and \nEli Lilly. He began his medical technology career with Carolina Medical \nElectronics in 1977. While reflecting on his career at Medtronic, he \nrecently said, ``I have seen many product launches--from the ear \nthermometer to the automatic external defibrillator.''\n  He joined Medtronic in 2002 as senior vice president and president of \nthe company's vascular business before serving as corporate president \nand chief operating officer. Bill Hawkins was named chief executive \nofficer of Medtronic in 2007 and assumed the additional role of \nchairman in 2008.\n  Under his guidance, Medtronic's capacity to serve patients extended \nfurther to provide an array of diagnostic, preventive, and chronic \ndisease management solutions. With a breadth and depth of expertise \nacross more than 30 major chronic conditions, he recognized the unique \nposition to play a larger role in the health care industry.\n  In March of 2010, Bill received the Biomedical Engineering Society's \nDistinguished Achievement Award. This award is given to recognize those \nthat have made great contributions to the field of biomedical \nengineering and bioengineering.\n  Mr. Hawkins serves on the Board of Visitors for the Duke University \nSchool of Engineering and the Board of Directors for the Guthrie \nTheater and the University of Minnesota Foundation.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me, his friends, family, and colleagues \nin commending Bill Hawkins on his numerous achievements and wishing him \nwell as he begins a new journey.\n  Congratulations, Bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/22/senate-section/article/S4022-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MARC MILANI\n\n Mr. RUBIO.

A bill to provide for preferential duty treatment to certain \napparel articles of the Philippines; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \ntoday, cosponsored by my colleagues Senator Reid of Nevada, Senator \nBlunt of Missouri, and Senator Akaka of Hawaii, that will provide duty-\nfree treatment to U.S. imports of finished Philippine apparel in return \nfor purchasing and using fabrics and yarns made in the United States. \nThis bill will promptly create an incentivized export market for our \nshrinking textile industry, and create new jobs.\n  The Philippine apparel industry estimates that U.S. fabric sales \nspurred by the SAVE Act could reach potentially hundreds of millions of \ndollars and translate into upwards of 2,000 additional jobs in the \nUnited States fabric mill sector. With almost 99 percent of the U.S. \napparel market now served by imports, U.S. textile manufacturers are \nreliant on export markets for their survival.\n  The SAVE Act is patterned after the Dominican Republic, Central \nAmerica Free Trade Agreement, or CAFTA, which permits tariff-free \nimport of apparel assembled in those countries in return for using \ncotton and manmade fiber fabrics still made in the United States. The \nSAVE Act will provide our textile companies with a new opportunity to \nexport fabrics into the dynamic Asian market.\n\n[[Page S4026]]\n\n  The Philippine apparel manufacturing industry is well established and \nknown for its quality needlework and high-end fashion. It has been \nsupplying top American brands and U.S. retailers for decades. With the \ngrowth of China in apparel production and the end of the quota system, \nPhilippine apparel exports to the United States have dropped by 50 \npercent in the last five years. The Philippine apparel sector is in \ncritical decline, with employment dropping by 75 percent since 2003.\n  The Philippines has been, arguably, our closest and most steadfast \nfriend in Southeast Asia. They were our protectorate and strategic \npartner from the Spanish-American War through World War II. 10,000 \nAmerican and Filipino servicemen died together in the infamous Bataan \nDeath March after our forces were overwhelmed by the Japanese Army in \n1942. More than 100,000 Filipinos then volunteered to fight alongside \nthe United States and under U.S. command.\n  More recently, the United States and the Philippines have partnered \nin successful efforts to combat terrorists in and around their islands. \nCampaigns by the Armed Forces of the Philippines, trained in \ncounterterrorism by U.S. troops, resulted in the deaths of the Abu \nSayyaf leader and his deputy in 2006, as well as two other leaders in \n2010.\n  Our close partnership deserves to be mutually rewarding on an \neconomic level. The SAVE Act would represent the first trade initiative \nwith the Philippines in nearly four decades. Unlike other countries in \nthe region, the United States and the Philippines share a balanced \ntrade relationship. The SAVE Act would continue to build on this \npositive trade relationship and strengthen our economic ties with the \nPhilippines by helping each other reestablish competitive textile \nindustries.\n  The SAVE Act would also allow duty-free treatment for a limited range \nof apparel not using U.S. fabrics so Philippine manufacturers can offer \na complementary product line to U.S. brands and retailers. This \ncategory of apparel, which includes certain lines of coats, dresses, \nskirts, blouses, and infants' wear, will not contain any components \nthat could have been made in the United States. These lines of apparel \nalso will not compete against imports from third countries using U.S. \ncomponents.\n  With the Republic of the Philippines as a partner, we can expect \nproper customs enforcement. We believe the enforcement provisions of \nthe SAVE Act are more rigorous than any comparable bill. At our \nrequest, Customs and Border Patrol, CBP, conducted an informal \ntechnical review of the SAVE bill. With their recommendations included, \nCBP concluded that the SAVE Act can be administered and enforced. The \nPhilippine Department of Trade and Industry then reviewed and agreed to \nall the enforcement provisions.\n  This bill will provide our manufacturers with new export markets and \nprovide mutual benefits to a longstanding and erstwhile friend in \nSoutheast Asia. The Philippines, in my view, should never be relegated \nto secondary consideration even as our focus shifts from one priority \nto another.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1244\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Save Our Industries Act of \n     2011'' or the ``SAVE Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The United States and the Republic of the Philippines \n     (in this Act referred to as the ``Philippines''), a former \n     colony, share deep historical and cultural ties. The \n     Philippines holds enduring political and security \n     significance to the United States. The 2 countries have \n     partnered very successfully in combating terrorism in \n     Southeast Asia.\n       (2) The United States and the Philippines maintain a fair \n     trading relationship that should be expanded to the mutual \n     benefit of both countries. In 2010, United States exports to \n     the Philippines were valued at $7,375,000,000, and United \n     States imports from the Philippines were valued at \n     $7,960,000,000.\n       (3) United States textile exports to the Philippines were \n     valued at just over $48,000,000 in 2010, consisting mostly of \n     industrial, specialty, broadwoven, and nonwoven fabrics. The \n     potential for export growth in this area can sustain and \n     create thousands of jobs.\n       (4) The Philippines' textile and apparel industries, like \n     that of their counterparts in the United States, share the \n     same challenges and risks stemming from the end of the \n     textile and apparel quota system and from the end of United \n     States safe-guards that continued to control apparel imports \n     from the People's Republic of China until January 1, 2009.\n       (5) The United States apparel fabrics industry is heavily \n     dependent on sewing outside the United States, and, for the \n     first time, United States textile manufacturers would have a \n     program that utilizes sewing done in an Asian country. In \n     contrast, most sewing of United States fabric occurs in the \n     Western Hemisphere, with about two-thirds of United States \n     fabric exports presently going to countries that are parties \n     to the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Dominican \n     Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement. \n     Increased demand for United States fabric in Asia will \n     increase opportunities for the United States industry.\n       (6) Apparel producers in the Western Hemisphere are \n     excellent at making basic garments such as T-shirts and \n     standard 5-pocket jeans. However, the needle capability does \n     not exist to make high fashion, more sophisticated garments \n     such as embroidered T-shirts and fashion jeans with \n     embellishments. Such apparel manufacturing is done almost \n     exclusively in Asia.\n       (7) A program that provides preferential duty treatment for \n     certain apparel articles of the Philippines will provide a \n     strong incentive for Philippine apparel manufacturers to use \n     United States fabrics, which will open new opportunities for \n     the United States textile industry and increase opportunities \n     for United States yarn manufacturers. At the same time, the \n     United States would be provided a more diverse range of \n     sourcing opportunities.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to encourage higher levels of trade in textiles and \n     apparel between the United States and the Philippines and \n     enhance the commercial well-being of their respective \n     industries in times of global economic hardship;\n       (2) to enhance and broaden the economic, security, and \n     political ties between the United States and the Philippines;\n       (3) to stimulate economic activity and development \n     throughout the Philippines, including regions such as Manila \n     and Mindanao; and\n       (4) to provide a stepping stone to an eventual free trade \n     agreement between the United States and the Philippines, \n     either bilaterally or as part of a regional agreement.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Classification under the hts.--The term \n     ``classification under the HTS'' means, with respect to an \n     article, the 6-digit subheading or 10-digit statistical \n     reporting number under which the article is classified in the \n     HTS.\n       (2) Dobby woven fabric.--The term ``dobby woven fabric'' \n     means fabric, other than jacquard fabric, woven with the use \n     of a dobby attachment that raises or lowers the warp threads \n     during the weaving process to create patterns including, \n     stripes, and checks and similar designs.\n       (3) Entered.--The term ``entered'' means entered, or \n     withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, in the customs \n     territory of the United States.\n       (4) HTS.--The term ``HTS'' means the Harmonized Tariff \n     Schedule of the United States.\n       (5) Knit-to-shape.--An article is ``knit-to shape'' if 50 \n     percent or more of the exterior surface area of the article \n     is formed by major parts that have been knitted or crocheted \n     directly to the shape used in the article, with no \n     consideration being given to patch pockets, appliques, or the \n     like.

For purposes \n     of this paragraph, false information is material if \n     disclosure of the true information would have meant that the \n     article is or was ineligible for preferential treatment under \n     this section.\n       (i) Proclamation Authority.--The President shall issue a \n     proclamation to carry out this section not later than 60 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.

A bill to provide for the establishment of the Special Envoy \nto Promote Religious Freedom of Religious Minorities in the Near East \nand South Central Asia; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend Senator Carl \nLevin in introducing this legislation to create a new U.S. Department \nof State special envoy for religious minorities in the Middle East.\n  As we observe the political upheavals occurring throughout the \nregion, we need to remember that this region is the birthplace of three \nof the world's major religions. I am particularly interested in \nensuring that the shrinking minority of Christians in places like \nEgypt, Iraq, the West Bank, and Afghanistan receive adequate attention \nby our foreign emissaries.\n  I expect this bill to encourage the State Department to redouble its \nefforts to call attention to all religious minorities and demonstrate \nto leaders in the region that the United States takes religious freedom \nseriously. I am hopeful that as change takes place in many of these \ncountries, they will look to the United States as a model of religious \ntolerance and freedom.\n  I thank my friends in the House of Representatives, Frank Wolf, Anna \nEshoo, Joe Pitts, and many others, for their efforts on this bill's \nHouse companion, which was introduced earlier this year.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \nCapitol and with the Administration to enact this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today Senator Blunt and I have introduced \nthe Near East and South Central Asia Religious Freedom Act of 2011. The \npurpose of this legislation is to establish within the State Department \na special envoy to promote freedom of worship for religious minorities \nin this important region of the world.\n  It is a tragic fact that in many of the nations of the Near East and \nSouth Central Asia, this universal human right, the freedom to worship \nin keeping with one's conscience, is in doubt. I would point my \ncolleagues to the State Department's most recent Report on \nInternational Religious Freedom, published late last year. The report \nconcludes, among other things, that: in Iran, ``government respect for \nreligious freedom in the country continued to deteriorate''; in Iraq, \n``violence conducted by terrorists, extremists, and criminal gangs \nrestricted the free exercise of religion and posed a significant threat \nto the country's vulnerable religious minorities''; in Afghanistan, \nrespect for the rights of religious minorities deteriorated; in \nPakistan organized violence against religious minorities had increased; \nand in Tajikistan the government passed new laws restricting religious \npractice.\n  The legislation we introduce today seeks to combat such abuses by \nplacing a high-level official within the State Department to focus the \nNation's diplomatic efforts on promoting freedom\n\n[[Page S4029]]\n\nof worship. The special envoy would be tasked with promoting religious \nfreedom within the Near East and South Central Asia; monitoring and \ncombating intolerance and incitements to violence against religious \nminorities within the region; and working with the region's governments \nto address laws and practices that infringe on religious freedom.\n  It is in the interest of the United States to promote freedom of \nworship and the rights of religious minorities around the world, and \nespecially in nations where those freedoms are under threat. Such \nviolence is a threat to regional stability in a part of the world where \nU.S. interests are great. Moreover, our support for these universal \nhuman values affirms the principles upon which our own Nation was \nfounded.\n  I thank my colleague from Missouri for joining with me in introducing \nthis important legislation. I urge my colleagues to support our efforts \nto protect the lives and freedoms of religious minorities, and to \npromote the universal values upon which our Nation is built.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of Colorado (for himself, Mr. Risch, Mr. Tester, and \n        Mr. Bennet):\n  S. 1249. A bill to amend the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration \nAct to facilitate the establishment of additional or expanded public \ntarget ranges in certain States; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \nTarget Practice and Marksmanship Training Support Act with the support \nof Senators Risch, Tester, and Bennet. I thank my colleagues for \njoining me in this bipartisan effort.\n  This bill would provide funding flexibility to the states to help \nconstruct and maintain needed public shooting ranges, designated areas \nwhere people can sharpen their marksmanship skills and safely enjoy \nrecreational shooting.\n  For a variety of reasons, the number of places where people can \nsafely engage in recreational shooting and target practicing has \nsteadily dwindled. This includes areas on our public lands. In an \neffort to establish, maintain and promote safe and established areas \nfor such activities, this legislation would allow States to allocate a \ngreater proportion of their Federal wildlife funds for these purposes.\n  Currently, states are allocated funds for a variety of wildlife \npurposes under the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act. This act \nestablished an excise tax on sporting equipment and ammunition that is \nused to fund many state activities, including wildlife restoration and \nhunter education and safety programs. Pittman-Robertson funds can also \nbe used for the development and maintenance of shooting ranges. \nHowever, the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act contains \ncertain restrictions on the use of Pittman-Robertson funds that limit \ntheir effectiveness for establishing and maintaining shooting ranges.\n  The Target Practice and Marksmanship Training Support Act would amend \nthe Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act to adjust certain \nfunding limitations so that States have greater flexibility over the \nuse of funds available for the creation and maintenance of shooting \nranges.\n  To be clear, the bill would not allocate any new funding to the \nconstruction of shooting ranges, it would not raise any fees or taxes, \nnor would it require states to apply their allocated Pittman-Robertson \nfunds to shooting ranges. Instead, by reducing the amount of other \nfunds states would have to raise and allowing states to ``bank'' \nPittman-Robertson funds for 5 years for shooting ranges, the bill gives \nStates greater flexibility to use their existing Pittman-Robertson \nfunds as they think best. Also as a result of this bill, States will be \nable to extend their existing license fee revenue and other State-\ngenerated funds on other important programs, such as wildlife habitat \nconservation.\n  Hunting and recreational shooting are an integral part of the \nColorado way of life, activities that also are appropriate where not \nprohibited on our public lands. This bill is designed to improve the \nquality of the recreational shooting experience by promoting safe, \ndesignated places to shoot. In addition to the improvements this bill \ncontains, it is my hope that the public land management agencies will \ncontinue to work with the States, sportsmen and women, the recreational \nshooting interests, local communities, and others so that these \nopportunities are safe and available.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1249\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Target Practice and \n     Marksmanship Training Support Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the use of firearms and archery equipment for target \n     practice and marksmanship training activities on Federal land \n     is allowed, except to the extent specific portions of that \n     land have been closed to those activities;\n       (2) in recent years preceding the date of enactment of this \n     Act, portions of Federal land have been closed to target \n     practice and marksmanship training for many reasons;\n       (3) the availability of public target ranges on non-Federal \n     land has been declining for a variety of reasons, including \n     continued population growth and development near former \n     ranges;\n       (4) providing opportunities for target practice and \n     marksmanship training at public target ranges on Federal and \n     non-Federal land can help--\n       (A) to promote enjoyment of shooting, recreational, and \n     hunting activities; and\n       (B) to ensure safe and convenient locations for those \n     activities;\n       (5) Federal law in effect on the date of enactment of this \n     Act, including the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act \n     (16 U.S.C. 669 et seq.), provides Federal support for \n     construction and expansion of public target ranges by making \n     available to States amounts that may be used for \n     construction, operation, and maintenance of public target \n     ranges; and\n       (6) it is in the public interest to provide increased \n     Federal support to facilitate the construction or expansion \n     of public target ranges.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to facilitate the \n     construction and expansion of public target ranges, including \n     ranges on Federal land managed by the Forest Service and the \n     Bureau of Land Management.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF PUBLIC TARGET RANGE.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``public target range'' means a \n     specific location that--\n       (1) is identified by a governmental agency for recreational \n     shooting;\n       (2) is open to the public;\n       (3) may be supervised; and\n       (4) may accommodate archery or rifle, pistol, or shotgun \n     shooting.\n\n     SEC. 4.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING COOPERATION.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that, consistent with \n     applicable laws and regulations, the Chief of the Forest \n     Service and the Director of the Bureau of Land Management \n     should cooperate with State and local authorities and other \n     entities to carry out waste removal and other activities on \n     any Federal land used as a public target range to encourage \n     continued use of that land for target practice or \n     marksmanship training.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 1257. A bill establish grant programs to improve the health of \nborder area residents and for all hazards preparedness in the border \narea including bioterrorism and infectious disease, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Border \nHealth Security Act of 2011.\n  This legislation is designed to make several important changes to \ncurrent law to address pressing public health challenges along the \nU.S.-Mexico border.\n  In 1993, along with Senators Hutchison and McCain, I introduced the \noriginal United States-Mexico Border Health Commission Act. With the \nsupport of Members from both chambers, and from both parties, we passed \nthis landmark legislation, which was signed into law in 1994 by \nPresident Clinton. I was gratified when the bi-national agreement to \nestablish the Commission was signed in 2000. And, I have monitored with \ninterest the important work of the U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission \nin the years since.\n  As the Commission enters its second decade, the problems it seeks to \ndeal with are no less pressing than those we originally set out to \ntackle with the Border Health Commission Act.\n  Health disparities and chronic diseases for the over 14 million \npeople who live in the border region, comprised of two sovereign \nnations, 25 Native American tribes, and four states in the United \nStates and six states in Mexico, remain at unacceptable levels, far \noutpacing rates in most of the United States. Far too many border \nresidents remain uninsured. Texas and New Mexico, for instance, rank \nfirst and fifth, respectively, in the percentage of residents who are \nuninsured. Many who live in the region still do not have access to \nadequate primary, preventive, and specialty care. If the border region \nwere considered a state, it would rank at or near the bottom on many \nkey health indicators, such as rates of tuberculosis, hepatitis, \ndiabetes, and access to health professionals. Compounding all these \nproblems are high rates of poverty; three of the ten poorest counties \nin the United States are located in the border area.\n  In addition, communicable diseases that can easily travel across \nborders, such as tuberculosis and H1N1, strain our border's public \nhealth systems. Amplifying our public health surveillance efforts at \nour border can help mitigate the impact of such diseases, as well as \nother bio-security threats, in the rest of the nation.\n  I believe, just as I did when I introduced the original legislation, \nthat the public health problems the border region faces are truly bi-\nnational in nature. As such, they demand a truly bi-national public \nhealth architecture. Over the last 11 years, the U.S.-Mexico Border \nHealth Commission has provided this structure as it worked to address \nthese issues. It has had a number of successes, including notable \nconferences and reports on infectious disease surveillance, childhood \nobesity, and tuberculosis, developed jointly by both its U.S. and \nMexican members. Its programs were particularly helpful as we \ncoordinated our response to the H1N1 pandemic in 2009.\n  Still, the public health challenges in the border remain great. As \nthe Commission enters into its second decade, this bipartisan \nlegislation will strengthen the capacity of the Commission and \nauthorize appropriate federal resources for its important work.\n  The legislation does this in several ways. First, through a new grant \nprogram, it authorizes additional funding to improve the \ninfrastructure, access, and the delivery of health care services along \nthe entire U.S.-Mexico border.\n  These grants would be flexible and allow the individual communities \nto establish their own priorities with which to spend these funds for \nthe following range of purposes: maternal and child health, primary \ncare and preventative health, public health and public health \ninfrastructure, health promotion, oral health, behavioral and mental \nhealth, substance abuse, health conditions that have a high prevalence \nin the border region, medical and health services research, community \nhealth workers or promotoras, health care infrastructure, including \nplanning and construction grants, health disparities, environmental \nhealth, health education, and research.\n  Second, it authorizes new, funding for the successful Early Warning \nInfectious Disease Surveillance, EWIDS, program in the U.S.-Mexico \nborder region. EWIDS is designed to bolster preparedness for \nbioterrorism and infectious disease. The legislation also establishes a \nhealth alert network to identify and communicate information quickly to \nhealth providers about emerging health care threats. It requires the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services and the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to coordinate this system.\n  Third, it strengthens the capacity of the U.S.-Mexico Border Health \nCommission by undertaking several key organizational reforms.\n  Finally, the legislation encourages more coordination, \nrecommendations, and study of these complex border health challenges. \nThe bill affirms the need for integrated efforts across national, \nfederal, state and local agencies to properly address border health \nissues. It specifies that recommendations and advice on how to improve \nborder health will be communicated to Congress. Further, the \nlegislation authorizes two key studies conducted by the Institute of \nMedicine: the first on bi-national health infrastructure and a second \non health insurance coverage for border residents. A total of $31 \nmillion is authorized to carry out the act.\n  Without the changes and resources this legislation envisions, border \nresidents will continue to lag behind the United States in many key \nindicators of good public health. Without this bill, both of our \ncountries will be less prepared when the next bi-national health \nsecurity threat hits.\n  I would like to thank Senator Hutchison, who was an original \ncosponsor of the U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission legislation, \nPublic Law 103-400, that we passed in 1994 and is the lead cosponsor of \nthis legislation today. She has also been the lead Senator in getting \nfunding for the U.S.-\n\n[[Page S4031]]\n\nMexico Border Health Commission since its inception.\n  I urge the adoption of this bipartisan legislation by this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1257\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Border Health Security Act \n     of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States-Mexico border is an interdependent \n     and dynamic region of 14,538,209 people with significant and \n     unique public health challenges.\n       (2) These challenges include low rates of health insurance \n     coverage, poor access to health care services, and high rates \n     of dangerous diseases, such as tuberculosis, diabetes, and \n     obesity.\n       (3) As the 2009 novel influenza A (H1N1) outbreak \n     illustrates, diseases do not respect international \n     boundaries, therefore, a strong public health effort at and \n     along the U.S.-Mexico border is crucial to not only protect \n     and improve the health of Americans but also to help secure \n     the country against biosecurity threats.\n       (4) For 11 years, the United States-Mexico Border Health \n     Commission has served as a crucial bi-national institution to \n     address these unique and truly cross-border health issues.\n       (5) Two initiatives resulting from the United States-Mexico \n     Border Health Commission's work speak to the importance of an \n     infrastructure that facilitates cross border communication at \n     the ground level. First, the Early Warning Infectious Disease \n     Surveillance (EWIDS), started in 2004, surveys infectious \n     diseases passing among border States allowing for early \n     detection and intervention. Second, the Ventanillas de Salud \n     program, allows Mexican consulates, in collaboration with \n     United States nonprofit health organizations, to provide \n     information and education to Mexican citizens living and \n     working in the United States through a combination of Mexican \n     state funds and private grants. This program reaches an \n     estimated 1,500,000 people in the United States.\n       (6) As the United States-Mexico Border Health Commission \n     enters its second decade, and as these issues grow in number \n     and complexity, the Commission requires additional resources \n     and modifications which will allow it to provide stronger \n     leadership to optimize health and quality of life along the \n     United States-Mexico border.\n\n     SEC. 3. UNITED STATES-MEXICO BORDER HEALTH COMMISSION ACT \n                   AMENDMENTS.\n\n       The United States-Mexico Border Health Commission Act (22 \n     U.S.C. 290n et seq.) is amended--\n       (1) in section 3--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (B) in paragraph (2), by striking the period and inserting \n     ``; and''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) to serve as an independent and objective body to both \n     recommend and implement initiatives that solve border health \n     issues'';\n       (2) in section 5--\n       (A) in subsection (b), by striking ``should be the leader'' \n     and inserting ``shall be the Chair''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(d) Providing Advice and Recommendations to Congress.--A \n     member of the Commission may at any time provide advice or \n     recommendations to Congress concerning issues that are \n     considered by the Commission.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Trafficking Victims Enhanced \n     Protection Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) There are as many as 300,000 child soldiers in use by \n     state-run armies, paramilitaries, and guerilla groups in \n     roughly 21 countries around the world and in almost every \n     region of the world.\n       (2) The 2010 Trafficking in Persons Report defines a child \n     soldier as any person under 18 years of age who directly \n     takes part in hostilities, has been compulsorily or \n     voluntarily recruited as a member of a government's armed \n     forces, or has been recruited or used in hostilities by armed \n     forces distinct from the armed forces of a state.\n       (3) Children are used as soldiers, combatants, spies, \n     scouts, decoys, guards, cooks, human mine detectors, and even \n     sex slaves, robbing them of their childhood. Children are \n     forced to join such groups physically, economically, or \n     socially, or lured with promises of food, money, or security.\n       (4) Exploitation of these children leaves them stigmatized \n     and traumatized. Children also suffer higher mortality, \n     disease, and injury rates in combat situations than adults, \n     putting their health and lives at risk.\n       (5) The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection \n     Reauthorization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-457) prohibits \n     the provision of International Military Education and \n     Training (IMET) and Foreign Military Funds (FMF) assistance \n     to countries found to use child soldiers.\n       (6) The first report required under WTVPRA, published in \n     2010, identified 6 countries found to use child soldiers: \n     Burma, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), \n     Sudan, Yemen, and Chad.\n       (7) On October 25, 2010, President Barack Obama exercised \n     his waiver authority for 4 of the 6 countries to include the \n     Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Sudan, Yemen, and Chad, \n     which allowed the United States Government to provide both \n     IMET and FMF funding to these countries.\n       (8) United States peacekeeping funds that were not \n     restricted in the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims \n     Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 have been provided to \n     Somalia, despite the use of child soldiers in that country \n     and United States efforts to halt such practices.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``College Literacy in Finance \n     and Economics Act of 2011'' or the ``College LIFE Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Student borrowing is widespread in higher education, \n     and more than $100,000,000,000 in Federal education loans are \n     originated each year. In 2008, 62 percent of recipients of a \n     baccalaureate degree graduated with student debt.\n       (2) Forty-eight percent of students at 4-year public \n     institutions of higher education borrow money to pay for \n     college, as do 57 percent of students at 4-year private \n     institutions of higher education, and 96 percent of students \n     at for-profit institutions of higher education.\n       (3) In 2008, 92 percent of Black students, 85 percent of \n     Hispanic students, 85 percent of American Indian/Alaska \n     Native students, 82 percent of multi-racial students, 80 \n     percent of Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander students, 77 \n     percent of White students, and 68 percent of Asian students \n     received financial aid.\n       (4) Students depart from institutions of higher education \n     with significant debt. In 2008, the average student loan debt \n     among graduates of institutions of higher education was \n     $23,186, and 1 in 10 recipients of a baccalaureate degree \n     graduated at least $40,000 in debt. In 2008, 57 percent of \n     recipients of a baccalaureate degree from a for-profit \n     institution of higher education owed more than $30,000, and \n     the median amount of debt was $32,700. Since 2003, the \n     average cumulative debt among students at institutions of \n     higher education has increased by 5.6 percent each year.\n       (5) Students enrolled in for-profit institutions of higher \n     education account for 47 percent of all student loan \n     defaults, despite representing approximately 10 percent of \n     all\n\n[[Page S4033]]\n\n     students enrolled in institutions of higher education. Since \n     2003, the national cohort default rate has increased from 4.5 \n     percent to 7 percent.\n       (6) Students rely on access to credit. Fifty-six percent of \n     dependent students at institutions of higher education had a \n     credit card in their own name in 2004. The average credit \n     card balance among such students who were carrying a balance \n     on their cards was $2,000.\n       (7) According to the National Foundation for Credit \n     Counseling, the majority of adults (56 percent of adults in \n     the United States, or 127,000,000 people) do not have a \n     budget or keep close track of expenses or spending.\n       (8) According to a 2009 National Bankruptcy Research Center \n     study, consumers who received financial education through \n     pre-bankruptcy counseling had 27.5 percent fewer delinquent \n     accounts and remained current on their accounts for 29 \n     percent longer.\n       (9) According to the Financial Industry Regulatory \n     Authority Investor Education Foundation, less than one-third \n     of young adults (ages 18 to 29) set aside emergency savings \n     to weather unexpected financial challenges.\n       (10) According to a Jump$tart Coalition for Personal \n     Financial Literacy survey, 62 percent of high school students \n     cannot pass a basic personal finance exam, and financial \n     literacy scores among future higher education students are \n     low.\n       (11) According to research by the National Endowment for \n     Financial Education and the University of Arizona, schools \n     are the institutions that students trust most to help \n     increase their knowledge of personal finance.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINANCIAL LITERACY COUNSELING.\n\n       Section 485 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     1092) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(n) Financial Literacy Counseling.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Each eligible institution shall provide \n     financial literacy counseling to student borrowers in \n     accordance with the requirements of this subsection, \n     through--\n       ``(A) financial aid offices;\n       ``(B) an employee or group of employees designated under \n     subsection (c); or\n       ``(C) a partnership with a nonprofit organization that has \n     substantial experience developing or administering financial \n     literacy and economic education curricula, which may include \n     an organization that has received grant funding under the \n     Excellence in Economic Education Act of 2001 (20 U.S.C. 7267 \n     et seq.).\n       ``(2) Entrance and exit counseling required.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Financial literacy counseling, as \n     required under this subsection, shall be provided to student \n     borrowers on the following 2 occasions:\n       ``(i) Entrance counseling.--Such counseling shall be \n     provided not later than 45 days after the first disbursement \n     of a borrower's first loan that is made, insured, or \n     guaranteed under part B, made under part D, or made under \n     part E.
