Mr. President, shortly the Senate will vote on the \nconfirmation of Richard Cordray to lead the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau. Again, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I \nstress ``consumer.'' By now we all know my Republican colleagues will \nfilibuster Mr. Cordray's nomination. They said they will. This is not \nan up-or-down vote. In the Republicans' effort to not allow this vote, \nthey are stopping a vote on this very qualified man.\n  They are not blocking this nomination because of any fault, real or \nperceived, in this candidate. He has bipartisan support and is \neminently qualified. He has a long history of protecting consumers \nagainst the unfair practice of financial predators. He currently serves \nas chief of enforcement at the Bureau.\n  Before that, Mr. Cordray served as Ohio's attorney general, a very \nimportant job in a very heavily populated State. While there, he \nrecovered billions of dollars from pension funds on behalf of retirees, \ninvestors, and others. He took action against fraudulent foreclosures \nand predatory lending. He is qualified, and he is a man of diligence.\n  The Republicans are blocking his nomination and not allowing a vote \nbecause they don't like the Federal agency he would lead, an agency \nestablished by law. This is the first time in the Senate's history that \na party has blocked a qualified candidate solely because they disagreed \nwith the existence of an agency that has been created by law.\n  Republicans are doing this to undermine the system of law we have in \nour country. Democrats fought to pass Wall Street reform last year to \nprotect against the greed of big banks. Well, without a director, the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau doesn't have the tools it needs to \nget the job done. It is shocking that despite the economic crash in our \nrearview mirror--it is easy to look back and see what happened because \nof Wall Street greed--Republicans, in spite of that, would leave \nconsumers without a watchdog to guard against the greed of Wall Street. \nThat is unfortunate.\n  Would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n[[Page S8422]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/08/senate-section/article/S8422-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8422-S8429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   NOMINATION OF RICHARD CORDRAY TO BE DIRECTOR, BUREAU OF CONSUMER \n                          FINANCIAL PROTECTION\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Richard \nCordray, of Ohio, to be Director, Bureau of Consumer Financial \nProtection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 10:30 a.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  Mr. REID. I ask that a quorum be called and the time be equally \ndivided between the two sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. This morning the Senate will vote whether the new \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau should be able to put a director \nin place before concerns about its accountability to the American \npeople are addressed. Let me stress that is all today's vote is about. \nToday's vote is about accountability and transparency. It is a debate \nabout whether we think Americans need more oversight over Washington or \nless.\n  Republicans made our position clear more than 7 months ago when 44 of \nus signed a letter saying we will not support a nominee for this \nBureau, no matter who the President is, until three commonsense \nconditions are met that would bring some transparency and \naccountability to the CFPB. That letter now has 45 signatories.\n  The President knew about these concerns months ago and he chose to \ndismiss them. Now he is suddenly making a push to confirm his nominee \nbecause it fits into some picture he wants to paint about who the good \nguys are and who the bad guys are here in Washington. So, once again, \nDemocrats are using the Senate floor this week to stage a little \npolitical theater. They are setting up a vote they know will fail so \nthey can act shocked about it later. This is what passes for leadership \nat the White House right now.\n  The President has made his choice about how to deal with this issue, \nand we have made ours. What we have said is that until this or any \nother President addresses these legitimate concerns, we cannot and will \nnot support a nominee. Here is what we said in that letter 7 months \nago: First, replace the single Director with a board of directors who \nwould oversee the Bureau. Second, subject the Bureau to the \ncongressional appropriations process. Third, allow other financial \nregulators to provide a check on CFPB rules so they don't imperil the \nhealth of financial institutions and lead to unnecessary bank failures.\n  Look, everybody supports strong and effective oversight, but that has \nto include the overseers as well. Unelected bureaucrats must be held \naccountable to the American people, and that is exactly what our \nproposal would do. So it is up to the President. Republicans have \noutlined our concerns and they are well known. We are not going to let \nthe President put another unelected czar in place, unaccountable to the \nAmerican people. And, frankly, his refusal to work with us only deepens \nour concerns. The CFPB requires reforms before any nominee can be \nconfirmed. It is time the President takes these concerns seriously.\n  I look forward to hearing from the President on this issue so we can \nput in place the kind of oversight and accountability the American \npeople expect in an agency of this size and this scope. Until then, I \nwill vote against this nominee for the CFPB and any others that this or \nany other President sends until he works to fix the problems, until he \nbrings transparency to this bureaucracy and accountability to the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the motion \nto invoke cloture on the nomination of Richard Cordray to be the \nDirector of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.\n  Earlier this year, I and 44 of my colleagues sent a letter to the \nPresident expressing our concerns with the unaccountable structure of \nthe Bureau. It is now 7 months later and the President has yet to \nrespond.\n  The majority has called for a vote they know will fail today. It is \nevident the White House and the majority have decided to place politics \nahead of good policy. They have chosen to fabricate a political issue \nrather than do what is in the best interests of consumers. Nonetheless, \nthey claim this debate is about consumer protection.\n  There is no disagreement, however, that consumer protection, as the \nActing President pro tempore knows, needs to be enhanced. The only real \npoint of contention is whether the new Bureau of Consumer Financial \nProtection will be accountable to the American people.\n  If we believe regulators never fail, then the current structure of \nthe Bureau is just fine. Yet we all know regulators do fail and their \nfailures harm consumers.\n  Members of the majority, I believe, have repeatedly made this point \nwith their criticism of the Fed's failure to regulate subprime \nmortgages and the OCC's preemption of State consumer protection laws.\n  I strongly agree with the majority that our regulators failed to do \ntheir jobs in the lead-up to the financial crisis. But the lesson we \nshould learn from the financial crisis is not that we need more \nunaccountable regulators. Instead, all of our financial regulators need \nto be held more accountable.\n  Just as banks should be held accountable for their failures, \nregulators should also be held accountable for theirs. After all, if \nregulators know Congress can hold them accountable, they will have a \nfar stronger incentive to do their jobs. That will be good, as we all \nknow, for consumers. That is why, if the Bureau is reformed, the \nbiggest winners will be the American consumers.\n  Today, however, the majority will show that they are now more \nconcerned with insulating bureaucrats from accountability and rewarding \npolitical allies than looking out for consumers. The administration and \nthe majority will try to argue that the Bureau already is accountable. \nIndeed, they will say it is more accountable than any other financial \nregulator. But let's look at the facts. The facts tell a different \nstory.\n  First, it is necessary to appreciate the amount of power placed in \nthe hands of the Director of this Bureau. No bureaucrat will have more \npower over the daily economic lives of Americans than this Director. \nThe Director, in effect, will decide which Americans can access credit \nto buy homes, purchase cars, and pay for college. The Director will \nregulate not only financial companies but also tens of thousands of \nMain Street businesses. Also, the Director will unilaterally decide how \nthe Bureau spends its up to $600 million budget.\n  Despite the vast power vested in the hands of the Director, there are \nno effective checks on the Director's authority. To truly understand \njust how unusual the structure of the Bureau is, one need only compare \nit to other independent agencies.\n  Unlike the Chairman of the SEC, the CFTC, and the Federal Reserve, \nthe Director of the Bureau does not have to obtain the agreement of \nother board members or other government officials before acting. Unlike \nother consumer protection agencies, the Bureau is not subject to the \ncongressional appropriations process. Indeed, other consumer\n\n[[Page S8423]]\n\nprotection agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission and the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, are both subject to appropriations \nand are governed by five-member boards.\n  To further ensure against one party domination, the FTC and the SEC \ncan have no more than three members from the same political party. \nAnother important comparison is with the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission. This agency actually served as the template for Professor \nWarren when she first advocated for the creation of a consumer \nprotection agency in an article several years ago. How is the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission structured? It is, first, funded through \nappropriations, and there is a five-member commission.\n  Opponents of accountability have sought to justify the structure of \nthis Bureau by pointing to the Office of the Comptroller of the \nCurrency and the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Once again, the facts \nrefute their argument.\n  First, the Comptroller can be removed at any time by the President \nfor any reason. In contrast, the President can remove the Director of \nthe Bureau only for limited grounds of ``inefficiency, neglect of duty \nor malfeasance.'' This means the Director of the Bureau cannot be \nremoved even if the Director pursues policies that are harmful to the \nAmerican people. How is that good for consumers?\n  As for the Federal Housing Finance Agency, its Director is far less \npowerful than the Director of the Bureau. The Director of the Federal \nHousing Finance Agency oversees the regulation of only 14 financial \ninstitutions. He does not have sweeping powers over all consumers and \ntens of thousands of Main Street businesses like the Director of the \nBureau would have.\n  It should be common sense that the more power an agency has, the more \naccountable it needs to be. Moreover, rather than attempting to point \nto other regulators to justify the structure of the Bureau, a more \nresponsible approach would be to make all of our financial regulators \nmore accountable. And we should begin right here with the Bureau.\n  To make the Bureau more accountable, we have proposed three \ncommonsense reforms.\n  First, the Bureau should be led by a board of directors, as I have \nsaid. This is such a commonsense measure that the President and the \nDemocratic-controlled House originally called for the consumer agency \nto be structured as a commission.\n  Second, the Bureau's funding should be subject to congressional \nappropriations.\n  Currently, the Federal Reserve is required to transfer up to $600 \nmillion to the Bureau each year. These are funds that could otherwise \nbe remitted to the Treasury and used for deficit reduction or other \nthings. Diverting this money to fund an unaccountable Federal agency \nsets a dangerous precedent of using the Federal Reserve as an off-\nbudget mechanism for funding programs. It had not happened before.\n\n  In addition, funding the Bureau through the Fed removes any check on \nrunaway spending. I believe the fiscally responsible way to fund the \nBureau is through the congressional appropriations process just as \nevery other consumer protection agency is funded.\n  Our third reform proposal is to create an effective safety and \nsoundness check for the prudential bank regulators.\n  Some have said the Bureau already has a check under the so-called \nFinancial Stability Oversight Council veto. But this veto was designed \nso it would never actually constrain the Bureau. The council can only \noverturn a rule in an extremely rare case: The rule must put at risk \nthe safety and soundness of the entire U.S. banking system or the \nstability of the U.S. financial system.\n  Under this construct, a rule could cause the failure of multiple \nbanks, but the council still would not have standing to alter the rule. \nAdditionally, the procedure is rigged to prevent the council from \nacting. It takes an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the \ncouncil's members to set aside one of the Bureau's rules, and the \nBureau's Director is a voting member of the council.\n  In addition, only 3 of the council's 10 members are actually bank \nprudential regulators. This veto is not a check on the powers of the \nBureau. It is a sham that they have today. We need to change that.\n  Recent history shows that taxpayers are ultimately on the hook for \nbank failures. For this reason, consumer protection needs to be \ncarefully coordinated with bank regulation to prevent against \nunnecessary bank failures.\n  As presently structured, the Bureau can ignore any advice offered by \nbanking regulators, even if it undermines the safety and soundness of \nbanks. Unless this structural flaw is remedied, a real possibility \nexists that the consumer bureau will one day cause bank failures that \nend up harming consumers, taxpayers, and our economy.\n  In light of the reasonableness of the reform proposals we have \nrequested, the question remains: Why are the administration and the \nmajority so insistent that the Bureau be unaccountable?\n  Clearly, they want to use the Bureau as a political issue. A second \nreason is that they believe nonbank financial institutions are not \ncurrently regulated. But this is false. The Federal Trade Commission, \nthe State attorneys general, and State financial regulators all have \nauthority over nonbanks. A more likely reason for today's vote is that \nthe Bureau will provide funding to key liberal activists, such as \nACORN.\n  Other agencies must return to the Treasury funds what they receive \nfrom enforcement actions. This consumer bureau, as now structured, is \nallowed to dole out money it collects from fines and penalties to \nliberal consumer groups. This reveals why the administration and the \nmajority want so desperately for the Bureau to be unaccountable. They \nwant the Bureau to be a permanent funding machine for their political \nallies.\n  Finally, we are going to hear that our methods to achieve reform are \nunprecedented in the history of the Senate. It has been said:\n\n       Never before has the consideration of a nominee been \n     conditioned on a change in the law.\n\n  This, of course, is ridiculous on its face. It is nonsense. Nominees \nare held routinely in the Senate by both parties, for any number of \nreasons, including the desire to make changes in existing law. The only \nthing different in this particular case is that it is completely \ntransparent. No secret backroom deals. We are right here in the open.\n  After all the harm caused to consumers by financial regulators, it is \ntime the majority stops using consumer protection as a political \nfootball and starts taking actions that actually help consumers. We can \ntake the first step by reforming the Bureau to make it accountable to \nthe very consumers it purports to protect.\n  Until that time, however, we cannot, we should not, and we will not \nmove forward on the nomination of the Director to lead this massive and \nunaccountable bureaucracy. I urge my Democratic colleagues to stop \nobstructing reform and join with us to move forward on real consumer \nprotection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized for \n5 minutes at the conclusion of Senator Johnson's remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, 2 months ago the Senate \nBanking Committee voted along party lines to send to the full Senate \nthe nomination of Richard Cordray to be the first Director of the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. Due to an unprecedented and \nirresponsible display of political gamesmanship, Mr. Cordray's \nnomination and strong protections for American consumers are being held \nhostage.\n  Before any candidate was put forth, Senate Republicans pledged to \nblock the nomination, and their objections have nothing to do with Mr. \nCordray's qualifications, his politics, or his character. Republican \nSenators have actually admitted as much, with a public pledge to block \nany nominee for the new consumer agency until a list of legislative \ndemands, which would greatly weaken the agency, are met. That those \ndemands were debated and rejected by a bipartisan Congress last year is \nbeside the point. The minority\n\n[[Page S8424]]\n\nparty is distorting the Senate confirmation process, mandated by the \nConstitution, to rewrite a law against the wishes of the American \npeople.\n  Why do Senate Republicans remain opposed to consumer protection \ndespite national surveys showing 3-in-4 bipartisan voters support the \nnew agency's creation? Whatever the motivation, it appears to outweigh \nany concerns about protecting families buying homes, students borrowing \nfor college, and service members or older Americans falling prey to \nfinancial scams.\n  This vocal minority opposed to strong consumer protection and helped \nby special interests have drummed up misleading claims to hide behind. \nThey claim the CFPB Director will put the economy at risk--ignoring the \neffects of the foreclosure crisis, which was itself fueled by \nirresponsible and predatory lending. They claim the agency lacks \naccountability--ignoring the fact that it is bound by accountability \nmeasures comparable to or exceeding that of other independent financial \nregulators. And they claim restrictions on abusive financial products \nwill hurt lenders--ignoring the damage those products inflicted on \nconsumers tricked into signing unfair contracts filled with hidden fees \nand penalties.\n  In reality the CFPB was created as an accountable yet independent \nregulator in bipartisan negotiations last year. Its mission is to \nprotect consumers--by cracking down on predatory lenders and \nstreamlining disclosures so families can make better informed financial \nchoices. But until it has a confirmed director in place, the CFPB's \nauthority over nonbank financial institutions, like private student \nlenders and mortgage brokers, will be stifled. Every day Mr. Cordray's \nconfirmation is blocked, vital protections are delayed, millions of \nAmericans--including service members, veterans and older Americans--are \nleft vulnerable, and the Nation's community banks and credit unions \nremain at a disadvantage to their less-regulated competitors.\n  The question we consider today should not be whether the minority \nparty can hijack this constitutional process and demand as ransom \nlegislative changes that would hamstring the consumer agency. The \nquestion should be whether Mr. Cordray is qualified for the job. And I \nbelieve that Mr. Cordray is an outstanding candidate. For years Richard \nCordray has worked tirelessly as a public servant. As Ohio's Attorney \nGeneral he aggressively pursued financial crimes by banks and mortgage \nfirms, and won more than $2 billion in settlements for the State. And \nas Ohio's first solicitor, he argued cases before the Supreme Court to \nprotect consumers and enhance the quality of our financial markets.\n  American families paid a steep price for the financial crisis, \nbattered by layoffs and foreclosures. Yet incredibly, many of the bad \nactors that contributed to the crisis remain poorly regulated and \ncontinue to lobby against tougher regulation. Congress created the CFPB \nto protect consumers and clean up the marketplace, but it needs a \ndirector. Richard Cordray has proven himself capable for the job, and \nthere is no legitimate reason to block his confirmation.\n  I urge my colleagues to reconsider their political game playing and \ndo the right thing.\n  Stop blocking Richard Cordray's nomination and allow him to have an \nup or down vote.\n  I yield to my colleague from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I wish to thank the chairman for his \nleadership on this important issue and so many others before the \nBanking Committee.\n  Since September 2008, we have learned many hard lessons about the \nfactors that contributed to the financial crisis. To address systemic \nrisks and to fix the system, we passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street \nReform and Consumer Protection Act. One of the most important reforms \nwe made in that legislation was the creation of the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau, or the CFPB. The CFPB is charged with stopping \nabusive mortgage originators, stopping abusive credit card companies, \nand stopping abusive private student loan lenders.\n  For years we have had organizations whose purpose was to protect the \nbanking system and, indirectly, consumers. We need to provide a \nbalance. Frankly, if we had this balance in place prior to 2008, we \nmight have avoided some of the incredible costs we have seen not only \nto consumers but to the entire banking system as a result of predatory \nbehavior by many different financial institutions.\n  Unfortunately, many of my Republican colleagues are trying not to \ncorrect deficiencies in the Dodd-Frank act or improve it. They want to \ngut it. One of the things they want to take out is consumer protection, \nand they want to do that by denying a nominee to head up this important \nagency.\n  It certainly is a prerogative of my colleagues to work on improving \nany piece of legislation, but effectively to say: We will not let \nlegislation that has passed this body by 60 votes and that has ample \nprecedent in the law to take effect because we won't put a person in \ncharge is, I think, abusing the process.\n  We have worked on this issue, and we know consumers need these types \nof protections. We know that daily there are scams targeting the \nelderly. There are unscrupulous mortgage lenders and abusive payday \nlenders. Most financial firms are not like this--in fact, these \nindividuals probably represent a very small minority of the financial \ncommunity, but they are abusive predators, particularly to the most \nvulnerable people in our society.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about the 1 percent and the 99 \npercent. Well, guess what, the 99 percent are consumers, and the 1 \npercent are probably those people who are running some of these \nfinancial institutions, some of them fairly and scrupulously, but \nothers who are not.\n  We want to protect consumers in this country--all of us--certainly \nthe 99 percent, but because of Republican opposition of this nominee, \nwe are running into a real problem. If we do not have a head of this \norganization, then it cannot effectively implement regulations and \neffectively enforce the laws it has been given the task to oversee and \nimplement.\n  We have to have rules that apply across the country that get at the \nshadow banking system, that provide the kinds of protections consumers \ncan rely on, and that, in fact, improve the operation of the \nmarketplace. Again, I think some of the people who regret what happened \nthe most in the 2007, 2008, 2009 time period are financial leaders \nlooking around and saying: Why wasn't anyone checking the behavior of \nsome of the financial companies out there that have ruined my \nmarketplace and ruined my reputation? Well, we have to do that.\n  The longer Richard Cordray is blocked, the longer such disreputable \npractices in the financial marketplace can continue. And Richard \nCordray is entirely qualified: as former treasurer of the State of \nOhio, he knows the financial business and worked closely with banks at \nthe Treasury, as former attorney general of Ohio, he worked to protect \nconsumers, and as an individual, he has the intellect and the character \nto do an outstanding job. We have to get him in place.\n  Who suffers if we don't do this? Well, among those who are suffering \nare military personnel. I had the privilege of commanding a paratrooper \ncompany in the 82nd Airborne Division in the 1970s. I was an executive \nofficer, and I handled all the complaints, all the dunning, all the \nletters that were coming in from my soldiers. It has gotten worse.\n  Holly Petraeus, who is the head of the Office of Servicemember \nAffairs at the CFPB, testified before the committee. She talked about \nInternet lenders who target military personnel--vulnerable soldiers and \ntheir families--who are about to deploy or who just came back from \nAfghanistan. They will give loans of up to 40 percent of a soldier's \npay. Of course, the interest rate can be as high as 584 percent APR. We \ncan't stop that until we get somebody such as Richard Cordray in charge \nof this organization.\n  She also talked about the dunning calls, 20 times a day, threatening \nthem: We will go to your commander. We will have you court-martialed. \nWe will take away your security clearance. We will ruin your career.\n  We have to stop that. This is about real people, real consumers. We \nhave to confirm Richard Cordray.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n[[Page S8425]]\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I understand I have 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order. The Senator may use 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Thank you very much.\n  Let me first thank Chairman Johnson for his leadership in this regard \nand in so many other major issues before the Banking Committee. He has \nreally exercised a lot of our oversight obligations in making sure we \nimplement Wall Street reform in a way that protects all of us as \ntaxpayers in the country but creates a system that can still let us \neconomically flourish, and this is one of those.\n  For too long too many in Washington protected Wall Street from \ncommonsense regulations and let consumers fend for themselves. For too \nlong Republican economic policy, when it should have protected the 99 \npercent of American consumers from the reckless financial games that \nled us to the brink of economic disaster in 2008, protected the 1 \npercent on Wall Street instead.\n  Banks played Russian roulette with the future and economic security \nof middle-class families, and no one--no one--was watching. Backed up \nby too-big-to-fail government guarantees, they wreaked havoc on our \neconomy and on the jobs and retirement savings of families who played \nby the rules.\n  We have lived through the unfortunate results of lax oversight, and \nnow it is time to work together to correct it. It is time to stop the \npolitical games and govern. It is time to act. It is time to work \ntogether to make sure middle-class families get the protection they \ndeserve and the watchdog they need.\n  This is really about whose side a person is on. Cordray and consumer \nprotection are being blocked simply because Republicans want to protect \nWall Street. Wall Street already has a legion of lobbyists protecting \nits interests. We need someone who can protect Main Street's interests, \nand that is what Richard Cordray would do as the Director of the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n  Richard Cordray is an unquestionably well-qualified nominee, and no \none is disputing that fact--no one. I have not heard anyone dispute his \nqualifications for the job. We know the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau would be off to a good start with Richard Cordray at the helm, \ndespite efforts by special interests to derail the process. It will be \na strong but fair agency under Richard Cordray--to protect financial \nconsumers who are tired of being tricked by the fine print, the \n``gotcha'' paragraphs that no one but a bank lawyer would understand.\n  Despite hysterical claims from Wall Street, the Bureau actually won \nwidespread praise from both consumers and the industry for its first \nmajor initiative when it created a new and greatly simplified Know \nBefore You Owe mortgage loan disclosure form so that consumers \nunderstand what kind of mortgage they are getting into before they take \nit. Had we had that type of language early on, maybe we wouldn't have \nhad part of the crisis in which consumers were led to bad mortgage \nproducts--products that ultimately had skyrocketing interest rates--\nwhen they qualified for a conventional mortgage. Maybe we wouldn't be \nin the great predicament we have been in since 2008.\n  Under Wall Street reform, Richard Cordray will be there to prevent \nthose families from being ripped off again. Fixing our broken system \nwas not easy, and it is still not over. We are still fighting to keep \nthe ground we have gained against special interests.\n  The longer this nomination is delayed, the more consumers will \nsuffer. Without a Director, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \ncannot carry out some of its most vital functions, including regulating \npayday lenders, pawn shops, private student loan companies, those that \nmake unscrupulous and predatory loans on our military families--we \nheard Senator Reed, who has great experience in this, talk about that--\ngiving them an unfair advantage at the same time as they do that over \ncommunity banks and credit unions that are regulated, that are good and \nthat play by the rules.\n  Now is a time to work together to make that happen. I ask that my \ncolleagues stop playing games. Let us go to a final up-or-down vote on \nMr. Cordray.\n  Republicans have continued to couple Mr. Cordray's nomination to \nweakening the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is \nunprecedented. Never in Senate history has a nominee been opposed in \nthe Senate because of opposition to the whole agency for which he or \nshe has been nominated.\n  I say to my Republican colleagues, let's stop playing games with the \nprotections American consumers need. Work with us to do the job we were \nelected to do and confirm this nominee. Work with us to protect \nconsumers.\n  We have come a long way toward a middle ground in creating this \nagency with checks and balances to begin with. The time has come for \nRepublicans to join us in governing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, there has been a lot of wild rhetoric, \nquite frankly, hyperbole, exaggeration. I wanted to try to bring this \ndiscussion and this debate back to reality. To do that, I wanted to \nremind folks that conservatives objecting to this nomination have, from \nthe very beginning, laid out three very narrow, specific, concrete \nreforms we are seeking. So this notion that we are against consumer \nprotection, we are trying to gut CFPB, is silly. Let's get back to \nreality. Let's get back to what we have said from the very beginning: \nWe want these three important reforms.\n  First of all, we think it is very important for the single Director, \na new czar quite frankly, a credit czar, to be replaced with a board to \noversee this Bureau. That is how other comparable agencies operate. The \nbest example--the best comparison--is the SEC. I think that is a \ncritical check on the Bureau's authority to have a board that can \ndiscuss and come up with a consensus, not a single agency.\n  Secondly, related to that, there should be safety and soundness \nchecks for the prudential financial regulators who oversee the safety \nand soundness of financial institutions. One of the core reasons we had \nthe 2008 financial crisis is we had political agendas run amok with \nregard to financial institutions with no safety and soundness checks.\n  We are putting that same problem on steroids in this new all-powerful \nbureaucracy. Again, point No. 1, very specific, very concrete, very \ncommonsense reform that we have proposed from the beginning is a safety \nand soundness check.\n  Third, and perhaps most important, the Bureau should be subject to \nthe congressional appropriations process so there is some oversight and \naccountability from the American people and their representatives. That \nis the norm. That sort of check and balance, that oversight and \naccountability, is absolutely the norm. It is way outside the norm to \nhave no oversight and accountability because, as it stands now, this \nnew superbureaucracy has an unlimited check that it gets from the \nFederal Reserve--never has to get an appropriation, never has to answer \na single question from the people or their representatives.\n  Again, the CFPB, as it sounds now, draws its budget directly from the \nrevenue of the Federal Reserve. By the way, this revenue would \notherwise be deposited into the Treasury paying down the debt. The CFPB \nis not just about mega institutions, mega banks--more hyperbole that \nhas been thrown on the floor--but anyone, any business, for instance, \nthat offers four or more payment installments and an installment plan.\n  Sure, that includes Citibank. It also includes your dentist, your \nvet, your local electronics store. CFPB right now is so unlimited in \ntheir authority that they are able to limit or prohibit the terms of \nany such product or service, has power over marketing of any such \nproduct or service in its jurisdiction with, again, the Federal Reserve \nas its basically unlimited piggy bank.\n  I think these concerns we have are pretty darn fundamental and have a \nlot of common sense in them. Again, we have three very specific, \nconcrete reforms we want advanced. We are not trying to gut the CFPB. \nThose reforms would not gut it--not against consumer protection. Those \nreforms would still have a sound, strong consumer protection agency in \nplace.\n\n[[Page S8426]]\n\n  I think the American people deserve a more honest debate than, quite \nfrankly, they are getting in a lot of this. This notion that if we are \nagainst ObamaCare, we are against all improvement of the health care \nsystem is silly. I think Americans get that as their health insurance \npremiums go up significantly now, by every accounting, by every \nindependent source, well beyond what they would have gone up otherwise.\n  Being against that is not being against health care reform. We heard \neven earlier, if we are against the stimulus plan, we are against \neconomic recovery. That is silly. I think Americans know that now that \nwe are still stuck at very high unemployment. How is that recovery \nworking out for everyone?\n  I was against the stimulus because I was for economic recovery, and \nit is the same thing here. We need to advance the interests of the \nAmerican people, certainly including consumers. But we do not need an \nall-powerful, new czar in Washington who can hurt everyone, including \nconsumers.\n  So we continue to advance three very specific, concrete, commonsense \nreforms. That is all we want. That does not gut CFPB. That is not \nagainst consumer protection. It is against unbridled, unprecedented \nauthority. The American people, agency after agency, issue after issue, \nhave seen the effects of that sort of unbridled, virtually unlimited \nFederal Government authority in the last 2 years. They do not like it.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Earlier this week in Kansas, President Obama tried to \nscore political points by chiding Senate Republicans for refusing to \nvote on the confirmation of Richard Cordray to be Director of the so-\ncalled Consumer Financial Protection Bureau--CFPB--saying we refuse to \nlet him do his job. And the President asked, Why? I am happy to answer \nhis question, again.\n  Earlier this year, I joined 44 other Senators in recommending to the \nPresident three necessary reforms for the CFPB in order to improve \naccountability in its operations. Specifically, we asked that a board \nof directors be established to oversee it, that the agency be subjected \nto the regular congressional appropriations process, and for the \nestablishment of a safety and soundness check for the prudential \nregulators.\n  We made clear to the President that without these reforms we would \nnot vote to confirm any nominee to run the CFPB, regardless of \npolitical affiliation or qualifications. The President chose to ignore \nour suggestions. Although the President frequently pays lip service to \naccountability in the regulatory process, when push came to shove, he \nmade this serious issue just another talking point.\n  President Obama is now trying to pressure my colleagues to vote to \nconfirm Mr. Cordray by traveling around the country giving speeches. I \nwant to reiterate that I will not vote to confirm any director for this \nrogue bureaucracy until appropriate checks and balances are put into \nplace. President Obama promised that ``transparency and accountability \nwill be a hallmark of my administration'', making his refusal to make \nCFPB more transparent especially disappointing.\n  Without reform, CFPB's director would serve with unprecedented and \nunconstitutional amounts of power. The director would have the power to \ndecide what rules are issued in the name of consumer protection, how \nfunds are spent, and how its enforcement authority will be used. In \nshort, it empowers a single, unelected person with seemingly endless \nand unchecked authority. This bureaucracy holds the sweeping ability to \nlimit choices when it comes to commonly-used financial products such as \nhome equity loans, credit cards, and student loans. Simply put, a \ndesignation from the CFPB director saying these products are \n``abusive'' could restrict the availability of credit to consumers and \nincrease the cost of goods or services for all Americans.\n  This year alone, over 70,000 pages of new regulations have been added \nto the books from agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency \nand the National Labor Relations Board, oftentimes without any \ncompelling justification for their existence. The last thing job \ncreators in America need is more uncertainty from a powerful government \nagency such as the CFPB that will receive a blank check for a half \nbillion dollar budget with virtually no input from Congress.\n  President Obama has urged the American people to ``help hold [him] \naccountable''. I stand with my Republican colleagues in an effort to do \njust that. The truth is we need transparency in government that \nprovides greater confidence that regulations are designed to protect \nconsumers from unfair practices, without destroying jobs. Until basic \ntransparency requests are made, I will not support allowing the CFPB to \noperate with unaccountable leadership.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, both sides agree that everyone benefits \nfrom a marketplace free of fraud and other deceptive and exploitative \npractices. The disagreement is over the best way to structure our \nFederal regulatory agencies to accomplish this goal and provide \naccountability.\n  One of the lessons of the financial crisis is that we need a \nsupervisory program that looks and considers how safety and soundness \nand consumer protection work together and reinforce better and safer \nservices to banking customers. Far too often, supervision either looked \nat consumer issues in isolation--promoting access to credit and home \nownership--or it looked at safety and soundness in isolation, such as \nensuring that customer information was legally accurate but not asking \nwhether it was understandable to bank customers.\n  We should have strengthened the link and coordination between \nprudential supervision and consumer protections rather than severing \nit. Instead Congress institutionalized this separation by creating a \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau and blurred the role and \naccountability of the prudential regulators and the new Bureau.\n  Mortgage underwriting is a good example of an issue that was found \nlacking before the financial crisis and has the potential to be subject \nto an even more bureaucratic regulatory system going forward. I say \npotential because it is unclear to me where the authority of the Bureau \nstops and where the authority of the prudential regulators overlaps on \nseveral important issues that will likely cause confusion and \npotentially inconsistent regulatory approaches. Already we are seeing \nconflicts among regulators with different regulators adopting different \nconsumer protection rules and duplication in examinations.\n  From my perspective, the new Bureau is a massive, expensive \ngovernment bureaucracy that is immunized against meaningful oversight \nby either Congress or the President, and dramatically extends the \nFederal Government's control over the economy.\n  According to analysis from Andrew Pincus, a partner in the law firm \nMayer Brown LLP:\n\n       The Bureau's structure has a number of features that, when \n     taken together, concentrate an amount of unchecked authority \n     in a single individual--the Director--that is unprecedented \n     for a federal agency that regulates private entities and \n     individuals:\n       First, the Bureau will be headed by a single Director with \n     complete, unilateral authority to make all regulatory and \n     enforcement decisions and to hire and fire all personnel, \n     including his or her own deputy.\n       Second, the Bureau's Director does not serve at the \n     pleasure of the President. Rather, during his or her five-\n     year term, the Director may be removed only for inefficiency, \n     neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. That standard \n     eliminates the President's power to remove the Director based \n     on a policy disagreement: once nominated and confirmed, the \n     Director cannot be overruled by the President.\n       Third, the Bureau is exempt from the congressional \n     appropriations process. It is funded instead by a transfer of \n     money from the Federal Reserve in an amount determined solely \n     by the Director, subject only to a cap that already exceeds \n     $550 million, will increase 10% for the next fiscal year, and \n     is subject to automatic inflation adjustments thereafter.\n\n  While I appreciate the willingness of Richard Cordray to serve and \nanswer questions, I can't support the consideration of any nominee to \nbe the Director of the Bureau until the agency is reformed to make it \nmore accountable and transparent.\n  First, we would establish a board of directors to oversee the Bureau. \nThis would allow for the consideration of multiple viewpoints in \ndecisionmaking and would reduce the potential for the politicization of \nregulations. A board of directors structure is consistent with the \norganization of the Federal Reserve\n\n[[Page S8427]]\n\nBoard, National Credit Union Administration, FDIC, SEC, CFTC, and \nFederal Trade Commission.\n  Second, we would subject the Bureau to the congressional \nappropriations process to ensure that it doesn't engage in wasteful or \nunnecessary spending. This also gives Congress the ability to ensure \nthat the Bureau is acting in accordance with our legislative intent. \nThe SEC, CFTC, and the Federal Trade Commission have long been subject \nto the appropriations process for the same reasons.\n  Finally, we would establish a safety and soundness check. This would \nstrengthen the link and coordination between prudential supervision and \nconsumer protections.\n  Given the enormous impact the Bureau will have on the economy, it is \nimportant for Congress to revisit its structure and authorities to make \nit more accountable and transparent.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about the \nnomination of Richard Cordray to lead the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau and to urge my colleagues to join me in voting in support of his \nconfirmation.\n  In July of last year, I was proud to join many of my colleagues in \nthe Senate to pass comprehensive Wall Street reform legislation that is \nalready working to protect middle-class families, hold Wall Street \naccountable, and put in place policies to make sure taxpayers will \nnever again be left holding the bag for the big banks' mistakes. I \nsupported this legislation because for far too long the financial rules \nof the road had not favored the American people. They were tilted \ntoward big banks, credit card companies, and Wall Street, and they were \ntwisted and abused to make sure no matter what happened, the financial \nindustry would come out ahead.\n  When the economy was roaring, the big banks made enormous sums of \nmoney and handed out huge bonuses to their employees. But when the \nproducts they created brought down the banks and pulled Main Street \ndown with them, it was the taxpayers who had to foot the bill to \nprevent absolute calamity. Wall Street had a pretty good system going \nfor a while: Heads they won, tails the taxpayers lost. To correct this, \nwe fought to pass Wall Street Reform last year over Republican \nobjections, and we took a huge step in the right direction. We \nstrengthened the rules. We increased the oversight. And critically, we \ncreated the first-ever agency dedicated to protecting middle-class \nfamilies, seniors, and small business owners from the financial fraud \nand scams that have devastated so many.\n  The mission of this new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is \nclear: to make sure that consumers come first--that the financial \nindustry can no longer pull fast-ones on their customers--and, \nfundamentally, that the markets for consumer financial products and \nservices actually work for all Americans. The CFPB's job is to help \nconsumers understand the financial products that are being marketed to \nthem every day because we know the big banks win when the American \npeople don't understand the fine print. And it is to make sure that the \nfinancial firms are playing by the rules and to stand up for the \nAmerican people and enforce those rules if consumers are being lied to, \nscammed, or cheated.\n  Over the last year the CFPB has been staffing up and ramping up and \nhas already started working to protect consumers. But without a \nconfirmed Director, they are simply unable to do everything possible to \nstand up for middle-class families. Their hands are tied. Without a \nconfirmed Director, the CFPB doesn't have the full authority to protect \nconsumers who use non-bank financial institutions such as payday \nlenders, credit-reporting agencies, and debt collectors, which are \nservices many working families depend on, as well as so many of our \nNation's veterans and servicemembers. This isn't right. We created the \nCFPB to protect all families and consumers, and we need to confirm a \nDirector to give them the tools they need to do that.\n  I was proud to support President Obama's appointment of Elizabeth \nWarren to help set up the new Bureau. I think she did a fantastic job, \nand I am deeply disappointed that Republicans were so opposed to her \nwork standing up for middle-class families against the big banks that \nthey said they would block any attempt to name her as full-time \nDirector. I thought the way Elizabeth Warren was treated by Senate \nRepublicans was truly shameful. But she hasn't given up, and she is \nstill fighting for the middle-class families and consumers she has \nalways been such a passionate advocate for.\n  I am very glad that President Obama nominated another strong advocate \nfor the middle-class to fill this role. Richard Cordray has been \nserving as the Chief of Enforcement at the CFPB, so he understands the \nmission and the need to fight for the rules that protect consumers. He \npreviously served as attorney general and State treasurer in Ohio, \nwhere he amassed a strong record of standing up for seniors, investors, \nbusiness owners, and consumers. He has received support from Democrats \nand Republicans, and he is the right man for the job.\n  But the Republicans who have come out in opposition to this \nnomination don't seem to be opposing Richard Cordray. They seem to be \nopposed to the very idea that anyone should be in a position to stand \nup for consumers and families in the financial products market. They \nwant to keep this position open because they are worried that this \nagency is going to have too much power.\n  Well, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was designed to have \npower. It was created to put that power in the hands of middle-class \nfamilies and consumers and to take some away from the big banks and \ncredit card companies that had it all before.\n  So once again we have a simple choice before us in the Senate: Do you \nstand up for middle-class families who deserve to be protected from \nscams and financial gimmicks or do you stand up for the big banks and \nWall Street firms that are scared to death that a powerful consumer \nadvocate will cut into their fat profits and big bonuses? I know where \nthe American people stand. I stand with them. And I truly hope that \nRepublicans have a change of heart and stand with us to confirm this \nhighly capable and effective nominee so the CFPB can do the job the \nAmerican people expect and deserve.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to express my strong support for \nthe President's nomination of Richard Cordray to be the first Director \nof the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, CFPB. Mr. Cordray is an \nexceptionally well-qualified nominee who deserves an up-or-down vote in \nthe Senate.\n  The opposition to this nomination has nothing to do with Mr. \nCordray's credentials and is yet another attempt by Republicans to \nundermine the CFPB and stop it from cracking down on unscrupulous and \nfraudulent practices by big banks, credit card companies, payday \nlenders, and other financial firms.\n  The CFPB was established as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform \nlegislation that overhauled our banking system. Before the financial \ncrisis, no single agency coordinated Federal consumer protection. Banks \nand financial companies could choose their own regulator, which enabled \nthem to avoid regulations with real teeth. The failure of Federal \nagencies to coordinate and the lack of any effective consumer watchdog \nagency allowed financial firms to pursue deceitful lending practices \nthat hurt American families and caused the worst recession since the \nGreat Depression.\n  The CFPB was created to solve this problem and to make sure that \nfinancial markets work for all Americans, not just big business. The \nCFPB has already begun reviewing many areas of consumer protection law, \nincluding mortgage disclosure forms. It will enforce new rules for \ncredit cards, require mortgage servicers to better assist homeowners in \navoiding foreclosure, and enforce new rules on bank overdraft fees.\n  President Obama appointed Elizabeth Warren, a respected law professor \nand dedicated consumer advocate, to set up the CFPB. Elizabeth Warren \nwas selected for her long history of independent, unflinching consumer \nadvocacy, and under her leadership the CFPB had a running start. But \nRepublicans adamantly opposed her as CFPB director, before she had even \nbeen nominated. They knew she would crack down on abusive practices in \nthe banking and credit card industries. And they know that by law, the \nCFPB cannot exercise its full authority without\n\n[[Page S8428]]\n\na confirmed Director. That is why 44 Republican Senators signed a \nletter promising to oppose any nominee, of any party, until their \ndemands to cut back the agency's power and independence are met.\n  Mr. Cordray would be an outstanding leader of the CFPB. He currently \nleads the CFPB's Enforcement Division. He has built his career around \nprotecting the public interest, reflecting his commitment to consumers \nand his dedication to fairness. After having been a State \nRepresentative, Solicitor General and Treasurer in the State of Ohio, \nMr. Cordray was elected Attorney General of Ohio in 2008. In this role, \nhe prosecuted fraudulent foreclosures and predatory lending, and \nrecovered more than $2 billion for Ohio's retirees, investors, and \nbusiness owners.\n  Mr. Cordray's nomination has broad, bipartisan support. Attorneys \nGeneral from 37 States, representing both political parties, signed a \nletter in support of this nomination, calling him ``both brilliant and \nbalanced,'' with a ``superior knowledge of the financial services \nmarketplace.'' Sixty-one mayors from around the country, led by Mayor \nVillaraigosa of Los Angeles, also wrote to support his confirmation. \nThe California Reinvestment Coalition, Center for Responsible Lending, \nConsumers Union, Main Street Alliance, NAACP, National Association of \nConsumer Advocates, AFL-CIO, AFCSME, International Brotherhood of \nTeamsters, SEIU, UAW, and UFCW have all expressed support for Mr. \nCordray, and for confirming a director so that the CFPB can operate as \nintended.\n  It is stunning that Republicans continue to block any effort to rein \nin the type of reckless and abusive behavior that caused the worst \neconomic crisis since the Great Depression.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, it never ceases to amaze me to hear \nmy colleagues whose first loyalty is to Wall Street banks, who continue \nto make excuses for being against putting a consumer cop on the beat. \nThis is an office that will be a few-hundred-million-dollar office, \nthis consumer protection--this consumer cop on the beat.\n  But this consumer cop on the beat has to look at trillions of dollars \nin mortgages, has to protect consumers when there are $30 billion in \noverdraft fees alone that banks are charging, when many times those \noverdraft fees are because consumers simply cannot figure out the fine \nprint and do not understand the terms of the agreement.\n  In the end, again, people on this floor and their special interest \nfriends in the Congress, the friends of the Wall Street banks, the \nfriends of these interest groups that continue to fleece the American \npeople--if we had had Rich Cordray or Elizabeth Warren, for that \nmatter, the consumer cop on the beat, would we have had those kinds of \nforeclosures in places such as Cleveland and Dayton? Would we have had \nthese fly-by-night mortgage brokers from Ameriquest and New Century and \nothers moving in and taking advantage of people? I am not sure we would \nhave.\n  But my Republican colleagues, my colleagues who always do the \nbidding--not all of them, but many of them always do the bidding of \nthese special interest groups that have inflicted far too much damage \non this economy--I hear all this, that if we would just make some \nchanges in the agency. I talked to the Senate Historian because I have \nheard these arguments: If we just change this agency, I would vote for \nit. First of all, I talked to the Senate Historian, who said: Never in \nthe history of the Senate has one political party tried to block the \nnomination of a Presidential appointee based on wanting to change the \nagency. It is nothing about the qualifications of Rich Cordray. I know \nRich Cordray better than anybody in this institution. He is from my \nState. He was our attorney general. He was the State treasurer. He was \ncounty treasurer. He was a State legislator. I have known Rich for over \n20 years. I know he is qualified. Many of my colleagues on both sides \nsay he is qualified.\n  But they say: We want to change the agency. We worked with \nRepublicans to change this agency as it went through the process in \nDodd-Frank. They kept shifting the goalposts. In order to accommodate \nRepublican concerns, we made the CFPB a bureau at the Federal Reserve. \nMany of us thought it should be totally independent. We were willing to \nmake that concession in order to get Republican support.\n  They then, after we did that, asked for regular GAO audits of the \nbooks. They got them. The GAO said the CFPB passed with flying colors. \nThey said: We do not like Elizabeth Warren, give us someone else. \nElizabeth Warren withdrew. She was a great consumer activist, would \nhave been very good at this. We are replacing her--the President is--\nwith Richard Cordray from Ohio. He will do this job well.\n  Then, after he is appointed, they say--and Richard Cordray has \nsupport from banks and credit unions and consumer groups. That is still \nnot good enough. They asked the President not to recess appoint a \nDirector. The President agreed to that. They are moving the goalposts. \nNow they are saying they will not approve anyone to serve as the \nDirector of the consumer bureau unless we change the Bureau.\n  In other words, to protect their Wall Street friends, they are \nsaying: We are not going to allow a Director to be in place unless we \nweaken this agency. As Senator Reed from Rhode Island said, would we \nnot appoint a Director of the Food and Drug Administration in the \nfuture until we rolled back all food safety laws? Are we not going to \nprotect the Consumer Products Bureau in the government, in the \nDepartment of Commerce, until we roll back child toy safety laws? That \nmakes no sense.\n  This was voted with more than 60 votes--61 or 62, if I recall--a \nsupermajority in this Congress 2 years ago. We allowed all kinds of \namendments. We accepted many changes that Republicans wanted. But in \nthe end, it is a choice: Are we for consumers or are we for Wall \nStreet? We know who it is. I am not asking my colleagues to vote for \nhim. I am asking my colleagues to let us have an up-or-down vote. Let \nus vote on it. Do not filibuster. Do not block the vote.\n  Understand, this is a vote coming up that is to break a filibuster, \nto break a Republican filibuster, where Republican Senators almost \nalways are flacking for Wall Street. They do that. It never ceases to \namaze me.\n  So all we ask is an up-or-down vote. Vote yes for cloture so we can \nhave an up-or-down vote for Attorney General Cordray.\n  I yield the floor and ask for a ``yes'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. LEE. I ask unanimous consent to enter into a colloquy with my \nRepublican colleagues for up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I stand today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport efforts to bring forward a balanced budget amendment, one that \ncan be passed out of both Houses of Congress and submitted to the \nStates for ratification.\n  Article V of the Constitution gives us the power to change the \nConstitution from time to time, to modify our laws, that 224-year-old \ndocument that has fostered the development of the greatest civilization \nthe world has ever known.\n  We have done this 27 times. We have done it at times in order to \nprotect and preserve the Nation our ancestors fought so valiantly to \ncreate and later again to defend. We have to modify our government, the \nmanner in which we do business, in order to preserve that system, in \norder to make it strong, in order to ensure that it will continue to be \nstrong for future generations.\n  We made it stronger when, for example, we added the Bill of Rights \nshortly after the ratification of the Constitution. We made it stronger \nagain when, for example, we added the so-called Civil War amendments, \namendments XIII, XIV, and XV, ending slavery and the badges and \nincidents thereof. We made it stronger when we made clear that women \nmust always be given the right to vote. We have made it stronger a \nnumber of times. And the time to make it stronger has come yet again.\n  It is time to modify the Constitution to limit--to restrict--\nCongress's current power granted by article I, section 8, clause 2 of \nthe Constitution to borrow money on credit of the United States. The \nreason we need to do this is because this power has been so severely \nabused over such a prolonged period of time that it is causing \ndevastating consequences for our economy and for our ability to fund \nthe operations of the government.\n  We have now accumulated over $15 trillion in debt as a country. That \nworks out to about $50,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. \nIt works out, arguably, to about $120,000 to $150,000 for every \ntaxpayer in America. This is lot of money. It also represents between \n90 and 100 percent of our gross domestic product annually, depending on \nwhose statistics you follow. This is troubling, given that there is an \nabundant amount of research indicating that once a country's sovereign \ndebt-to-GDP ratio crosses the significant 90-percent threshold--which \nwe have now done--economic growth tends to slow, tends to slow to a \npoint that an economy as large as ours can expect to lose as many as 1 \nmillion jobs a year. We can't afford to lose jobs, especially when we \nknow one of the major causes is our national debt. It is time we change \nthe way we do business. It is time to change the manner in which \nCongress acquires new debt.\n  This is no longer an issue that is either Republican or Democrat, \nthat is either liberal or conservative. It is simply American. I remind \nmy colleagues, whether you are concerned on the one hand about \npreserving America's leading edge, its ability to fund its national \ndefense program or, on the other hand, if you are most concerned about \nfunding our entitlement programs, you should want a balanced budget \namendment because this is what we need to do, this is what we have to \ndo in order to protect our ability to fund both of those things and \neverything else we do, you see, because by the end of this decade, \naccording to the White House's own numbers, we will be paying close to \n$1 trillion every year to pay the interest on our national debt. Just \nthe interest alone. We are currently spending a little over $200 \nbillion a year on interest--still a lot of money but about $800 billion \nlower than what we are likely to be spending by the end of this decade.\n  Where will that additional $800 billion every single year come from? \nThis isn't a discretionary sum. This is money we have to pay. It is the \nfirst thing we have to pay. Where will that $800 billion difference be \nmade up? At that point, we can't expect simply to raise taxes to make \nup that difference. I am not aware of any tax increase plan that could \nbring in that much additional revenue every year, without stagnating \nour economy to the point that we might, within 1 year or 2 years, bring \nin less revenue rather than more--certainly not $800 billion more. Nor \nam I aware of any plan whereby we could simply borrow an additional \n$800 billion to pay that interest, because doing so, of course, would \ncause our interest rates to skyrocket, grow out of control, and our \ninterest payments would be even more significant at that point, thus \nfurther impairing our ability to fund everything from defense to \nentitlements. So at that point, the only option on the table would be \ndramatic, severe, abrupt, even Draconian cuts to everything from \ndefense to entitlements and everything in between. We don't want this. \nThere is a better way. And the better way forward consists of a severe \npermanent structural spending reform that can be achieved only through \na balanced budget amendment.\n\n  Let me explain what I mean by that. And, more importantly, let me \nexplain what I don't mean by that.\n  We have to be aware of things that masquerade as balanced budget \namendments, things that will actually do the job instead of purporting \nto do the job, distracting the public's attention away from the need to \ndo this while in effect doing nothing. We need to be aware of what I \nsometimes call the Trojan horse balanced budget amendment proposal.\n  There are a few hallmarks of what a real, effective balanced budget \namendment would accomplish. First and foremost, it has to apply to all \nspending in requiring Congress to provide a supermajority vote for any \nborrowing authority. There are some who have suggested we should have a \nbalanced budget amendment that exempts certain categories of \nentitlement spending. But, of course, as we all know, it is entitlement \nspending that continues to\n\n[[Page S8430]]\n\nconsume a larger and larger share of our national budget each and every \nyear. It is entitlement spending that is anticipated to have shortfalls \nfor sums that will have to be expended for Americans alive today. It \ncould range anywhere from $50- to $60- to $110 trillion in unfunded \nentitlement liabilities. So simply exempting entire categories of \nentitlements is one of these hallmarks of a Trojan horse balanced \nbudget amendment. We can't do that. We need it to apply to all Federal \noutlays, all Federal spending.\n  Second, an effective balanced budget amendment must cap spending at \nthe average historic level of Federal revenue. Over the last 40 years, \nour average take, our average income as a percentage of GDP, has been \nabout 18 to 18.5 percent of our gross domestic product. We need to make \nsure we are not spending more than that; that Congress can't, without a \nsupermajority vote, spend more than 18 percent of GDP in any given \nyear. Otherwise, we run the risk that Congress will find a way through \ntricky accounting schemes to circumvent the restrictions to make sure \nit is not spending more than it takes in.\n  Third, the supermajority requirement must apply to the folks in both \nHouses of Congress every time Congress wants to spend more than it \ntakes in. Any balanced budget amendment proposal that allows for a \nsimple majority to bring about an exception to these spending \nlimitations is one that Congress can and will use to circumvent the \namendment entirely. Let me explain what I mean.\n  We have had in the past certain statutory legislative limitations on \nCongress's spending and borrowing power. Some of these have been known \nas the Graham-Rudman-Hollings legislation, and also the pay-go rules. \nBut because Congress makes those laws and because they haven't been \nreduced to a constitutional amendment, just as Congress giveth, \nCongress taketh away, and Congress has seen fit to exempt itself of \nthose rules. A balanced budget amendment, even while enshrined in our \nConstitution, becomes no more effective than those statutory or \ninternal rules unless every time Congress wants to get around those \nlimitations Congress is required to cast a supermajority vote to \njustify that excess.\n  Finally, an effective balanced budget amendment must require that \nCongress cast a supermajority vote anytime we raise the debt limit. \nThis will give us an additional guarantee that tricky accounting \nmechanisms will not be used to circumvent some of these most important \nrestrictions. Without these restrictions, Congress will continue to \nspend out of control, because Members of Congress tend to be rewarded \nwhen they spend and they tend to be criticized when they cut, and \npolitical pressures are such that I fear this spending will continue \nout of control in perpetuity until that moment in which we reach our \nnatural mathematical borrowing limit--not our statutory debt limit, our \nnatural mathematical borrowing limit. It is at that point when the most \nabrupt, the most painful, the most Draconian cuts will have to be made. \nWe can do this in a way that makes sense. We can do this in a way that \nis sensitive to the needs of the most vulnerable Americans, those who \nhave become the most dependent upon our entitlement State, most \ndependent for their day-to-day existence on these very programs. Those \nprograms will have to be cut abruptly and in a most painful manner \nunless we take the necessary steps right now and start moving onto a \nsmooth glidepath toward a balanced budget amendment.\n\n  We may not be able to balance our budget overnight, but we can do it \nover the course of a few years. That is exactly what this would allow \nus to do.\n  I have worked closely with a number of my Republican colleagues in \nsupporting S.J. Res. 10, a balanced budget amendment proposal that has \nthe support of all 47 Republicans. One of my close allies in this \nendeavor has been my friend and colleague, the junior Senator from \nKentucky. I would like to ask him to share his perspective on why this \nis necessary.\n  So I ask Senator Paul why does he think this is so important for us \nto have this amendment right now.\n  Mr. PAUL. I think Congress has failed. We have not passed a budget in \n2 years, much less a balanced budget. We cannot even pass a budget \nunder the normal procedures, and we are showing no signs of being able \nto balance our own budget.\n  They say the American public, when we ask them are they for a \nbalanced budget, 70 to 75 percent of the people are for it--\nRepublicans, Democrats, and Independents. Congress currently has about \na 10-percent approval rating. My thought is maybe our approval rating \nis so low because we are not listening to what the people want. The \npeople want us to balance our budget. They want us to do the \nresponsible thing. But they also do not want to say: Oh, Social \nSecurity, we are going to put that off to the side. They want the \nSocial Security fund to be sound too.\n  What are we doing right now? We are reducing the funding to Social \nSecurity. We are doing exactly the things we should not be doing. So it \nis important, as my colleague said, that the balanced budget amendment \ninclude all spending, and we need to balance our budget.\n  Mr. LEE. If the Congress is consisting of a Senate and House, and the \nMembers of the Senate and House are elected representatives of the \npeople who stand for reelection at regular intervals, and if the \nAmerican voting public overwhelmingly supports a balanced budget \namendment, why haven't we then passed it and given the States an \nopportunity to ratify such an amendment?\n  Mr. PAUL. The big driving force here is the entitlements. If we look \nat the revenue coming into the government, it is all being spent on \nentitlements and interest. Forty percent of every dollar is borrowed, \nbut that means we have to borrow all the money for national defense, \nfor our roads, all the rest of government. Forty percent of every \ndollar, $40,000 a second, is being borrowed. Why don't we come to an \nagreement?\n  I have been asking many people on the other side that, and they say \nwe will not fix entitlements until we have a $1 trillion tax increase. \nIf that is the starting point, we are never going to fix entitlements \nbecause many of us think raising taxes is a mistake, in the middle of a \nrecession, and we think more money left in the private sector would be \nbetter spent for jobs.\n  We have the balanced budget debate as part of this debate on how to \nreduce spending on the entitlement programs because they consume 60 \npercent of the budget. But there is this unwillingness up here. I think \npeople would like us to find solutions. When I go home to my State, it \ndoesn't matter whether they are a Republican or Democrat or \nIndependent; they want us to fix the entitlement programs. They don't \nwant it to be dependent on increasing taxes on everyone also.\n  Mr. LEE. What is my colleague's sense as to how the various State \nlegislatures are likely to respond to a constitutional amendment \nproposed by both Houses of Congress? Does he think they would likely \nratify such an amendment by the necessary three-fourths margin?\n  Mr. PAUL. In the last year, I spoke before my State legislature to a \njoint session of the House and Senate, and there was overwhelming \nsupport for a balanced budget amendment. I think there is actually a \nmovement out there to do it if we do not do it. There is so much \nfeeling among the public that this enormous debt is hurting us.\n  When I go home and talk to people, I say: Look, the people the debt \nhurts the worst are those on fixed incomes, senior citizens, and those \nin the working class. Those are the people who are being hurt by this \ndebt because it causes rising prices. As we print the new money, those \npeople are hurt every time they go buy gas at the pump, every time they \ngo to the grocery store. The rising prices are hurting senior citizens \nand the working class. The only way we are going to fix it is to have \nrules that must be obeyed.\n  Mr. LEE. So they are paying for Washington's fiscal irresponsibility \nin the form of job losses and in the form of increased prices for goods \nand services and in the form of inflation.\n  It is likewise my experience with my State legislature that they seem \nto be very supportive of it. In fact, I have a document here signed by \nthe legislative leaders of my State: by Governor Gary Herbert, by Utah \nhouse of representatives speaker Rebecca\n\n[[Page S8431]]\n\nLockhart, and by Utah State senate president Michael Waddoups. It \nconcludes essentially as follows:\n\n       We urge the United States Senate and House of \n     Representatives to pass a balanced budget amendment and send \n     it to the states for ratification. Additionally, we urge \n     Congress to make Utah's current resolution part of the \n     Congressional Record.\n\n  They also proceed to explain why they feel so strongly about this. \nThey say:\n\n       Not only for our own sake, but for future generations as \n     well, the states must now combine in an unwavering resolve \n     with convincing action to put the nation's financial house in \n     order. Passage of your own state's resolution urging the \n     support for a balanced budget amendment can help make this \n     happen. Please join with Utah to call upon Congress to \n     immediately pass a balanced budget amendment. We respectfully \n     encourage you to urge your congressional delegation to act in \n     your behalf.\n\n  They are calling not only on Congress but also their fellow State \nlegislators throughout the country to urge this same action from \nCongress. In the same breath, they also adopt it, and they supported \nwholeheartedly the specific balanced budget amendment proposal that is \nfound in S.J. Res. 10.\n  I thank them for doing that. I think they reflect the views of so \nmany of our State legislatures which balance their budgets every single \nyear. Most of them do. It is not news when they do it. It is not news \nbecause it is what is expected. It is expected because that is what \nthey do.\n  I look forward to the day and age when it is no longer news when \nCongress balances its budget.\n  I would like to ask Senator Paul another question. Why is it that so \nmany are fond of saying, as our President has recently said, ``We don't \nneed a balanced budget amendment; what we need is for Congress to just \ndo its job''? Why isn't that enough to carry the day?\n  Mr. PAUL. The problem is, in the past we have had rules--as the \nSenator mentioned, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, pay as you go. I think pay as \nyou go, which was passed in the late 1990s, was broken 700 times. There \ndoesn't seem to be the spine or will power here to say no. Everybody \nwants something from government, but they do not realize that by \ngetting things from government we do not pay for has ramifications.\n  Admiral Mullens said last year that the biggest threat to our \nnational security right now is our debt. Erskine Bowles, head of the \nDebt Commission, said the most predictable crisis in our history is \ngoing to be a debt crisis.\n  For those on the other side who will oppose a balanced budget, they \nwill need to explain to the American people when chaotic situations \ncome and we are having trouble paying for those things that come from \ngovernment, when the value of the money is destroyed and when prices \nare rising dramatically, they will have to explain to the American \npeople why they thought it was not necessary to balance the budget.\n\n  I have seen no willpower to attack entitlements. There are simple \nways. We could gradually raise the age of the entitlement eligibility \nand means test the benefits. We could fix Social Security tomorrow. We \ncould fix Medicare tomorrow. But the other side is unwilling to talk \nabout entitlement reform unless--they believe they are owed some \nobligation of raising taxes by $1 trillion. That would be a disaster \nfor the economy, and it is beyond me why the other side will not say \nlet's fix Social Security.\n  What would it take to fix Social Security? What would it take to fix \nMedicare? I think we could fix all of these problems, but I do not \nthink the dialog is there. I have been trying to ask questions to the \nother side for months now, and we are not getting anywhere.\n  Mr. LEE. I think most Members of Congress would acknowledge that \ntheir constituents want the Federal budget balanced. Why is it not \nenough for us just to tell Members of Congress: Please balance it. We \ndon't want to have to restrict your authority. We don't want to have to \ntake the keys away from the irresponsible driver. We just want you to \nbe responsible. Why doesn't that work?\n  Mr. PAUL. I think because so much of government spending is \nconsidered to be mandatory, so it just keeps enlarging and expanding. \nAlso, because people have great big hearts and they want to help \neveryone, but they do not realize the ramifications of accumulating \nsuch a massive debt. As we accumulate this debt there are \nramifications. There are higher prices and the threat of an economic \ncollapse.\n  Greece is going under. Italy is behind them. Portugal, Spain--they \nare struggling under this burden of debt. They say when a country's \ndebt equals its economy, when it is about 100 percent of its gross \ndomestic product, it is losing 1 million jobs a year.\n  Our debt is stealing American jobs, it is making us weaker as a \ncountry, making us vulnerable, making our national security vulnerable. \nBut we have to do something. There is no evidence in this body we can \neven pass a budget, much less a balanced budget.\n  I think everything about this body shows a failure to be fiscally \nresponsible and we need stronger rules.\n  Mr. LEE. Perhaps it is inherent in the institution itself, in the \nforces at play, that have made Congress uniquely vulnerable to this \nkind of massive deficit spending. Whatever the reason, we know Congress \nis not willing, is not able, or at least in recent years has not been \ninclined except in rare, unusual circumstances to balance its own \nbudget.\n  That being the case, we cannot assume that Congress will all of a \nsudden start doing its job, as those who have used this argument have \ninsisted. Part of Congress's job, as Congress has come to perceive it, \nis to engage in deficit spending. One of Congress's powers, as Members \nof Congress who read the Constitution will point out, is to borrow \nmoney on the credit of the United States. So it is not enough to simply \ntell Congress to do its job because it has regarded this kind of \nmassive deficit as consistent with that mandate, consistent with that \ninjunction.\n  Meanwhile, Congress is continuing to occupy a larger and larger share \nof the American economy. We have to remember that for the first 150 \nyears or so of our Republic's existence, we were spending between 1 \npercent and 4 percent of gross domestic product at the Federal national \nlevel, with only two brief exceptions--once during the Civil War and \nonce during and then the immediate aftermath of World War I. But that \nall started to change in the 1930s when we broke into double digits for \nthe first time ever during peacetime. We have never really gone back.\n  Now the Federal Government is spending about 25 percent of GDP \nannually. Roughly a quarter out of every dollar that moves through the \nAmerican economy every year is taken out of the real economy by \nWashington. It is absorbed within the Federal morass that is our \ngovernment. That is a problem. That needs to change.\n  I fear, I suspect, I firmly believe that it will not change until we \ntake this power away, until we at least impose severe restrictions on \nCongress's borrowing power because it has become part of Congress's \nnature to engage in this kind of out-of-control deficit spending.\n  I would like to ask Senator Paul another question. How does he think \nit would impact the lives of Americans, of Kentuckians, on a day-to-day \nbasis, if we were to pass a amendment such as this and have it ratified \nby the States?\n  Mr. PAUL. People maintain that they are for jobs, for getting the \neconomy growing again. If we were to pass a balanced budget amendment \nand send it to the States this year, it would create more jobs and \ncreate a better psychology than we have had in this country in decades. \nI think we would see a rise in the stock market like we have never seen \nbefore if we said to Wall Street and said to investors worldwide: We \nare going to balance our budget; we are not going to spend more than we \ntake in.\n  I think we would see an economic recovery begin as we have never seen \nin this country. I think we would see millions of jobs created. That is \nwhy we have to do this. That is what the American people want.\n  What amazes me about this debate is we are going to have this debate \nand have this vote and the vast majority of the other side said they \nwill not vote for a balanced budget amendment.\n  I say take that home. Tell your people at home that you are opposed \nto balancing the budget, and let's run on that. Let's see who wins the \nelections in the future because our country's future depends on \nbalancing our budget\n\n[[Page S8432]]\n\nand controlling the debt. I hope we do not wake up when it is too late.\n  Mr. LEE. I could not agree more with that assessment. It is important \nfor us to remind our colleagues of that because according to a recent \nCNN poll, the American people overwhelmingly support this by a margin \nof about 75 percent. Those who oppose it, those who are Members of this \nbody, those who are Members of our sister body--the House of \nRepresentatives--who choose not to support it, will cast their ``no'' \nvote at their own political peril because the American people are \nstanding and they are demanding more. They understand that, in the \nwords of Benjamin Franklin: ``He'll cheat without scruple who can \nwithout fear.''\n  When Congress is free to spend more than it takes in every single \nyear without political consequence, bad things happen. When Congress \nstarts to manipulate more and more of the economy, that is something \nthe American people understand is hurtful rather than helpful to them, \nto the people on the ground, to the person who is unemployed and \nlooking for a job, to the person who is underemployed or underpaid for \nthe work he does, to the single mother who is just worried about taking \ncare of her children, to the grandparents who are worried about the \nfuture of their grandchildren, worried about the fact that for the \nfirst time in American history, Americans fear their posterity will \nenjoy a lower standard of living than what they have enjoyed.\n  All this is due to the fact that Congress has no real boundaries to \nits authority and recognizes no real limits on its ability to spend our \nhard-earned money. This has real consequences. We can forestall those \nnegative consequences right now if we will act to restrict, on a \npermanent and structural basis, Congress's ability to engage in deficit \nspending.\n  Accept no imitations, beware of the Trojan horse balanced budget \namendment, the one that can be circumvented easily by a simple majority \nvote. Beware of the balanced budget amendment that limits, as a \npercentage of GDP, Congress's ability to spend money. Look out for \nthese principles. If we get this balanced budget amendment passed, \nsubmit it to the States for ratification. They will ratify it, and we \nwill find our best days, as Americans, are yet ahead of us.\n  I urge my colleagues to cast a vote in favor of S.J. Res. 10.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The Senior Senator from \nIowa.\n\n\n                         Health Care Litigation\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in a few minutes, the Supreme Court will \nbe addressing four issues in connection with the constitutionality of \nthe Obama health care law. Previously, I spoke about the \nunconstitutionality of the individual mandate. Today, I wish to discuss \nthe second issue of four: how much of the law must be struck down if \nthe Court finds the individual mandate to be unconstitutional. This \nlegal question is called severability.\n  When a court rules a law is unconstitutional, it can strike down only \nthose parts it considers unconstitutional. It can strike down the parts \nthat are intertwined with the unconstitutional provision or it can \nstrike down the whole law. Its action will depend upon whether the \nremainder of the law can function as Congress intended when it passed \nit.\n  There are rules governing severability. Normally, when only parts of \na law are held to be unconstitutional, only those parts of the law are \nstruck down by the Court. But when a statute's unconstitutional \nprovisions are severed, the whole law falls when Congress would not \nhave passed the constitutional provisions without the unconstitutional \nones being in it as well.\n  It is not enough that some of the remaining provisions are \nconstitutional. The Supreme Court has asked whether the remaining \nprovisions ``would function in a manner consistent with . . . the \noriginal legislative bargain.''\n  The lower courts have reached four different conclusions concerning \nthe health care reform law; first, that the individual mandate can be \nsevered from the rest of the bill; second, that the individual mandate \ncan be severed but only if the law's related provisions that require \nmandatory issue and community ratings are also severed; third, the \nopposite position, that the mandate and the related provisions are not \nseverable; and, finally, that the mandate is not severable and that the \nwhole law must fall.\n  One of my Judiciary Committee colleagues has stated, for the \nDemocrats, ``worst-case scenario, the mandate falls.'' But even the \nObama administration does not take that view. The administration argues \nthat if the mandate falls, the guaranteed issue and community rating \nprovisions must also be struck down. The President's administration \nsays health insurance markets will not function if all Americans are \nnot forced to buy health insurance and insurance companies must, \nnonetheless, insure everyone who seeks coverage at prices that do not \nreflect their health risk.\n  If the mandate falls, keeping any of this law would violate the \noriginal legislative bargain. I would like to remind my colleagues of \nthat original legislative bargain. The health care law passed because \nthe majority party--in its own partisan way--was going to pass this \nbill by any means necessary. The individual mandate was very critical \nto the ability to pass this law and to particularly pass it only by \npartisan considerations.\n  We considered an amendment in the Finance Committee that would have \ngranted exemptions from the individual mandate to everybody who asked \nfor that exemption. My good friend, the chairman--and that is Senator \nBaucus, as we all know--correctly stated: ``The system won't work if \nthis amendment passes.'' He further called it ``an amendment which guts \nand kills health reform.'' He commented that ``if we are serious about \nmaking sure that the Americans have health insurance, we all have to \nparticipate. . . .'' So the bill's sponsors knew the whole operation of \nthe law depended upon this very important provision that the Court is \nnow considering on the individual mandate and whether that issue was \nconstitutional.\n  Let me repeat that. The people promoting this legislation that passed \non a partisan vote knew the whole operation of the law depended upon \nthe compulsion of the individual mandate. The legislative bargain also \nshowed this law would not have passed if a single comma had been \nchanged. Congress could not have enacted any part of this law without \nthe individual mandate or any other provision. That situation comes \nabout from the fact that the bill passed the Senate by one vote and \nindividual Senators were able to extract specific provisions that \nbenefited their State in return for agreeing to provide their deciding \nvote for the bill. I think we all know the outrage that came from the \ngrassroots of America over some of those very special provisions. We \nalso know the American people were disgusted by these deals. But \nwithout those arrangements and deals, none of the law would have \npassed.\n  Those deals were one of the reasons why the Democrats lost their 60-\nvote majority in the last election. So when the other body could pass a \nbill only by accepting the Senate bill, they blocked any amendments \nthat would have changed so much as a comma. Had anything changed, the \nnew 59-vote Senate majority would have prevented passage. The bill was \noffered on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, all or nothing. If the \nindividual mandate is struck down, then the whole law must fall. \nAlthough it is not conclusive, it is certainly relevant that the law \ndoes not contain a severability clause. This is one more indication \nCongress thought the law was a unified whole.\n\n  It is simply not reasonable to argue that the law should survive \nwithout the mandate. The most important political accomplishment of the \nlaw is the additional coverage, not the lower costs we were promised. \nWithout the mandate, coverage under the law evaporates.\n  Does anyone believe that without the coverage in the law, Congress \ncould have passed the massive Medicaid expansion? Does anyone believe \nthat without the coverage in the law, Congress could have passed the \nDraconian cuts in Medicare? Does anyone believe that without the \ncoverage in the law, Congress could have passed hundreds of billions of \ndollars in new taxes? Of course not. It is simply not a legitimate \nargument that the rest of the bill could have ever stood on its own \nwithout the individual mandate enabling additional coverage.\n\n[[Page S8433]]\n\n  I am pleased the Supreme Court has granted oral arguments devoted to \nthe severability question all by itself. In the past, the Supreme Court \nhas issued very activist severability rulings in which it rewrote a \nstatute in a way Congress never would have passed it.\n  For instance, it completely rewrote the campaign finance laws in the \n1976 Buckley v. Valeo decision in a way that produced an unworkable \nsystem that no Member of Congress would have ever voted for. In the \nBooker case, the Supreme Court rewrote the sentencing laws in a way \nthat produced a very unworkable system that no Member of Congress would \nhave voted for. This time, the Supreme Court should not use the \nseverability doctrine to rewrite the health care law into something \nCongress never would have passed in the first place. It should strike \ndown the entirety of the law in keeping with the law on this subject. \nSuch a ruling would give us the chance to do what we did not do before: \nwork in a truly bipartisan way to address these issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                       Las Vegas Helicopter Crash\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am saddened to have learned this morning \nthat five people were killed late yesterday in the terrible helicopter \ncrash just a few miles outside Las Vegas. My sympathy is with the \nfamilies of those who died, including pilot Landon Nield and four \npassengers. My thoughts are with them as the recovery efforts continue \nthis morning and as they lay their lost loved ones to rest.\n  Reports indicate the aircraft was on a tour of Hoover Dam. It crashed \ninto a remote and rocky terrain in the River Mountains between Lake \nMead and Henderson, NV, a few miles from Las Vegas.\n  I have taken those helicopter tours. It is an exciting trip. People \ndon't realize this, but we are just a few miles from the Grand Canyon \nthere in Las Vegas. It takes just a short time to travel to that \nbeautiful canyon to see where millions of people go every year to see \nthe Grand Canyon. Hundreds of thousands of tourists come from Las Vegas \nto see it.\n  I am truly grateful for the efforts of the National Park Service \nrangers, the metropolitan police department, the search-and-rescue \nteam, and the Henderson fire departments that responded rapidly to the \nscene of the accident.\n  The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation \nSafety Board are investigating this accident as we speak. I will \ncontinue to monitor the investigation as well as the recovery efforts \nthat are in progress.\n  Hundreds of thousands of tourists, I repeat, enjoy these helicopter \ntours each year. I am sorry innocent people lost their lives in such a \nrare tragedy. Nevada puts great stock in protecting the safety of its \ntourists, whether flying over the Grand Canyon or walking down the Las \nVegas strip. I hope the inquiry into the cause of this crash will help \nus better protect helicopter pilots and passengers in the future.\n\n  Again, my heart goes out to the families as they mourn this awful \ntragedy.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If the Democrats aren't going to take their time, I \nwould like to take 5 or 6 minutes on another subject, and I ask \nunanimous consent to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Broken Accounting System\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to commend \nSecretary of Defense Leon Panetta for personally focusing top-level \nattention to what has been a festering problem, and I think it is fair \nfor me to say a festering problem for decades. I am talking about the \nDefense Department's broken accounting system and lack of financial \naccountability.\n  Secretary Panetta has grabbed the bull by the horns and told the \nmilitary services to get on the stick and move out smartly. He wants \nthem to fix the problem now, not later. Secretary Panetta's bold \ninitiative is laid out in a Department-wide memorandum dated October 11 \nthis year. In this document, he calls for an all-hands-on-deck priority \neffort to accelerate plans to create a modern, fully integrated finance \nand accounting system. Such a system, if it ever comes to be, would be \ndesigned to generate reliable, accurate, and complete financial \ninformation. Such a system should be capable of producing credible \nfinancial statements that can earn clean opinions from independent \nauditors. If that happens, the Department will achieve what is called \nfull audit readiness. But now I want to warn Secretary Panetta about \nwhat has happened to so many well-intentioned Secretaries of Defense. \nThat could be a big ``if.''\n  Under the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, all government \nagencies were supposed to reach full audit readiness 15 years ago. As I \nunderstand it, the Defense Department is now the only delinquent \nagency. After the passage of so much time, how is it, then, that the \nPentagon cannot provide an accurate accounting of all the money it \nspends? Doing it is a constitutional responsibility. Not doing it is \nunacceptable. Why are the military services dragging their feet as they \nare? What is the problem? Are all of the petty fiefdoms entrenched in \nPentagon bureaucracy causing the problem? Is it because they do not \nwant to surrender control of the money to a centralized financial \nauthority?\n  This is a festering problem Secretary Panetta has tackled. As a \nformer chairman of the House Budget Committee and Director of the \nOffice of Management and Budget, he has the necessary knowledge and the \nnecessary experience to get this job done.\n  The magic date for achieving full audit readiness at Defense was set \nin concrete 2 years ago. Unfortunately, this goal has a long and \nelusive history, and that long and elusive history is best \ncharacterized by relentless slippage. It is a rolling target date, and \nmost experts believe the 2017 deadline is unattainable.\n  I am sure our tax-paying public doesn't understand why the Federal \nGovernment wouldn't have the best accounting system in the world, but \nthey don't, particularly in the Defense Department.\n  Under Secretary Panetta's leadership, I hope all the slippage comes \nto a screeching halt and all the bureaucratic roadblocks are torn down. \nHe has definitely turned up the heat and turned up the pressure. He has \ndrawn a line in the sand. He wants to see results and see results now. \nHe is calling for a revised plan for achieving audit readiness. It is \ndue on his desk December 13. So Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast \nGuard, and everybody else--well, the Coast Guard is not involved but \neverybody else--get on the stick because that is next week. He has set \na near-term goal. He wants the Department to produce partial financial \nstatements by 2014.\n  As a first step, Secretary Panetta has called for the production of \nstatements of budgetary resources by 2014. A statement of budgetary \nresources is just one component of a financial statement, but it \nrepresents a big important chunk of the whole. If credible statements \nof budgetary resources can be produced 3 years ahead of schedule, then \nmaybe the full audit readiness by 2017 is, indeed, possible.\n  I also understand that Secretary Panetta's near-term goal is being \nincorporated in legislation working its way through Congress right now. \nThat should help to move the ball further down the field.\n  Secretary Panetta's decision to set a preliminary goal of 2014 will \nbe a good gauge--a good test--of what is and is not possible. Can the \nDefense Department achieve full audit readiness by 2017? We won't have \nto wait 6 years to find that out under the process Secretary Panetta is \ninstituting. If problems surface early on, we in Congress can help the \nDepartment take corrective action to keep this effort on track and \nmoving in the right direction.\n  A willingness and a commitment on the part of the Secretary of \nDefense to take on this problem goes way beyond the production of \ncredible financial statements required by the Chief Financial Officers \nAct of the late 1970s. It\n\n[[Page S8434]]\n\ngoes right to the heart of a much larger constitutional issue; that is, \nwhether the Department of Defense is going to be held accountable.\n  The Department must be able to provide a full and accurate accounting \nof all the money it spends. Under article I, section 9 of the \nConstitution, such an accounting must be published from time to time. \nThe taxpayers expect and deserve nothing less than that. Today, DOD \ncan't do that. The status quo is unacceptable.\n  While I began conducting oversight of the Defense Department \nfinancial management issues more than 20 years ago, I did not come to \nfully appreciate the true understanding of the root cause issue until 3 \nyears ago.\n  After receiving a series of anonymous letters alleging misconduct and \nmismanagement within the inspector general's audit office, I initiated \nan in-depth oversight review of audit reporting. Early on in the \nreview, there was a startling revelation: One all-important, central \nelement was adversely affecting every facet of the inspector general's \naudit effort, and that was the Department's broken accounting system. \nThis dysfunctional system is driving the audit freight train. The \nsuccess or failure of an audit turns on the quality of the financial \ndata available for audit by competent examiners. The record clearly \nshows the quality of financial data presented for audit by the \nDepartment should be rated poor--or maybe I ought to say even worse \nthan poor. This is what I call the ``no audit trail'' scenario. It is \nfrequently encountered by auditors trying to examine Department of \nDefense books of account. That is the exact problem Secretary Panetta \nis attempting to address.\n\n  All my audit oversight work tells me that fixing the accounting \nmachinery is the first step to audit readiness. Once a modern, fully \nintegrated system is up and running, it should be a simple matter of \npunching the right computer buttons and credible financial statements \nwill roll off of the printer. Doing routine oversight audits should be \na piece of cake. Today's labor-intensive and time-consuming audit trail \nreconstruction work which auditors now endure in the absence of \nreliable accounting records will be a thing of the past. Most \nimportantly, effective internal controls will be in place to protect \nthe taxpayers' money against fraud, theft, and waste.\n  What I am saying to my colleagues is this: Secretary Panetta is on \nthe right track. He is trying to take us to a place where we need to go \nand go soon. I want to help him lead us there, so I am here today to \nencourage and support this courageous effort to clean up the books. I \nadmire and respect his personal commitment to such a noble cause.\n  I am also here to reinforce the words of encouragement contained in a \nletter that my friend from Oklahoma, Dr. Coburn, and I penned to \nSecretary Panetta on November 17. We, being Senator Coburn and I, want \nto work with him to achieve this most worthy goal. And in the process \nof these remarks to the Senate, I hope other Members of the Senate, \nparticularly those who are on the Armed Services Committee, will also \ngive Secretary Panetta encouraging words of support and thanks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I ask \nunanimous consent that the time until 2:30 p.m. be equally divided \nbetween the two leaders or their designees for debate on the Reid \nmotion to proceed to Calendar No. 251, S. 1944; that at 2:30 p.m., the \nSenate vote on the motion to proceed to S. 1944; that upon disposition \nof the Reid motion to proceed, it be in order for the Republican leader \nor his designee to move to proceed to Calendar No. 244, S. 1931; that \nthere be 2 minutes of debate equally divided between the two leaders or \ntheir designees prior to the vote; that both motions to proceed be \nsubject to a 60-vote threshold; finally, that the cloture motion \nrelative to the motion to proceed to S. 1944 be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                       Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, a little earlier today the junior Senator \nfrom Utah, Mr. Lee, came to the floor to discuss the balanced budget \namendment. Under the budget agreement agreed to in Congress in August, \nboth the House and Senate were required to vote on a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget before the end of this calendar year. \nThe House has already taken the vote. The measure failed. The Senate \nstill has a responsibility to take it up, which we will do in the \nclosing hours of the session this calendar year.\n  There are at least two proposals before us for a constitutional \namendment, and my subcommittee, the Subcommittee on the Constitution, \nCivil Rights and Human Rights of the Committee on the Judiciary, held a \nhearing last week asking questions about these approaches to the \nConstitution.\n  The leading approach on the Republican side comes from both Senators \nHatch and McConnell. I am not certain which they will offer or whether \nthe language might change at the last minute, but it would enshrine in \nour Constitution a disciplinary mechanism to reduce the budget deficit. \nThis has been brought before the Senate and the House before many \ntimes. This particular proposed constitutional amendment would:\n  Require that in each fiscal year Federal outlays shall not exceed \nreceipts unless two-thirds of each House votes to waive.\n  It caps outlays at 18 percent of gross domestic product each year \nunless two-thirds of each House votes to waive.\n  It requires a two-thirds vote in each House for any tax or revenue-\nraising measure.\n  It requires a three-fifths vote in each House for raising the debt \nlimit.\n  It allows for waiver of the amendment in times of declared war or \nserious military conflict.\n  It prohibits courts from ordering any increase in revenue to enforce \nthe amendment.\n  It directs Congress to enforce the amendment through appropriate \nlegislation.\n  It takes effect 5 years after ratification.\n  This is far more extreme than the clean House balanced budget \namendment, which failed to pass in that Chamber on November 18.\n  The testimony before our subcommittee from experts in the field said \nthat this amendment, proposed by Senators Hatch and McConnell, will \nrequire Draconian cuts in Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, our \nmilitary retirement system, and many programs important to working \nfamilies.\n  It will make Republican fiscal policies the constitutional law of the \nland, giving protection to those in higher income categories from any \ntax increase forever, without an extraordinary vote in either House.\n  It would delegate the task of resolving budget disputes to our court \nsystem.\n  It would make recessions worse by requiring cuts in countercyclical \nsafety-net programs such as food stamps and unemployment just at the \ntime when those expenditures are most needed.\n  It would increase the likelihood of debt limit standoffs each year.\n  It would lead to increased burdens on our States.\n  During the course of the hearings, several people came forward to \ntestify. I recommend to my colleagues that they carefully read these \ntestimonies, which are available on the Senate Judiciary Committee \nwebsite.\n  The first was Robert Greenstein, president of the Center on Budget \nand Policy Priorities. Mr. Greenstein, who is well recognized and \nrespected on Capitol Hill, spoke about the countercyclical aspect and \nsaid that if you cut spending in the midst of a recession, you will not \nhave the resources you need to provide unemployment benefits, food \nstamps, and the things that save families when they are out of work or \nmaking very little money.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Greenstein's statement be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Testimony of Robert Greenstein, Before the Subcommittee on the \n   Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights Hearing Entitled, ``A \nBalanced Budget Amendment: The Perils of Constitutionalizing the Budget \n                      Debate,'' November 30, 2011\n\n       Thank you for the invitation to testify today. I am Robert \n     Greenstein, president of\n\n[[Page S8435]]\n\n     the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a policy \n     institute that focuses both on fiscal policy and on policies \n     affecting low- and moderate-income Americans. We, like most \n     others who analyze fiscal policy developments and trends, \n     believe that the nation's fiscal policy is on an \n     unsustainable course. As part of our work, we have been \n     analyzing proposed changes in budget procedures for more than \n     20 years. We have conducted extensive analyses of proposals \n     to write a balanced-budget requirement into the Constitution, \n     among other proposals.\n       The purpose of changing our fiscal policy course is to \n     strengthen our economy over the long term and to prevent the \n     serious economic damage that would likely occur if the debt \n     explodes in future decades as a share of the economy. But we \n     need to choose our fiscal policy instruments carefully. We \n     want to avoid ``destroying the village in order to save it.''\n       The goal of a constitutional balanced budget amendment is \n     to address our long-term fiscal imbalance. Unfortunately, a \n     constitutional balanced budget amendment would be a highly \n     ill-advised way to try to do that and likely would cause \n     serious economic damage. It would require a balanced budget \n     every year regardless of the state of the economy, unless a \n     supermajority of both houses overrode that requirement. This \n     is an unwise stricture that large numbers of mainstream \n     economists have long counseled against, because it would \n     require the largest budget cuts or tax increases precisely \n     when the economy is weakest. It holds substantial risk of \n     tipping faltering economies into recessions and making \n     recessions longer and deeper. The additional job losses would \n     likely be very large.\n       When the economy weakens, revenue growth drops and revenues \n     may even contract. And as unemployment rises, expenditures \n     for programs like unemployment insurance--and to a lesser \n     degree, food stamps and Medicaid--increase. These revenue \n     declines and expenditure increases are temporary; they \n     largely disappear as the economy recovers. But they are \n     critical for helping to keep struggling economies from \n     falling into a recession and for moderating the depth and \n     length of recessions that do occur.\n       When the economy weakens, consumers and businesses spend \n     less, which in turn causes further job loss. The drop in tax \n     collections and increases in unemployment and other benefits \n     that now occur automatically when the economy weakens \n     cushions the blow, by keeping purchases of goods and services \n     from falling more. That is why economists use the term \n     ``automatic stabilizers'' to describe the automatic declines \n     in revenues and automatic increases in UI and other benefits \n     that occur when the economy turns down; these actions help \n     stabilize the economy.\n       A constitutional balanced budget amendment, however, \n     effectively suspends the automatic stabilizers. It requires \n     that federal expenditures be cut or taxes increased to offset \n     the effects of the automatic stabilizers and prevent a \n     deficit from occurring--the opposite course from what sound \n     economic policy calls for.\n       Over the years, leading economists have warned of the \n     adverse effects of a constitutional balanced budget \n     amendment. In Congressional testimony in 1992, Robert \n     Reischauer--then director of the Congressional Budget Office \n     and one of the nation's most respected experts on fiscal \n     policy--explained: ``[I]f it worked [a constitutional \n     balanced budget amendment] would undermine the stabilizing \n     role of the federal government.'' Reischauer noted that the \n     automatic stabilizing that occurs when the economy is weak \n     ``temporarily lowers revenues and increases spending on \n     unemployment insurance and welfare programs. This automatic \n     stabilizing occurs quickly and is self-limiting--it goes away \n     as the economy revives--but it temporarily increases the \n     deficit. It is an important factor that dampens the amplitude \n     of our economic cycles.'' Under the constitutional amendment, \n     he explained, these stabilizers would no longer operate \n     automatically.\n       Similarly, when a constitutional balanced budget amendment \n     was under consideration in 1997, more than 1,000 economists \n     including 11 Nobel laureates issued a joint statement that \n     said, ``We condemn the proposed `balanced-budget' amendment \n     to the federal Constitution. It is unsound and unnecessary. \n     The proposed amendment mandates perverse actions in the face \n     of recessions. In economic downturns, tax revenues fall and \n     some outlays, such as unemployment benefits, rise. These so-\n     called `built-in stabilizers' limit declines of after-tax \n     income and purchasing power. To keep the budget balanced \n     every year would aggravate recessions.'' This summer, five \n     Nobel laureates in economics issued a new statement opposing \n     a constitutional balanced budget amendment for this reason.\n       Earlier this year, the current CBO director, Douglas \n     Elmendorf, sounded a similar warning when asked about a \n     constitutional balanced budget amendment at a Senate Budget \n     Committee hearing. Elmendorf observed:\n       ``Amending the Constitution to require this sort of balance \n     raises risks . . . [t]he fact that taxes fall when the \n     economy weakens and spending and benefit programs increase \n     when the economy weakens, in an automatic way, under existing \n     law, is an important stabilizing force for the aggregate \n     economy. The fact that state governments need to work . . . \n     against these effects in their own budgets--need to take \n     action to raise taxes or cut spending in recessions--undoes \n     the automatic stabilizers, essentially, at the state level. \n     Taking those away at the federal level risks making the \n     economy less stable, risks exacerbating the swings in \n     business cycles.''\n       Finally, a month ago, Macroeconomic Advisers (MA) analyzed \n     the economic impacts of a constitutional balanced budget \n     amendment. One of the nation's preeminent private economic \n     forecasting firms, Macroeconomic Advisers provides analysis \n     to major corporations and government entities, such as the \n     President's Council of Economic Advisors under Presidents of \n     both parties, including Presidents Reagan and George W. Bush.\n       MA concluded that if a constitutional balanced budget \n     amendment had already been ratified and were now being \n     enforced for fiscal year 2012, ``the effect on the economy \n     would be catastrophic.'' If the 2012 budget were balanced \n     through spending cuts, MA found, those cuts would total about \n     $1.5 trillion in 2012 alone--and would throw about 15 million \n     more people out of work, double the unemployment rate from 9 \n     percent to approximately 18 percent, and cause the economy to \n     shrink by about 17 percent instead of growing by an expected \n     2 percent.\n       Even if a BBA were implemented when the budget was already \n     in balance, MA concluded, it would still put ``new and \n     powerful uncertainties in play. The economy's `automatic \n     stabilizers' would be eviscerated [and] discretionary \n     counter-cyclical fiscal policy would be unconstitutional . . \n     . . Recessions would be deeper and longer.''\n       MA also warned that ``The pall of uncertainty cast over the \n     economy if it appeared a BBA could be ratified and enforced \n     in the middle of recession or when the deficit was still \n     large would have a chilling effect on near-term economic \n     growth.'' MA concluded that a BBA would have detrimental \n     effects on economic growth in both good times and bad.\n       Proponents of a constitutional amendment often respond to \n     these admonitions by noting that the proposed constitutional \n     amendment would allow the balanced-budget requirement to be \n     waived by a vote of three-fifths of the House and the Senate, \n     so the BBA would be set to the side in recessions. But this \n     response is too facile, and the three-fifths waiver provision \n     does not solve the problem. It is difficult to secure three-\n     fifths votes for anything; consider the paralysis that marks \n     much of the work of the Senate. Moreover, it may take months \n     after a downturn begins before sufficient data are available \n     to convince three-fifths of the members of both houses of \n     Congress that a recession is underway. Furthermore, it is all \n     too likely that even after the evidence for a downturn is \n     clear, a minority in the House or Senate would hold a wavier \n     vote hostage to demands for concessions on other matters \n     (such as new, permanent tax cuts). By the time that a \n     recession were recognized to be underway and three-fifths \n     votes were secured in both chambers, if such support could be \n     obtained at all, extensive economic damage could have been \n     done and hundreds of thousands or millions of additional jobs \n     unnecessarily lost.\n       The bottom line is that the automatic stabilizers need to \n     continue to be able to work automatically to protect American \n     businesses and workers. The balanced budget amendment \n     precludes that.\n       Nor is a recession the only concern. Consider the savings \n     and loan crisis of the 1980s, or the financial meltdown of \n     the fall of 2008. A constitutional balanced budget amendment \n     would have hindered swift federal action to rescue the \n     savings and loan industry or to rapidly put the Troubled \n     Assets Relief Program in place. In both cases, history \n     indicates that federal action helped save the economy from \n     what otherwise likely would have been far more dire \n     problems.\n       Moreover, the federal government provides deposit insurance \n     for accounts of up to $250,000; this insurance--and the \n     confidence it engenders among depositors--is critical to the \n     sound functioning of our financial system so that we avoid \n     panics involving a run on financial institutions, as occurred \n     in the early 1930s. A constitutional prohibition of any \n     deficit spending (unless and until a supermajority of both \n     houses of Congress voted to authorize it) could seriously \n     weaken the guarantee that federal deposit insurance provides. \n     That is a risk we should not take.\n       These are illustrations of why fiscal policy should not be \n     written into the Constitution.\n       A parallel problem is that the proposed constitutional \n     amendment would make it even harder than it already is to \n     raise the debt limit, by requiring a three-fifths vote of \n     both the House and Senate to raise the limit. This is playing \n     with fire. It would heighten the risk of a federal government \n     default. A default would raise our interest costs and could \n     damage the U.S. economy for years to come.\n\n\n               Mistaken Analogies to States and Families\n\n       Proponents of a constitutional amendment sometimes argue \n     that states and families must balance their budgets every \n     year and the federal government should do so, too. But \n     statements that the constitutional amendment would align \n     federal budgeting practices with those of states and families \n     are mistaken.\n       While states must balance their operating budgets, they can \n     borrow to finance their capital budgets--to finance roads, \n     schools, and other projects. Most states do so. States also \n     can build reserves during good times\n\n[[Page S8436]]\n\n     and draw on them in bad times without counting the drawdown \n     from reserves as new spending that unbalances a budget.\n       Families follow similar practices. They borrow--they take \n     out mortgages to buy a home or student loans to send a child \n     to college. They also draw down savings when times are tight, \n     with the result that their expenditures in those periods \n     exceed their current incomes.\n       But the proposed constitutional amendment would bar such \n     practices at the federal level. The total federal budget--\n     including capital investments--would have to be balanced \n     every year, with no borrowing allowed for infrastructure or \n     other investments that can boost future economic growth. And \n     if the federal government ran a surplus one year, it could \n     not draw it down the next year to help balance the budget.\n       I would also note that the fact that states must balance \n     their operating budgets even in recessions makes it all the \n     more important from the standpoint of economic policy that \n     the federal government not be subject to the same stricture. \n     American Enterprise Institute analyst Norman Ornstein \n     addressed this matter in an article earlier this year, where \n     he wrote: ``Few ideas are more seductive on the surface and \n     more destructive in reality than a balanced budget amendment. \n     Here is why: Nearly all our states have balanced budget \n     requirements. That means when the economy slows, states are \n     forced to raise taxes or slash spending at just the wrong \n     time, providing a fiscal drag when what is needed is \n     countercyclical policy to stimulate the economy. In fact, the \n     fiscal drag from the states in 2009-2010 was barely countered \n     by the federal stimulus plan. That meant the federal stimulus \n     provided was nowhere near what was needed but far better than \n     doing nothing. Now imagine that scenario with a federal drag \n     instead.''\n\n\n         S.J. Res. 10 and S.J. Res. 23 Raise Additional Issues\n\n       The foregoing concerns apply to all versions of the \n     balanced budget amendment that have been introduced. Some \n     versions of the balanced budget amendment, such as S.J. Res. \n     10 and S.J. Res. 23, which are identical, raise additional \n     concerns, because they would write into the Constitution new \n     barriers to raising any revenues--including closing wasteful \n     tax loopholes--to help balance the budget and also would \n     prohibit federal expenditures in any year from exceeding a \n     figure such as 18 percent of the Gross Domestic Product in \n     the previous calendar year. These constitutional requirements \n     could be overridden only by supermajority votes in both the \n     House and the Senate.\n       This requirement for a supermajority to raise taxes would \n     be extremely unwise. It would protect what President Reagan's \n     former chief economic advisor, Harvard economist Martin \n     Feldstein, has called the biggest area of wasteful government \n     spending in the federal budget--what economists call ``tax \n     expenditures'' and Alan Greenspan has called ``tax \n     entitlements.''\n       In 2010, tax expenditures amounted to $1.1 trillion, more \n     than the cost of Medicare and Medicaid combined (which was \n     $719 billion), Social Security ($701 billion), defense ($689 \n     billion, including expenditures in Iraq and Afghanistan), or \n     non-defense discretionary spending ($658 billion, including \n     expenditures from the Recovery Act). Many of these tax \n     expenditures are fully the equivalent of government spending. \n     Let me use child care as an example.\n       If you are low- or moderate-income, you may get a federal \n     subsidy to help cover your child care costs, and the subsidy \n     is provided through a spending program. If you are higher on \n     the income scale, you still get a government subsidy that \n     reduces your child care costs, but it is delivered through \n     the tax code, as a tax credit. (Moreover, if you are a low- \n     or moderate-income parent with child care costs, you likely \n     will miss out because the spending programs that provide \n     child care subsidies are not open ended and can only serve as \n     many people as their capped funding allows. By contrast, if \n     you are a higher income household--and there is no limit on \n     how high your income can be--your child care subsidy is \n     guaranteed, because the tax subsidy that you get operates as \n     an open-ended entitlement.) It is difficult to justify making \n     the tax-code subsidy sacrosanct and the program subsidy a \n     deficit-reduction target merely because one is delivered \n     through a ``spending'' program and the other is delivered \n     through the code.\n       And as the child care example illustrates, sharply \n     distinguishing between subsidies delivered through the tax \n     code and those delivered through programs on the spending \n     side of the budget also has a ``reverse Robin Hood'' aspect. \n     Low- and moderate-income households receive most of their \n     government assistance through spending programs; affluent \n     households receive most of their federal subsidies through \n     tax expenditures. Effectively barring reductions in tax \n     expenditures from contributing to deficit reduction is a \n     prescription for placing the greatest burden of deficit \n     reduction on those who can least afford to bear it.\n       The problems do not stop there. If it requires a \n     supermajority to raise any revenue, another likely outcome is \n     a proliferation of tax loopholes. New loopholes--including \n     loopholes that Congress did not intend but that high-priced \n     tax lawyers and accountants have found ways to create--could \n     become untouchable once they appeared, because it would \n     require a supermajority of the House and Senate to raise any \n     revenue. It would become more difficult to close tax \n     loopholes that opened up, since (under S.J. Res. 10 and S.J. \n     Res. 23) special-interest lobbyists could block such action \n     simply by securing the votes of one-third plus one member in \n     one chamber.\n       Finally, as noted, S.J. Res. 10 and S.J. Res. 23 would bar \n     federal spending from exceeding 18 percent of GDP in the \n     prior calendar year, which translates into a limit of about \n     16.6 percent of the current fiscal year's GDP. To hit that \n     level would require cuts of a truly draconian nature. \n     Consider the austere budget that the House of Representatives \n     passed on April 15, sometimes referred to as the Ryan budget. \n     Under that budget, Medicare would be converted to a voucher \n     system under which, the Congressional Budget Office has said, \n     beneficiaries' out-of-pocket health-care costs would nearly \n     triple by 2030 (relative to what those costs would be that \n     year under the current Medicare program). CBO also has \n     written that under the Ryan budget, federal Medicaid funding \n     in 2030 would be 49 percent lower than it would be if the \n     Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion were repealed but \n     Medicaid otherwise was unchanged. And funding for non-\n     security discretionary programs would be cut more than one-\n     third below its real 2010 level. Yet CBO says that under this \n     budget, total federal spending would be 20\\3/4\\ percent of \n     GDP in 2030, so it would breach the allowable limit under \n     S.J. Res. 10 and S.J. Res. 23 by four percentage points of \n     GDP. This illustrates the draconian nature of the proposed \n     16.6 percent-of-current-GDP requirement.\n       Another way to look at this stricture is to examine federal \n     expenditures under Ronald Reagan. Under President Reagan, who \n     secured deep budget cuts at the start of his term, federal \n     expenditures averaged 22 percent of GDP. And that was at a \n     time before any members of the baby boom generation had \n     retired and when health care expenditures throughout the U.S. \n     health care system (including the private sector) were one-\n     third lower as a share of GDP than they are today. It also \n     was before the September 11 terrorist attacks led \n     policymakers to create a new category of homeland security \n     spending, and before the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan led to \n     increases in veterans' health-care costs that will endure for \n     a number of decades.\n\n\nEstimating the Effects of Spending Cap in S.J. Res. 10 and S.J. Res. 23\n\n       To provide a more precise and detailed analysis of the \n     impact that the spending cap in S.J. Res. 10 and S.J. Res. 23 \n     would have, we recently conducted an analysis of its effects, \n     using the latest Congressional Budget Office ten-year budget \n     projections. We considered the impact if the balanced budget \n     requirement would take effect in fiscal year 2018, as would \n     occur if Congress approved it now and the requisite number of \n     states ratified it by September 30, 2013. Here are the \n     results.\n       --Congress would have to cut all programs (except interest \n     on the debt) by an average of 24.9 percent in 2018. It would \n     have to cut programs by $1.1 trillion in 2018 alone, and by \n     $6.1 trillion through 2021.\n       --If all programs were cut by the same percentage, Social \n     Security would be cut $265 billion in 2018 alone and $1.7 \n     trillion through 2021; Medicare would be cut $168 billion in \n     2018 and $1.1 trillion through 2021; and Medicaid and the \n     Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) would be cut $115 \n     billion in 2018 and $724 billion through 2021.\n       --Veterans disability payments, compensation, and other \n     such benefits would be cut $19 billion in 2018 and $122 \n     billion through 2021.\n       --Defense spending would be cut $141 billion in 2018 and \n     $879 billion through 2021, on top of the reductions made to \n     comply with the discretionary spending caps that the Budget \n     Control Act establishes and the reductions made under the \n     sequestration order that is expected to be issued in January \n     2013, pursuant to that act.\n       Congress would not, of course, have to cut all programs by \n     the same percentage and likely would not do so. But if \n     Congress chose to spare certain programs, others would have \n     to be cut even more deeply. For example, if Social Security \n     were spared, the average cut to all other programs would rise \n     by more than one third, from 24.9 percent in 2018 to 34.2 \n     percent. Similarly, if the defense budget were increased by \n     placing it at 4 percent of GDP (exclusive of war costs) and \n     maintaining it at that level, as presidential candidate Mitt \n     Romney has proposed, then all other programs--including \n     Social Security--would have to be cut an average of 38.2 \n     percent in 2018 under S.J. Res. 10 and S.J. Res. 23.\n       Even if the so-called ``plain vanilla'' version of the BBA \n     is pursued, rather than S.J. Res. 10 and S.J. Res. 23, the \n     required level of budget cuts would be massive, assuming \n     taxes are not raised to help balance the budget. Congress \n     would have to cut everything an average of 17.3 percent in \n     2018, an average of 23.8 percent if Social Security were \n     protected, and an average of 29.4 percent if the defense \n     budget were set at 4 percent of GDP and Social Security were \n     not protected.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       Policymakers need to begin to change our fiscal trajectory. \n     As various recent commissions have indicated, we need to \n     stabilize the debt as a share of GDP in the coming decade and \n     to keep it stable after that (allowing for some fluctuation \n     over the business cycle). But establishing a balanced budget \n     amendment in the Constitution would be exceedingly unwise. It \n     would likely exact a heavy toll on the economy and on \n     American businesses and workers in the years and decades\n\n[[Page S8437]]\n\n     ahead. It is not the course that the nation should follow.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, another testimony that I thought was \nextremely compelling came from Alan Morrison. Alan Morrison is an \naccomplished attorney and has argued many cases before the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. He is the Lerner Family Associate Dean for Public Interest & \nPublic Service Law at George Washington University Law School.\n  Professor Morrison really asked us to think through what we are \ndoing. In fact, he asked us the most important question: If you put an \namendment to the Constitution that requires a balanced budget, who will \nenforce it? Who will make it work? Who will decide if you have lived up \nto its terms? He concluded, based on his background in constitutional \nlaw and arguing before the Supreme Court, not the President. The \nPresident is not in that position to do it. The President, of course, \nwith his budget, has his own favorites when it comes to spending and \nrevenue.\n  Professor Morrison said this case ultimately has to find its way to \nour court system. But he made it clear that any constitutional balanced \nbudget amendment must expressly give to the Federal courts the standing \nto decide the question. He raised a question that without that \nexpressed language, he really was doubtful that the courts would take \nit up. They might view it as just a political question to be resolved \nby Congress itself.\n  Now, Senator Lee, who spoke on the floor earlier, has a version of \nthe balanced budget amendment that expressly gives standing to Members \nof Congress, if I am not mistaken. But the point made by Professor \nMorrison is that any balanced budget amendment has to expressly give to \nour Federal court system the power of judicial review. In other words, \nwho is going to call the fouls, the balls, the strikes, and the outs? \nIt is going to have to be the court system when it comes to whether the \nbalanced budget amendment is being complied with.\n  That is the first question but certainly not the last question.\n  Professor Morrison then went on to say: Now, put this in the real \nworld. In the real world, where Congress has passed a budget, \nappropriations bills, and now someone is arguing that what Congress did \ndoes not comply with the new provision of the Constitution requiring a \nbalanced budget--arguing that, in fact, Congress is overspending the \namount it is allowed to spend, for example--then, of course, that case \nhas to find its way from the Capitol Building to the President, who \nsigned the bill, and then over to the court system.\n  Keep in mind, while we are in doubt about the outcome on \nappropriations bills and the budget, there is a serious question about \nhow we will continue to fund our government, whether we can continue to \nmake important payments to military retirees, Social Security \nrecipients, Medicare recipients. All of it is in doubt while there is a \nquestion raised as to whether the budget passed by the Congress is \nunconstitutional.\n  This is the thicket we are being led into by those who very glibly \nsay: All we need to do is mandate in the Constitution a balanced \nbudget, and it will just flow naturally from that mandate.\n  Well, listen to what Professor Morrison said:\n\n       The federal courts will (rightly) be extremely reluctant to \n     wade into these budget battles and thus will want to be sure \n     that there is likely to be a violation before agreeing to \n     decide the merits. But budgets are inherently uncertain in \n     their impact, depending on such factors as whether revenue \n     targets are met, whether the demand for entitlements is \n     higher or lower than anticipated, whether discretionary \n     spending is fully realized, and whether an existing war winds \n     down or a new one starts, each with great uncertainties \n     accompanying them. Thus, it will be far from clear on October \n     1st of a given fiscal year whether a duly enacted budget will \n     or will not be in balance, assuming that the question is \n     reasonably close, as it is likely to be in at least some \n     years. Unless Congress makes it clear, either in the \n     [constitutional] amendment or perhaps by subsequent \n     legislation, that the courts should resolve all doubts in \n     favor of finding claims ripe, the courts are likely to be \n     very reluctant to reach the merits even for those persons who \n     are expressly given standing in the amendment.\n\n  Then, of course, is the question of a remedy. What if Congress passes \na budget and appropriations bills, the President signs them, and they \nare challenged in court, and the court says: Yes, in fact, Congress has \noverspent beyond the requirements of the Constitution. What is next? \nWhat remedy would the courts order? What can the court do?\n\n       Can they order the recipients (of salaries, social security \n     benefits, Medicare payments, payments under Government \n     contracts etc) to ``pay back'' [a certain percentage]? Or can \n     it order Congress to rectify the balance in the next year's \n     budget, which would almost certainly trigger a new lawsuit? \n     To be sure, the courts will not dismiss as moot claims that \n     are capable of repetition, yet evade review because the \n     duration of the violation is so limited that the courts \n     cannot decide its legality before it has ceased.\n\n  Professor Morrison asks us to get beyond the bumper stickers and to \nthink twice before we amend our Constitution.\n  In the 220 years since the enactment of the Bill of Rights, we have \namended this Constitution precious few times. We have done it for \ncompelling national reasons. We have done it to extend the right to \nvote to women. We have done it to make it clear that African Americans \ntreated as slaves will be treated as citizens in the United States. We \nhave done it to deal with questions of Presidential disability and \nsuccession. These are things which were compelling, major, national \nissues which could be resolved in a clear, definitive way by our \nCongress, working with the States for ratification.\n  Now comes the flavor of the day. In the midst of the deficit crisis \ndebate, there are those who are arguing that we should not accept our \nresponsibility in the Senate and the House to balance the budget. No, \nwe should just put in the Constitution that we are required to do it. \nAnd then they go further. If we are going to address it, they say, we \nare going to draw certain lines that future Congresses, forever, as \nlong as this constitutional amendment applies, will be bound by--to \nmake it more difficult to raise taxes on anyone in the United States; \nto make it imperative, if not mandatory, that cuts be made in programs \nsuch as Social Security and Medicare. These are questions that should \nbe decided by Congress and the President on a timely basis.\n  I have been involved in the past 2 years with a lot of debate about \nour national budget deficit, both on the Bowles-Simpson Commission and \nwith the voluntary effort by six Democratic and Republican Senators. It \nis not easy. It is very hard. But it can be done if the political will \nis there.\n  I think we need to summon the courage, the political courage and the \nwill to do it. But we should reject--summarily reject these efforts to \namend our Constitution. They are not well thought out. The Constitution \nis too important a document, a historical guidepost for our Nation, and \nan inspiration for nations around the world to put in a fatally flawed \nconstitutional balanced budget amendment in the heat of the moment.\n  This is a significant vote. Those of us--and that includes every \nsingle Member of the Senate--who have sworn to uphold and defend the \nConstitution need to take that document very, very seriously. Those who \nwant to amend it in quick fashion, changing their amendment language by \nthe day, should be dismissed. If they do not show the reverence for \nthis document that it deserves, if they do not take the time to make \ncertain their proposals are consistent with the sanctity and importance \nof this document, they should not be taken seriously.\n  I do not believe any of my colleagues can go home having voted for \nthat amendment and expect wild applause from audiences across America. \nThey will understand that this was just a political reaction to a very \nimportant issue. Let's not amend the Constitution with a balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  (Mrs. HAGAN assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I would like to make one additional \nbrief statement. I see the Senator from Ohio in the Chamber.\n  The holiday season is upon us, and a lot of us are thinking about our \nfamilies, and we are thinking about being with them as quickly as we \ncan. It is a time of year that has a special significance for so many \nof us. But what was made clear by President Obama yesterday--and my \ncolleagues should take note--we are not going home for\n\n[[Page S8438]]\n\nChristmas, Hanukkah, or any holiday season until we have done our job \nfor the people of this country.\n  Millions of people in Illinois and across America are counting on \nCongress to extend the payroll tax cut. What does it mean in my State? \nWith an average income of $50,000 a year, it is worth more than $1,000 \na year to those families. It is worth about $125 to $150 a month to \nhave a payroll tax cut--money that working families, struggling from \npaycheck to paycheck, desperately need to fill the gas tank, to pay the \nutility bills, to provide clothing for their kids, to make sure they \ncan stay in their home. These are the basics.\n  No Member of Congress is going to be allowed to go home and ignore \nthe imposition of such a new payroll tax on America. President Obama \nmet with the Democratic leaders of the Senate yesterday, and he said \npoint-blank--he has told the First Lady, Michelle, and his girls that, \nif necessary, they can have their Christmas vacation in Hawaii, which \nthey go to each year, by themselves, and he will wait here until this \njob is done. I hope that does not happen for the sake of his family or \nfor the sake of any family of any Member of Congress, but in order to \navoid that, we have to do the right and responsible thing.\n  This afternoon, there will be a vote on the payroll tax cut offered \nby Senator Casey of Pennsylvania. It is a payroll tax cut that would \nhelp millions of America's working families have more to spend and help \nthe economy to recover. And he pays for it. He does not add to the \ndeficit. He pays for it by imposing a surtax--listen closely--on the \nsecond million dollars earned by a person in a year, not the first \nmillion. You do not pay a penny on the first million you earn. On the \nsecond million, you will pay a surtax, and I think it is 2 percent, \nmaybe less.\n  The Republicans have said: Absolutely unacceptable. We will not allow \nyou to impose this onerous tax on these people.\n  People who are already making $20,000 a week, we cannot ask them to \npay 2 percent more on the next dollar they make? I do not think it is \nunreasonable. And if it leads to a payroll tax cut that helps families \nacross this country, if the economy continues to recover even at a \nfaster pace, if we see more business activity and business life and \nmore people working, do you know what is going to happen? Those same \nwealthy people will prosper again, as they always do. It is in their \nbest interests for this economy to get well. For our Republican friends \nto fold their arms and say: We are just not going to let you touch the \nwealthiest people in America, is an irresponsible position.\n  Senator Casey has led this effort. It is the second effort we have \nmade. We had one last week. The Republicans offered their alternative \nlast week. It had 20 votes on the floor of the Senate--20 out of 47 \nRepublican Senators. Twenty voted for it. They want to bring it up \nagain today. They will probably get more than 20 votes this time, but \nit is pretty clear that the Republican Senators are halfhearted in \ntheir support of this Republican alternative.\n  One Republican Senator from Maine had the courage to step across the \naisle last week and join us. We salute Senator Collins for doing that. \nWe hope others will do it today.\n  We can bring this challenge to a close the right way by extending the \npayroll tax cut, paying for it with a tax on the wealthiest people in \nAmerica. We can do our job and go home and be with our families. If \nRepublicans will not come to the table to work with us on a reasonable \ncompromise, I am afraid the American people will know very clearly who \nis to blame for continuing a tax on working families across America.\n  The facts are that we want working Americans to have a good year, get \nthrough a difficult time, and the economy to recover.\n  We should be doing this on a bipartisan basis. The President said: \nRoll out your Christmas trees and blankets here in the Senate because \nyou are going to stay here, even through the holidays if necessary. We \nare not going to go home to celebrate until we can celebrate with \nAmerican families who are counting on us across America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I go home every weekend, back to \nnortheast Ohio where I live in a town called Avon in Lorain County. I \nwant to go home at Christmas. I want to be with my 3-year-old grandson \nand my three daughters and son. But I also think our obligation, as \nSenator Durbin said, the assistant majority leader, is to stay here and \nget our work done. And ``get our work done'' means extend the payroll \ntax cut and extend unemployment benefits.\n  If we do not do that, frankly, we are ruining the holiday season for \ntens of thousands and dozens of tens of thousands, if you will, of \nOhioans and Illinoisans and North Carolinians. If we do not do that, we \ndo not deserve to be able to go home and be with our families. I am not \ntrying to be a martyr, but I think it is shameful a group of people, in \norder to protect the highest income taxpayers in this country--those \nmaking over $1 million a year--continue to block an extension, a \ncontinuation, if you will, of this tax cut for working families.\n  In my State the average tax cut that we will vote for today, and \ncontinue until it happens is about $100, $110, $120 per family per \nmonth. It is absolutely unconscionable not to do that.\n  Senator Durbin also talked about the constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget. I want to recount something I heard earlier today \non the Senate floor. Two of my conservative colleagues--one from \nKentucky, one from Utah--spoke about the importance of a balanced \nbudget amendment. I supported a balance budget amendment in the past \nwhen I was in the House of Representatives. In here I have actually \nvoted--it was part of an effort to get us to a balanced budget in \nreality in the 1990s. When President Bush took office we had the \nlargest budget surplus. We balanced the budget and then some. We had \nthe largest budget surplus in American history.\n  I was part of that. I was proud of that. We accomplished what we set \nout to do. We accomplished what we said we would, and we accomplished \nsomething very important for our country. It was then in the first \nyears of the last decade--in 2001, 2002, and 2003--that we went to war, \ntwo wars, Afghanistan and Iraq, and we did not pay for them.\n  President Bush, in those days, pushed through two tax cuts--one in \n2001, one in 2003--that went overwhelmingly to the wealthiest \nAmericans, without paying for it, without offsets, cuts, or other \ntaxes. Then President Bush also pushed through--at a very close, \nmiddle-of-the-night vote in the House of Representatives, by, I \nbelieve, one vote or two votes--a Medicare privatization bill that \nbasically was a bailout for the drug companies and the insurance \ncompanies and did not pay for that. That is why we got to this \nsituation, unfortunately, where we have had this terrible budget \nproblem.\n  What I wanted to address is what the solution of a couple of my \ncolleagues seems to be. To their minds, there seems to be sort of a \nmoral equivalent of, on the one hand, asking millionaires, people \nmaking a million dollars and up, to pay their fair share and making \nMedicare beneficiaries and Social Security beneficiaries take big cuts.\n  So I heard my two colleagues basically say this: that if the \nDemocrats were serious about moving toward a balanced budget--and, \nagain, 15 years ago we did it. We absolutely did it with President \nClinton, got to a balanced budget, got to a surplus.\n  They said if the Democrats are serious about that, they will raise \nthe retirement age for Social Security, and they will raise the \neligibility age of Medicare. Let me tell you why that is a bad thing. I \nwas in Youngstown not too long ago at a townhall meeting. A 63-year-old \nwoman stood up and said--62, 63 years old.\n  She said: I just need to stay healthy and stay alive until I am 65 so \nI have health insurance. I need to be able to stay alive for another \ncouple of years so I can get on Medicare and have health insurance.\n  Imagine living your life that way, when you are thinking: I just have \nto stay alive until I am 65. Then I will have good government Medicare \nhealth insurance. So some people here say: Well, tough luck. We are \ngoing to have to raise the eligibility age of Medicare to 66, 67, 68, \nwhatever my very conservative colleagues are proposing--from\n\n[[Page S8439]]\n\nUtah and Kentucky--raise the eligibility age for Medicare as if that is \ngoing to make them better.\n  When you think about it--I want 62-year-olds--one reason we passed \nthe health care reform, I want 62-year-olds to have health insurance. \nOne, it is good for them. Second, it is way better for the country, \nincluding taxpayers, that they get health care before they get sicker \nand sicker and end up in the emergency room or end up with cobbled-\ntogether health care that is much more expensive, let alone what it \ndoes to this lady and her family.\n  Second, they proposed to raise the eligibility age for Social \nSecurity. Now, it is easy for people around here to dress like this \nwho, for all intents and purposes, talk for a living--work hard at what \nwe do but talk for a living and work in offices and, you know, do not \ndo heavy lifting and are not exposed to the elements and all of that. \nIt is easy for us to say: Let's raise the Social Security age to 70 \nbecause, God willing, we will still be here if the voters vote us in \nand we can keep doing this. Most of us are pretty healthy and do not \nwork around asbestos and are not doing heavy lifting, are not working \nin the snow, in the rain, in the heat.\n  Well, when I think about raising the retirement age to 70, here is \nwho I think about. I think about construction workers. I think about \nwomen who cut hair. I think about a waitress who works at a diner. I \nthink about someone who works at a factory in Brunswick, OH. I think \nabout people who walk the floors in retail. We are going to tell them \nthat--we who dress like this, we who have jobs like this are going to \ntell those constituents--and there are millions in my State and tens \nand tens and tens of millions around the country, working-class \ncitizens of this country who simply cannot work until they are 70.\n  If you are cutting hair, if you are changing sheets in a hotel, \ncleaning out bathrooms in a hotel, if you are working as a carpenter or \na laborer or sheet metal worker, if you are working as an auto worker, \na steel worker or nonunion in a tool-and-die or machine shop, you \nprobably cannot work until you are 70. Your body probably will not be \nable to function in the workplace, with the physical and mental demands \nnow to work in the workplace until 70. Yet people here think it is OK \nto do that.\n\n  The people here, I would add, can retire if they have 20 or 25 years \nin the House and Senate. They can retire at 60 or 62 or whatever and \nget a full pension. That is why I have introduced legislation--not \nopposed to their balanced budget amendment. I think it has all kinds of \nmechanisms in it that lock in low tax rates for the richest people in \nthis country. I will not get into that. Senator Durbin talked about \nthat.\n  But I have introduced the legislation that simply says if we raise \nthe retirement age to 70, then Members of Congress cannot retire with a \npension until 70. Why should Members of Congress be able to get a \npension at 62 or 58 if they served enough years, but a Social Security \nbeneficiary should not until a decade or so later?\n  So it is important, as we talk about balancing the budget, as we talk \nabout our fiscal situation, not to make a moral equivalence between the \nrichest people, the richest 1 percent in this country paying their fair \nshare in taxes, making that a moral equivalence to Social Security and \nMedicare beneficiaries having to endure significant cuts.\n  Some people around here call Medicare and Social Security \nentitlements. They can be dismissive: We have to fix entitlements. \nWell, talk to a 72-year-old in Dayton or a 68-year-old in Zanesville or \nan 81-year-old woman in Xenia or Springfield, OH, and they will tell \nyou oftentimes this is not really an entitlement, this is an \ninvestment. They paid into Social Security. They paid into Medicare. \nThey want to make sure the government fulfills the covenant that we \nmade over the last 75 years in the case of Social Security, 45 years in \nthe case of Medicare, the covenant that we made between our government \nand the citizens of this country. That is the importance of that. We \nneed to think twice.\n  That is why my legislation was introduced, in part, that Congressmen \nand Congresswomen cannot receive a pension before the same retirement \nage as Social Security beneficiaries. We need to think twice before we \nare going to tell a carpenter or a barber or a retail worker or a steel \nworker that we are going to raise the retirement age and make them work \nuntil 70 so they can receive Social Security benefits.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Making Tough Choices\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I am coming to the floor now because we will not have an \nopportunity to debate on the payroll tax cuts because the vote is going \nto be at 2:30 and that time is taken.\n  I think it is important for the American public to look at what is \nhappening in Washington right now. There is not a disagreement in \nWashington about whether we want people to continue to receive this tax \ncut. The disagreement is, should it come out of Social Security? Should \nwe continue to undermine Social Security or should we do it a different \nway? That is No. 1.\n  No. 2 is, if we are going to borrow $117 billion against our children \nknowing that we have significant waste, fraud, abuse, and duplication \nin the Federal Government of in excess of $350 billion a year, should \nwe not eliminate some of that, pay for this rather than borrow the \nmoney?\n  So we have the posturing between the two parties based on the \nelection that is coming to create a predicate that some people only \ncare for the rich and some people only care for those who are less \nfortunate, which is all smoke and mirrors. There is unanimity that we \nwant this to continue. So what the American people are not hearing is \nthe real debate.\n  The real debate is, should we eliminate some of the waste, some of \nthe stupidity, some of the duplication in the Federal Government and \nactually do that to be able to pay for this so that as we do this thing \nthat we all want to do--in other words, keep this $1,000 to $2,000 per \nfamily in the economy now--that we do not do that by crippling the \nchildren of the very people who are in the economy.\n  You know it is a zero-sum game. Somebody is going to pay the bill \nsometime. If it is us who refuse to do the hard work of ferreting out \nwaste, duplication, fraud, then our service will have been in vain \nbecause what we are really doing is transferring to our children the \nresponsibility for us today. Actually, it is going to come doublefold \nbecause the way this bill is lined out is we are going to borrow the \nmoney in the market to pay for this continued decrease in Social \nSecurity taxes.\n  We have already stolen $2.6 trillion from Social Security, Congresses \nhave the last 20 years. When we borrow that money and put it back in, \nthere is no reduction in what is owed, so our kids are actually going \nto get to pay for it twice. They are going to pay for it now with the \nnew debt that we are taking, and the fact that new payment was not \nrecognized as a reduction, they are going to get to pay it again.\n  So it is going to cost our children a quarter of a trillion dollars. \nThere is a lack of honesty in talking plainly with the American people. \nThey know we are in trouble. The question is, Will we be honest with \nthem, treat them as adults in terms of how we go about solving the \nproblem? We hear the mess. The press takes advantage of that. There is \nnot a lot of difference between the Senator from Ohio who just spoke, \nin terms of what we want to do in terms of protecting seniors. But the \npolitics surrounding it and the game playing poorly serves our country.\n  So for all the press that is watching, we are going to get this done. \nI know it is the game Blood Sport that is happening right now, with the \npress saying: Will they or will they not? It is going to happen. We are \ngoing to fix unemployment so that we have a continuation of that. The \nreal question is, Will we fix the real things that the\n\n[[Page S8440]]\n\ncountry needs fixed or are we just going to kick the can down the road?\n  What we are doing is kicking the can down the road because we won't \nmake the tough choices to pay for it. We won't pay for the unemployment \nbenefits. The first 26 weeks is what is earned; that is what people \ncontributed to. We are up to 99 weeks, and that comes directly from the \nAmerican taxpayer--it actually comes from the future American taxpayer.\n  Some real questions ought to be asked. What is the game being played \nin Washington by both sides--trying to get advantage in the next \nelection? As our country drowns in debt, we continue to further \nmortgage our children's future, and we continue to treat the American \npeople like children rather than the adults they are. Everybody knows \nwe are all going to have to sacrifice. Does that mean we are going to \nabandon the social safety net? No, it doesn't. Does that mean a 62-\nyear-old who is trying to get on Social Security is not going to get \nthere? No; they are. Those are the tactics of fear that something will \nnot be there. As a fiscal conservative or a constitutional \nconservative, I want us to fulfill our obligation to the promises we \nhave made and to our oath, which is to uphold the Constitution. Thomas \nJefferson said you should never borrow money which you have not laid a \ntax to pay for. He is a Founder--one of the Founders of our country. We \nwould do well to go back and revisit the wise and prudent advice of our \nFounders. You don't see that or hear that much anymore in the U.S. \nCongress.\n  These are big problems our country is facing. I am 63--soon to be \n64--years old. We have never faced anything close to what we are facing \ntoday. How we react and how we respond is going to make all the \ndifference in the world--not only for our short-term future but also \nfor our long-term future.\n  I hope the American people who are listening right now understand \nthat we are going to do what is necessary to help get the economic \nprocess of our country running again in a better and viable way. I hope \nyou will dismiss the partisan rhetoric and the class warfare rhetoric \nthat is all too commonplace today. If we will focus on what the problem \nis rather than the next election, we will have a great deal more \nsuccess in coming together and forging solutions the American people \ncan be proud of and we will actually move our country ahead.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Cordray Nomination\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, first, I want to comment on the Cordray \nappointment that was attempted a little bit ago, and then I want to \nbring up some more good news on the economic front.\n  First, I was somewhat disappointed in the vote of 54 to 45, garnering \nonly 1 Republican from the other side--only 1--and on such an important \nagency that ensures the protection of consumers in a variety of areas. \nIt seems illogical to me that we would not find compromise in a vote to \nappoint someone to run an agency that this body, in a 60-vote margin, \napproved to help protect consumers, particularly considering what has \nhappened over the last several years and the glaring problems and \nchallenges consumers have had to endure with the financial institutions \nof this country as well as from other entrepreneurs, such as pawnshops \nand payroll check cashers. All of these institutions would have firm \nregulations and provide the consumer an opportunity to respond, or \nthose who get abused by those programs.\n  I am a little disappointed. I wasn't intending to come and speak on \nthat issue, but I wanted to have my voice on the floor that I was \ndisappointed that an appointment could not happen, which I believe is \nraw politics. It has nothing to do with the individual's ability to \nmake this agency run properly. They didn't want to appoint him because \nthey didn't like the agency--the 45 or so who didn't vote for it. And I \nthink it all boils down to one very simple thing: Consumers are now, \nonce again, left without someone running an agency that will help \nprotect them against these people who prey on individuals in the \nfinancial arena.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Again, Madam President, I am somewhat disappointed, but let me get to \nthe real reason I came to the floor. I came down yesterday and had a \nlot to say about the economy and where we are and the headlines that \nwere reported yesterday. And in less than 48 hours--27 hours--there are \nmore good news headlines.\n  These are some of the headlines I talked about yesterday: ``Jobless \nRate Dips to Lowest Level in More Than 2 Years.'' New York Times. CNN: \n``Dow Closes With the Largest Gain Since March 2009.'' ``Private Sector \nJobs Soar. Payroll Forecasts Rise.'' That is Reuters. The Wall Street \nJournal: ``Online Sales Reached Record $1.25 Billion on Cyber Monday.''\n  On top of that, we had record sales for Thanksgiving weekend--Black \nFriday they call it, and Small Business Saturday. Again, an incredible \nimpact for our economy.\n  What this tells me--even though we get a lot of criticism from the \nother side and others who complain maybe we are not doing our job and \nare frustrated that Washington isn't working as well as it could--and I \nagree there are a lot of areas where we are not able to move forward, \nsuch as the appointment I mentioned a few minutes ago--is there are \ngood examples of policies we have worked through over the last 3 years \nduring this great recession. We have fought kind of a lonely war to get \nthese policies in place.\n  Once again, more good news, and let me read off a couple. This week's \nTime magazine has a whole article entitled ``How America Started \nSelling Cars Again.'' Why is this important? Because this is a \nmanufacturing base for our country. It employs people not only in jobs \nin the automobile industry but it trickles all the way through the \neconomy of the country. It doesn't matter if they are at a port, for \nexample.\n  I remember meeting recently with the folks from the Detroit Port \nAuthority talking about ships and the movement of product from the \nautomobile industry across this country, but also manufacturing and \nother activities throughout the country that support the automobile \nindustry. It is moving forward. It is growing.\n  We took a dramatic step and got a lot of criticism for it. As a \nmatter of fact, no one wants to even mention the words, because \neveryone is so nervous about it. Some call it an auto bailout. And, \nyes, we did do that. That result is a healthy, strong, profitable \nindustry that is bringing jobs to America and creating jobs in America. \nAs a matter of fact, there was an article in the Wall Street Journal \nnot long ago talking about how we are importing jobs from Japan and \nChina back to the United States, to the automobile industry, because it \nis successful.\n  And, oh, by the way, they are paying back all those loans they got \nfrom the Federal Government with interest. So the taxpayers are getting \ntheir money back in full. The net result is, because we helped at the \nright time, we have ensured we are still a player in the automobile \nindustry not only in this country but in the world market. So for those \nwho want to continue to complain and to demonize that action, the net \nresult is we are bringing jobs back to the United States in this \nindustry.\n  The Cash for Clunkers Program was another piece of legislation that \nbarely passed. Again, many of us on this side of the aisle took that \nlonely road because we thought it was the right thing to help move this \neconomy forward. Again, the net result is this industry is profiting \nmore in the last several years. They are producing more jobs not only \nin their industry directly but indirectly. And the naysayers on the \nother side rarely bring this up anymore, because in less than 3 years--\nreally, less than 2 years--this industry has turned itself around \nbecause of American ingenuity and with the help and support from the \nU.S. Government, and that help and support is being paid back with \ninterest in the good old American way.\n  So from my perspective, once again, this is a great story, and I \ncommend Time magazine for talking about the future.\n\n[[Page S8441]]\n\n  Let me also talk about another one. This is from CNBC. I pulled this \noff because I like looking at all the business magazines and Web sites \nevery morning. I glance through quickly to see what is happening, what \nthe markets are doing, what the industry is doing, who is investing, \nwhat are the new businesses, and what is happening out there. Here is \nthis one: ``U.S. Mortgage Applications Jumped Last Week.''\n  This is the industry that fell apart in the beginning of the great \nrecession--the housing industry. A lot of people say that was the main \nreason the economy collapsed. It was a significant portion of it, no \nquestion about it. But let me read this.\n\n       The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally \n     adjusted index of mortgage application activity, which \n     includes both refinancing and home purchase demand, spiked \n     12.8 percent in the week December 2. The MBA's seasonally \n     adjusted index of refinancing applications also jumped, \n     gaining 15.3 percent, while the gauge of loan requests for \n     home purchases rose 8.3 percent.\n\n  By loan requests, these are people who are now saying, I want to \nthink about buying a home. I want to purchase today. I want to start \nexamining what is out there.\n  Here is what the Mortgage Bankers Association's vice president of \nresearch and economics said. These are his words:\n\n       Applications increased significantly as mortgage rates \n     dropped to their lowest levels in about 2 months.\n\n  Actually, overall, it is the lowest level in decades. But we now \nmeasure things by an eighth of a point. So when you are at 4.125 or \n4.25, we are now measuring which is lower overall, but it is lower for \nthe last several decades. Incredible.\n  Let me read another one. This is from Politico, but it is reporting \non the Bloomberg Global Poll--which they started doing in 2009 to sort \nof see where foreign investors will put their money. Where will they \ninvest? Where will they take the dollars they have accumulated or will \ngather through investors and shareholders and so forth? Where are they \ngoing to put their money?\n\n       More than . . . 41 percent, said they expect the U.S. will \n     have one of the strongest performing economies in the world \n     in the coming year--the highest percentage the country has \n     seen since the Bloomberg Global Poll began in October 2009.\n\n  Here is another one. Today, again MSNBC. ``Jobless claims drop to 9-\nmonth low.''\n\n       . . . jobless claims dropped 23,000 to adjusted 381,000--\n\n  That is actually below the magical threshold of 400,000, which people \nwatch. The question is, Will it be consistently under 400,000? We have \nreceived more of these under 400,000 recently than in the last 3 years. \nThat is a good signal that the economy is moving.\n  I know some will say it is not enough. Well, when I came here, half a \nmillion people were losing their jobs every single month. So we have \nnow had 21 consecutive months of job growth in the private sector. That \nis a great statement for us as an economy, this 21 consecutive months \nof job growth. It is an indication our economy is moving.\n  Do we want it to move faster? Of course we do. That is what America \nis about. We want to see things happen right now--today. But this has \nbeen called a great recession. Yet we are pulling ourselves out of it. \nIt takes time and it takes good policy. And, yes, it takes some \nopportunity and taking a little risk, and we did some of that here. We \nmade some decisions that were tough and were not necessarily very \npopular at times.\n  I remember many of the calls I received on some of these issues. But \nwhat is the end result? That is what we have to measure by. Leadership \nis not about waiting for a poll to tell us what is right or wrong or \nwaiting for someone to say, here is the right move because your \nconstituency will vote for you if you do this thing this way. It is \nabout leadership. Sometimes the leadership role is tough. It means \ngetting a few trucks running over you a little bit, leaving some tire \ntracks on your back, but the end result is what we look for.\n  Today, where we are, we have job growth--not as significant as we \nwant but job growth. Where were we? Half a million jobs a month \ndisappearing.\n  Let me cite another one. This is a big issue people are concerned \nabout. As a former mayor, managing a city, you are always looking at \nthe revenues because the revenues tell you how your local economy or, \nif it is State revenue, how your State is doing. If you remember, at \nthe end of 2008, 2009, and beginning of 2010, there was incredible \nconcern about local governments collapsing under the debt and deficit \nspending and unable to manage.\n  As a matter of fact, the markets were concerned about municipal and \nState debt and what that might mean. Oddly enough--and I wish I had \nbrought that article--it hasn't panned out as people thought. Local \ngovernments, State governments are doing better than people \nanticipated. It is still a tough road, no question about it. We still \nhave firefighters, police officers, and teachers who have been laid \noff. We tried to pass a bill here to help that out, but that didn't \nhappen because too many on the other side opposed it.\n  But for State and local governments, here is the latest State revenue \nreport by the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government, University \nat Albany, NY: ``Overall Tax Revenues Show Strong Growth in Second \nQuarter.'' The article speaks to State tax revenues growing by 10.8 \npercent in the second quarter of 2011.\n  As a matter of fact, the year ending June 2011--which is the end of a \nlot of fiscal years for State and local governments--the period \ncorresponding to 46 States--almost all of the States' fiscal years--\ntotal State collections increased by $58 billion in that year, or 8.4 \npercent, from the previous year, the strongest annual gain since 2005.\n  What does that mean? That means local economies, State governments, \nare starting to recover. It is still a rough road but starting to \nrecover. Good signs. That means there is more economic activity within \ntheir communities. It means businesses are replanting and redesigning \ntheir opportunities in those communities. People are buying homes, as I \nmentioned, which means they are paying property taxes, which means \nthose local governments can hire police and fire and paramedics and \nteachers.\n  Again, I could probably come here every day and give this kind of \ngood news. Because what we all hear--today, the market is down. I \nforget what it is--70, 80 points, maybe 100 today--but the headlines \nwill be: market crashes or market dips significantly.\n  Here is the reality. Since March of 2009, the market is up, even with \ntoday's activity, 81 percent. That means my son's 529 account is better \ntoday than it was 3 years ago. That is good because that means my wife \nand I can afford to make sure he can go to college someday. But it also \nmeans retirement accounts have more resources in them today than they \ndid 2\\1/2\\ or 3 years ago. It means public pension programs and \ninvestment retirement programs that invest in these kinds of markets \nalso are doing better. But, again, the headline will be that the sky is \nfalling because that is what people like to do. They like to prey on \nfear rather than opportunity.\n  I think a lot of us on this side believed in the opportunity, in the \nfuture of this great country 3 years ago when we sat here and made some \ntough decisions over the first 18 months in my term. Tough decisions. \nBut we believed in what was possible. We believed that this economy \nwould turn around with a little help from the people who live here, \nwork here, and see the future.\n  We also knew we had to do a little bit. We had to do something \nextraordinary to create the opportunities for the future of this great \ncountry. As I mentioned, private sector jobs increased, the automobile \nindustry better than ever before, home sales doing better than they \nwere 2\\1/2\\ years ago, the market is up by 80 percent--all good news. \nBut we don't hear a lot of those as the front-page, above-the-fold, \nbig, bold headlines because they are not sexy. They are not \ncontroversial. But that is what is happening. If a lot of us around \nhere had more belief in the potential, it would be incredible what \ncould happen.\n  Let me end on this note; that is, we are in the middle of the debate \non continuing tax relief for the folks who are working every day, the \npeople I just talked about who are buying homes, buying cars, paying \ntaxes. We are saying to them: We want to make sure you\n\n[[Page S8442]]\n\ncontinue to receive the dollars in your pocket.\n  In my State, that is $300 million--just in my State, $300 million \nwith the payroll tax deduction that they get to keep for 400,000 \nAlaskans instead of the IRS taking it. I don't know about you, but I \nthink that is a good thing.\n  I know some will say: We have no proof this works. Well, I just gave \nproof. I will give proof every day if necessary. Yes, we can't say this \ncertain industry came back because of this one little item. But I will \ntell you, if we put $300 million in my State into the hands of 400,000, \nAlaskans, a little over $1,000 per person, the net result is they are \ngoing to spend that money in the economy. They are going to buy that \ncar, that washing machine, or go on that vacation. They are going to \nspend that money in this economy. Yes, there is no fancy report that \nsaid this business succeeded because we gave them this special tax \nbreak--which we shouldn't do. We gave to the people of this country an \nincredible opportunity to take their money and put it to work.\n  Mr. President, 160 million families will benefit--160 million \nfamilies will benefit by this action today. People making $50,000 or \nless will put back about $1,000 into their pockets again--not in the \nIRS's pocket but into the consumers' pockets that they will spend.\n  Again, I will hear from the other side how bad it is, that there is \nno proof, that this may not work. It is working. They can deny it all \nthey want, but I will continue to lay all the facts down. It is not me \nproducing this out of some government document. It is mostly some very \nconservative publications reporting on the good news.\n  I hope the folks on the other side--and I know we picked up a \nRepublican from when we had this before. This is a modified, \ncompromised version that didn't pass last week to say: OK, we are \ntrying to compromise. But we are keeping it simple and trying to do it \nin a way that ensures that middle-class Americans, and Alaskans whom I \nrepresent, put more money in their pockets, people who are working \nevery day, making a difference in the economy--not people who are just \non the top end of the cycle. I know that is the great debate, and we \ndiffer and I differ with several people on the other side.\n  I do believe people who make $1 million or more should pay a little \nbit more. I don't have any heartburn over that. It is 235,000 people we \nare talking about versus 160 million. That is who I want to put my \ninvestment in because I know those people, who are individuals, \nfamilies, and a significant portion of small businesspeople who will \ncontinue to build this economy.\n  As a matter of fact, the best growth period and growth pattern right \nnow is small business. They are the ones that are the backbone of this \neconomy. Those are the ones that we need to help. That is what this \nbill does. I hope we find the magical success.\n  I wish we would have 50 majority votes like the rest of this world \noperates under. For some reason, this place has to have special rules \nand make it complicated and hard for anything to get done. But maybe \nthere will be some people who join and want to support the American \npeople and support giving them tax relief and making sure their lives \nare better, especially at this time of year with Christmas around the \ncorner. I would love to give them a good Christmas gift. I think all of \nus would. Let's do it. Let's do it today. Let's do it for the American \npeople. Let's do it for my constituency in Alaska, for your \nconstituency, Mr. President, and all the rest in this room.\n  Mr. President, if there is one thing I look for, if it makes a \ndifference for Alaska, if it is about Alaska, I am there. This is not \nonly about Alaska, it is about this country. It is about the middle \nclass. Not only am I there, I am double there, and I hope we find \nopportunity in this Chamber to do the right thing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that any time spent during a \nquorum call between now and 2:30 p.m. be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today the Senate will consider my \nlegislation again to extend the temporary payroll tax cut.\n  This week, the Senate has been given another opportunity to do the \nright thing and provide much needed relief to the American worker.\n  It shouldn't be news to anyone that Americans are desperate for \nsolutions. Millions of Americans are unemployed, underemployed, or have \nsimply given up looking for a job.\n  In between looking for a job or higher paying employment, Americans \nare busy trying to figure out how to handle high health care costs, \nlooming bankruptcy, and the threat of foreclosure.\n  As a Senator from Nevada, I understand how difficult it is, perhaps \nmore than any of my other colleagues. My State has the unfortunate \ndistinction of leading the Nation in unemployment, in bankruptcies, and \nin foreclosures. I hear from my constituents every day on these issues. \nNevadans--Democrats, Independents, and Republicans--are looking to \nCongress for answers, and they are frustrated that they are not getting \nthem.\n  Even with the economic difficulty Americans across the country are \nexperiencing, Congress appears to be prepared to stage a partisan \nstandoff rather than extending a payroll tax cut for hard-working \nAmericans. I cannot allow this to happen. Americans deserve solutions.\n  The plan I have introduced to extend the payroll tax cut is a \nworkable solution that will provide relief for Americans responsibly. \nIn fact, the solution I am proposing today borrows a cost-cutting idea \nfrom the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles Commission that can actually pass \nCongress and be signed into law.\n  My proposal allows American taxpayers to hold on to more of their \nhard-earned wages while not punishing the Nation's job creators as the \nmajority proposes. Under my plan, American taxpayers will not see a tax \nincrease. In fact, my plan prevents a tax increase on those already \nreceiving a payroll tax credit. Today, Congress can do the right thing \nby allowing employers to continue to invest in their businesses so they \ncan plan for the future and, of course, hire more workers.\n  I understand that Democrats would prefer to pay for the payroll \nextension by raising taxes on employers. But treating tax dollars \nresponsibly is absolutely necessary if we are going to see long-term \neconomic growth in this country. In this case, we can extend the \npayroll tax cut and still pay for it.\n  I also understand that not all Republicans support my plan. To be \nhonest, I disagree with some of my colleagues who claim a payroll tax \nholiday is not necessary. I believe that we should allow more Americans \nto hold on to their hard-earned wages. For those who are already \nstruggling to live within their means, this payroll tax cut will \ncontinue some much needed relief.\n  Today, I am asking my Republican and Democratic colleagues to come \ntogether and join me to help continue the payroll tax holiday without \nraising taxes on businesses in America. This will help preserve long-\nterm job growth in the future.\n  My proposal is a workable solution containing provisions endorsed by \nboth the majority and my colleagues in the House of Representatives. \nThis is the only version of the payroll tax cut that has the potential \nto pass Congress and to be signed into law.\n  My proposal pays for the payroll tax cut by reducing government \nspending where it is no longer needed and requires the richest \nAmericans to pay higher premiums for Medicare. This will allow us to \nstrengthen and preserve Medicare for those Americans who rely on the \nprogram the most.\n  This is the same approach endorsed by Democrats who say the richest \nAmericans should do more. Americans want solutions. They do not want \nmore partisan bickering.\n  This week Congress has another opportunity to do the right thing to \nhelp hard-working Americans extend the payroll tax cut holiday.\n  I make calls back to my home State every week. In those calls, I ask \nNevadans if they think their children will have access to a better, \nbrighter future than their own. For the first time in history, a \nmajority of Americans and a majority of Nevadans believe their children \nwill have less opportunity. By continuing down this path of \npartisanship, Congress is robbing the American people of the dream for \ntheir children. This needs to stop.\n\n[[Page S8443]]\n\n  We in this body need to seriously consider the high stakes of the \npolitical games that continue to unfold on this Senate floor. American \nworkers need solutions and they need relief right now. Congress should \ncome together today, put partisanship aside, and pass meaningful \nlegislation that will benefit all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak about an \nissue we will be voting on today and we have been discussing and \ndebating now for a number of days. We are into our second week of \ndebate about a cut in the payroll tax. Just by way of review--and so \nmany Americans have been following this debate--here is where it \nbasically stands between what we did last year and what we are trying \nto do this year.\n  Last year, as part of a larger tax bill, we reduced the payroll tax \nfor employees across the country from 6.2 percent to 4.2. So that 2-\npercent reduction meant millions of American families were able to have \nabout $1,000 in their pocket of take-home pay they wouldn't have had \notherwise absent that action in the tax bill. What we are trying to do \nthis year--and I should start with what I tried to do last week, and we \ngot 51 votes for this--is to say we should not only continue or extend \nthat cut in the payroll tax but we should expand it. So instead of \nsaying it should go from 6.2 to 4.2, we take it down to 3.1. In \nessence, what we tried to do last week was cut in half the payroll \ntaxes that relate to employees. We wanted to add to that cutting in \nhalf the payroll tax for small businesses, and they would benefit \ndisproportionately. Thirdly, we wanted to add to that a tax credit so \nthat if an employer hired or increased wages for employees, if an \nemployer expands their payroll in one of several ways, they can get a \ntax credit equal to an elimination of the payroll tax. So instead of \nthe usual 6.2, you would be down to zero. So the combination of those \nthree would mean we would be helping employees by cutting their payroll \ntax in half, helping employers by cutting their payroll contribution in \nhalf, and then have this third element as well for employers who \nactually hired people or added to their wage base.\n  Unfortunately, in the Senate, because we needed 60 votes and got 51, \nwe knew at that point we couldn't get enough support from the other \nside of the aisle. So what I did, in working with our leadership and \nworking with folks in the Senate, was to refashion the legislation so \nthat we made it smaller. We reduced the cost of the overall proposal by \nsome $80 billion. We also concentrate on just the element we worked on \ntogether last year, which was the employee side.\n  Here is where we are in this debate about cutting the employee \npayroll taxes. It is down to this question: Should we cut it to 4.2, as \nwe did last year, or should we cut it further and reduce it in half? I \nbelieve we should, and I think most Americans believe that.\n  Here is what it means to folks out there. Instead of saying we will \ncontinue what we did last year--which would be about $1,000 per worker, \nin essence, per family, on average--if we cut it in half, we can get \nthat number up to $1,500. So it is not just putting money in people's \npockets and continuing to do that for another year, but it is more \nmoney. It would go from roughly $1,000 to approximately $1,500.\n  That is where we are. Unfortunately, we are not yet sure we can get \nthe support we need to do that.\n  Here is what it means to Americans. It means more money in their \npockets, more take-home pay, but it also means that if we don't, at a \nminimum, extend the payroll tax cut from last year--here is what it \nmeans on two issues: GDP--gross domestic product--and jobs. According \nto Mark Zandi of Moody's--someone we have quoted often on both sides of \nthe aisle and relied on his expertise--not extending the payroll tax at \nleast to the 4.2 level would reduce 2012 growth of real GDP in a State \nsuch as Pennsylvania, by way of example, by 0.52 percentage points. \nThat means we are talking about gross domestic product or gross State \nproduct, in a sense, in a State such as Pennsylvania, cutting it in \nhalf instead of allowing it to grow. So this has a real adverse \nconsequence for Pennsylvania and for the country if we don't do what we \ndid last year.\n  Of course, if we did more than we did last year, as I think we should \nand I think most people do, we could not only not fall behind, but we \ncould move forward dramatically.\n  Here is another way to look at it: Jobs. According to Mark Zandi, not \nextending the payroll tax cut will cost Pennsylvania 19,700 payroll \njobs in the calendar year 2012. For context, in the State of \nPennsylvania last year, the payroll tax job creation number--or payroll \njobs added last year--was 54,500. So we created last year in a State \nsuch as Pennsylvania almost 55,000 jobs. But if we don't extend the \npayroll tax cut this year, we are talking about losing as many as \nalmost 20,000 jobs. This is a substantial factor in the discussion \nabout our economy. It would have a substantially adverse impact if we \ndon't keep the payroll tax cut in place.\n  As I said before, we should do more than we did last year. We should \ncut it in half. It would give people across the country peace of mind \nin two time periods: The next couple weeks when they are going out and \nshopping and enjoying the holidays. We want people to spend as much as \nthey feel they can, and if they know they are going to get $1,000 to \n$1,500, they can spend more in this upcoming holiday season. But it is \nespecially important for 2012. Why should taxpayers have to live with a \ntax increase because Washington just didn't get along and the same old \npolitical games were played in Washington instead of saying let's come \ntogether in a bipartisan way and extend and expand the payroll tax cut \nfrom last year.\n  We have lots to do in the next couple days and weeks. But maybe the \nmost important thing we can do in the next few days is to make sure we \ncut the payroll tax again. Because this is about whether we are going \nto give people peace of mind as we head into a new year and whether we \nare going to put more money in their pockets in order to jump-start the \neconomy, to give the economy the jolt we got at the end of last year. \nLast year, we came together and passed a tax bill and we had average \njob growth from February, March, and April 2011--those 3 months--\naverage private sector job growth of just about 240,000 jobs. We need \nanother 3-month period similar to that. In fact, we need another 6 or 7 \nor 8 months similar to that. But the only way to get there is to put in \nplace this payroll tax cut.\n  I hope when we vote later today, we will get at least 60 votes for \nthis effort to make sure we are giving Americans peace of mind and more \nmoney in their pockets.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak \ndespite the expiration of the majority's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I begin by thanking my colleagues, many of whom served \nin the last Congress. I thank them for extending the payroll tax cut at \nthat time, providing a payroll tax cut from 6.2 percent to 4.2 percent. \nI thank them on behalf of myself. I was not a Member of this body at \nthat time. I thank them on behalf of the American people. They are due \nthat thanks and appreciation for that vision and courage in extending \nthat measure in cutting the\n\n[[Page S8444]]\n\npayroll tax so as to lessen the recession. We have only to listen to \nthe virtually unanimous opinion of economists to the effect that we \nsaved the Nation, this body saved the Nation from a deeper recession.\n  Now I ask my colleagues to undertake a similar mission, to accomplish \nthe same goal, to once again save the Nation from a deeper recession. \nThe recovery of this Nation's economy has been fragile and slow. Many \neconomists--notably, Mark Zandi, who has been quoted by my \ndistinguished colleague from Pennsylvania--say that a failure to extend \nit will mean a new recession. We are talking about average Americans, \nordinary people who are hurting and struggling. They are hurting \neconomically and struggling to find jobs. They are struggling to stay \nin their homes and keep their families together at a time of year when \njoy and satisfaction ought to be the quality of their lives. They \ndeserve this measure of peace of mind, as my colleague from \nPennsylvania, Bob Casey, has referred to it. But all of us--the entire \nNation--deserve the economic security, which is a matter of national \nsecurity.\n  Rescuing this country from continuing debt and deficit means \nreturning to full employment. Twenty-five percent of our deficit can be \neliminated by going back to lower rates of unemployment.\n  Economic recovery is a means to countering and curtailing what the \nformer Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff called a national crisis \nand a security threat.\n  Economic recovery depends on consumer demand. As I go around the \nState of Connecticut, businesspeople tell me what they need most is \nconsumer demand. Their confidence and certainty about the future of the \neconomy, their willingness to invest, depends on consumer demand. That \nkind of factor, that need is what ought to motivate all of my \ncolleagues--every Member of this body--to vote for this measure, not \nonly extending that payroll tax cut but also reducing it by 3.1 \npercent.\n  We are talking about anywhere from $1,400 to $1,500 or more in the \npockets of people around the country, people around the State of \nConnecticut. The average middle-class family in Connecticut earns \n$83,797 per year and would save $1,676 in taxes under the current \npayroll tax cut. Let me give you those numbers again. The average \nmiddle-class family in Connecticut earns $83,797 per year--back in \ntheir pockets $1,676 in taxes under the current payroll tax cut as \nproposed in this measure.\n  We are talking here about a compromise. Our side of the aisle has \nmodified this bill to make it about one-third smaller in size and cost. \nThis legislation will no longer give employers a tax break. We have \npulled back on the magnitude of this measure. But it will still affect \n160 million workers who will receive nearly $1,500 in additional take-\nhome pay.\n  This bill will be paid for by measures that were coming from the \ndeficit reduction proposals contained in a number of the \nsupercommittee's ideas. It is paid for by fees charged by Fannie Mae \nand Freddie and by a proposal suggested by my colleague, the Republican \nleader. The cost-saving reform suggested by him would make millionaires \nineligible for unemployment compensation and food stamps.\n  This legislation also levies a surcharge, a temporary 10-year \nsurcharge, on the highest earners in American society, who can well \nafford it when their own interests would be extraordinarily well served \nby the consumer demand and economic recovery that would be generated.\n  I know many of my colleagues, including the Presiding Officer, are \nconcerned about the effect on Social Security, and so am I. The Social \nSecurity trust fund is a trust, a sacred trust that we are honor bound \nto protect. And I would not vote for this measure if I thought it \ncreated a threat, a real threat, to the viability of that fund. But I \nbelieve the assurance we have received from the chief actuary of that \nfund--and it is contained in a letter to Secretary Geithner and to \nJacob Lew, it was printed in the Congressional Record yesterday by \nSenator Casey, and it assures that the effect would be negligible. In \nfact, it says the trust funds would be ``unaffected.'' It uses that \nword, and I will quote directly from the letter.\n\n       We estimate that the projected level of the OASI and DI \n     Trust Funds would be unaffected by enactment of this \n     provision.\n\n  That letter comes from the chief actuary of the trust fund, and I am \nprepared to rely on that assurance and to say that I believe this kind \nof measure is the responsible thing to do at this point in our economic \nhistory to make sure our recovery is continuing.\n  The effects of failing to do so: The economists differ whether the \nrate of growth will suffer by .5 percent, which is Mark Zandi; or .66 \npercent, Goldman Sachs; or 1 percent, RBC Capital Markets; or 1.5 \npercent, Michael Pond. Whatever the specific percentage, we know it \nwill be grave and serious in the damage to our economy if we fail to \nextend and enlarge the tax cut.\n  So I urge my colleagues to heed the voices they are hearing back \nhome, as I am hearing from ordinary citizens, middle-class families.\n  We are talking about a middle-class family measure that will benefit \npeople like Marilyn in Bloomfield, who writes to me:\n\n       I believe these cuts need to remain in effect in order to \n     avoid deepening the recession we are in. I urge you to \n     support the President's jobs plan and pass as much of it as \n     you can in upcoming legislative sessions, for the benefit of \n     struggling families.\n\n  She writes and she says ``to urge you to vote in favor of extending \nthe payroll tax cut for workers beyond Dec 31. . . . ''\n  Listen to people like Ginny. They are in every one of our States. \nGinny, who is from Southport, CT, writes:\n\n       I know you will do the right thing when the payroll tax cut \n     and increasing the taxes of only the 2nd million and above of \n     wealthy Americans comes up for a vote. I have faith in you.\n       With the economy still struggling to recover and millions \n     of Americans struggling to put food on the table this holiday \n     season, we cannot afford to raise taxes on working Americans.\n\n  Those voices from middle-class families are reaching this body every \nday. We have heard them before. This body heeded them last year in \nenacting this tax cut. I thank every Member who voted for it. It was a \nbipartisan vote. I hope this one will be as well. I will be proud to \njoin Members from both sides of the aisle, and I hope this measure will \nhave support--overwhelming support--from both sides of the aisle in \nshowing the American people we can come together, bridge our \ndifferences, and compromise.\n  This measure reflects a compromise on both sides. I hope it will be \npassed later in the day.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs \non agreeing to the motion to proceed to S. 1944, which is subject to a \n60-affirmative-vote threshold.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I wish to thank the Senator from Tennessee for \nhis graciousness to make a very few brief remarks.\n  I wish to call to the attention of the Senate that there are some \ngood things that are happening in Medicare. In the health care bill--\nwhich was a very complicated piece of legislation--there are a lot of \ngood things. There were some things that are implemented over time, \nthat if mistakes had been made, we can correct those mistakes as they \nare starting to be implemented.\n  I wish to point out some of the salutary things that are happening \nunder the new health care reform bill with regard to Medicaid. It was \njust this week that the agency that runs Medicare, the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, announced that more seniors and \npeople with disabilities on Medicare are seeing significantly lower \ncosts for important health care because of this new law.\n  For example, what we are seeing for the first time is that millions \nof Americans on Medicare are now getting free physical exams as part of \ntheir preventive medicine. Because of the doughnut hole, which is that \ncomplicated black hole senior citizens would fall into when they were \ngetting assistance for their prescription drugs, well, lo and behold, \nthat doughnut hole is being filled by the Federal Government assisting \nthem in paying for those drugs. Therefore, they are getting a lot more \nof their drugs without having to pay for them.\n  For example, Nationwide has over 2.5 million people on Medicare who \nhave saved more than $1.5 billion on their prescriptions. If we boil \nthat down to my State of Florida, we have 172,000 Medicare recipients \nwho save $96 million, which is an average for the senior citizen in \nFlorida of $563 per person per year.\n  In the case of physical exams, we have over 24 million people in the \ncountry who now have taken advantage of having one of these free \nphysical exams in order to help with the preventive health care aspects \nthat the bill was aimed at. In my State, where there are a lot of \nsenior citizens, close to 2 million senior citizens have taken \nadvantage of those physical exams.\n  Remember how we were discussing the doom and gloom of Medicare \nAdvantage? What has happened to Medicare Advantage? We had to change it \nbecause Medicare Advantage before, under the previous law, had a 14-\npercent bump over and above Medicare fee-for-service. The Federal \nGovernment was going to go broke if we did\n\n[[Page S8446]]\n\nnot do something about that. Where was that money going? It was going \nto the insurance company because Medicare Advantage is a fancy term for \nMedicare given through an insurance company and HMO.\n  What has happened? If we look all across the country at Medicare \nAdvantage, enrollments are up and the premiums senior citizens pay are \ndown. Look at the State of Florida in this last year. Enrollment was up \nby 6 percent, premiums decreased by about 10 percent. What is happening \nnow in 2012? Enrollments are up almost 20 percent and the premiums are \ngoing down by a whopping 26 percent. That means more seniors are going \nto have access to higher quality care while paying less, and it is a \nwin-win-win. It is clearly a win for the country that we are leveling \nout all of the excess bumps. It is clearly a win to the senior citizen \nand, in the process, the insurance companies are giving better quality \ncare.\n  I wanted to bring this to the attention of the Senate, and I do thank \nmy colleague from Tennessee for his generosity in allowing me to make \nthese comments prior to his.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we hear a lot about tax breaks and \ntax loopholes around the Senate. I wish to talk about a tax loophole, a \nbig one, that is on its way out. It is a $23 billion tax loophole. It \nis not a loophole in the tax code of Washington, DC. It is a loophole \nin virtually every State in the country. It is a loophole that prefers \nsome taxpayers over other taxpayers. It subsidizes some businesses over \nother businesses. Because of that loophole, it causes tax rates in \nStates to be higher, and it causes States to have less money to fund \nthe universities or the State parks or the schools or the other \nexpenses that are legitimate in the operation of a State.\n  I say it is a tax loophole that is on its way out because after 10 \nyears, Senator Enzi of Wyoming and Senator Durbin of Illinois have \nproduced a piece of legislation that is rare in Washington, DC. It is \nonly 10 pages long. It is very simple. It is a States rights piece of \nlegislation that gives each State the right to decide for itself how to \ncollect its State sales tax from everybody who owes it, whether that \nperson buys a pair of cowboy boots in Nashville or whether that person \nbuys a pair of cowboy boots online.\n  Senator Enzi and Senator Durbin introduced the Marketplace Fairness \nAct 4 weeks ago. It has five Republican sponsors and five Democratic \nsponsors. I am one of those sponsors. This is the bill that solves the \nproblem of the online sales tax loophole, the one I described a little \nearlier. I mentioned cowboy boots. Let me describe what I am talking \nabout in practical terms.\n  I called the owner of the Nashville Boot Company a couple weeks ago. \nHis name is Frank Harwell. He sold boots online, and he sells them to \npeople who walk into his store in west Nashville. When he started the \ncompany, almost all of his boots were sold online. Here is what he says \nis happening to him today: People come into the store in Nashville and \nthey try on cowboy boots. They find a pair they like and then they go \nhome and buy the cowboy boots online in order to save the State sales \ntax.\n  They owe the sales tax. Many people don't know they owe it. They owe \nthe sales tax as much as if they had bought the boots at the cowboy \nboot store in Nashville. They don't pay it. Why is that? Under the \nState law, when Frank Harwell sells a pair of cowboy boots in his store \nin Nashville, he collects the sales tax and sends it to the State.\n  But under the law, the Supreme Court said 20 years ago, the State of \nTennessee or the State of Missouri or the State of Washington could not \nrequire an out-of-State seller to collect the same sales tax. They had \na reason for doing so, and it was a good reason. They said it was so \ncomplicated to do that it put a burden on interstate commerce. But at \nthe same time, the Supreme Court invited the Congress to fix the \nproblem. By fixing the problem, that means the Congress could act in \norder to create a fair way for States to require retailers that are \nout-of-State to collect the same sales tax retailers on Main Street \ncollect.\n  Over that 20 years, the online sales tax loophole got to be a big \nloophole. It subsidizes some businesses at the expense of others and, \nas I said earlier, prefers some taxpayers at the expense of others.\n  Last week, the Hudson Institute, a generally conservative \norganization, released a new report that explains how the subsidizing \nof out-of-State sellers works and how the Federal Government--those of \nus in Washington--are keeping States from closing this loophole. Hudson \nconcludes that this online sales tax loophole is distorting the \nmarketplace, and I urge my colleagues to take a serious look at the \nHudson Institute report.\n  Governors and legislators are up in arms because they are being \ndeprived of the right to enforce their own sales tax law. This is a \nlittle different loophole--actually, a little worse one. Usually, \nloopholes are written into the law. Those are the kind we are trying to \nchange in our tax reform proposals in Washington. This is a tax that is \nalready owed. This is a tax that is already owed that Governors and \nlegislators want to collect. It is used to pay for the things States \nneed to pay for or reduce a tax. In the State of Tennessee, which has a \nvery high sales tax, if the State was allowed to collect sales tax from \nout-of-State retailers the same way it does from Main Street retailers, \nthen we might postpone the day of a State income tax, which are \nprobably three of the most hated words in the tax vocabulary in \nTennessee.\n  I said, when Senator Enzi and Senator Durbin introduced their bill, \nthat I believed they had solved the problem and that if I were an out-\nof-State retailer or an online retailer, I would begin to make plans to \ncollect sales tax the same way Main Street collectors collect it today, \nand many have. For example, Amazon--which had opposed for a long time \nthis kind of legislation because, in their view, it was too complicated \nfor them to figure out what the tax might be--changed their mind, and \nsaid the Enzi-Durbin bill is a good bill and Amazon now supports it. \nThat is not all. Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, a strong conservative \nRepublican Governor and former chairman of the Republican Governors \nAssociation, wrote a letter on November 29 which I wish to quote:\n\n       In the early days of the Internet, the complexities of \n     collecting State sales taxes across thousands of State and \n     local sales tax jurisdictions were major obstacles. The \n     technology simply didn't exist to expect startups to comply \n     with the various tax compliance rules in every part of the \n     country. But today, e-commerce has grown, and there is simply \n     no longer a compelling reason for government to continue \n     giving online retailers special treatment over small \n     businesses who reside on the Main Streets across Mississippi \n     and the country.\n\n  Governor Barbour continues:\n\n       The time to level the playing field is now, as there are no \n     effective barriers to complying with state sales tax laws.\n\n  Here is what Governor Barbour is saying: Twenty years ago we didn't \nhave the kind of software and information we do today. If I want to \nknow what the weather is in Maryville, TN, where I live, I put in \n``weather'' and my ZIP Code, 37886. Under this new bill and under the \ntechnology that exists today, States will be required to give out-of-\nState retailers or online retailers the software that will permit them \nto do the same thing. If I order a pair of cowboy boots, they can put \nin my name, the cost of the boots, and the ZIP Code, and the software \nwill compute the tax and even find a way to send it on to the State. It \nwill be just as easy, or maybe even easier, for the out-of-State \nretailers to collect the sales tax that is owed as it will be for a \ncowboy boots store selling it out of the front door in Nashville.\n  The National Governors Association sent a letter last week saying \nthat the Enzi-Durbin bill represents a commonsense approach that will \nallow States to collect taxes they are owed, help businesses comply \nwith different State tax laws, and provide fair competition between \nretailers that will benefit consumers.\n  Last week, the Judiciary Committee in the House of Representatives \nheld an oversight hearing to discuss all three bills that have been \nintroduced to address this issue and there was a lot of good \ndiscussion. I wish to share a few things that were said and I hope we \ncan have a similar hearing in the Senate soon.\n\n[[Page S8447]]\n\n  Mike Pence of Indiana, one of the leading conservatives in Congress \nand a fellow who knows a tax when he sees one, said:\n\n       I don't think Congress should be in the business of picking \n     winners and losers. Inaction by Congress today results in a \n     system that does pick winners and losers.\n\n  Congressman Pence also talked about something I want to make sure my \ncolleagues understand. The Enzi-Durbin bill is not talking about taxing \nthe Internet. It is not talking about creating a new tax. As far as the \nInternet access tax goes, the Senate debated that a few years ago. I \nwas in the middle of that debate and I was in the middle of the \nsolution that imposed a moratorium on the Internet access tax. That law \nis still there. We are not talking about an Internet access tax. \nNeither are we talking about a new tax. We are talking about the plain \nold State sales tax that already exists. It is very hard to imagine how \nanyone can say collecting a tax that is already owed is a new tax.\n  Governor Barbour and Congressman Pence are correct; 20 years ago the \ntechnology didn't exist. Today it does. About the only ones complaining \nare the taxpayers and businesses that enjoy being subsidized by other \ntaxpayers and other businesses, and that, in our opinion, is not \ncorrect tax policy.\n  As Republicans, I believe our party should oppose government policies \nthat prefer some taxpayers over others or some businesses over others. \nAs Republicans, I believe we should support States rights, and our bill \ndoes that by giving the State the right to make the decision about how \nto collect its own taxes: Do you want to collect taxes from everybody \nwho owes the tax, or do you not want to? Do you want to prefer some \nout-of-State businesses over in-State businesses, or do you not want \nto? Do you want to collect the tax, reduce tax rates, or spend the \nmoney on services? That is up to the States.\n  These sentiments are also shared by the late William F. Buckley and \nAl Cardenas, chairman of the American Conservative Union. Ten years ago \nWilliam Buckley, who many people see as the father of the modern \nconservative movement, wrote in the National Review:\n\n       The mattress maker in Connecticut is willing to compete \n     with the company in Massachusetts, but doesn't like it if \n     out-of-State businesses are, in practical terms, subsidized; \n     that's what the non-tax amounts to. Local concerns are \n     complaining about traffic in mattresses and books and records \n     and computer equipment which, ordered through the Internet \n     come in, so to speak, duty free.\n\n  That is William F. Buckley.\n  Then Al Cardenas, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, a \ndistinguished man from Florida, and the head of an outfit that is \narguably as strong and influential as any conservative organization in \nWashington, said in his recent essay:\n\n       There is no more glaring example of misguided government \n     power than when taxes or regulations affect two similar \n     businesses completely differently.\n\n  As I have said many times before, I believe the Enzi-Durbin \nlegislation solves the problem. I believe it is going to happen. I hope \nthat out-of-State sellers and online sellers will move ahead to work \nwith States to make voluntary agreements as, for example, Amazon has in \nTennessee, and begin to allow States to enforce their tax policy \nproperly.\n  Our bill is a remarkable feat in Washington, DC. I have mentioned it \nbefore and I wish to emphasize it again. It is only 10 pages long. It \nis only about allowing States to make a decision about whether they \nwant to close a tax loophole. It is about stopping the subsidization of \nsome taxpayers over others. It is about stopping the subsidization of \nsome businesses over others. I am glad others are starting to share \nthis view, and as more Senators learn about the Marketplace Fairness \nAct and look at the options it gives each State, I hope and I believe \nwe will have more cosponsors.\n  Ten years ago the bills introduced weren't adequate to solve the \nproblem. Fortunately, today, Senator Enzi and Senator Durbin have \nsolved the problem. I agree, Democratic Senators agree, the chairman of \nthe American Conservative Union agrees, a former chairman of the \nRepublican Governors Association agrees, Congressman Mike Pence agrees: \nIt is a matter of marketplace fairness.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter to \nwhich I referred from Mississippi Governor Barbour, a letter from the \nNational Governors Association, and the National Journal article \npublished last week regarding the House Judiciary Committee hearing on \nthis subject.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             State of Mississippi,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                   Jackson, MS, November 29, 2011.\n     Hon. Mike Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Lamar Alexander,\n     Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi and Senator Alexander: I am writing to \n     congratulate you on the introduction of the Marketplace \n     Fairness Act and offer my support for its timely passage.\n       Fifteen years ago, when e-commerce was still a nascent \n     industry, it made sense to exempt startups like Amazon.com \n     from collecting and remitting sales taxes in states where \n     they had no facilities. As chairman of the Republican Party, \n     I was there when discussions surrounding the Internet \n     commerce tax moratorium took place, and this was only to last \n     until e-commerce had truly taken root. I supported this \n     effort then, because I believed this budding industry needed \n     every opportunity to thrive and grow. Looking back, I think \n     it's clear we made the right call as America is home to the \n     largest and most dynamic e-commerce companies in the world.\n       In the early days of the Internet, the complexities of \n     collecting sales taxes across thousands of state and local \n     tax jurisdictions were major obstacles. The technology simply \n     didn't exist to expect startups to comply with the various \n     tax compliance rules in every part of the country. But today, \n     e-commerce has grown, and there is simply no longer a \n     compelling reason for government to continue giving online \n     retailers special treatment over small businesses who reside \n     on the Main Streets across Mississippi and the country. The \n     time to level the playing field is now, as there are no \n     effective barriers to complying with states' tax laws.\n       As Governor of Mississippi, I value the important role that \n     our Main Street retailers play in our communities. Failure to \n     level the playing field threatens to, and in fact has, run \n     many of them out of business, taking with them jobs and the \n     sizable contribution they make to not just our community \n     culture, but to the Organizations who have long benefited \n     from their charitable involvement.\n       States should not be deprived of their right to establish \n     and collect taxes as they see fit. I've stood for lower taxes \n     and smaller government my entire career in public life, but \n     I've also stood for the authority of states to devise their \n     own tax laws without being overridden by the federal \n     government for no existing purpose.\n       Finally, government shouldn't be picking winners and \n     losers. In this area, at least, the Marketplace Fairness Act \n     will end that practice, and that's something conservatives \n     should be proud to support.\n       I again applaud you for addressing this important issue and \n     I look forward to working with you to end the special \n     treatment for online retailers and give everyone the \n     opportunity to compete fairly.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Haley Barbour,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 28, 2011.\n     Hon. Richard Durbin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Michael Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Lamar Alexander,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin, Senator Enzi, Senator Johnson and \n     Senator Alexander: The National Governors Association \n     applauds your efforts to level the playing field between Main \n     Street retailers and online sellers by introducing S. 1832, \n     the ``Marketplace Fairness Act.''\n       As you know, years ago the Supreme Court opinion in Quill \n     Corp. v. North Dakota stated that Congress has the authority \n     to require out-of-state sellers to collect sales taxes. At \n     present, states are unable to collect more than $22 billion \n     in sales taxes annually from remote sales made through \n     catalogues or over the Internet. This also creates a price \n     disparity between goods bought from the corner store and \n     those bought online, effectively giving a continuing and \n     growing subsidy to Internet sales.\n       Since the Quill ruling, at least two facts have changed: \n     (1) the proliferation of computers to calculate taxes due on \n     sales--just as shipping costs are determined based on Zip \n     Code--and (2) a state agreement on streamlining and \n     simplifying sales taxes so that it is easier to collect and \n     remit sales taxes wherever a company does business.\n       The Marketplace Fairness Act recognizes these changes and \n     uses them to grant authority to states that simplify their \n     tax systems to make it easier to do business. This common \n     sense approach will allow states to collect the taxes they \n     are owed, help businesses comply with different state laws, \n     and\n\n[[Page S8448]]\n\n     provide fair competition between retailers that will benefit \n     consumers.\n       NGA looks forward to working with you as you work to enact \n     the Marketplace Fairness Act and create a more level playing \n     field for all sellers and consumers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Governor Bill Haslam,\n                                                        Tennessee.\n                                   Governor Christine O.

North Dakota that \n     found catalog and other retailers do not have to collect \n     sales taxes from customers in states where they do not have a \n     physical store or other facility. Since then, online \n     retailers have exploited the loophole to the tune of billions \n     in lost tax revenue, according to state officials.\n       ``It is estimated that currently in the state of Texas \n     between $600 million and $800 million is not collected on \n     out-of-state sales. . . . That points out to me the unfair \n     competition that my storefronts are competing against,'' \n     Texas state Rep. John Otto, a Republican, told the committee.\n       Even some tax-averse lawmakers such as Rep. Mike Pence, R-\n     Ind., said congressional action is warranted.\n       ``I don't think Congress should be in the business of \n     picking winners and losers,'' Pence said. ``Inaction by \n     Congress today results in a system today that does pick \n     winners and losers.''\n       State calls for congressional action on the issue got a big \n     boost earlier this month when Amazon, after years of battling \n     efforts to address the loophole, endorsed bipartisan online-\n     sales-tax legislation introduced by Sens. Michael Enzi, R-\n     Wyo., Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and others. That bill would \n     authorize states that meet certain minimum standards to \n     require online retailers to collect sales taxes from \n     customers even in states where those firms have no facility. \n     A similar bill has been introduced in the House by Reps. \n     Steve Womack, R-Ark., and Jackie Speier, D-Calif.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I yield the floor, and I note the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, it has been 10 years since I introduced \nthe DREAM Act, legislation that will allow a select group of immigrant \nstudents with great potential to contribute to America. The DREAM Act \nwould give these students a chance to become legal in America. They \ncame to the United States as children. They have to be long-term \nresidents of our country, have good moral character, graduate from high \nschool, and complete 2 years of college or military service in good \nstanding. Those are the basic standards we apply.\n  I think if we enacted the DREAM Act, as I have tried to for many \nyears, it would make America a stronger country, giving these talented \nyoung immigrants a chance to serve in our military and make us a \nstronger nation. Tens of thousands of highly qualified, well-educated \nyoung people would enlist in the Armed Forces if the DREAM Act becomes \nlaw. We have the support of the Department of Defense and the \nPresident. They understand that these young people could make us a \nstronger and safer nation by serving in our military. And they are \nwilling. Many of them are willing to risk their lives for this country.\n  Studies have also found that these DREAM Act participants could \nliterally build our economy in years to come with their talent.\n  Remember, these students we are talking about were brought to America \nas children and as infants. They grew up here believing they were \nAmericans. They went to class every day, pledged allegiance to the only \nflag they knew, and sang the only national anthem they had ever heard. \nThey are American in their hearts, and they should not be punished \nbecause their parents made a decision to bring them here.\n  These young people are tomorrow's doctors, engineers, soldiers, \nteachers. They are the people with whom we can build an America on. We \nshould not squander their talent by deporting them to countries they \nmay not remember at all.\n  Last year, Republican Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana joined me in \nasking the Department of Homeland Security to suspend the deportation \nof these DREAM Act students. Now, for the record, if there is any \nevidence of wrongdoing by these students, they are completely \ndisqualified from this conversation. We are talking about students of \ngood moral character who are in the United States basically without a \ncountry.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Lugar and I were joined in our request by \n21 other Senators, including majority leader Harry Reid, Judiciary \nCommittee chairman Patrick Leahy, and Senator Bob Menendez, asking that \nthese DREAM Act students be given an opportunity to stay and not be \ndeported. In response to our letters, John Morton, the Director of \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement, issued a memo in June of this year \nestablishing new priorities for deportation. The Morton memo says: It \nis a high priority to deport those who have committed serious crimes or \nthose who are a threat to public safety, while it is a low priority to \ndeport individuals who have been in the United States since childhood, \nlike those who are eligible for the DREAM Act.\n  During hearings this summer on the DREAM Act, Homeland Security \nSecretary Janet Napolitano told me and my subcommittee that the \nDepartment of Homeland Security would establish a process to implement \nthe Morton memo. Under this new process, high-priority cases will be \nexpedited, and low-priority cases will be closed in many instances.\n  Recently, the Department of Homeland Security announced the next step \nin the process. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and \nattorneys will receive comprehensive training on the new deportation \npolicy. By January, all ICE officers and attorneys will have the \ntraining they need. ICE attorneys will review all new deportation cases \nto identify low-priority cases that should not be placed in the \nimmigration court.\n  A review of the cases currently in immigration court is also \nunderway. Department of Homeland Security attorneys will review pending \ndeportation cases in Baltimore and Denver to identify-low priority \ncases that should be removed from the docket. This trial review of new \nand pending cases will be completed by mid-January and then expanded \nnationwide.\n  Let me commend the President and his administration for these \nthoughtful and humane steps to implement this new deportation policy.\n  Today, there are approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants in \nthe United States. It would take billions and billions of dollars to \ndeport all of them. It would likely lead to the collapse of many parts \nof our economy. You can't go to a hotel or restaurant in the city of \nChicago--I have been told this by restaurant owners--and not find at \nleast some place in that establishment an undocumented person doing the \ntough, hard work immigrants do.\n  DHS has to set priorities about which people to deport--and not \ndeport--using its limited resources. Some of my Republican colleagues \nhave claimed that this is kind of a backdoor amnesty. That could not be \nfurther from the truth. This is simply a temporary decision not to use \nlimited government resources to deport low-priority individuals who are \nno threat to the United States of America. Individuals whose cases are \nclosed will not receive any permanent legal status. So there is no \namnesty involved.\n  Ironically, some Republican critics of the administration's new \npolicy called on the Clinton administration to establish deportation \nguidelines--exactly what the Obama administration has done here. In \nresponse to this request from some Republicans in Congress, the Clinton \nadministration established a policy on prosecutorial discretion.\n\n[[Page S8449]]\n\nThe Bush administration kept the policy in force from the Clinton years \nand issued several followup memos without any criticism from any \nRepublicans in Congress. The Bush administration also stopped \ndeportations of a number of DREAM Act students, again without any \ncriticism from Republican Members.\n  Let's be clear. What the Obama administration has done in \nestablishing this new process for prioritizing deportations is \nperfectly appropriate and legal. Throughout our history, our government \nhas had to decide who to prosecute and who not to prosecute based on \nlaw enforcement priorities and available resources.\n  I strongly support the administration's new deportation policy but \nmore needs to be done to implement this policy and it needs to be done \nquickly. Many young people who would be eligible for the DREAM Act are \nstill facing deportation proceedings. Almost every day my office is \ncontacted by DREAM Act students who are at risk of being deported in a \nmatter of hours or days. Today, let me tell you the story of two of \nthese young people.\n  Here is a photo of Minhaz Khan. Eighteen years ago, in 1992, Minhaz \nKhan's parents brought him to the United States from Bangladesh. At the \ntime, he was 4 years old. Today, Minhaz is 22--18 years later--and he \nhas overcome amazing obstacles to complete his education. In 2009, \nMinhaz graduated from the University of California Riverside with a \nbachelor's degree in neuroscience.\n  Minhaz sent me a letter, and here is what he said about his future:\n\n       My dream is to make several contributions to science, and \n     become a physician's assistant as a career, and eventually a \n     teacher as well. I have great aspirations, but I do not dream \n     of big houses or tons of cars. I want normality, stability, \n     and liberty.\n\n  Today, Minhaz lives in Palo Alto, CA, with his wife, who is an \nAmerican citizen. Minhaz's wife has filed an application for her \nhusband to become an American citizen, but under our broken immigration \nlaws he has been placed instead in deportation proceedings. Eighteen \nyears in the United States, a bachelor's degree in neuroscience, \naspiring to become a researcher or teacher, married to an American \ncitizen, and he is under threat of being deported. What threat is he to \nAmerica? The threat is losing a person who is talented and can make \nsuch a difference in the lives of so many people.\n  Minhaz was scheduled to be deported last month. Under President \nObama's new deportation policy, the Department of Homeland Security put \nhis deportation on hold for 3 months so that his application for legal \nstatus can be considered. I think that was the right thing to do. \nMinhaz grew up in America, he is married to an American, and he wants \nto make America a better nation.\n  In his letter to me, Minhaz spoke about what it would mean to him if \nthe DREAM Act became law.\n\n       Imagine the countless numbers of individuals ready to \n     contribute to our society as law-abiding, successful \n     individuals who live life with a sense of strength and \n     morality. Abraham Lincoln once said, ``I have always found \n     that mercy bears richer fruit than strict justice,'' and this \n     is more true now than ever. I have a great amount of hope, \n     optimism, and belief in this country and that one day we \n     shall see the DREAM Act enacted into law.\n\n  Here is another DREAMer. This is a photo of Jose Librojo. In 1995, \nwhen he was a child--16 years ago--Jose's parents brought him from the \nPhilippines to the United States. Shortly after they arrived here, \nJose's parents filed an application to stay in this country as legal \npermanent residents. For more than 15 years, their immigration \napplication has been stuck in the courts.\n  In the meantime, Jose grew up in America. He graduated from San \nFrancisco State University with a bachelor's degree in biology. As a \nmember of Alpha Phi Omega National Service Fraternity, Jose volunteers, \nworking with the elderly and young Asian Americans, among other things.\n  Jose has been authorized to work while his immigration case is \npending. For more than 10 years, he worked as a registered dental \nassistant and a dental laboratory x-ray technician. The dentist who \nemploys him was so impressed by his work, he filed papers to sponsor \nJose for legal permanent residency in the United States. The employer's \npetition was approved, but because of our broken immigration laws, Jose \nhas been placed in deportation proceedings. After all of these years in \nAmerica--16 years--and earning a bachelor's degree in biology, \ncurrently working in the health field in dentistry, and one who has \ndone such a good job that his employer wants to have him here \npermanently, he is now facing the prospect of being deported to a \ncountry he cannot even remember.\n  Jose was scheduled to be deported last month, 3 days before \nThanksgiving. But the Department of Homeland Security put his \ndeportation on hold, so he will have a chance to apply for legal status \nand keep working.\n  Jose sent me a letter, and this is what he said:\n\n       I have followed the laws of our system, but the logjam in \n     the courts has put me in this untimely predicament. I have \n     lived in the U.S. for 16 years, and I consider this country \n     as my home. I have always felt like an American. I wish to \n     stay, live my dreams, and build my own family here in the \n     United States. I hope that someday the DREAM Act becomes a \n     reality so that I may continue making contributions to the \n     country I call home.\n\n  I ask my colleagues who are critical of the administration's \ndeportation policy, would America be better off if we deported Minhaz \nor Jose back to Bangladesh and the Philippines? I don't think so. These \ntwo young men were brought here as infants, children. They grew up in \nour country. They have overcome great odds and achieved great academic \nsuccess, without the support of Federal assistance. They didn't qualify \nfor it. They have no problems with moral character, and they pose no \nthreat to America. They would make us a better country if we gave them \na chance.\n  Minhaz and Jose are not isolated examples. There are literally \nthousands of others like them in this country. We have a responsibility \nin the Senate to give them a chance to let them prove what they can do \nfor America.\n  I commend the Obama administration for its new deportation policies. \nI urge the Department of Homeland Security to move forward on an \nexpedited basis. As long as young people such as Minhaz Khan and Jose \nLibrojo are facing deportation, work still needs to be done.\n  It is also clear that this policy is only a temporary solution. The \ndeportations of many DREAM Act students will be temporarily suspended. \nUltimately, the responsibility lies with Congress and with us to fix \nthese broken immigration laws and give these good young people a \nchance.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the DREAM Act. It is the right thing \nto do. It will make America a stronger nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin).

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the collapse of \nMF Global. While its demise hasn't triggered the sort of economic \nturmoil we saw in 2008, let me assure you it is having a devastating \nimpact on the livelihoods and savings of many in my State.\n  Sadly, the story of MF Global is all too familiar. It is the story of \nanother overleveraged financial firm that took on too much risk and did \nlittle to disclose its bets. Once again, the folks whom the system was \nsupposed to protect have been left holding the short end of the stick. \nThree years after the U.S. financial system was nearly toppled by this \nsort of recklessness, it seems little has changed on Wall Street.\n  Today, Mr. Corzine appeared before the House Agriculture Committee to \ntestify on events that led to the bankruptcy of MF Global--the firm he \nled--as well as the whereabouts of roughly $1.2 billion in customer \nfunds that remain missing. While taking responsibility for the collapse \nof the firm in his testimony today, Mr. Corzine chose to use much of \nhis testimony defending the strategy that ultimately led to the firm's \ndemise and that left many in my State with their life savings on the \nline. In regard to the missing customer funds, he responded that, as \nCEO of MF Global, he wasn't really in the position to know what \nhappened.\n  If executives at MF Global were willing to steer their ship into \ndangerous waters, they should be able to account for the safety of \ntheir customers' funds\n\n[[Page S8450]]\n\nheld in segregated accounts--something considered sacred within these \nmarkets.\n  If anybody still doubts that Wall Street has not learned from its \nmistakes, I would have you talk with the farmers in my State who can't \naccess their life savings and aren't sure when or how much of it they \nwill ever get back.\n  Dean Tofteland, from Luverne, MN, a town of 4,600 people--his family \ngrows corn, soybeans, and raises pigs on their farm in southwest \nMinnesota. He currently has over $200,000 in what was supposed to be a \nsegregated MF Global account, which he cannot access and which he may \nnever fully recover. He is not a speculator. He invested to reduce his \nrisk--locking in prices ahead of the growing season so he is protected \nfrom price fluctuations that can eat into his profits.\n  Talk to Dennis Magnuson, a pork producer from Austin, MN, who had a \nsubstantial amount of money with MF Global that he used to stabilize \nthe cost of feed for his pigs. Both Senators in the Chamber are from \nStates that have livestock, and they know the cost of feed has been \nescalating. That is why he vested. He knows the risks--price swings, \npoor crops, bad weather. These are all part of farming. But his account \nat MF Global was supposed to help manage those risks, not become one.\n  It is not just individual farmers; the effects of MF Global's \ncollapse are rippling through the whole agricultural community.\n  Here is a letter from Philip Deal, who writes:\n\n       I am the CEO and General Manager of Wheaton-Dumont Co-Op \n     Elevator in Wheaton, MN.\n       Wheaton is located on the western edge of Minnesota by the \n     North Dakota/South Dakota border. Our cooperative has \n     approximately 1,200 active members and a total membership of \n     more than 5,000. So the MF Global situation affects a great \n     number of people here.\n       We employ about 115 people, and we are easily the largest \n     nongovernment employer in all of the communities we operate \n     in.\n       Our business uses a Chicago Mercantile Exchange and \n     Minneapolis Grain Exchange to hedge grain purchases and \n     sales. We do not speculate. We have always relied on the \n     implied fiduciary responsibility of the Commodity Futures \n     Trading Commission and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to \n     safeguard our segregated funds.\n       The impact to our business has been huge. We have been \n     forced to double-margin the missing funds. This has increased \n     our interest expenses and decreased our ability to buy and \n     sell grain.\n       Simply put, we cannot afford to lose any money on this \n     deal. On a local level, the very future of our business is at \n     stake. On a larger level, if segregated funds are lost, \n     market participants will leave the market, open interest will \n     decline, and market liquidity will fall. Everyone loses.\n\n  Sadly, Philip Deal is correct. The failure of MF Global has caused \nmillions in investor losses, created significant uncertainty in the \nmarkets, and has left many in my State confused and angry--and they \nshould be angry. Just 3 years after the 2008 financial collapse, and \nwhat has changed? How can ordinary folks trust this system? Who can \nthey trust to protect them?\n\n  Two weeks after the collapse of MF Global, it was announced the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission, which is leading the \ninvestigation into the missing funds, will receive only two-thirds of \ntheir budget request for 2012, potentially limiting the agency's \nability to do its job at a time when the markets they oversee are \nexpanding exponentially. This is not acceptable. We need to make sure \nour regulatory agencies aren't allowing Wall Street bankers to go down \nthe street in their Ferraris while those standing up for the middle \nclass--those at the agencies that are supposed to regulate them--are \nnot following behind in a Model T Ford.\n  We don't know with certainty what the ongoing investigations into MF \nGlobal will find, but there is little doubt Congress has work to do. \nAlready the CFTC, after our hearing in the Senate Agriculture Committee \nlast week, has come up with some changes they are proposing to how \nthese funds can be invested. I think more needs to be done. There are \nalso rules of disclosure being considered and that were discussed today \nat a House hearing, as well as in our Senate Agriculture hearing, that \nneed to be changed. These changes were made to the CFTC rules in 2000 \nand in 2005 they loosened the rules and expanded things. They need to \ngo back to where they once were, where they protected investor savings.\n  Investor trust in segregated accounts is vital to market confidence \nand is the cornerstone of customer protection in the commodity futures \nmarket. This trust has been breached. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin demanding those responsible for the MF Global failure be held \naccountable for their actions and that steps are taken to prevent this \nfrom ever happening again.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for whatever time I might use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I wanted to take this opportunity to share \nwith you what has been keeping me awake, and I am sure, if I explain it \nwell enough, it will keep you awake as well. Misery loves company. This \nis misery that is going to affect your future, and the Senate has to \nmake some changes to have a future for this country.\n  For 14 years, I was the only accountant in the Senate. I have been \njoined by Senator Johnson of Wisconsin, who is an accountant, and these \nkinds of numbers always bother us a little bit. I have put together a \ncouple of pie charts here. This one on the left represents the spending \nwe are doing; the one on the right represents the revenue we are \nreceiving to do the spending. These are proportionately correct. This \nis the spending; this is the revenue to do the spending. Dramatically \ndifferent. The revenues are dramatically lower.\n  There are a number of pieces to this that I think probably will \nreveal more. The spending, incidentally, is $3.456 trillion. We are \nspending $3.456 trillion. We are taking in $2.2 trillion. That is $1.3 \ntrillion less than we are spending. So we are spending a third more \nthan we are taking in.\n  How long can you do that? There is no end in sight. What is that made \nup of? Well, one of the things we worry about is Medicare, Medicaid, \nand Social Security. I have the revenues represented here for Social \nSecurity and other social insurances, and we are taking in $865 billion \na year to support these programs. This piece of the pie is what we are \nhaving to put out for those same programs. We are having to put out \n$1.494 trillion; so $865 billion versus $1.494 trillion.\n  When we say these programs are going broke, I think that fact is \npretty evident. If you don't make any changes, this kind of spending \nwill eliminate a program that seniors rely on. I used to say when we \nare spending at this rate, we are stealing from our grandkids. Now we \nare to a point where we have spent so much, it is no longer our \ngrandkids we are stealing from, it is our kids. And in a matter of \nmonths the bill could come due.\n  Europe is having some difficult financial times, and they are \nchanging the way money is going to be available to secure the bonds \nthat allow us to do this kind of spending. These actions could have \nwidespread implications for the United States very soon. We also took \nSocial Security money and put it in a trust fund. I always say, don't \ntrust the trust funds. What we did is put IOUs in a drawer and we spent \nthe money. We are spending some of the money twice. How long can you \nspend the money twice?\n  Let us take a look at some of the other parts of this pie, because we \nalways talk about the nondiscretionary spending. Well, to cover our \ndiscretionary spending, which includes Defense and all of the \nnonmandatory items, we are spending $1.349 trillion. And the income? \nIndividual income tax is paying $899 billion. Corporate income tax pays \n$191 billion. I bet people thought there was a lot more corporate tax \nthan that.\n  Part of the reason for this corporate number is that a lot of people \nhave single proprietorships, partnerships, or small business \ncorporations. If a business is in one of those three categories, the \nmoney their company makes goes straight to their tax line, even though \nhardly anybody in business can take\n\n[[Page S8451]]\n\nout all of the money they make. If they do not reinvest that money into \nthe business, it business would go broke. So they do not get to take \nthe money out, but have to count it through the individual tax code. \nThat goes in this $899 billion of individual income, as opposed to the \ncorporate tax of $191 billion. There is also an excise tax of $67 \nbillion. These are the kinds of numbers that have to fund $1.349 \ntrillion of spending.\n  We have discretionary spending of $660 billion and we have military \nspending of $689 billion. I mentioned Social Security, Medicare, and \nMedicaid, but besides that we have other mandatory spending adding \nanother $416 billion in spending. That $416 billion accounts for the \nother items we have said will definitely be paid no matter what kind of \nshape the Federal Government is in. There are all sorts of programs \nincluded in that tally.\n\n  This little yellow sliver here, a very important one, is the interest \nwe have to pay. That is mandatory as well. We don't have an option on \nwhether we are going to pay the interest on the bonds that we owe. \nThose interest costs come to $197 billion a year and that is at the \nlowest interest rate in the history of the United States. What happens \nwhen that goes up? As European countries have more trouble trying to \nsell their bonds, they are going to have to pay a higher rate to be \nable to sell those bonds. When they have to pay a higher rate, we will \nhave to pay a higher rate. We are all competing for the same dollars, \nand there aren't enough dollars out there to fund this kind of an \nincrease in spending each and every year. How do we make up the $1.2 \ntrillion more we are spending than we are taking in? It's a huge \ndifference we aren't coming close to addressing.\n  I hope people can grasp the difference between spending and revenues. \nIf you look at your own personal budget, your spending better be lower \nthan your revenues, or at least no greater than the revenues. We \nhaven't grasped that concept here yet. We did eliminate earmarks for \nthe most part, and that helps, but it was still a rather small amount \nand we are still adding programs.\n  Sometimes we add programs as a demonstration project. A group of \nSenators get together and they say, our five States could do something \nbeneficial with this new program we have devised, so we will put a \nlittle money in the budget and draw up the criteria so just those five \nStates can receive these monies. And the purpose is to see whether the \nprogram is effective. In my 14 years here, I have rarely seen one of \nthese types of tailored programs that wasn't effective. I suppose there \nare some I never heard reported on, but I yet to see one that isn't \neffective. This means the following year the same group comes back and \nsays, we just had this revelation, this marvelous experiment that \nhappened in our State. It was spectacular and it ought to be expanded \nto every State in the Nation. Well, if it is that good, it probably \nought to be expanded to every State in the Nation. But with whose \nmoney? With what money? We are already spending more than we are taking \nin.\n  We can't do the demonstration programs on new ideas unless we can \neliminate some of the old ideas, which brings up another problem. \nAnother thing we do around here is we say we are going to eliminate \nthis program, and over 10 years it will bring in the $5 billion needed \nto fund a new program. Well, that savings is accrued over 10 years, but \nthe money on the new program is going to be spent over 1 year or 2 \nyears at the most. That is pretty bad accounting. That is how you get \nto a situation where you have the current spending level versus the \ncurrent revenues, by using creative accounting to pay for that new \nprogram.\n  Well, you can't bind a future Congress, so there is no assurance that \nthe current method of getting the revenue will stay around. There is \nalso no assurance we won't use that same pot of revenue two or three \ntimes. We will probably be told this is not the case, but I have seen \nsome instances around here where revenue has been spent more than once.\n  One of the other problems we have around here is that we have too \nmany spending decisions to make. There isn't a business in the world, \nwith the exception of a business like Wal-Mart, that spends $3.456 \nbillion in a year--1 year. There aren't many businesses that comes \nclose to that. And they have a bevy of accountants figuring out how to \nmake expenditures, cuts, and balance the budget for the year.\n  What we do here in the United States Senate is an appropriations \nprocess. We have broken that process down into 12 pieces to make it \nmore manageable, but 12 pieces doesn't cut it. You can't get into the \ndetail for spending the billions. One of those numbers is $689 billion. \nHow long would it take to go through the expenditures on $689 billion? \nWe have to trust some of the past spending and some of the past \nobligations, but we can't be as conscientious and detail-oriented as we \nshould be.\n  So what do we do about it? Well, we do omnibus bills. That is where \nwe look at what we spent last year, and we put everything into one \npackage and hurry up and pass it so the government can continue to \noperate. Before that happens, we might do a series of continuing \nresolutions. We say, we can't shut down government because there are so \nmany things people need that we have already approved--to the tune of \n$3.456 trillion--so we have to keep government operating. What we end \nup with is a continuing resolution.\n  A continuing resolution allows a government agency to spend one-\ntwelfth of what they had the previous year each month until we get a \nfunding agreement for the remainder of the fiscal year. In 2008, we \nspent 27 percent less than we spend right now. I think a lot of the \nagencies would be delighted to have us keep continuing one-twelfth of \ntheir last year's allotted spending each month this year. That is what \nwe have been doing, and it's not getting us anywhere.\n  I think there ought to be a penalty, which would be reflected in \nevery one of the budgets. I think every time we pass a continuing \nresolution there ought to be a reduction in the amount spent each month \nuntil we get a final resolution. That could be 1 percent or \\1/2\\ \npercent or \\1/4\\ percent, but there should be some kind of a reduction \nif we are ever going to reduce spending and pay down our debt.\n  There is another responsibility, and that is for appropriators to \nfigure out how to get this spending circle down to the size of the \nrevenue circle. This is the only part that the Appropriations Committee \nhas worked on--this little third of the square that contains \ndiscretionary spending.\n  What we are going to have to do now is come up with some solutions. I \nhave some solutions. I am not going to go into those today, but what I \nwant people to do right now is to think about how much we are spending \nversus the revenue we have. Every person in America needs to be \nthinking about the way the programs they are involved in can be a part \nof getting the spending circle down to the size of the revenue circle. \nIt is everybody's responsibility.\n  What we continually run into are the groups--particularly from our \nStates--that come in and say: I have this fantastic program and we just \nneed a little increase for inflation because it is such a phenomenal \nprogram. For years, we have been able to do that. That is how the \nballoon got this big. We are not going to be able to do that anymore.\n  What would be helpful is if people could suggest how, in their \nprogram, they could make it better for less money. It is either going \nto have to be better for less with a little pain right now, or wait a \ncouple years and have it worse for less with a lot of pain.\n  We are at a point right now where we reduce spending 1 percent for \neach of 7 years and get to a balanced budget; that is, 1 percent true \ncuts. That isn't 1 percent less growth. It is 1 percent true cuts each \nand every year, and it has to cover the whole circle, not just the \ndiscretionary part of the spending circle--which is what we usually \nconcentrate on--and then have some discretionary capability on it. The \nfact is, the largest amounts we spend in this whole piece of the pie is \nspent on mandatory spending, and it is conversely funded by a much \nsmaller amount. We can't do that for long. We are going to have to \npropose solutions.\n  Instead we have been in scenario where people come in and say we need \na little bit more money or don't cut my program; keep it the same size. \nI ask for suggestions on how we could keep this practice going in light \nof our disproportionate revenues and expenditures. The usual approach \nis to tell me\n\n[[Page S8452]]\n\nand my fellow senators there are a couple of other programs that we \nought to eliminate. We are looking at those too.\n  We looked at them in the Health and Human Services areas, Senator \nCoburn and I did, and found there was $9 billion of duplication. Do we \nneed duplication? I would hope not. Senator Coburn got so excited, he \ndid this same study for the entire Federal Government and found $900 \nbillion in duplication. Does that mean a whole lot of other agencies \nwere a whole lot less efficient than Health and Human Services? No. It \nmeans we have duplicative programs in every single agency.\n  We also have financial literacy programs in every single agency. If \nwe are spending $3.456 trillion and only getting $2.2 trillion in \nrevenue, is the financial literacy in our government working? I don't \nthink so.\n  When I first got here, there were 119 preschool education programs. \nPreschool is important. The start children get from when they are first \nborn until they go to school makes a huge difference in their growth \nand development for the rest of their lives. However, we had 119 \nprograms and once we took a closer look, we found many of them, \naccording to their own evaluation, were failing. We now have that \nnumber down to 69 programs. Do you know why we can't go below 69? My \njurisdiction as Ranking Member of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee is over the Department of Education, which only has \n8 programs--8 of 69 preschool programs. The Department of Agriculture \nhas the most preschool programs.\n  That's why, when Senator Coburn is talking about duplication and \nlooking at the complete picture of everything the Federal Government \ndoes, there is duplication in each and every agency. What we are going \nto have to do is pick out those that operate with the most efficiency \nand results, give them a little more funding and eliminate the other \nduplicative programs. Getting rid of duplication is a surer way of \nsolving the problem than some of the other ways that have been talked \nabout.\n  One other avenue we keep talking about is waste, fraud, and abuse. \nYes, there is waste, fraud, and abuse. We need everybody in America to \nhelp us find that waste, fraud, and abuse, but in reality, the total \ncost of waste, fraud, and abuse is a rather elusive number. Does \nanybody know how big that is? Everybody is guessing. It is only a guess \nhow much there is. We need to find it, and we need to be taking the \nmoney from eliminating these actions before we spend it.\n  We will sometimes attempt to use the waste, fraud, and abuse numbers \nas the pay-for for a new program. We aren't able to spend that money \nuntil we actually have it, but what happens it is used as pay-for and \nthe program goes into effect, but nobody follows up to go out and dig \nup that waste, fraud, and abuse. Instead, the waste, fraud, and abuse \nmoney ought to go into a fund before it can be spent on something else.\n  However, when I am talking about duplication, the $900 billion worth \nof duplication, I am talking about numbers that we can go to the \nFederal budget and look up. We can find out exactly how much those \nprograms are spending. In its duplication, we wouldn't eliminate all of \nthem, but we ought to be able to eliminate half of them. Madam \nPresident, $450 billion alone, half of Senator Coburn's total \nduplication findings, would be a huge change for this country.\n  I hope we look at some of those ideas to cut spending. I have a 15-\npage speech that would explain some ways we could solve this problem, \nbut what I am trying to do is get people to grasp the concept that our \nFederal tax receipts, and total revenue, is far outweighed by the \ncircle that shows what we are spending. As a family, people know they \ncan't budget this way. As a government, we can't do it for very long, \neven if we print our own money. Somehow we are going to have to shrink \nthe spending circle down until it is that size or grow the revenue \ncircle until it is--they are comparable in size, or a combination of \nthe two. As I said, I will give some other speeches to outline some of \nmy other ideas. In the meantime, I hope everybody will take a look at \nthe chart I have shown today.\n  We can't look at it and say don't touch Medicare, Medicaid, and \nSocial Security, we can't have $\\1/2\\ trillion of extra expenditure \nspending in that category alone for long. There is another $416 \ntrillion in mandatory spending in that same category. How long can we \nkeep spending at this rate? What happens if interest rates go up? This \npiece of the spending pie can become much bigger and probably will. I \ndon't know how long we can keep interest rates as low rate as they are \nnow. If they go up, it will help some seniors because they have some \ninvestments in cash that would get higher interest rates, but for the \ncountry as a whole, rising interest rates that already make up 6 \npercent of our budget will only be more cause for worry. When that one \nexpands above the 1 percent we are spending right now--and it is going \nto expand in the next couple of years because of what is happening in \nEurope--we had better be worried about it.\n\n  This is the kind of picture shown by the deficit commission that \nErskine Bowles and Alan Simpson chaired. I was hoping we would repaint \nthis picture a number of times between the time they released their \nreport 1 year ago and now, because we have to get America to \nunderstand. Actually, I can tell you the people in my State understand \nthis. I don't need to explain it to them. They know how much more we \nare spending versus what we are taking in. They can even tell you the \nnumbers. They are concerned, and they need to be concerned. We all need \nto be concerned.\n  I am open to suggestions on this. I will have some speeches I'll give \nlater reiterating this definite problem we are in. I have said a number \nof times our country has maxed out its credit cards.\n  A couple weeks ago during a trip to Wyoming, I checked into a hotel \nand I used my Senate credit card. The lady a few moments later, very \nembarrassed, said: ``I am sorry, but your card is being rejected.'' I \nsaid: ``I guess the Federal Government is in worse trouble than I \nthought,'' and used my own card and it went through.\n  We had better be worrying about it now because we do have a problem. \nWe have maxed out our credit cards, and there are not any other places \nwe can go for money. We have been the bastion of money for years.\n  Keep in this in mind. Start thinking of ways we can actually make \nsome cuts and increase some revenues. I have ideas for both in speeches \nI'll give in the future. We are in a crisis. It will be a more \nimmediate crisis any time and we are no longer spending our grandkids' \nmoney; we are spending our kids' money, and it is about to come due on \nus. When I say ``on us,'' I am even including myself and the seniors in \nthat count. The day of reckoning is not far away.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask to speak as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/08/senate-section/article/S8452-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8452-S8454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FUTURE OF AMERICA\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are here now deciding what kind of \na country America might be in the future--whether it will be a place we \ncan look back at and remember when everybody had a chance at success.\n  It is hard to believe that when we look at the vote we just had. It \nconfirmed where the Republicans are on the issue of whether middle-\nclass families should get a tax break. The Republican answer, was no. \nThe answer they gave on the middle-class families tax break was: \nAbsolutely no. No, no, no.\n  To the struggling single parent who wants to provide for their \nfamily, works hard every day, the Republicans said no way. To the \nrecent college graduate trying to start a career but having trouble \npaying back college loans, paying rent, paying living costs, the \nRepublicans said no. To the working couple, a family with a couple of \nkids who needs some help in this tough economy, the Republicans said \nno. No, no, no. The Republicans refuse to help them because their \nmission is to shield the wealthy from paying their fair share of our \ncountry's obligations.\n\n[[Page S8453]]\n\n  Across our country, Americans are watching Republicans in this \nCongress and wondering what they are going to do to supply \nencouragement and hope for people who need it. Are we going to be \nsimply a big accounting firm, simply doing the auditing, or are we \ngoing to be there to stimulate activity for people, to give them a \nchance to elevate their living standards for their family, to get their \nkids educated, and take care of the family necessities?\n  Right now, 14 million Americans are jobless, and they are worried \nabout how they are going to stay in their homes, feed their children, \nand keep their families warm this winter. But unemployed Americans are \nnot the only people who are struggling. Hard-working Americans from all \nwalks of life are struggling to make ends meet. They are coping with \nskyrocketing grocery prices, surging health premiums, soaring college \ntuition.\n  In my home State, 1 in 10 New Jerseyans is on food stamps, the \nhighest level in more than a decade. New Jersey has traditionally been \namong the top States per capita income in the country, within the top \nthree, often in the first position.\n  On this side of the aisle, we are trying to help struggling families. \nI learned the hard way about family struggles when I was growing up. My \nfather took ill with cancer when he was 42; I was 18. My mother, when \nmy father died, was 37 years old. We had all kinds of obligations to \npay. My mother took over the family leadership. We owed money for the \npharmacy, for hospitals, for doctors. We were virtually bankrupt. I had \nenlisted in the Army. Next week, it will be 69 years ago that I \nenlisted in the Army, in December of 1942.\n  I know how tough it was and how much aggravation accompanies a family \nwho just cannot keep their heads above water.\n  Here we are, in a day of some incredible wealth around this country--\naround this room--and Republicans are trying to thwart our efforts to \nextend and expand the payroll tax cut for working families--for people \nwho depend upon their incomes to take care of their family needs; not \non their savings, not on their inheritance, on their jobs.\n  Millions of American families have benefitted from this tax cut that \nwe have had this year, but it stands to expire at the end of December. \nOur side is eager to continue this tax cut and increase the size of \nthat cut to help these families. In my State, this means a typical \nfamily would receive a total tax cut of $2,100 next year. For parents \nwho are trying to feed their families, educate their kids, pay their \nbills, an extra $2,100 goes a long way. To make sure that all working \nfamilies receive this much needed relief next year, we are asking \nAmerica's millionaires to pay their fair share, but the Republicans \nwould rather protect their wealthy friends than continue the payroll \ntax cut for working families.\n  First, the Republicans blocked our side's efforts to cut taxes for \nthe middle class. Then the Republicans offered their own plan. It was a \ndisgrace. Their plan calls for a much smaller middle-class tax break, \nwhich they would have paid for by laying off 200,000 middle-class \ngovernment workers. That is how they would solve the problem--fire \npeople. Don't take it out of your bank account, don't take it out of \nyour salary--even if you make over $1 million a year--fire people. That \nwill make sure they understand we are not as concerned about them as we \nare about the person who makes over $1 million a year.\n  It was a cynical ploy. It showed the other side's true stripes. The \nRepublicans say they are for lower taxes, but we now see that only goes \nfor the jet set. Their tax-cutting zeal doesn't extend to the middle \nclass. Republican priorities? Raise taxes on middle-class families. \nMiddle-class families do not have it easy in America today. Republicans \nwant to raise their taxes to protect the luxuries for the millionaires.\n  Make no mistake. Working families will suffer if the Republicans \ncontinue to block our efforts to extend and expand the payroll tax cut, \nand so will our economy. Last week, Barclays Bank warned that our GDP \nwill drop 1.5 percent if the payroll tax cut is allowed to expire.\n  The choice is clear. We can continue the payroll tax cut for working \nfamilies or we can allow the Republicans to continue running their \nmillionaires' protection ring. The fact is, American millionaires are \ndoing just fine. They don't need protection from the Republicans. Since \nthe 1980s, our country's wealthiest 1 percent have seen their average \nhousehold income increase by 55 percent. But for the bottom 90 percent, \naverage household income has not increased at all.\n  As we see here, even though incomes are growing for the very wealthy, \ntheir taxes are actually going down.\n  We can also look at CEOs to see how well the wealthy are faring. CEOs \nat the largest companies are now paid an average salary of $11 million \na year. That is 343 times as much as the average worker's salary of \n$33,000.\n  It used to be a much more modest comparison. In 1980, CEOs made 42 \ntimes the average worker's pay. Just look at that. Just a few decades \nago the pay was much more reasonable, and the people who were working \nin the mills and making products and doing the service jobs and all of \nthat were living significantly better than they are today.\n  Millionaires are making much more money today than they did in those \nyears past. This is something I know something about directly. I was \nthe president of a very large company when I came to the Senate. And \nyou know how I got there: I had a boost from our country. I had \nenlisted in the Army, and I served in Europe. I got the GI bill. I went \nto Columbia University. It happened because the country said: Frank, if \nyou can learn we will help you. We will pay your tuition because you \nserved your country. I've done well because my country invested in me, \nand I'm willing to invest more in my country today to help the next \ngeneration.\n  That company I helped start with two other fellows has 45,000 \nemployees today; 45,000 people are working at ADP, the company I helped \nstart, because we had a chance at an education and to learn what we had \nto do to be in management, what we had to do to be in leadership.\n  Our goal should not be to protect millionaires and billionaires who \ndon't need our help. We should focus on the foundation that our society \nrequires to function. We should be focused on protecting Medicare, food \nsafety, Head Start.\n  Imagine, they want to take seats away from Head Start Programs. I \nvisited a Head Start Program in New Jersey just a few weeks ago, and I \nsaw the children. They were 3, 4, 5 years old. They were interested in \nlearning something. I talked to them, and I wanted--one of the little \nkids came over and hugged me around the knees. I wanted to pick him up \nand take him home. He was so beautiful, so nice. I thought: Here is a \nchild, learning. He came from a single-parent family.\n  The people who need help--we should be focusing on protecting them \nand giving them a chance to grow. We should be about making sure they \nhave proper Medicare, that food safety is taken care of. Head Start, \nhome heating for the poor, and other essential programs--we should be \nprotecting them from reckless cuts.\n  The Republicans who served on the supercommittee refused, before the \nnegotiations were started--refused to ask wealthy Americans to pay \ntheir fair share. They practically took an oath that they would demand \nnothing more of the wealthy, when the country is deeply in debt, \nstarving for a better way to solve our problems.\n  As a result, the poor and the middle class are going to have to make \nup the difference. These are the people who need help the most right \nnow. We must act now to protect the vital programs on which they rely. \nIf we fail to act, our country and our economy will continue to \nsuffer--especially Americans who are already struggling. It is just \nplain heartless to continue asking the poor, the middle class, the \nelderly, and our children to bear the entire burden of these brutal \neconomic times.\n\n  It does not hurt any of us who have been successful to pay a fair \nshare. It might cost a few dollars more, but if you are making over $1 \nmillion a year, look in the mirror and see if you have done it all by \nyourself or whether it took the help of your country to get there. \nThere is a whole cadre of people working across America--they go to \nwork every day because they want to make a week's pay and take care of\n\n[[Page S8454]]\n\ntheir kids and take care of their obligations. That is the foundation \nthat built America. It is the foundation of the development of \nsomething that was called the ``greatest generation.''\n  That was the generation in the last century who served in World War \nII. All of us had an opportunity to get a college education when we \notherwise would not have been near a college.\n  That built our country. That strengthened our foundation. Now we see \npeople, Republicans, who want to make it tougher for people to make a \nliving, tougher for people to get an education, tougher to provide heat \nfor people who desperately need it in the wintertime, tougher to think \nahead and say: You know what. I know my children will do better than I \nhave done in my life.\n  That used to be a truism in our view of life in this country. We \ndon't hear that much anymore because people are unsure, and it does not \nhelp to have the Republicans sticking up for the wealthiest among us \nand turning their backs on working-class families in this country, the \nmiddle-class families. It is not right.\n  I hope the people across this country will say: No. We are going to \nsay no to these Republican policies. I hope our Republican colleagues \nwill disband their millionaires' protection game, stop standing in the \nway, and start standing up for everyday Americans who need our help.\n  Help us continue the payroll tax cut for working families. Help us \nprotect the programs that benefit the people who need them most. Help \nus, friends on the Republican side, to make America even stronger than \nit is today. We can do that.\n  Countries are failing all over the globe. America need not to do \nthat. We just have to make sure that while we take care of our \nexpenses, we also make sure we have the revenues to do the job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken).

Madam President, I rise today to extend my personal \nblessing this holiday season to the family of Jacob Akin of Somerset, \nKentucky. This year, the town of Somerset has graciously chosen to \nhonor the Akin family by accepting their donation of a 20-foot cherry \nspruce tree to be displayed in the town's Fountain Square as the county \nChristmas tree. More important, however, is the solemn but heart-\nwarming story of the tree's origin, and the inspiration it brings to \nthe people of the community.\n  The tree, known as ``Jacob's Tree,'' was planted in remembrance of \nJacob Akin, who was tragically killed in a terrible accident on \nDecember 6, 1994. Five-year-old Jacob was playing with his older \nbrother, Abraham, in a house when a chimney unexpectedly collapsed on \ntop of him. Thus, the holiday season each year is especially burdensome \nfor his family, as it serves as a constant reminder of the horrific \naccident that took place 17 years ago.\n  A year after his death, his family decided to plant a tree to honor \nyoung Jacob. Over the years, the tree has helped bring comfort and \npeace to the family. ``We decided to put up the tree in memory of my \nson,'' Jacob's mother, Rebecca Buis, says. ``I felt like as the tree \ngrew, I could keep up with the\n\n[[Page S8455]]\n\nyears and somehow see how my son might have grown. It's kind of a \nreminder, and it helps with the grieving process to plant something in \nmemory of someone you love.''\n  Almost two decades later, Jacob's spirit remains ever-present in the \nmagnificent 20-foot cherry spruce tree that Rebecca hopes will bring a \njoyful light to the community on Fountain Square. ``Over the years, it \njust grew and grew,'' she says. ``It's a beautiful, well-rounded tree \nand would make a wonderful Christmas tree.''\n  On December 3, Jacob's Tree was scheduled to be lit for the first \ntime in Fountain Square in a special tree-lighting ceremony during this \nyear's annual Christmas parade. In the spirit of the season, Jacob's \nfamily hopes that the community will come together around the tree and \nshare in its joy. ``Christmas is a time of giving,'' Rebecca said.\n  The story of Jacob's Tree and the selflessness of the Akin family is \ntruly inspirational. I would like to extend my personal blessing to \nJacob's mother, Rebecca Buis, his father, David Akin, and his brother, \nAbraham Akin, this holiday season. And I ask my Senate colleagues to \njoin me in wishing the family a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New \nYear. It is my hope that the tree brings them comfort, and that it \nshine especially bright in honor of young Jacob.\n  The Commonwealth Journal, a Somerset-area publication, recently \npublished an article telling the story of Jacob's Tree. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n       [From the Commonwealth Journal, Nov. 25, 2011]\n\n            `Jacob's Tree' Will Warm the Spirit This Season\n\n                           (By Chris Harris)\n\n       The Christmas season is seen as a time of miracles, a time \n     of redemption for mankind.\n       This year, one of Somerset's proudest symbols of the \n     Christmas tradition will be its own miracle of sorts--a \n     chance to redeem joy and light out of the clouds of tragedy.\n       The Christmas tree in the town's Fountain Square is \n     scheduled to be lit in a special ceremony on Saturday, \n     December 3, as is the annual custom.\n       This year's tree comes from the yard of Rebecca Buis, known \n     to local bank customers as a branch manager and loan officer \n     at First & Farmers National Bank in Somerset.\n       Anyone who has driven down Denham Street lately has \n     probably noticed the towering cherry spruce standing out with \n     its bold green hue, even as the trees around it have shed \n     their leaves and stand bare and bland.\n       The tree was planted around the holiday season of 1995--one \n     year after a horrific accident that changed Buis's life \n     forever.\n       On December 6, 1994, Jacob Akin, Buis's 5-year-old son, was \n     killed in what his mother can only call a ``freak accident.''\n       Jacob and his brother Abraham, who was 10 at the time, were \n     playing in a house on Newton Street in Ferguson that their \n     father was in the process of razing.\n       ``(The father, David Akin) did construction work,'' said \n     Buis. ``This wasn't anything that was new to (the children). \n     They were used to playing around that kind of stuff.''\n       This time, however, was different.\n       After Abraham exited the structure to ask his father a \n     question, a chimney crumbled and collapsed on top of young \n     Jacob.\n       A parent's worst nightmare had come to pass--and during the \n     holiday season meant to be a happy time for families.\n       The memories remain painful to this day.\n       ``They couldn't find my son underneath the bricks,'' \n     recalled Buis, who still finds herself overcome with emotion \n     when talking about the incident. ``They had to pull them off \n     brick by brick until they found him.''\n       According to then-county coroner Alan Stringer, Jacob died \n     of multiple skull fractures as a result of the toppled \n     bricks. Buis noted that Jacob's neck was broken immediately, \n     which meant that death came quickly. This and the fact that \n     Abraham survived provided the only sources of solace in that \n     terrible time.\n       ``My worry was that he suffered, and they told me he had \n     not,'' said Buis. `` I'm lucky in the sense that I felt like \n     God could have taken both my boys that day, playing in the \n     house together. I could have lost them both.''\n       Still, the holiday season was unalterably affected for Buis \n     and her family.\n       ``I wasn't able to focus on Christmas at all,'' said Buis. \n     ``We didn't put up a tree that year.''\n       For one thing, Buis felt like she had to stay strong for \n     her other son's sake. The necessity of putting on a brave \n     face took its own toll on the devastated mother.\n       ``You have to carry on because you have two children,'' she \n     said. ``Kids grieve differently. It's not an easy thing to \n     deal with; kids don't usually tell you, but they feel \n     responsible. I tried hard not to show grief because I didn't \n     want (Abraham) to feel responsible. Nobody could have done \n     anything. It was a freak accident.''\n       Buis recalls Jacob, in kindergarten at Hopkins Elementary \n     at the time, as ``a funny little young man,'' as well as one \n     who was both handsome and intelligent.\n       ``He was a very smart young man,'' she said. ``He \n     understood lots of things, I think.''\n       The calendar pages turned, and soon enough, it was the \n     Christmas season again. Buis decided it would be appropriate \n     to pay some kind of tribute to Jacob, and decided to plant \n     the household Christmas tree, only about five feet tall at \n     the time, in the ground outside their home.\n       ``We decided to put up the tree in memory of my son,'' she \n     said. ``I felt like as the tree grew, I could keep up with \n     the years and somehow see how my son might have grown. Every \n     time I would pull in the driveway, I would see the tree.''\n       ``It's kind of a reminder,'' she added. ``It helps with the \n     grieving process to plant something in memory of someone you \n     love.''\n       Today, the majestic tree stands about 20 feet tall. It's \n     ``reached its potential,'' as Buis put it, and has \n     ``overgrown the place.''\n       As such, Buis decided it might be the perfect time to \n     inquire about donating ``Jacob's Tree,'' as it's called, to \n     use on the Fountain Square as the county's official Christmas \n     tree. County officials happily obliged.\n       ``Over the years, it just grew and grew,'' said Buis. ``I'd \n     been thinking for some time about (donating it), and just \n     decided, `You know, it's time to cut the tree down.' ''\n       Buis said she also took Abraham's feelings into \n     consideration. Now 27, still in Pulaski County working in \n     construction, Abraham ``thinks it's a good idea,'' according \n     to Buis, but she wanted to make sure he was okay with the \n     choice to donate the tree given the effect Jacob's death had \n     on him as well.\n       Much as the tree reached its adult size, Jacob would have \n     been 22 years old this year. However, his legacy has managed \n     to live on in other ways as well.\n       After Jacob's death, Buis decided to donate his corneas and \n     heart valves to help save the lives of other individuals. \n     ``(Christmas) is a time of giving,'' she said, noting that \n     Jacob's untimely passing was able to give hope to others.\n       ``I received letters telling me that one of Jacob's corneas \n     went to a child who was born with a birth defect, and another \n     went to an older man in his 60s with an eye injury from a \n     work accident,'' said Buis. ``His heart valves also went to \n     adults. I didn't realize how important heart valves were to \n     people who need them (until then).''\n       ``It's a hard decision to make because you have to make it \n     quickly,'' she added, referring to the decision to donate \n     Jacob's organs. ``You can't think about it for days. You have \n     to know at the time of death, and it's a very hard time.''\n       Just as Jacob's body was donated to bring a new light of \n     hope to those in need, his spirit remains in the tree that \n     has now been donated to bring a similarly joyful light to the \n     community.\n       ``It's a beautiful tree,'' said Buis. ``It's well-rounded \n     and would make a wonderful Christmas tree.''\n       Citizens can see ``Jacob's Tree'' lit for the first time on \n     December 3. The annual Christmas parade, sponsored and \n     organized by the Chamber of Commerce, begins at 5 p.m. with \n     the tree lighting activities set for 7 p.m.\n       As a Chamber Ambassador, Buis is looking forward to the \n     yearly festivities that are so beloved by locals--but \n     especially since she will get to see that special memorial to \n     her son shining in all its glory.\n       ``I just hope that (those who see it) will enjoy the tree \n     and that it will be beautifully decorated,'' said Buis. ``I \n     hope that people will get a warm feeling from the tree, and \n     know that it's given in a good spirit.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/08/senate-section/article/S8455-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8455-S8456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION WEEK\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about Computer \nScience Education Week, which began on December 4, 2011, and continues \nuntil December 10, 2011. This celebration includes events in my home \nState of Pennsylvania that advance the teaching and learning of \ncomputer science. These activities help to engage students and build \ntheir interest in a field that promises good jobs in a rapidly \nexpanding sector. The week also draws attention to the critical need \nfor strong computer science education in our schools.\n  E-mails, text messages, financial transactions, cell phone calls and \ndoctor's visits are just a few of the activities that rely on computer \nscience. In the last 20 years, we have undergone a technological \nrevolution that has transformed industry, created entirely new segments \nof the economy, and transformed our daily lives. Pennsylvania's high-\ntech industry has played a crucial role in this growth, and we must \nprepare the next generation to continue innovating. The events of \nComputer Science Education Week help to build momentum for students to \nlearn computer science.\n  In Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, which boasts one of the \nbest\n\n[[Page S8456]]\n\ncomputer science and informatics programs in the country, will host \nhigh school students and expose them to the multitude of academic and \nprofessional opportunities in computer science. At Emmaus High School \nin Emmaus, young people will demonstrate programmable robots and hear \nfrom alumni who have successfully pursued careers in computer science, \nall while honoring computing pioneer Grace Hopper with a birthday cake. \nEven the White House is celebrating Computer Science Education Week by \nhonoring the week's organizers and representatives of the Computer \nScience Teachers Association as ``Champions of Change.''\n  I have introduced S. 1614, the Computer Science Education Act, to \nhelp students develop the skills to compete for the growing number of \njobs in computer science. Our Nation's economy and security depend upon \ncomputing professionals, but the current pipeline of graduates will \nsatisfy only 52 percent of the more than 1.4 million computing job \nopenings expected by 2018. The other 48 percent of these jobs will \neither go unfilled or move to other countries. America should continue \nto lead in the high-tech sector by preparing students to take these \nwell-paying jobs. This legislation would strengthen computer science \neducation in elementary and high schools by ensuring that students not \nonly use technology but also learn the technical skills needed to work \nin computer science and grow our economy.\n  Computer Science Education Week will help to increase the interest of \nstudents who will invent the next mobile technology or start the next \ntechnology company. This week was established in 2009 by the Computing \nin the Core Coalition, a group of organizations, companies, and \nscientific societies that strive to advocate for computer science as a \ncore academic subject. Computer Science Education Week coincides with \nthe birthday of Grace Murray Hopper, a pioneer in computer science, who \nwas born on December 9, 1906. She rose to the rank of rear admiral in \nthe U.S. Navy, engineered new programming languages and developed \nstandards for computer systems that laid the foundation for many \ncomputer science advances.\n  The economy of the future and the jobs that will accompany it demand \nthat we prepare our students to remain competitive as leaders in the \nhigh-tech global marketplace. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in recognizing Computer Science Education Week and to cosponsor \nthe Computer Science Education Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/08/senate-section/article/S8456-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8456-S8457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HOOVER POWER ALLOCATION ACT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nimportance of the Hoover Power Allocation Act of 2011, of which I am a \ncosponsor.\n  This legislation passed the Congress after a multiyear effort led by \nSenator Harry Reid, the bill's lead author, and I thank him for his \nwork.\n  Upon enactment, Californians will be able to continue buying Hoover \nDam's power at the cost of production for the next 50 years.\n  The legislation allows the people of southern California whose local \ngovernments and utilities signed the 50-year contracts that made \nbuilding Hoover Dam possible to receive 56 percent of the energy \nproduced by the dam for another five decades.\n  For the people of my State, the Hoover Dam has been a consistent \nsupply of affordable, pollution-free power for decades. The Hoover Dam \nis one of the largest power plants in the United States, with a \ncapacity of 2,080 megawatts approximately the size of each of \nCalifornia's nuclear powerplants.\n  Its average production between 1999 and 2008 was about 4.2 billion \nkilowatt-hours per year, approximately 2.4 billion kilowatt hours of \nwhich goes to southern Californians who buy their power from Southern \nCalifornia Edison, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, or \nmembers of the Southern California Public Power Agency.\n  Hoover's power also plays an essential role moving water into parched \nand populous southern California.\n  The Metropolitan Water District uses Hoover's power to move its \n550,000 acrefeet annual allocation of water from the Colorado River, \nover five desert mountain ranges, to Los Angeles.\n  Without Hoover's power, the Metropolitan Water District's cost of \nmoving that water would be inordinately more expensive.\n  And if California rate payers had to buy that much power at market \nrates instead of Hoover Dam's 2.5 cents per kilowatt hour cost of \nproduction, it would cost approximately $180 million more each year.\n  And that power would likely come from dirtier, more distant sources, \nincluding coal plants.\n  Instead, continued access to Hoover's low-cost, renewable hydropower \nwill keep rates low as California's utilities bring on new, more \nexpensive renewable power to comply with the State's 33-percent \nrenewable portfolio standard.\n  The legislation also sets up a process through which new power \nrecipients in California will be determined by the Western Area Power \nAdministration.\n  As explained in the House committee report accompanying this bill, \nCongress expects the agency to conduct an open hearing and review the \nprocess to determine power allocations fairly and equitably.\n  The process should provide the opportunity for irrigation districts, \nrural electric cooperatives, and other eligible entities to receive \nallocations.\n  Congress also expects that Western Area Power Administration will \nevaluate the relevant power requests of potential new Hoover power \nrecipients in an open, thorough, and transparent process to assess both \nthe applicants' power needs and the classes of customers they serve.\n  The agency should make allocation determinations in an impartial, \nunbiased, and objective manner, consistent with State and Federal \npreference standards, and in a way that provides the most benefit to \nthe most Californians.\n  My colleagues and I also expect that the process and analytical \nresults will be documented and made available for review.\n  Finally, no discussion of Hoover Dam would be complete without \nacknowledging efforts to protect endangered species.\n  Hoover contractors have committed to providing more than $150 million \nover 50 years to support the Lower Colorado River Multi-Species \nConservation Program for the protection of 26 endangered, threatened \nand sensitive species.\n  The legislation authorizing the MSCP was enacted in the 111th \nCongress and signed into law on March 30, 2009.\n  I thank the parties for reaching this agreement.\n  The Hoover Dam is an American success story. And it is a renewable \nenergy success story.\n  During the depths of the Great Depression, Americans stepped forward \nto help build one of the great engineering marvels of all time.\n  Between 1931 and 1936, our Nation made a massive effort involving \nthousands of workers more than 100 of whom lost their lives to build a \npowerplant unlike anything the world had ever seen.\n  Many in Congress at the time argued the cost of Hoover Dam was too \nhigh.\n  They argued that government should not be making such large \ninvestments in infrastructure.\n  They opposed efforts to invest in an unproven energy technology like \nhydropower.\n  The debate was strikingly similar to debates we are having in this \nbody today.\n  Luckily for the people of California, believers in American \ninfrastructure and technology won the Hoover Dam debate.\n  The U.S. Congress provided Federal funds, but only after the \nDepartment of the Interior arranged power contracts at prices \nsufficient to both, No. 1, cover the operating and maintenance charges \nand, No. 2 repay the capital appropriated by the U.S. Congress within \n50 years.\n  When the communities and utilities of California, led by the City of \nLos Angeles, stepped forward to sign those contracts, construction \nbegan.\n  As the years have passed, the investment has been repaid and the \nwisdom of Congress's decision has become apparent.\n  And now we have enacted a law that continues the legacy of Hoover \nDam.\n  I thank the generations before us for having the foresight to fund \nthe Hoover\n\n[[Page S8457]]\n\nDam, and I hope we can again rekindle the spirit and invest in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/08/senate-section/article/S8457-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING LORELEI SHEPARD\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today to recognize and thank \nMs. Lorelei Shepard, who will be retiring from the United States Senate \nat the end of the year. Lorelei began her career on the Hill in 1993, \nworking for the Secretary of the Senate as an elevator operator in the \nCapitol. She eventually became a supervisor where she was responsible \nfor managing the weekly schedule of 20 operators and supervising their \nday to day duties. Her pleasant demeanor and calm nature served her \nwell as she guided and delivered confused visitors and harried staff \nand Senators to their destinations in the Capitol.\n  She joined the staff of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \nin 1995, as the Committee's receptionist, where once again her calm and \nfriendly approach and knowledge of the Capitol served her well. In \n2000, Lorelei decided to pursue one of her dreams and she moved to a \nbeautiful home in a little town in Vermont. As a Californian, I think \nit is safe to say that although beautiful, the winters in Vermont leave \nsomething to be desired. Thanks to that New England winter, Lorelei \ndecided she needed to thaw out and she soon returned to Washington. \nThrough a combination of good luck and timing, the Committee was able \nto have Lorelei join the Committee staff again, at the end of 2001.\n  She has served for the last 10 years on the Committee's staff, \nincluding for the last 5 years as our security assistant, making sure \nthat classified documents are logged and distributed appropriately, \nhandling classified correspondence, and keeping track of the secrets \nentrusted to the Committee.\n  It is the Intelligence Committee's constitutional responsibility to \noversee the intelligence activities of our nation. Through her many \nyears of service on the Committee, Lorelei has made a quiet but \ncritical contribution to this effort. For that, I thank her.\n  Though Lorelei will be leaving, the Shepard family still remains a \npart of the Senate community. Lorelei's daughter, Lori, and son, Peter, \nhave followed in their mother's footsteps and both work in the Senate \ntoday. This is quite a testament to their family's commitment and \ndedication to our nation and one for which they should be proud.\n  I wish Lorelei all the best as she retires and eventually returns to \nVermont. I know she will enjoy the new-found time she will have to \npursue her love of quilting, writing and the myriad of other talents \nwith which she has been blessed.\n  On behalf of the Intelligence Committee, many thanks Lorelei, best \nwishes, and stay warm.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/08/senate-section/article/S8457-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the \nViolence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2011, which I am pleased \nto cosponsor today. As attorney general of Rhode Island, I saw \nfirsthand the good work the Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, has done \nto protect victims of domestic violence, to provide crucial services to \nthose in need, and to hold batterers accountable. The VAWA \nReauthorization Act builds on that record of success and makes \nimportant updates to strengthen the law, while cognizant of the \nchallenging budget circumstances we face. I congratulate Senators Leahy \nand Crapo for their hard work and leadership on this bill.\n  I am particularly appreciative that Senators Leahy and Crapo have \nincluded the Saving Money and Reducing Tragedies through Prevention Act \nof 2011, or the SMART Prevention Act, which I previously introduced, \nwithin the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act.\n  Far too many teens suffer abuse at the hands of a dating partner. \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control, for example, 1 in 10 \nteenagers reported being hit or physically hurt on purpose by a \nboyfriend or girlfriend at least once in the past year. The SMART \nPrevention Act will support innovative and effective programs to \nprotect our children from this dangerous abuse.\n  Earlier this year, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's \nSubcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, I held a field hearing in my home \nState on ``Preventing Teen Violence: Strategies for Protecting Teens \nfrom Dating Violence and Bullying.'' With hundreds of students from \nTolman High School in Pawtucket, RI, in the audience, prominent \nadvocates and experts testified about the importance of educational and \ncommunity programs in preventing dating violence among teenagers.\n  The witnesses explained that teen dating violence remains a serious \nproblem, but that we can take important preventive measures. Ann Burke, \na leading national advocate, explained that school-based teen dating \nviolence prevention programs, especially those focused on middle \nschools, have proven effective in changing behaviors. The Lindsay Ann \nBurke Act, named in memory of Ann's daughter, a victim of dating \nviolence, supports abuse education programs for teens in Rhode Island. \nSince its passage, physical teen dating violence rates in our State \nhave decreased from 14 percent in 2007 to 10 percent in 2009.\n  These preventive measures are most effective when part of a \ncommunity-wide approach. As Kate Reilly, the executive director of the \nStart Strong Rhode Island Project, explained at the hearing, effective \nprevention programming should not be limited to schools alone, but \nshould ``meet kids where they live and play.'' That requires involving \nparents, coaches, mentors, and teen and community leaders, as well as \nusing new technology and social media in innovative ways.\n  One group of children needs particular attention: children who have \nwitnessed abuse in their home. Deborah DeBare, the executive director \nof the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence, explained at \nthe hearing that ``growing up in a violent home may . . . lead to \nhigher risks of repeating the cycle of abuse as teens and young \nadults.'' By supporting robust services for children exposed to \ndomestic violence in the home, we can help break the intergenerational \ncycle of violence.\n  The SMART Prevention Act builds on each of these insights. It would \ncreate a new grant program within VAWA to support dating violence \neducation programs targeting young people, with a particular focus on \nmiddle school students. The bill would also support programs to train \nthose with influence on youth, including parents, teachers, coaches, \nolder teens, and mentors. The new teen dating violence prevention \nprogram would be coordinated with existing grant programs focused on \nprevention, including a program directed at children who have witnessed \nviolence and abuse. By requiring coordination with these programs, and \nfocusing resources on prevention, the SMART Prevention Act is also \nsmart policy fiscally. Abuse that is prevented reduces the strain on \nour already overburdened health and education systems.\n  New laws in several States, as well as innovative and hard-working \norganizations such as the Lindsay Ann Burke Memorial Fund and the Katie \nBrown Educational Program in New England, have demonstrated how \neffective such prevention programs can be, so now is the time for \nCongress to act.\n  I again thank Senators Leahy and Crapo for their leadership in \nreauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. I look forward to working \nwith them and other Senators from both sides of the aisle toward a \ncountry that is free from dating and domestic violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/08/senate-section/article/S8457-3", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8457-S8458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS DAY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I rise today to mark International Human \nRights Day, a day which celebrates the adoption of the Universal \nDeclaration on Human Rights by the UN General Assembly on December 10, \n1948.\n  In the immediate after math of World War II, and reacting with \nrevulsion to the horrors of that global war and the Holocaust, the \ncommunity of nations organized itself with the goal of protecting \ninternational peace and security. Although the United Nations founding \nCharter recognized the protection of human rights as one of the\n\n[[Page S8458]]\n\nUN's most basic purposes, it was quickly recognized that it would be \nnecessary to further elaborate these fundamental freedoms in order to \nensure their protection. The resulting document--the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights--has since served as the foundation upon \nwhich all other human rights work at the international level has stood. \nIt remains to this day an enduring guide for human rights advocates \naround the globe.\n  This has been an exciting and dramatic year that will be remembered \nfor the triumphs of the Arab Spring. The fall of so many dictators who \nhave been responsible for the deaths, torture, and other atrocities \nmeted out against so many has opened up the exhilarating prospect of \nreal reform and meaningful human rights improvements. But the final \nchapter of the Arab Spring has not yet been written, and nothing can be \ntaken for granted.\n  Progress in this field is not necessarily linear. As Ronald Reagan \nsaid in his inaugural address, ``Freedom is a fragile thing and is \nnever more than one generation away from extinction.''\n  I believe it is especially critical, at this historic moment, for the \nUnited States to remain vigilant in the protection and promotion of \nhuman rights--abroad and at home.\n  Overseas, the United States must continue to use our voice to speak \non behalf of those silenced by brutal regimes. We must continue to lift \nup those who cannot stand on their own. And while we must inevitably \npursue a multifaceted foreign-policy that advances American goals in a \nbroad range of areas including hard security and the economy, we must \nnever treat human rights as something expendable.\n  I take particular note of the countries that stand shoulder to \nshoulder with us in that effort. I welcome Polish Foreign Minister \nRadek Sikorski's call for a ``European endowment for democracy,'' \nsimilar to the National Endowment for Democracy which the United States \nhas supported since 1983. I commend Poland for the leadership it has \nshown on human rights issues during its presidency of the European \nUnion.\n  In all of these efforts, the role of civil society remains critical. \nOn the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights, the United Nations adopted a declaration on the rights of \nhuman rights defenders. They are the first line of defense and they \noften pay the highest price.\n  There are, unfortunately, too many cases of human rights defenders \nwho are imprisoned, persecuted or worse, for me to raise them all here. \nBut I would like to mention one in particular that maybe emblematic of \nmany others: the case of Evgenii Zhovtis, Kazakhstan's most well-known \nhuman rights activist.\n  Zhovtis is the Director of the Kazakhstan International Bureau for \nHuman Rights and Rule of Law and even a member of the OSCE Office for \nDemocratic Institutions and Human Rights' panel of experts on freedom \nof assembly. But he was involved in a tragic car accident in which a \npedestrian was killed and, after a trial widely condemned for lacking \ndue process, he was sentenced in 2009 to 4 years in prison.\n  A year ago, at the OSCE Summit in Astana, civil society activists \ncalled for Zhovtis' release. As one NGO participant remarked:\n\n       Evgenii is the human rights Everyman. If this can happen to \n     him, it can happen to anyone.\n\n  A year later, Evgenii Zhovtis remains in a Siberian penal colony, \neven as Kazakhstan prepares to host an OSCE election observation \nmission. In the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, I \nonce again urge President Nazarbayev to review his case and to release \nhim.\n  Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/08/senate-section/article/S8458-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOAN McKINNEY\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to Joan \nMcKinney, who has been a beloved and respected mainstay of the Senate \nPress Gallery for almost 40 years.\n  Joan retired recently after a decade of service on the Press Gallery \nstaff. Prior to that, she served the people of my home State of \nLouisiana for 2\\1/2\\ decades as Washington correspondent for the Baton \nRouge Advocate.\n  Joan is originally from Greenville, SC, and is a graduate of Winthrop \nCollege. She came to Washington in 1971 to work on the press staff of \nour dear colleague Senator Fritz Hollings.\n  As her career advanced, she chose to return to journalism, working \nfirst as a reporter for the Greenville News, where her father served as \neditor, and then for another paper from my home state, the Shreveport \nJournal.\n  Joan was hired away by the Advocate when she continually beat the \nAdvocate's reporter--who happened to be the son of the publisher--on \nstories. I came to know and respect Joan during our many hallway \nmeetings that so often occur between Members and the press. I also had \nthe great fortune of getting to know her as a person and as a friend.\n  In her tenure as the Advocate's congressional correspondent, Joan \ncame to be well respected by members of the Louisiana delegation from \nboth parties. The Members from my State knew her as fair-handed and \ntough, and most of all, that there was nothing, nothing that could get \nby her.\n  Through her work, Joan became an expert on the intricacies of the \nSenate and the Supreme Court. She took this knowledge with her into her \nrole as a member of the Senate daily press gallery staff. I know her \nSenate acumen on the institution and its procedure was of great value \nto the reporters roaming the gallery who relied on her for deep insight \nabout the Chamber they cover.\n  Joan, who has won reporting awards from the South Carolina and \nLouisiana press associations, is a longtime member of the elite \nGridiron Club of newspaper writers. She was one of the first women to \nbecome a member.\n  I know that one of Joan's biggest interests is dance, something I am \ntold she plans to be very active with in retirement. Long before \n``American Idol'' and ``So You Think You Can Dance,'' Joan was an \nexcellent competitive dancer. Her specialty is Shag, a regional dance \npopular in the Carolinas.\n  This year, Joan won her first national Shag championship. With more \ntime to practice, I am sure more dance titles are on the way.\n  For those of us who have been fortunate to work with Joan, it is \nalmost impossible to imagine the Press Gallery without her. But I know \nI join the entire Senate press corps in wishing Joan the best as she \nembarks on this new adventure in her life.\n  Joan, thank you for sharing with this institution and our entire \ncountry your knowledge, experience and good heart. All of us are better \nas a result of your service to the best ideals of our democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/08/senate-section/article/S8458-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8458-S8459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              CROWDFUNDING\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to address a promising new \nidea for investors and small businesses: crowdfunding.\n  In recent years, small businesses and startup companies have \nstruggled to raise capital. The traditional methods of raising capital \nhave become increasingly out of reach for many startups and small \nbusinesses. There is another option, but Congress must act to authorize \nit and provide for appropriate safeguards.\n  Low-dollar investments from ordinary Americans may help fill the \nvoid, providing a new avenue of funding to the small businesses that \nare the engine of job creation. The CROWDFUND Act would provide startup \ncompanies and other small businesses with a new way to raise capital \nfrom ordinary investors in a more transparent and regulated \nmarketplace.\n  The promise of crowdfunding is that investments in small amounts, \nmade through transparent online forums, can allow the ``wisdom of the \ncrowd'' to provide funding for small, innovative companies. It allows \nordinary Americans to get in on the ground floor of the next big idea. \nIt is American entrepreneurism at its best, which is why it has the \nsupport of the President and many in the business community.\n  That said, there are real risks of investment losses at a rate far \nbeyond ordinary investing. Crowdfunding, if done without proper \noversight, provides significant opportunity for fraud. Indeed, it was \nnot too long ago that our financial regulators were doing daily battle \nwith scam artists pitching huge returns on fraudulent schemes through \nsmall, unregistered securities.\n\n[[Page S8459]]\n\n  That is why the CROWDFUND Act will tap the opportunity of \ncrowdfunding while reducing the risks.\n  The CROWDFUND Act provides a capital-raising alternative for startups \nand other small businesses, while not undercutting essential investor \nprotections. It allows companies to raise up to $1 million each year \nfrom ordinary Americans. It provides more disclosure, more \naccountability and accuracy, and limits the exposure of any individual \ninvestor.\n  I thank my colleague Senator Bennet for joining me in this effort, \nand I hope to partner with more of my colleagues to move this idea \nforward in the days to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/08/senate-section/article/S8459-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO CHRISTOPHER L.

Madam President, last weekend California and the \nNation lost one of our great environmental champions when Elden Hughes \ndied at his desert home in Joshua Tree, CA, at age 80.\n  As a longtime activist with the Sierra Club and former president of \nits Angeles Chapter, Elden led successful campaigns to protect \nCalifornia's wild rivers and preserve the historic Union Pacific \nRailroad depot in the desert town of Kelso, CA.\n  But Elden Hughes is best known and fondly remembered as one of the \ntireless leaders of the long grassroots effort to enact the 1994 \nCalifornia Desert Protection Act, which created a new national park in \nthe Eastern Mojave Desert and established higher levels of protection \nfor Death Valley, Joshua Tree, and other desert lands.\n  Elden was born in 1931 in Whittier, CA, the son of cattle farmers \nfrom Modoc County. When he was 13, the family moved out of town and \nbought a ranch where Elden made enough money raising hogs to buy an old \ncar and begin a lifetime of exploring California's wild places. After \nearning his way through college, he worked in the family plumbing \nsupply business, which he then sold to become the executive vice \npresident of a major computer service company.\n  Elden's interest in river-running, spelunking, archaeology, nature \nphotography, and the desert led him to join Sierra Club expeditions and \ngradually become involved in the club's conservation activities. In the \nearly 1980s, he led a grassroots letter-writing campaign that convinced \nCalifornia Senator Pete Wilson to sponsor ``wild and scenic'' \ndesignation for a major stretch of the Tuolumne River. In the late \n1980s, Elden led the successful ``three rivers campaign'' that obtained \nwild and scenic designations for portions of the Kings, Kern, and \nMerced Rivers.\n  Elden worked with Congressman Jerry Lewis to save the historic Kelso \nDepot, in what was then the Eastern Mojave National Scenic Area. \nShowing their usual flair and creativity, Elvin and his wife Patty \ngalvanized public opinion on the depot issue by convincing Amtrak to \nrun a special ``Desert Wind'' train from Los Angeles to Kelso, where \nElden led the crowd in singing railroad songs.\n  In 1986, as the new chair of the Sierra Club Angeles Chapter, Elden \nwas invited to attend a press conference on the introduction of the \nfirst Desert Bill, authored by Senator Alan Cranston. He brought along \nsome of his photos of the Mojave and was soon leading a group of \namateur photographers on a 2-year project cataloguing the fragile \nbeauty of this unique natural area.\n  In 1990, Elden retired from business to become the west coast \nspokesman for the Desert Bill. He was a natural, and the media loved \nhim. As Frank Wheat noted in his book ``California Desert Miracle,'' \nElden was also ``knowledgeable, quotable, pleasant to be with, and \nwilling to go to great lengths to show members of the press what the \nDesert Bill was intended to protect. Soon he was drawing reporters as a \nlamp draws moths.''\n  Meanwhile, Elden and Patty had adopted a pair of abandoned pet \ntortoises and successfully bred a new family. When the babies were 5 \nmonths old, Elden and Patty took them on a cross-country tour to raise \nmedia and public interest in protecting the desert tortoise. Over the \nyears, they made nine trips to Washington, DC, to gain congressional \nsupport for the Desert Bill. Once, when an airline security guard told \nthem they couldn't bring pet tortoises on the plane, Patty said, ``They \naren't pets, they're lobbyists.''\n  Finally, in 1994, Congress passed the California Desert Protection \nAct, and I was proud to cosponsor this bill with Senator Feinstein. \nElden Hughes was instrumental in passing this landmark legislation. \nToday, the Mojave National Preserve and the Kelso Depot stand as \nmonuments to this joyous, creative, and inexhaustible man who did so \nmuch to protect California's priceless natural heritage.\n  On behalf of the people of California, who have benefitted so much \nfrom Elden's life work, I send my deepest gratitude and condolences to \nhis wife Patty; his sons, Mark, Paul, and Charles; and his three \ngrandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/08/senate-section/article/S8459-6", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8459-S8460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  At 9:39 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby\n\n[[Page S8460]]\n\nMrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 1541.

    \n\n[Pages S8462-S8464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Coons):\n  S. 1976. A bill to authorize educational assistance under the Armed \nForces Health Professions Scholarship program for pursuit of advanced \ndegrees in physical therapy and occupational therapy; to the Committee \non Armed Services.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to allow \nphysical and occupational therapists to enroll in the Armed Forces \nHealth Professionals Scholarship Program. I am pleased to be joined in \nthis effort by my colleague, Senator Coons of Delaware. Our legislation \nprovides tuition assistance to critical health care professionals in \nexchange for service as a commissioned medical officer.\n  Unfortunately, while the need for physical therapists has grown \nduring the last ten years of combat, neither the Department of Defense \nnor the military services have conducted a separate analysis of the \ncurrent or future DoD workforce requirements for occupational and \nphysical therapists, even though such an analysis was required by last \nyear's Defense authorization bill.\n  This legislation would allow the military services to extend the same \nkind of educational benefits to physical and occupational therapists \nthat are already afforded to physicians, dentists, physician \nassistants, and even veterinarians.\n  Physical and occupational therapists at the military's major medical \ncenters serve approximately 600 wounded warriors every day on their \nroad to recovery. More than 32,000 service members have been wounded in \nIraq and Afghanistan, including many who have suffered very serious \ninjuries and amputations. Physical and occupational therapists play a \ncritical role in the prevention of injury, rehabilitation, and recovery \nof wounded warriors. They not only serve in medical facilities, but are \nalso embedded with combat brigade teams on the battlefield. They use \ntheir medical training and skill to overcome impairments, regardless of \nthe cause to enable service members to overcome disability and succeed \nin all aspects of life.\n  The idea for this bill came directly from a visit I had with a \nwounded Marine from Maine at the National Military Medical Center in \nBethesda, Maryland in November. He was severely wounded by an IED in \nAfghanistan. He lost part of one leg and his other leg contains \nshrapnel wounds. Both of his arms were wounded, and he has a traumatic \nbrain injury as well. In short, he has very serious wounds that are \ngoing to require a very lengthy recovery period. But, his spirits are \namazingly strong and upbeat.\n  However, when I asked him if he had any concerns, while he praised \nthe care he was receiving, he said there was a severe shortage of \nphysical therapists and other trained clinical personnel to help him in \nwhat is going to be a very long recovery. He is expected to be at \nBethesda for another nine months. It troubles me that he believes there \nare not a sufficient number of physical therapists to help him and the \nother wounded warriors who are hospitalized at Bethesda.\n  While the Department of Defense reports that it does not face a \nshortage in these professions overall, both the Air Force and the Navy \nreport shortages in physical therapists, physical therapy technicians, \nand occupational therapists. One out of every four physical therapist \npositions in the active duty Navy is currently unfilled. So including \nthese medical professions in this existing educational program would \nhelp meet this need.\n  This bill is also endorsed by both the American Physical Therapy \nAssociation and the American Occupational Therapy Association, who \nagree this effort will help curtail a possible shortage of these \nvaluable professionals in the future.\n  I wish to point out, we are not authorizing additional or new funding \nin\n\n[[Page S8463]]\n\nthis bill, it is simply an important insurance policy against a \nshortfall of these medical professions that will help the Navy and the \nAir Force fill vacancies. After all, it is these talented and committed \nprofessionals who are helping our wounded warriors return to living \nfull and independent lives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                                 American Physical\n\n\n                                          Therapy Association.\n\n     Senator Susan Collins,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the more than 77,000 \n     members of the American Physical Therapy Association, I write \n     to thank you for your amendment to the National Defense \n     Authorization Act and your introduction of legislation to \n     include physical therapists in the Health Professions \n     Scholarship Program (HPSP).\n       APTA commends your efforts to add physical therapists to \n     the HPSP. This legislation will enable more of these highly \n     qualified professionals to help treat our nation's wounded \n     warriors and ensure that there will be no shortage in the \n     future. There should never be any disruption in care for the \n     reason of inadequate personnel.\n       As you know, physical therapists play a critical role in \n     the prevention of injury, rehabilitation, and recovery of \n     wounded warriors around the world. They not only serve at \n     medical facilities like the Walter Reed National Military \n     Medical Center (WRNMMC), but they are also found on the \n     battlefield with the Army Medical Specialist Corps and are \n     embedded with combat brigade teams. They aid in shortening \n     the recovery time of soldiers so they can return to service, \n     and are a necessary and integral part of the health care \n     structure of the armed forces.\n       Thank you for your commitment to improving the \n     rehabilitation and well being of our wounded warriors. Please \n     contact Michael Hurlbut, Associate Director of Congressional \n     Affairs, at michaelhurlbut@apta.org or 703-706-3160, if you \n     have any questions or would like any additional information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           R. Scott Ward, PT, PhD,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         The American Occupational\n\n\n                                    Therapy Association, Inc.,\n\n                                   Bethesda, MD, December 7, 2011.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the American \n     Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA), the national \n     professional association representing the interests of more \n     than over 140,000 occupational therapists, occupational \n     therapy assistants and students of occupational therapy, I am \n     writing to thank you for sponsoring legislation to promote \n     occupational therapy within the United States military. This \n     legislation seeks to authorize educational assistance under \n     the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship program for \n     the pursuit of advanced degrees in occupational therapy and \n     physical therapy.\n       Occupational therapy is a skilled health, wellness and \n     rehabilitation service with the goal of improving function, \n     independence and quality of life so that individuals can lead \n     more productive and rewarding lives. Occupational therapists \n     work within the military from the frontlines in Combat Stress \n     Control teams throughout the continuum of care to long-term \n     rehabilitation and stateside community reintegration. While \n     occupational therapists are present in every branch of the \n     service the Army has the largest and most prominent role for \n     occupational therapy; using the professions unique focus on \n     overcoming impairments regardless of the cause to enable \n     soldiers to overcome disability and succeed in all aspects of \n     life.\n       The current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have dramatically \n     increased the demand for occupational therapy practitioners \n     within the military. The signature injuries of these \n     conflicts include traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic \n     stress disorder, traumatic amputation and poly-trauma. Within \n     both the military and the Veterans Administration \n     occupational therapists work as critical members of the \n     treatment teams to address each of these conditions.\n       AOTA and our members in the civilian world and the military \n     appreciate your leadership and vision in promoting \n     occupational therapy education and training for service \n     members so that they can go on to meet the needs of fellow \n     soldiers and society as a whole. Both within the military and \n     the private sector, demand for occupational therapy is \n     expected to increase dramatically and your legislation can \n     help meet those needs.\n       We look forward to working with you and your staff to enact \n     this legislation during this session of Congress so that more \n     occupational therapists are trained to meet the health care, \n     rehabilitation and reintegration needs of our service \n     members.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Tim Nanof, MSW,\n                                      Director of Federal Affairs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  By Mr. SANDERS (for himself and Mr. Begich):\n  S.J. Res. 33. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States to expressly exclude for-profit \ncorporations from the rights given to natural persons by the \nConstitution of the United States, prohibit corporate spending in all \nelections, and affirm the authority of Congress and the States to \nregulate corporations and to regulate and set limits on all election \ncontributions and expenditures; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I am submitting a resolution to amend the \nU.S. Constitution. I do not do this lightly, nor have I ever done \nsomething such as this before. The U.S. Constitution is an \nextraordinary document which has served our country well for over 200 \nyears and, in my view, it should not be amended often.\n  But in light of the disastrous Supreme Court's 5-to-4 decision in the \nCitizens United case, I see no alternative but a constitutional \namendment. I should add that a similar resolution has been offered in \nthe House by Congressman Ted Deutch of Florida. This constitutional \namendment is supported by such grassroots organizations as Public \nCitizen, People for the American Way, and the Center for Media and \nDemocracy.\n  Let me go on record as strongly as I can, and as clearly as I can, in \nstating that I strongly disagree with the Supreme Court's Citizens \nUnited decision. In my view, a corporation is not a person. In my view, \na corporation does not have first amendment rights to spend as much \nmoney as it wants, without disclosure, on a political campaign. In my \nview, corporations should not be able to go into their treasuries and \nspend millions and millions of dollars on a campaign in order to buy \nelections.\n  I do not believe that is what American democracy is supposed to be \nabout. I do not believe that is what the bravest of the brave from our \ncountry, fighting for democracy, fought and died to preserve. Almost 2 \nyears ago, in its now infamous Citizens United decision, the United \nStates Supreme Court upended over a century of precedent, taking a \nsomewhat narrow legal question and using it as an opportunity to \nradically change our political landscape, unleashing a tsunami of \ncorporate spending on campaign ads that has just begun. Make no \nmistake, the Citizens United ruling has radically changed the nature of \nour democracy, further tilting the balance of power toward the rich and \nthe powerful at a time when already the wealthiest people in this \ncountry have never had it so good.\n  In my view, history will record that the Supreme Court's Citizens \nUnited decision is one of the worst decisions ever made by a Supreme \nCourt in the history of our country. While there is no way of knowing \nfor sure, since there are no disclosure requirements in place to track \nwhat was spent, it is no secret that already in the 2010 midterm \nelections, corporations and some very wealthy individuals spent a huge \nand unprecedented amount of money to further their political goals. \nThere is no question this is just the beginning of their efforts. At a \ntime when corporations have over $2 trillion in cash in their bank \naccounts and are making recordbreaking profits, the American people \nshould be concerned when the Supreme Court says these corporations have \na constitutionally protected right to spend, spend, spend shareholders' \nmoney to dominate an election as if they were real live persons. There \nwill be no end to the impact corporate interests can have on our \ncampaigns and our democracy if we do not end this Citizens United \ndecision and its impact on our Nation.\n  All of us in the Senate share one common characteristic. We all run \nfor elections. We all live in the real political world. Let me speak \nfor a moment what I think many of my colleagues in their heart of \nhearts know to be true; that is, that while the campaign finance system \nwe had before Citizens United was, in my view, a disaster--there is no \nquestion it is a disastrous situation where candidates, Members of the \nSenate, spend huge amounts of time having to raise money, and I know \nthat is distasteful not just for Democrats, it is distasteful to \nRepublicans, it is distasteful for an Independent; that is what we do--\nnow, as a result of Citizens United, that bad situation has become much \nworse because\n\n[[Page S8464]]\n\ninfinitely more money is going to come into the political process \nthrough nondisclosed donations suddenly appearing on TV screens in our \nStates.\n  According to an October 10, 2011, article in Politico:\n\n       The billionaire industrialist brothers David and Charles \n     Koch plan to steer more than $200 million--potentially much \n     more--to conservative groups ahead of Election Day [2012].\n\n  What do we think? Do we think American democracy is about a couple of \nwealthy billionaires putting hundreds of millions of dollars into \ncampaigns without disclosure? Is that the democracy Americans fought \nand died for in war after war? I think not.\n  It clearly is not just Republican operatives. There will be Democrats \ndoing the same. So more and more money comes into the system. We do not \nknow where it comes from, and in order to defend ourselves candidates \nare going to have to raise more money and become more and more \ndependent on big money interests. Does anybody believe that is what \nAmerican democracy is supposed to be about?\n  Let's talk about the practical impacts. What happens on the floor of \nthe Senate? The six largest banks on Wall Street have assets equal to \nover 65 percent of our GDP, over $9 trillion--six banks. When an issue \ncomes up that impacts Wall Street--some of us, for example, think it \nmight be a good idea to break up these huge banks. Members walk to the \ndesk up there and they have to decide am I going to vote for this, am I \ngoing to vote against it--with full knowledge that if they vote against \nthe interests of Wall Street, 2 weeks later, there may be ads coming \ndown into their State attacking them. Every Member of the Senate, every \nMember of the House, in the back of their minds, will be thinking: Gee, \nif I cast a vote this way, if I take on some big money interests, am I \ngoing to be punished for that? Will a huge amount of money be unleashed \nin my State?\n  Everybody here understands that is true. It is not just taking on \nWall Street, maybe it is taking on the drug companies, maybe it is \ntaking on the private insurance companies, maybe it is taking on the \nmilitary-industrial complex. But whatever powerful and wealthy special \ninterest we are prepared to take on, on behalf of the interest of the \nmiddle-class and working families of this country, when we walk to that \ndesk and we cast that vote, we know in the back of our mind we may be \nunleashing a tsunami of money coming into our State, and we are going \nto think twice about how we cast that vote.\n\n  I am a proud sponsor of a number of bills that would respond to \nCitizens United and begin to get a handle on the problem. I would like \nto acknowledge them very briefly. One is the Disclose Act, sponsored by \nSenator Schumer, which would force corporations spending money on \ncampaign ads to disclose their identity, as candidates have to do. That \nis a good thing. I support it.\n  Another is the Fair Elections Now Act, sponsored by Senator Durbin, \nwhich would move us to publicly financed elections. I think that is a \nvery good idea. I support that.\n  The third piece of legislation is a recent resolution for a campaign \nfinance constitutional amendment, introduced by Senator Tom Udall of \nNew Mexico, that would make it clear that Congress and the States have \nthe authority to write laws to regulate campaign spending across the \ncountry and make sure our State and Federal elections are about what is \nright for our democracy, and I support Senator Udall's resolution. But \neven these excellent pieces of legislation are not enough.\n  The Constitution of this country has served us well for more than 200 \nyears. But when the Supreme Court says--for purposes of the first \namendment--corporations are people, that writing checks from the \ncompany's bank account is constitutionally protected speech, and that \neven attempts by the Federal Government and States to impose reasonable \nrestrictions on campaign ads are unconstitutional, when that occurs, \nour democracy is in grave danger. Something more needs to be done. \nThere needs to be something more fundamental and indisputable, \nsomething that cannot be turned on its head by a 5-to-4 Supreme Court \ndecision.\n  We have to send a constitutional amendment to the States that says \nsimply and straightforwardly what everyone--except five members of the \nU.S. Supreme Court--seems to understand; that is, corporations are not \npeople. Bank of America is not a person. ExxonMobil is not a person.\n  The resolution I am offering calls for an amendment to be sent to the \nStates that would do that. It would make perfectly clear, No. 1, \ncorporations are not persons with equal constitutional rights as real-\nlife, flesh-and-blood human beings; No. 2, corporations are subject to \nregulation by the people; No. 3, corporations may not make campaign \ncontributions, which has been the law of the land for the last century; \nNo. 4, Congress and States have the power to regulate campaign finance \nas Senator Udall's amendment would also say.\n  This amendment is cosponsored by Senator Begich of Alaska, and I \nwould urge all my colleagues to cosponsor this amendment which, in \nfact, does what its title suggests, saves American democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/08/senate-section/article/S8464-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8464-S8465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 346--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n   GOVERNMENT OF ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA AND ITS ACTIONS RELATING TO THE \n                     STANFORD FINANCIAL GROUP FRAUD\n\n  Mr. VITTER (for himself, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Wicker) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 346\n\n       Whereas the Government of Antigua and Barbuda has committed \n     numerous acts against the interests of United States citizens \n     and operated the financial sector and judicial system of \n     Antigua and Barbuda in a manner that is manifestly contrary \n     to the public policy of the United States;\n       Whereas 20,000 investors, including many United States \n     citizens, lost $7,200,000,000 in an alleged Ponzi scheme \n     involving fictitious certificates of deposit from Stanford \n     International Bank, an offshore bank chartered in Antigua and \n     Barbuda;\n       Whereas the Government of Antigua and Barbuda violated the \n     order of the United States District Court for the Northern \n     District of Texas regarding the receivership proceeding \n     initiated at the request of the United States Securities and \n     Exchange Commission (referred to in this preamble as the \n     ``Securities and Exchange Commission''), in which the court \n     took exclusive control of all the assets owned by Allen \n     Stanford and Stanford-affiliated entities around the world \n     and documents relating to those assets;\n       Whereas the Government of Antigua and Barbuda challenged \n     the authority of the United States District Court for the \n     Northern District of Texas by--\n       (1) initiating a separate and competing liquidation \n     proceeding for Stanford International Bank; and\n       (2) appointing liquidators who have defied the orders of \n     the court in multiple jurisdictions around the world by \n     litigating for control of hundreds of millions of dollars in \n     bank accounts in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Canada;\n       Whereas the Government of Antigua and Barbuda challenged \n     the authority of the United States Department of Justice by \n     seeking to obtain control of hundreds of millions of dollars \n     in bank accounts in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and \n     Canada that had been frozen at the request of the Department \n     of Justice in accordance with multilateral criminal asset \n     forfeiture treaties;\n       Whereas the courts of Antigua and Barbuda have denied \n     recognition of the United States district court-appointed \n     receiver for all assets of Allen Stanford and Stanford-\n     affiliated entities;\n       Whereas the Stanford International Bank liquidators \n     appointed by the Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeals now seek \n     recognition of the Antigua and Barbuda liquidation proceeding \n     as a foreign insolvency proceeding under chapter 15 of title \n     11, United States Code, in the United States District Court \n     for the Northern District of Texas;\n       Whereas the Government of Antigua and Barbuda acknowledged \n     in a statement in March 2010 that--\n       (1) Stanford International Bank ``was operating in Antigua \n     as a transit point and for purposes of registration and \n     regulation''; and\n       (2) ``[t]he business of Stanford International Bank, Ltd. \n     was run from Houston, Texas, and its books maintained in \n     Memphis, Tennessee'';\n       Whereas Allen Stanford, the Stanford Financial Group, and \n     the Government of Antigua and Barbuda enjoyed a mutually \n     beneficial business relationship involving numerous economic \n     development projects and loans to the government of at least \n     $85,000,000, and forensic accounting reports have identified \n     those loans as having been made from Stanford International \n     Bank certificate of deposit funds;\n       Whereas, in June 2010, the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission alleged that Allen\n\n[[Page S8465]]\n\n     Stanford bribed Leroy King, the chief executive officer of \n     the Financial Services Regulatory Commission of Antigua and \n     Barbuda, to persuade Leroy King to--\n       (1) not investigate Stanford International Bank;\n       (2) provide Allen Stanford with access to the confidential \n     files of the Financial Services Regulatory Commission;\n       (3) allow Allen Stanford to dictate the response of the \n     Financial Services Regulatory Commission to inquiries by the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission about Stanford \n     International Bank; and\n       (4) withhold information from the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission;\n       Whereas, in June 2010, the United States Department of \n     Justice indicted Leroy King on criminal charges and ordered \n     Leroy King to be extradited to the United States;\n       Whereas the Government of Antigua and Barbuda has failed to \n     complete the process of extraditing Leroy King to the United \n     States to stand trial;\n       Whereas Dr. Errol Cort, who served as the Minister of \n     Finance of Antigua and Barbuda from 2004 to 2009, allegedly \n     received more than $1,000,000 of fraudulently transferred \n     Stanford investor funds either directly or indirectly through \n     his law firm, Cort & Cort;\n       Whereas Cort & Cort, the law firm of Dr. Errol Cort, served \n     as the official registered agent for Stanford International \n     Bank until June 2009;\n       Whereas the Government of Antigua and Barbuda, along with \n     the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank--\n       (1) seized control and possession of the Allen Stanford-\n     owned Bank of Antigua without compensation to the United \n     States district court-appointed receiver;\n       (2) renamed that bank the ``Eastern Caribbean Amalgamated \n     Bank''; and\n       (3) allocated a 40 percent ownership position to the \n     Government of Antigua and Barbuda and 60 percent ownership to \n     5 Eastern Caribbean Central Bank member banks;\n       Whereas, after the fraud that the Stanford Financial Group \n     allegedly perpetrated was made public, the Government of \n     Antigua and Barbuda expropriated numerous Allen Stanford-\n     owned properties in Antigua and Barbuda worth up to several \n     hundred million dollars, and the government has not turned \n     over those properties to the United States district court-\n     appointed receiver;\n       Whereas the Government of Antigua and Barbuda expropriated \n     without compensation the property known as the Half Moon Bay \n     Resort, which is owned by a group of 12 United States \n     citizens; and\n       Whereas the Government of Antigua and Barbuda--\n       (1) has sought and obtained loans from the International \n     Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International \n     Development Association (commonly known as the ``World \n     Bank'') and the International Monetary Fund; and\n       (2) is the recipient of other direct and indirect aid from \n     the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) provision of all further direct or indirect aid or \n     assistance, including assistance derived from Federal funds, \n     by the United States Government to the Government of Antigua \n     and Barbuda should be suspended until the Government of \n     Antigua and Barbuda provides complete redress of the issues \n     described in the preamble, including through--\n       (A) the full cooperation of the Government of Antigua and \n     Barbuda and any appointee of that government, including the \n     joint liquidators of Stanford International Bank, with the \n     United States Securities and Exchange Commission, the United \n     States Department of Justice, the United States district \n     court-appointed receiver, and the United States district \n     court-appointed Stanford Investors Committee, in \n     investigating the Stanford Financial Group fraud and \n     marshaling the assets of Allen Stanford and all Stanford-\n     affiliated entities;\n       (B) an agreement by the Government of Antigua and Barbuda \n     to be subject to the jurisdiction and bound by the judgment \n     of any United States court that adjudicates the claims \n     relating to the Stanford Financial Group fraud;\n       (C) the transfer of the assets seized by the Government of \n     Antigua and Barbuda, or obtained by the joint liquidators of \n     Stanford International Bank, to the United States district \n     court-appointed receiver for the benefit of victims of the \n     Stanford Financial Group fraud;\n       (D) a contribution by the Government of Antigua and Barbuda \n     to the United States receivership estate for the benefit of \n     victims of the Stanford Financial Group fraud, in an amount \n     equal to the amount of any funds that Allen Stanford or any \n     Stanford-affiliated entity provided to the Government or \n     government officials of Antigua and Barbuda;\n       (E) a contribution by the Government of Antigua and Barbuda \n     to the United States receivership estate for the benefit of \n     victims of the Stanford Financial Group fraud, in an amount \n     equal to any payments that Allen Stanford or the Stanford \n     Financial Group made to Leroy King or any other official of \n     the Government of Antigua and Barbuda for the purpose of \n     subverting regulatory oversight of Stanford International \n     Bank;\n       (F) the fulfillment by the Government of Antigua and \n     Barbuda of its obligations relating to the expropriation of \n     the Half Moon Bay Resort; and\n       (G) an agreement by the Government of Antigua and Barbuda \n     to not--\n       (i) interfere with the receivership commenced by the United \n     States Government; and\n       (ii) seek control of assets claimed by the United States \n     Government; and\n       (2) the Secretary of the Treasury should direct the United \n     States Executive Directors of the International Bank for \n     Reconstruction and Development and the International \n     Development Association (commonly known as the ``World \n     Bank'') and the International Monetary Fund to use the voice \n     and vote of the United States to ensure that any future loan \n     made by the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund to \n     the Government of Antigua and Barbuda is conditioned on \n     providing complete redress of the matters, and satisfaction \n     of the requirements, described under paragraph (1).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/08/senate-section/article/S8465-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n          COMMITTEE ON HEALTH, EDUCATION, LABOR, AND PENSIONS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.
