Madam President, I ask the Chair to lay before the Senate \nthe House message to accompany S. 365.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair lays before the Senate a \nmessage from the House, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Resolved that the bill from the Senate (S. 365) entitled \n     ``An Act to make a technical amendment to the Education \n     Sciences Reform Act of 2002'' do pass, with an amendment.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, as provided under the previous order, I \nnow move to concur in the House amendment to S. 365.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The motion is pending.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, Senator McConnell and I have completed our \nstatements.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes under \nthe time allocated to the Republican side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, finally, Washington is taking some \nresponsibility for spending money that we don't have. At a time when \nthe Federal Government is borrowing 40 cents of every dollar it spends, \nthis is a welcome change in behavior. I gladly support it. Make no \nmistake, this is a change in behavior--from spend, spend, spend, to \ncut, cut, cut. Let me give you one example.\n  On Christmas Eve 2010 Congress raised the debt ceiling and attached \nto it $1 trillion in new spending over 10 years in the new health care \nlaw. This time, for every dollar we are raising the debt ceiling, we \nare reducing spending by a dollar, not adding to it. This reduction in \nspending over 10 years is about $2.4 trillion.\n  Here is another example: According to Senator Portman, who used to be \nthe Nation's budget director, the CBO would say if Congress did this \nkind of dollar-for-dollar reduction for spending every time a President \nasked us to raise the debt ceiling, we would balance the budget in 10 \nyears.\n  Here is another: The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that \nbecause of these spending cuts, the discretionary part of the budget, \nwhich is about 39 percent of the entire Federal budget, will grow over \nthe next 10 years at a little less than the rate of inflation. If we \ncould control the rest\n\n[[Page S5202]]\n\nof the budget so that it would grow to anything close to the rate of \ninflation, we would balance the budget in no time.\n  Balancing the budget is exactly what our goal ought to be. I did it \nevery year as Governor of Tennessee. Families in America do it every \nday. It is time to balance the government's books and live within our \nmeans.\n  These spending reductions are an important step, but they are just \none step, and no one should underestimate how difficult the next steps \nwill be. These spending cuts do almost nothing to restructure Medicare \nand Social Security so that seniors can count on them and taxpayers can \nafford them.\n  The President's budget projections still double and triple the \nFederal debt. Under the President's budget, according to the CBO, in 10 \nyears we will be spending more in interest on the debt than we now \nspend on national defense.\n  In January 2013, the very first thing the next President will have to \ndo is to ask the Congress to increase the debt ceiling. This problem \nwasn't created overnight, and it will not be solved overnight. If I \nwere sitting at Union Station trying to catch a train to New York and \nsomeone offered me a ticket to Philadelphia or Baltimore, I would take \nit, and I would find a way to get to New York from there.\n  Today's vote is an opportunity to take an important step in the right \ndirection, toward stopping Washington from spending money it doesn't \nhave. We should take it and then get ready to find ways to take the \nnext steps.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this is a historic vote. It is one that \nhas involved a lot of emotion and soul searching and a lot of hard \nwork. The leaders are on the Senate floor--the Democratic and \nRepublican leaders of the Senate, Senators Reid and McConnell. I salute \nboth of them for working so hard to bring us to this moment where we \nhave an opportunity to vote.\n  The House has passed this legislation, the so-called Budget Control \nAct. The Senate will take it up shortly. It is my belief it will also \npass in the Senate. But my vote for this legislation does not come \nwithout some pain.\n  We are told in life to follow our conscience. On this matter, my \nconscience is conflicted. If this bill should fail, we will default on \nour Nation's debt. That will be the first time that has ever happened. \nIf we should default at midnight tonight on our Nation's debt, terrible \nconsequences will ensue. We will find America's credit rating in the \nworld diminished, the interest rates we pay as a nation increased, and \nthe cost of money for businesses and families across the United States \nwill increase--at exactly the wrong time, in the midst of recession.\n  If we fail to pass this legislation, tomorrow the Secretary of the \nTreasury will sit down with the President and decide in the month of \nAugust which Americans who were expecting a check will actually receive \none. Will we pay Social Security recipients? Will we pay the members of \nour military? Will we pay the Central Intelligence Agency? It is an \nimpossible choice that the President would face if we fail.\n  But there is another side to the story. If this bill passes, we will \nreduce spending on critical programs. We have to be honest about it. \nFewer children from poor families will be enrolled in early childhood \neducation. Working families and their children will face even more debt \nto pay for a college education. Medical research will likely be cut. \nAnd the list goes on. So from where I stand, it is not the clearest \nmoral choice.\n  I spoke to our Chaplain before we started the session about a line in \nShakespeare I have always struggled to understand. It is from Hamlet, \nand it is the line in his famous soliloquy, when he said: ``Conscience \nmakes cowards of us all.''\n  This morning, I still cannot clearly articulate what it means, but I \nfeel it--struggling with this conscience question of defaulting on our \ndebt, with all of the consequences on innocent people across America, \nand passing this bill with all of the consequences on innocent people \nin America. I have spent the last year and a half focused on this debt \nsituation as I have never been focused before. I understand it a little \nbetter today than I did when I started.\n  I have come to the conclusion that if we are going to be honest about \nour debt and about reducing it, we have to be honest about how it will \nhappen. Sure, we must cut spending; that is where we have to start. But \nwe also have to understand it goes beyond that.\n  We have to be prepared to raise revenue. In the Bowles-Simpson \nCommission and the Gang of 6, I thought we came up with an honest \nanswer to that question. It was a balanced approach and put everything \non the table. Well, this bill makes a serious and significant \ndownpayment in spending cuts. Now a joint committee is created to take \nthe next step.\n  I will say this: If the next step is to be fair, if the next step is \nto be serious, it has to go beyond spending cuts. It has to look at \nserious questions about how we can save money in entitlement programs \nwithout compromising our commitment, and how we can ask those who have \nprofited so well in America, who live so comfortably, to join us in \nthis effort by paying more in taxes. That is the stark reality.\n  If we continue to move toward more and more spending cuts, we will \nliterally disadvantage the poor and working families of America to the \nadvantage of those who are well off. That is not fair, and it is not \nright. Many people have criticized this, saying we don't even read \nthese bills we vote on.\n  Yesterday, I sat down to read this bill--it is not that long. I have \nto say, the front end of the bill is almost unintelligible. A person \nneeds someone from the Budget Committee sitting next to them to explain \neach paragraph. I basically understand that portion of it. I also \nunderstand the portion that Senator McConnell proposed on how we will \nsequence requests for increases in the national debt. I certainly \nunderstand, and am puzzled in some ways, by the joint committee's basic \ncharge to find in 10 weeks anywhere from $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion \nin savings over the next 10 years--in 10 weeks, these 12 members of the \nHouse and Senate are to reach an agreement. It is a daunting task.\n  There is one provision I want to call to the attention of the Senate. \nIt troubles me greatly. It is a provision that requires that the Senate \nand House of Representatives, before December 31 of this year vote on a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. I searched this bill \nlong and hard to find the language of that constitutional amendment \nbecause I thought, if we are going to have to face the prospect of \namending the Constitution, I want to know what the language is. This is \nan awesome responsibility.\n  One can read this bill from top to bottom, and there is not one word \nof substance about that amendment. All it says is, the House and Senate \nshall consider a bill that is a ``joint resolution to amend the \nConstitution of the United States to balance the budget.'' End of \nsentence, end of reference in this bill.\n  It gets better. Not only do they require us to take a balanced budget \namendment and fail to include the language of that amendment--listen \nclosely--this bill says there shall be no amendments to the proposed \nresolution in committee in the House or on the floor of the House, in \nthe committees of the Senate nor on the floor of the Senate--take it or \nleave it.\n  As I say these words, I can imagine Robert C. Byrd descending from \nheaven, standing at that desk and waving this Constitution and \nreminding Members of the Senate that one of the few times in our lives \nwhen we have taken a solemn oath, Members of the Senate swore to uphold \nand defend this document, this writing. He would find it nothing short \nof outrageous that we are mandating a vote on a constitutional \namendment that is not even written, that we are prohibiting the House \nand the Senate from even considering the change of one word in that \nproposed constitutional amendment.\n  Madam President, I think the language of this bill entirely \ndiscredits this effort toward a constitutional amendment. We cannot \ntake it seriously if we take our oath seriously to uphold and defend \nthis document.\n  At the end of the day, I will vote for this measure, obviously with a \nheavy heart. There are parts of it I will struggle to explain and \ndefend, but I can't let this American economy descend into chaos if we \nfail to extend the debt\n\n[[Page S5203]]\n\nceiling. The job ahead will be hard, but let's hope we will, in \nreducing this deficit further, do it in a balanced and fair way, with \neverything on the table.\n  At the end of the day, Members of Congress and people in higher \nincome categories should feel they too are called to sacrifice. If we \nask that of the poorest in America and of working families, we can ask \nno less of Members of Congress and those who are well off in this great \nNation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The other Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, although this bill reflects a balanced \napproach, Americans also expect a balanced budget. We need to apply the \ncommon sense of the heartland to spend within our means, as each family \ndoes with their monthly budget.\n  The battle over this legislation was hard fought. We have finally \nstarted to change a 40-year culture of overspending and overborrowing \nin just 40 days. We hear the American people, and we respect their \njudgment. They tell us they are not undertaxed. They tell us Washington \noverspends.\n  We have a government that claims to support a strong economy but \nurges tax increases that will weaken it. We hear speeches from some who \nwant to expand employment but then attack employers. They argue for \nmore access to credit but then assail the banks that would provide it. \nThey call for more American energy but decry the very explorers who \nwould find it. We need more straight talk and accountability.\n  Small businesses provide the most jobs, and we should reward them. \nInventors create new economies, and we should encourage them. Many \ngovernment programs fail in their objectives, sometimes for decades, \nand we should cancel them. We face mounting government debt. The way to \npay this debt is to generate more jobs, creating more taxpayers who \nwill provide additional revenue, not new Federal job-killing taxes.\n  Given the views of our President and the economically liberal Members \nof this Senate, the legislation before us is the best deal we can get. \nThis legislation caps regular appropriations of the Congress. It \neliminates procedural impediments so that we will vote on how to cut \nautomatic spending programs. We even installed automatic spending \nprograms regardless of congressional gridlock as a backstop to ensure \nfiscal responsibility. This bill prevents a crisis from breaking out \nthis week. It also begins to control automatic spending programs, many \nof which have run without much accountability since the 1960s. All of \nthis is a downpayment on further ways to bring commonsense \naccountability and control to the spending of our government.\n  These basic values are the foundation of America's 200-year \nexperiment in self-government. If we fail, we deliver a free people \ninto the hands of a financial bondage. If we succeed, we honor the \npromise of limited government that offers greater and greater liberties \nto each generation of Americans so that they can reach their own \npotential.\n  I will vote for this legislation because it begins to make the hard \nchoices to keep us free. But it is only a first step, and a crucial \none, to increase the transparency, the performance, and results we \nshould demand from America's government.\n  This bill sets an important precedent to reform automatic spending. \nIf we use that precedent again, then I can imagine an America that once \nagain becomes the best place on Earth for inventors and families to \nstart and expand businesses that will provide for their children and, \nin a few cases, will span the globe with American exports to each \nmarket of the planet.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, over the past 2 years, our \ncountry has been struggling to recover from one of the worst economic \nrecessions in our history. Democrats have worked to pass legislation \nthat would create jobs. It has been our top priority. But at every \nturn, we faced resistance from ideologues who care more about winning \npolitical points and protecting the wealthy than doing what is right \nfor hard-working American families.\n  That is exactly what happened during this debt-ceiling debate. \nInstead of passing a clean extension and getting to work on our \neconomy, we have been forced to vote on a last-minute deal to prevent \nthe economic catastrophe that would result in default.\n  I spent the last few weeks and months highlighting the real-life \nconsequences of default for New Mexico families. At a time when \nfamilies are already dealing with extremely tight budgets, a default \nwould mean increased costs for just about everything, from food, to \ngas, to housing, to sending the kids to college. It would also \njeopardize critical Federal benefits that veterans, seniors, and others \ndepend on to pay the bills and stay healthy. It would mean more than \n360,000 New Mexicans would be in danger of losing their Social Security \nbenefits. It would mean another 300,000 who rely on Medicare seeing \ntheir health care disrupted. It would mean 174,000 New Mexico veterans \nmay not receive their benefits, and more than 1,400 Active-Duty \nmilitary personnel may not receive paychecks for their services.\n  But it wouldn't stop there. Even if you don't depend on a check from \nthe Federal Government every month for health care or retirement or \nother benefits, you would still feel the financial pain of default. \nThat is because mortgage payments would increase by more than $1,000 \nfor the average family and credit card interest would go up by $250. \nWhy is that, you ask. Because the interest you pay on just about every \nloan you have, whether it is a house or a car or college tuition, is \nbased on the interest rates the Treasury pays, and if that interest \nrate rises, as it would in a default, so does the interest rate on just \nabout everything else. New Mexicans can't afford that. America can't \nafford that. And it is to prevent New Mexico families from these \nrepercussions that I will vote for this legislation. But that is the \nonly reason because, to be frank, almost everything else about this \ndeal stinks, and it stinks to high heaven.\n\n  As my friend the good Senator from Vermont said yesterday, this \npackage is grotesquely unfair and bad economic policy. While I firmly \nbelieve we must take steps to rein in our deficit, this package is far \nfrom the ideal way to do so.\n  I hear every day from New Mexicans about the need to rebuild our \neconomy. We should be investing in innovation and infrastructure and \ncreating new jobs, but we don't do that with this deal. Instead of \ncutting excess and investing wisely in programs that create jobs, this \npackage will mean fewer dollars for job training, education programs, \nand housing, hampering our ability to create a long-term recovery.\n  Poll after poll shows a majority of Americans support shared \nsacrifice in this recovery. Unfortunately, this package also falls \nwoefully short on that count. While we did manage to protect important \nprograms such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and nutrition \nassistance programs, there are still many important programs that will \nbe on the chopping block, initiatives such as housing assistance, help \nfor small businesses, and rural economic development programs, just to \nname a few--this all the while the tax cuts for the wealthiest \nAmericans and large corporations remain untouched.\n  This package is what happens when ideologues bent on nationalizing \ntheir extreme agendas get their way. The fracture we have seen among \nRepublicans in the House over the last few months has much broader \neffect than just in that Chamber. Their staunch refusal to compromise \nat the expense of struggling families has pushed this debate and our \nNation to the brink.\n  Instead of having a frank conversation about how we can repair our \neconomy and reach a simple compromise, we have been forced to vote \ntoday to avoid default. With this plan, we get nowhere near the heart \nof our economic problems. Instead, we kick the can down the road a \ncouple of years, all the while the problem continues to grow, impeding \nour recovery and crippling our economic competitiveness.\n  Once this vote is taken and the immediate crisis is passed, it will \nbe all too easy to stick our heads back in the sand and pretend \neverything is OK. I rise today to say this: Everything is not OK, and \nit won't be OK until we have the courage and leadership to institute \ntax reform--not just trimming\n\n[[Page S5204]]\n\naround the edges or rearranging the numbers to create the illusion of \nsavings when, in fact, nothing has changed; I am talking about \nsubstantive tax reform that is the result of a national conversation \nabout our priorities as a society. We have the opportunity to do just \nthat with the commission being created by this plan, but it will take \nguts and leadership and hard choices.\n  Our national deficit is a burden that drags us down competitively and \nrequires serious negotiations, not just concessions to those who see \nthis as a political opportunity to push their personal agendas. We must \nall come to the table and do what is best for our Nation.\n  I see the Senator from Florida is here. I know he is a wise gentleman \nwho has much to say to us.\n  So with that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, again I say to my colleague \nfrom New Mexico what a fine Senator he is, as is the Senator presiding. \nWhat a privilege it is to serve with the likes of the both of you. \nIndeed, the Members of this body are extraordinary individuals, and we \nhave all anguished with what we have been through as the clock was \nconstantly ticking down to midnight tonight and knowing the \nconsequences.\n  This Senator always had the feeling that it was going to work out, \nthat we were going to reach agreement. Interestingly, the financial \nmarkets had that same feeling as well because the financial markets \nnever did go off a cliff. Even the Asian financial markets felt the \nsame thing as we were coming out of the weekend. Even though we, in \nthis capital city of our Nation, have gone back and forth over ways to \ncut this public debt, here we are, we have an agreement. Members of \nthis body, as well as the other body down at the other end of the \nCapitol, clearly are sincere in their differences. But I think what we \nsaw in the overwhelming vote yesterday in the House of Representatives \nwas most of the Members agree that gridlock doesn't do anything to help \nthe country, and especially the economy. So we have this compromise \nplan in front of us, and later today one of two things will be true: \nEither we will have done what is in the best interests of the American \npeople or we will have failed. I think, overwhelmingly, what we will \nsee when we vote at noon today is that there may be as many as 75 \nMembers of this 100-Member Senate who will vote in favor of this \npackage.\n\n  I think not only is it obvious this package is the way to avoid \ndefault, but it starts us on the path of getting serious about what we \nhave to do. The plan contains more than $2 trillion to bring down the \ndeficit over the course of the next 10 years, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, and it is going to cut about half of that \nnow. It leaves the rest of it up to a supercommittee of 12 Members--\nhalf from the House of Representatives, half from the Senate--with each \nhalf appointed by its respective leaders of the Chambers.\n  It is possible this supercommittee will deadlock, but I think with \nthe concern about the financial precipice we have been teetering on, \nthat supercommittee is going to come up with a plan for significant \ndeficit reduction. They have a target of an additional $1\\1/2\\ trillion \nover the next 10 years, but they are not limited to that, and \neverything is on the table. What they could do--and this is a moment, \nif we can seize it, that would be tremendous--is set us on the path to \ndo major tax reform. No one is happy with the existing Tax Code. We \ntalk about all these tax loopholes--the technical term is tax \nexpenditures--and they are simply special interest tax preferences for \nindividual special interests. It blows my mind to realize they will \ncost $14 trillion over the next 10 years. Why should this one special \ninterest have a tax preference and this one have a tax preference, and \nyet we find it difficult, as we go through this harangue here in our \ndebate, as to what is the level of the tax bracket for taxation on \nordinary people?\n  What we could do--and the supercommittee can do this--is take a lot \nof those tax preferences--that $14 trillion worth of them--and by \ntaking only 15 or 20 percent of those away and utilizing that revenue, \nwe could simplify the Tax Code into three tax brackets for individuals \nand lower everybody's tax in that income bracket, and we could lower \nthe corporate income tax. That is a real possibility for this \nsupercommittee. They could give the instructions back to the Ways and \nMeans Committee in the House and the Finance Committee in the Senate \nand then start to do reform, as well as bringing down the national \nannual deficit. The backup, if this supercommittee fails to agree, is a \nseries of spending cuts that automatically happens.\n  This agreement also calls for a vote on a balanced budget amendment. \nI have voted for balanced budget constitutional amendments in the past, \nand we are going to have another opportunity to vote for one. I assume \nwe are going to have a vote for two different versions. The version \nthat is being offered by Senator Udall is the one I intend to vote for.\n  So here we are with a plan that is not a perfect plan, although it \nclearly avoids default. But all of us agree on what it must do: \nGovernment spending must be cut, the public debt must be reduced; \notherwise, our economy will not recover and America will no longer be \nin good standing around the world. That is the bottom line.\n  I often quote from the Book of Isaiah, in which the Lord is speaking \nto the people and he says:\n\n       Come now, let us reason together.\n\n  Isn't that so true here? And was it not avoided for so long, where \nreasonable people of good will--and every one of these Senators is a \nperson of good will--could not get out of our ideological rigidity and \nout of our momentary excessive partisanship so that we could, as the \nGood Book says, ``Come now, let us reason together?'' But I think now \nthat is what we have done.\n  So when we pass this legislation--and it will be an overwhelming \nvote--in about 2 hours, and the President then signs it into law, we \ncan turn our attention back to the economy and creating jobs, which we \nso desperately need to bring us out of this recession that has been \nlingering far too long.\n  Madam President, I thank the Chair for this opportunity, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I understand we are alternating?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would request, after the Senator from Kentucky, who is \nhere to speak--\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. I am sorry, the Parliamentarian has \ncorrected me. There is no agreement to alternate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In that case, I believe I was here on the floor before the \nSenator from Kentucky, so I will proceed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, to say the legislation before us is not \nideal is truly an understatement. The notion that our deficit problem \ncan be solved solely by cutting spending flies in the face of our \nexperience, when in fact unwise tax cuts for the wealthy and egregious \ntax loopholes are significant culprits in our fiscal crisis. I believe \ntoo many Republicans are influenced by an ideology so extreme that it \npromised to wreak economic havoc if they did not get their way. ``No \nadditional revenues'' became the battle cry--an approach that prevents \nthe balanced deficit reduction the American people rightly support. The \nresult is that this legislation incorporates some policies that are \nprofoundly unfair to middle-income Americans.\n  Seen in isolation, Madam President, this is not a good bill. But no \npublic policy exists in a vacuum. Despite its many flaws, this \nlegislation must pass. Let me explain why.\n  While there will be a number of negative consequences as a result of \nthis bill's passage, there will be more dire consequences if it fails \nto pass. The choice here is between a faulty piece of legislation on \nthe one hand and severe damage to our economy and even greater \njoblessness on the other. The choice we face with this vote today is \nwhether to accept a flawed bill or to watch the United States--the \nglobe's preeminent economic power--default on its obligations to senior \ncitizens, students, and veterans, as well as to\n\n[[Page S5205]]\n\nthose who have invested in our country by the purchase of our bonds and \nour Treasury notes. We have taken many steps in the past 3 years to try \nto restart job creation in this country. Those efforts would come \nundone in the crisis that would follow our failure to pass this bill.\n  One of the things that is right about this legislation is that it \navoids a misguided demand that we have another round of crisis and \nnegotiation over this issue in a few short months. A short-term \nincrease in the debt limit, as House Republicans demanded, would surely \nhave led to a damaging downgrade of the government's credit rating. It \nwould have frozen financing for businesses and consumers. We simply \ncannot put the American people and the American economy through that \nagain.\n  Despite this bill's imbalance in focusing solely on spending cuts, it \ndoes contain a mechanism that can force acceptance of what our \nRepublican colleagues have refused to accept--the reality that revenue \nmust be a part of real deficit reduction and that fair and effective \ndeficit reduction efforts require shared sacrifice. The year 2011 is \nthe year of unbalanced spending cuts, and 2012 must be a year of shared \nsacrifice, one in which the President uses the bully pulpit to lead the \nNation to accept the notion that everyone--including, surely, the \nwealthy--must play a role in reducing deficits.\n  Democrats have repeatedly emphasized this point. It is a simple fact \nthat among the largest factors contributing to our deficits is the Bush \ntax cuts--tax cuts that greatly increased the growth of the gap between \nthe wealthiest among us and working families. Today, median household \nincome--the income of the typical American household--is lower than it \nwas in the mid-1990s, and yet the wealthiest Americans not only do \nextremely well, they are doing better and better all the time. A few \ndecades ago, the wealthiest 1 percent of all Americans took in 10 \npercent of all income. Today it is 24 percent.\n  These numbers are not aberrations or actions of a free market. They \nreflect policy choices. Too often the choice has been to pay lip \nservice to the middle class while driving income inequality to levels \nnot seen in 80 years in this country. The failure to ask all Americans \nto join in the sacrifices required to reduce our deficit flies in the \nface of logic and fairness and threatens to increase the growing gap \nbetween upper income and middle-income families.\n  Democrats have proposed commonsense steps to address the failure to \ninclude more revenue and to promote shared sacrifice. We have proposed \nrestoration of the 39.6-percent tax bracket for the wealthiest \nAmericans who make nearly $400,000 a year or more. Most Democrats \nsupport the end of tax breaks for the massively profitable oil \ncompanies. We seek to close loopholes that now allow tax dodgers to \nhide income and assets in overseas tax havens to avoid the taxes they \nrightly owe and to end tax breaks that let highly-paid hedge fund \nmanagers enjoy a lower income tax rate than the rate their employees \npay.\n  So far, too many have denied the need for these changes. But there is \na chance at least that this legislation may finally force consideration \nof added revenues, added fairness in the Tax Code, and the shared \nsacrifice that is so missing from the cuts in the legislation before \nus.\n  Why is that? Under this legislation, we will face a stark choice. We \nmust agree before the end of this year to deficit reduction of at least \n$1.2 trillion over 10 years, or stand by as an automatic budget cut \nkicks in to accomplish that goal. A bipartisan joint committee of 12 \nMembers of Congress will meet and develop a deficit reduction plan that \navoids those automatic cuts. That joint committee will have broad \npowers to review and propose changes to spending and to the Tax Code, \nand to add revenue. Revenues will finally be back on the table where \nthey have always belonged.\n  Meeting that $1.2 trillion goal will not be easy, but it will be \nachievable--achievable, that is, if those who so far have been \nunwilling to compromise will recognize that revenue must be part of the \nequation. Nobody should be eager for the automatic cuts that would \notherwise take effect. Many of those cuts would be unacceptably painful \nand damaging. But the very idea of those automatic cuts is that they \nare so unacceptable that few of us will want to see them enacted and \nmost of us will be willing to compromise in order to avoid them.\n  Congress used this approach once before. In 1985 we passed Gramm-\nRudman-Hollings, which set forth specific deficit targets and required \ncuts if those targets were not met. The framework for today's \nlegislation is based on that model. As one of the authors of the Gramm-\nRudman-Hollings act, Senator Gramm put it:\n\n       It was never the objective of Gramm-Rudman to trigger the \n     sequester; the objective of Gramm-Rudman was to have the \n     threat of the sequester force compromise and action.\n\n  And it did. For example, in 1990, when facing the possibility of \nunacceptable cuts in defense and other important programs, President \nBush and bipartisan leaders in Congress adopted a balanced deficit \nreduction plan that included significant new revenues. The Damocles \nsword of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction act was the reason \nfor that outcome. I believe that any plan from the bipartisan committee \nthat fails the test of balance will have no chance of passage in the \nSenate. That means members of the committee must truly be willing to \nlead, to put aside partisanship and rigid ideology, if we are to avoid \ntriggering unacceptable cuts. Success also is going to require \nPresidential leadership and stronger use of his bully pulpit.\n  Democrats have demonstrated that we are willing to put forward \nserious deficit reduction proposals, plans that include painful cuts to \nimportant priorities. With a vote to approve this bill, which we must, \nit is my hope that we have reached the high tide of an ideological \nmovement that has sought to hold tax cuts for the wealthy sacred while \nimposing increasingly Draconian cuts on programs for American families \nand threatened economic calamity if that movement did not get its way. \nThe era of slashing programs that help middle-class Americans, with no \nshared sacrifice by the wealthiest among us, must end and give way to \nan era in which fairness and balance guide our efforts. Passing this \nlegislation today hopefully will drive us to make that transition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. PAUL. I will.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to give my \nremarks immediately following the Senator.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, America will not default on her debt \ntoday. In fact, there was never any doubt that America would pay her \nbills. But mark my words, America will default. America will default, \nnot by not paying its bills, not by not raising the debt ceiling, but \nwe will default in a more insidious way. America will default by \nincreasingly paying our bills with money that is worth less and less \neach year.\n  A nation pays for its debt in three ways. We can either tax people, \nwe can borrow the money, or we can simply print the money. They all \nhave repercussions.\n  We are approaching our borrowing limit as a nation. We now owe China \nover $1 trillion. We owe Japan nearly $1 trillion. We even owe Mexico. \nAs we reach our borrowing limit, interest rates will rise and the \nprices in the stores will rise. You are already seeing this in your \ngrocery stores. You are already seeing this in your gas prices. They \nare not rising de novo, out of nothing. Your prices are rising because \nthe value of your dollar is falling. The value of your dollar is \nfalling because they are printing up money to pay for this exorbitant \ndebt.\n  In 2008 we went through a banking crisis and we doubled the monetary \nsupply in 4 months. We bought things. The Federal Reserve bought toxic \nassets. They bought bad car loans and bad home loans. Where once upon a \ntime your dollar was backed by gold, your dollar is now backed by toxic \nassets--not a very comforting thought.\n  Many pundits are arguing that the tea party has won this battle. They \nmisunderstand the debate. This battle is not about winners and losers, \nit is about the future of our country. It is\n\n[[Page S5206]]\n\nabout saving ourselves from ourselves. We are headed toward ruin if we \ncontinue on this path of spending money we do not have.\n  For decades, America has lived beyond her means. A nation that lives \nbeyond her means will eventually live beneath her means. That day is \ncoming. A day of reckoning looms. That day was never August 2. That day \nis when the dollar teeters and falls from its perch. That day is when \nprices soar. That day is when unemployment and a declining standard of \nliving foment discontent and unrest in the street.\n  As Erskine Bowles put it, there has been no more predictable crisis \nin our history. We have been given all the warning signs. It comes, and \nthis deal will not escape the facts that are looming for us. The \nPresident thinks that we need a balanced approach. America thinks we \nneed a balanced budget and that we should not spend money we do not \nhave; that since American families have to balance their budgets, why \nin the world would we not require our Government to balance its budget? \nWhat America needs is a balanced budget in an economy that grows and \nthrives and creates jobs.\n  Yes, a malaise hangs in the air. America is a ship without a captain. \nInstead of the President chastising job creators and preaching class \nenvy, we need a President who will show us leadership. The President \nneeds to accept responsibility for an economy that has worsened under \nhis failed leadership. Unemployment is up, gas prices have doubled, and \nthis President will add more debt than all 43 Presidents combined.\n  America got a deal on August 2 but not a solution. What America wants \nis a solution, not a deal. I hope in the next 6 months the President \nwill find it within himself to lead the Nation, the courage to lead and \nembrace reform, the reform that is necessary to get this great country \ngoing again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I compliment the senior Senator from \nKentucky for his good remarks on the floor and for allowing me that \nunanimous consent request.\n  We are coming down to the wire here. We will soon be voting on a \nproposal that would couple some deficit reduction with an increase in \nthe statutory debt limit. There are some positive features in this \nlegislation, and the Senate's minority leader, the Speaker of the \nHouse, and conservatives throughout the country should be commended for \ninsisting on them.\n  First, the President asked for a clean debt limit increase, and \nconservatives refused. They held the line and made clear that any \nincrease in the debt limit required matching deficit reduction.\n  Second, having lost the fight over a clean debt limit increase, the \nPresident insisted on a balanced approach to deficit reduction, by \nwhich he meant reducing the deficit by raising taxes. But conservatives \nagain fought this back. They knew that the primary driver of our debt \nis spending. Regardless of the President's talking points, nondefense \ndiscretionary spending is at historic levels. We are set for our third \nstraight trillion dollar deficit. We have a national debt of $14.5 \ntrillion, and the President's budget would give us $13 trillion more in \ndebt. The answer to this is not giving the government more money to \nspend.\n  And third, conservatives resisted the effort by the President's \nallies to push most of the deficit reduction in this package down the \nroad.\n  So there are some achievements in this proposal that conservatives \ncan hang their hat on.\n  But I regret to say that I will not be able to support it, because it \ndoes not sufficiently provide us with the solution to the debt crisis \nthat the markets are demanding. Last week, Moody's made clear that the \nreal threat to America's Triple A rating is not default, which even the \nadministration now acknowledges was never going to happen. The real \nthreat of a downgrade comes from a failure of will. It comes from a \nfailure of presidential leadership in getting federal spending under \ncontrol.\n  There is a solution to this spending crisis. It is cut, cap, balance, \nwhich I was an early supporter of. In addition to providing short term \nrelief by cutting and capping spending, it provides for a long-term \nsolution through passage of a strong balanced budget amendment.\n  This proposal falls well short of cut, cap, balance, and I cannot \nsupport it.\n  I would like to address a technical point about this package that \nraises concerns for me--whether the President is looking to the deficit \nreduction committee as an opportunity to raise taxes. He says that he \nis, as have some of my colleagues in the Senate.\n  I do believe that it will be very difficult, given the committee's \ncharge to reduce the deficit, to raise marginal tax rates. However, I \nworry that some Democrats will be looking at tax expenditures in order \nto hit the committee's required deficit reduction targets.\n  This would be a mistake for a number of reasons. The President has \nreferred to tax expenditures as ``spending through the Tax Code.'' But \nrhetoric aside, tax expenditures are an opportunity for individuals and \nbusinesses to keep more of the money that they earn. And getting rid of \ntax expenditures, without corresponding reductions in tax rates, will \nresult in a net tax increase on the American people.\n  The President would have you believe that getting rid of tax \nexpenditures is acceptable, because they only impact the rich. That is \nwhy he talks about bonus depreciation for jets and yachts used as \nsecond homes. Yet in a series of speeches, I have attempted to show \nthat this rhetoric of class warfare might work politically, but as a \ndescription of tax reality it is lacking. The fact is, the largest tax \nexpenditures, those that the President and Democrats would have to look \nto in order to raise revenue for deficit reduction, benefit middle \nclass itemizers the most.\n  Consider the example of the home mortgage interest deduction. Since \nadoption of the 16th amendment to the Constitution in 1913--98 years \nago--the United States has had an individual income tax. And for that \nentire time home mortgage interest has been deductible in calculating \ntaxable income.\n  Most of our fellow Americans, when buying a home, do not pay cash for \nthe entire purchase price. Rather, they typically pay a certain \npercentage in cash and borrow the rest. It is common that the money \nborrowed is repaid in monthly increments over the course of 15 or 30 \nyears. Those payments from the homeowner to the lender to compensate \nfor the borrowing of money are interest payments. If you itemize your \ndeductions, you get to subtract home mortgage interest from adjusted \ngross income--or AGI--in arriving at taxable income.\n  The most significant of the itemized deductions available to \ntaxpayers is the home mortgage interest deduction. The mortgage \ninterest deduction is the second largest tax expenditure identified by \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation, and it is not primarily a benefit for \nthe wealthy. Thirty percent of the benefit of the mortgage interest tax \nexpenditure goes to taxpayers over $200,000. Taxpayers with income \nbelow $200,000 receive 70 percent of the benefit of the mortgage \ninterest deduction. By a ratio of almost 2 to 1, taxpayers under \n$200,000 benefit from the mortgage interest deduction. Since $200,000 \nbasically fits the definition of rich used by my friends on the other \nside of the aisle, we can see that the nonrich or middle income group \ndisproportionately benefit from the mortgage interest deduction.\n  There have been proposals over the decades to eliminate the home \nmortgage interest deduction, but none of them have succeeded. In 1986, \nduring the last major tax reform effort, there were active proposals to \nget rid of the home mortgage interest deduction.\n  President Clinton attacked some of the tax benefits associated with \nhome ownership back in the 1990s. Specifically, President Clinton \nproposed taxing the imputed income associated with home ownership. A \nhomeowner by living in his home enjoys a certain benefit--the ability \nto live in his home. That is, he could have rented the home out for a \ncertain amount of money, but he instead decided to live in the home. It \nis as if he received the rental money for the home, and then spent it \non rent so that the owner himself could live in the home.\n  As policy this is somewhat convoluted. Generally, Congress has been \nreluctant to tax people when they have\n\n[[Page S5207]]\n\nreceived no cash. In addition, those on a fixed income would have found \nit difficult in many cases to get the cash to pay the tax. Finally, \nthere would be significant administrative concerns--just what would the \nrental value of a home be? How would that be determined? It would be \nquite difficult. Thus, in a bipartisan fashion, Congress rejected the \nPresident's proposal to tax imputed income arising from owner-occupied \nhousing.\n  Now President Obama is taking another crack at it because he wants to \nraise money to reduce the deficit. President Obama has proposed, \nreproposed, reproposed again, and reproposed yet again to reduce the \nbenefit of the home mortgage interest deduction. I am speaking of \nPresident Obama's proposed 28 percent limitation on itemized \ndeductions. President Obama has proposed to limit the tax rate at which \nhigh-income taxpayers can take itemized deductions to 28 percent. This \nis meant to lessen the benefit to higher income taxpayers of itemized \ndeductions--the home mortgage interest deduction being the most \nsignificant of the itemized deductions. The Joint Committee on Taxation \nsays that this provision would mean the Federal Government would \ncollect an additional $293 billion in taxes over 10 years.\n  To understand this provision, allow me to tell you about two \ntaxpayers: William and Spencer. Let's assume that William is in the 15 \npercent tax bracket, and that Spencer is in the 35 percent tax bracket. \nUnder current law, an additional itemized deduction of $100 is worth \n$15 to William, and $35 to Spencer. That is, an additional itemized \ndeduction of $100 will reduce William's tax bill by $15, but Spencer's \ntax bill would go down by $35. If the President's 28 percent limitation \nproposal were to go forward, however, although the itemized deduction \nwould still be worth $15 to William, it would now be worth only $28 to \nSpencer.\n  Of course, one may think--well why should high-income Spencer get a \nmore valuable tax benefit from an itemized deduction than low-income \nWilliam? But that mischaracterizes things. First of all, high-income \nSpencer, even under current law, still pays significantly more tax than \nlow-income William. That is not only true in absolute dollar terms, but \nalso in terms as a percentage of their respective incomes. Furthermore, \nthe 35 percent bracket was set by Congress with an understanding and \nrealization that itemized deductions would allow a significant tax \nbenefit. That is, had Congress known that higher income taxpayers would \nbe disallowed some of their itemized deductions, as the President now \nproposes, undoubtedly Congress would have created a lower maximum tax \nrate bracket than the current 35 percent tax bracket. So, to take away \nsome of the benefit of itemized deductions to higher-income taxpayers \nbut leave the high-income tax rates at their current high levels is to \nupset the balance struck by prior Congresses. Obviously, Congress is \nallowed to do that. But let's not pretend that current law is somehow \nan oversight, or unintended consequence, from prior legislation.\n  Some of the President's advisers defend the proposed 28 percent \nlimitation on the grounds that 28 percent was the tax benefit one would \nget during the later Reagan years. Yes, that is true. But it is only \ntrue because 28 percent was the highest tax bracket after the Reagan \ntax reform!\n  The larger point is this, however. To the extent that the home \nmortgage interest deduction, or any tax expenditure for that matter, \nshould be addressed by Congress, it should be addressed through the \ncontext of a comprehensive, revenue neutral tax reform that lowers \nrates. These tax-expenditures should not be cherrypicked by the \nPresident and his liberal allies to pay for the checks that his \nadministration has written.\n  I have made this point many times, but today, it is important to make \nit again. To the extent that any tax expenditures are taken away, tax \nrates should come down, so that the net effect to government revenues \non a static-score basis is neutral. That's what tax reform is all \nabout-- getting rid of tax expenditures so as to reduce tax rates. By \nreducing tax rates, we will unleash the free-market. By unleashing the \nfree market, we will grow the economy. By growing the economy, tax \nreceipts will increase, even though on a static-scoring basis, tax \nreform would be revenue neutral. If we get rid of tax expenditures \nwithout an offsetting tax-rate reduction, then we have simply made the \ntask of tax reform that much harder. We have squandered an important \nopportunity.\n  I would like to make a last procedural point about where we go from \nhere. Even if Congress passes, and the President signs, this deficit \nreduction package, we are going to be back at this again before the \nyear is out. The President will be asking Congress to raise the debt \nceiling again. Given that, I would like once again to address the \nfailure by the Treasury Department to respond to repeated requests I \nhave made over the past week about Treasury's short-term cash position, \nand the failure by almost every member of the so-called Financial \nStability Oversight Council--or, F-SOCK--to provide Congress with \ninformation about their contingency plans in the event there is a \nratings downgrade on U.S. debt in the future.\n  Does Treasury still think it will run out of cash by midnight \ntonight? I have been given only limited information. Treasury continues \nto say we will run out of cash today and will not be able to pay our \nbills, the same date they estimated way back in May. But, Treasury \nwon't show me how they are arriving at that estimate. I have not been \ninformed, Congress has not been informed, and Americans counting on \ntimely Social Security payments have not been informed. Almost every \nmember of the F-SOCK, including Treasury and the Federal Reserve, has \nrefused to provide me with any information about their contingency \nplans for ratings downgrades. Even if the debt limit is raised, there \nis no assurance that we won't face a downgrade. We need to know the \ngovernment's plans.\n  As I have said repeatedly, this is unacceptable. I want to be clear \nabout two things. First, Congress will have to look into this matter \nvery carefully, and investigate whether Treasury and most of our major \nfinancial regulators have been deliberately withholding information \nfrom Congress, and if so for what purposes.\n  Second, assuming that down the road Treasury will present Congress \nwith another default date, I want to put them on notice that this fall \nI will be demanding timely substantiation of Treasury's assessment and \nthe government's cash position. Absent this cooperation, I will stand \nin the way of any debt limit increase demanded by an unsubstantiated \nTreasury-determined deadline.\n  In closing I want to be clear. I cannot support the outcome of these \nnegotiations. But my opposition is not owing to the failure of \nconservatives or the Republican leadership in the House and Senate. It \nis owing to what is clearly amounting to the failed presidency of \nPresident Obama. He and his allies are ideologically committed to more \nspending. Fortunately, the American people will have the final verdict \non this economic philosophy in 2012.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bingaman). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to address the Obama-Boehner debt \ndeal. I must say it is an issue on which I have been immersed in \nwrestling to understand the impact on unemployment, the impact on \ninvestments that will strengthen our Nation down the road; certainly an \nimpact on programs that strengthen our families. It is in that context \nwe try to understand how do we build the strongest possible Nation for \nworking families. How do we do that? Is the Obama-Boehner debt deal the \nright path? I must conclude that it is not the right path. I conclude \nthat for four reasons.\n  The first is the impact on jobs. We are facing a gathering storm on \nthe job front. We have 5 to 8 million additional foreclosures that are \nsuppressing the success of our construction market, driving down the \nvalue of houses and having a devastating impact on the attempts at a \nrecovery.\n  Second, the unemployment benefits. The extended unemployment benefits \nexpire this year, and the rough estimate is that that will result in a \nreduction of around 500,000 jobs. That is a tremendous blow in 2012. \nThen we have the termination of a payroll tax holiday and the estimate \nis that may well produce losses of jobs of more than 900,000 across \nAmerica. Add them and you are talking about nearly 1.5 million lost \njobs that we will face in 2012.\n\n[[Page S5208]]\n\nSo on top of this gathering storm comes the Obama-Boehner debt deal \nthat is estimated to produce another job loss--and by varying \nestimates--from 100,000 to 300,000. Doesn't this deal take us in the \nwrong direction? Shouldn't we be on this floor working to create jobs, \nnot to destroy jobs? The success of our families depends on it.\n  My second major reservation about the Obama-Boehner debt deal is its \nimpact on working families through the concentration of cuts on the 18 \npercent of the budget that is the nondefense discretionary portion. \nThis is the portion of the budget that involves Head Start and Pell \ngrants--in other words, an opportunity for our children, our smallest \nchildren, success for university education for our college-bound \nstudents. It is the area of the budget that involves investments in \nclean energy. It involves our small business programs that support the \nsuccess of our small businesses. It involves job training that helps \nfamilies adjust to a changing dynamic in the economy, and so much more.\n  In this 18 percent of the budget is where the cuts will hit. What \nwith the phase I required cuts, or title 1 cuts, in combination with \nthe cuts under title 3, you have essentially 15 percent cuts from the \n2011 March CBO baseline. Understand that baseline for 2011 is a very \nlow baseline, much lower than 2010, much lower than 2009. It takes us \nback many years earlier. We have a very low baseline and we are going \nto cut 15 percent more out of the core programs supporting the success \nof our working families, supporting the success of our smallest \nchildren, supporting the success of our college-bound children. This is \nnot the path that builds a stronger America.\n  The third factor is that while our children in Head Start and our \nchildren headed for college and our citizens seeking job training are \ngoing to take these blows, the wealthy and well-connected do not \ncontribute one slim dime. As some of my colleagues have argued: Well, \nyou know what, there are some of those programs embedded in the Tax \nCode that actually help the middle class. My colleague from Utah was \njust making that argument. Then the argument is extended: So don't \ntouch any of those programs. Well, if we take that same attitude toward \nour spending programs, we would say some benefit the middle class, so \ndon't touch any spending programs. Obviously, it is an absurd argument. \nWhy is it made on the revenue side, to those programs there, but not in \nthe programs that are on the appropriations bill? Why is the tax bill \nprotected from not only that argument but the spending bills are not? \nOne simple answer: The programs for the wealthy and well-connected are \nin the tax bill. So this false argument is used to defend the \naccumulation of wealth, the expansion of prosperity for the few--for \nthe powerful few--at the expense of families across this Nation.\n  My fourth concern about the Obama-Boehner debt deal is that simply it \nwas forged out of a process of extortion. If you look through the \neditorials, you see words such as ``hostage taking'' and ``extortion'' \nand ``lunacy.'' We only have to turn back to Ronald Reagan to remember \nwhat he had to say on this. He said: This brinksmanship threatens the \nholders of government bonds and those who rely on Social Security and \nveterans' benefits. Interest markets would skyrocket, instability would \noccur in the financial markets, and the Federal deficit would soar. The \nUnited States has a special responsibility to itself and to the world \nto meet its obligations.\n  Those who have threatened, for the first time in U.S. history, for \nthe United States not to meet its obligations, which would result in a \ndevastating impact for families across this Nation, those who carried \nout that threat did so in the wrong spirit--not the spirit of America \npulling together, but in the spirit of creating a situation of hostage \ntaking and extortion designed to protect the most powerful and wealthy \nat the expense of families across this Nation.\n  Because this deal does damage to jobs and contributes to a gathering \nstorm in 2012 that threatens to take us back to a double-dip recession, \nbecause the cuts are concentrated on the programs such as education and \nHead Start and Pell grants that support the success of our children and \nthe success for our future economy, because it doesn't take one slim \ndime of contribution from those who are most able to contribute in our \nsociety, and because it was forged out of a fundamentally inappropriate \nuse of extortion against the American family--for those four reasons I \nwill oppose this deal.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bill. I would say \nfor the second time in about a week I have come to the floor to speak \nafter one of my friends on the other side who is talking about what we \nought to be talking about, and both times they were right. They said we \nshould be talking about private sector job creation. I say where are \nthe bills to do that?\n  We have been here the week of the Fourth of July. We were here and we \nhad two votes that week. One was to compel the Senators who didn't show \nup to show up. The other one was on some motion to proceed to cloture \non something that had nothing to do with job creation or any of the \nother issues we should be talking about. We could talk about what we \nought to be talking about, and that would be one thing. Of course, what \nwe are talking about today is the moment we have arrived at, the date \nthat was set by the administration. Apparently they were right in \nspeculating when we need to look at the borrowing limit again, and that \nis today.\n  I rise in support of the bill. I said for months the only thing worse \nthan not raising the debt limit would be raising the debt limit and not \nchanging behavior. In fact, I think that is what all the rating \nagencies that everybody is talking about now, whether they are going to \nand how they are going to rate our bond rating in the future--they have \nall said--and they said long before they talked about the debt limit--\nthat we are spending more money than we can afford to spend as a \nFederal Government or as a society. We are spending $1 out of $4 that \nthe society can produce, and that is about 25 percent more than we \nspent in 2008. It is 25 percent more than we spent on the average from \nthe 40 years from 2008 going backward four decades, and that is \nimportant. I think this bill does begin the process of changing \nbehavior. The way we approached the debt limit this time was everything \nbut business as usual.\n  This is a totally different discussion than we have had before about \nthe debt limit, and the country has almost always had debt. I think \nthere have been only a couple of times in our history where Andrew \nJackson paid off the debt and there was one other time we paid off the \ndebt--only a couple of times in our history when we didn't have some \nkind of debt. In the tradition of that debt, we have always said: Okay, \nlet's borrow more money because we need more money. This time, for the \nfirst time, we said: Why do we need more money? Why is it that we are \nincreasing debt? Why is it we are increasing debt so rapidly? We had a \n$10 trillion debt in January of 2009, and 30 months later we have a $15 \ntrillion debt. Obviously that trajectory cannot continue and the \nframework for the decision that is made in this bill says it won't \ncontinue.\n  Do we continue to add debt over the next decade? We wouldn't have to. \nThere is a study out that says every time the debt ceiling comes up \nover the next 10 years, we make the same kind of determination that for \nevery dollar we increase the debt ceiling, we are going to find a \ndollar in savings over the next decade. That study would indicate that \nin 10 years we balance the budget. Of course, that is what we should be \ndoing, balancing the budget. This body, before I served here, before I \nserved in the House, before I was in the Congress at all, in 1995 came \nwithin one vote of the balanced budget amendment, one vote of passing \nthe amendment that had passed the House. In 1996 it came within two \nvotes of passing that same amendment that had passed the House again. \nIf that one vote would have changed in 1995 or the two votes would have \nchanged in 1996, we would not be having this discussion today because \nwe would have a balanced budget today and would be moving in the way \nthat every State but one has to function and every family in America \neventually has to come to grips with the fact that they cannot spend \nmore than they have.\n\n[[Page S5209]]\n\n  The truth is, this agreement, while it is a 10-year agreement, is \nonly enforceable for a couple of years. I believe we will do what this \nagreement says this year and next year. I am hopeful and optimistic the \nselect committee will do its job and come back with another $1\\1/2\\ \ntrillion or more of cuts to spending, and that is going to happen--that \nselect committee is going to report this year. The budget cap is set \nfor this year and next year.\n  But elections matter, and who is elected in 2012 to the House and the \nSenate and the Presidency will finally and ultimately make a decision \nabout whether this track we are on now gets better than it is now or, \nfrankly, heads back in the other direction. I think the campaign \npledges are important. While I support the bill, I am also fully \nappreciative of everyone who feels as though they can't.\n  Frankly, if some campaign pledges hadn't been made in 2010, we \nprobably wouldn't be at this moment. And if that is somehow \nextraordinary--that people run for office and say that is what they are \ngoing to do and then they come here and do that--that is what the \nprocess is all about and how it is supposed to work.\n  Is this my sense of what would have been the best way to deal with \nthese spending cuts? We would have more spending cuts if I were writing \nthis bill. But the fact is, in Washington today no one party controls \nanything. My party, the Republican Party, controls one-third of what it \ntakes to get a bill to become law, and the other party controls two-\nthirds. At the end of the day, by definition, nobody is going to be \ntotally happy with this bill.\n  But as Senator Pat Roberts said yesterday in a meeting I was in, \nusing an old legislative saying: This is not the best possible bill, \nbut it is the best bill possible. It is the best we can do right now.\n  I think we take this victory and use it as a way to move forward to \nthe future.\n  Mr. President, I rise, again, in support of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor to express my support for the \nmeasure before us, as my colleague from Missouri who has just spoken, \nand as everyone else I have heard express their support for this \nproposal. No one seems perfectly satisfied with it, but that is \ninevitable. I think we have come to one of those classic moments of a \nvery big challenge our Nation faces--this enormous debt--and whether in \nthis agreement we see this glass half full or the glass half empty and \nwhether what encourages us in the agreement outweighs what disappoints \nus.\n  For me, the positive outweighs the negative. I am going to vote for \nmy hopes about what this agreement means as opposed to my fears that we \nare not doing enough in this agreement.\n  What makes me most happy about it is this is a bipartisan compromise \nthat turns the corner, turns the ship of America's state away from \ngreater and greater deficits and a greater national debt and in the \ndirection of balancing our budget once more. It turns us in the \ndirection of reestablishing classic American values of discipline and \nthrift and concern about our future and investment in our future, which \nwe have lost in our Federal Government through the work of both parties \nin the executive and legislative branches of our government.\n  It is a bipartisan agreement at a time when this Chamber and this \ncity have become reflexively and destructively partisan, and that is \nencouraging to me, that it is bipartisan. It is a compromise at a time \nwhen this city has become ideologically rigid, and it is clear, if we \nlook at our history, that we only make progress when we compromise. \nThat is because we are such a big, diverse country with so many \ndifferent opinions and points of view. So this is a bipartisan \ncompromise. It is the beginning of a long, hard march back to fiscal \nresponsibility in our country--back to a balanced budget.\n  So what troubles me about it? What troubles me about it is that the \nbipartisan compromise also represents a kind of bipartisan agreement by \neach party to yield to the other party's most politically and \nideologically sensitive priority. In the case of Democrats, it is to \nprotect entitlement spending, and in the case of Republicans it is to \nnot raise taxes. The reality is that we have to do some of both if we \nare going to get our country back into balance.\n  Because this agreement doesn't really touch the entitlement \nprograms--particularly Medicare, which is growing faster, bigger than \nany other government program--it puts all the burden of getting back \ntoward balance in our budget on the so-called discretionary spending \npart of the budget. That is about one-third of Federal spending. About \n60 percent is the entitlement or mandatory programs. So we have the \nbeginning of a system that forces cuts in the discretionary third of \nthe budget--defense and nondefense--which they have to do, they have to \ncut--but it doesn't ask much of anything of the 60 percent that is \ngrowing so rapidly, which is entitlement spending.\n  As a result, if the special committee created in this agreement--\nwhich is the great hope of the agreement, I think--doesn't work its \nwill and involve itself in entitlement reform and tax reform, and \nCongress doesn't accept it, then the trigger, the automatic spending \ncuts are also all from discretionary spending, asking that one-third of \nthe budget to pay the way, even though it is a small part of the \nresponsibility for the increase in government spending. That would have \na devastating effect on our national security because it would \ndramatically undercut our defense, as well as some of the programs that \nare the great investment programs of our future: education, energy, et \ncetera, et cetera. So I hope the special committee will redeem our \nhopes and Congress will too by dealing with entitlement reform.\n  I wish to say here that Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and I, in \nJune, introduced a proposal that would take steps to save Medicare for \nthe almost 70 million people who will be on Medicare in a decade and \nreduce the enormous costs it places on our taxpayers. I think a lot of \npeople in our country think the payroll deductions and the premiums \nthey pay, pay the total benefits of Medicare. Unfortunately, that is \nnot so. The average Medicare beneficiary in their lifetime takes $3 or \n$4 out of the system for every $1 they put in, and we just can't run a \nprogram long term like that. Who picks up the rest? The taxpayers, the \nbudget. That is a big part of why we are heading into deficit. So we \ncan't save Medicare by leaving it as it is. We can only save Medicare--\nand I want to save Medicare because I believe in the program--if we \nchange it.\n  Senator Coburn and I put forward this plan that will save over $600 \nbillion in Medicare costs over the next decade. It will extend the \nsolvency of Medicare by at least 30 years and reduce Medicare's 75-year \nunfunded liabilities by $10 trillion.\n  Now, I know our plan contains some strong medicine, but that is what \nit will take to keep Medicare alive, and we believe our plan \nadministers this medicine in a fair way. Senator Coburn and I are going \nto forward our proposal, which is in legislative form, to the joint \nselect committee for their consideration, and we hope they will include \nparts of it in their recommended legislation.\n  I also believe it is essential for the joint committee to act to \nbolster the solvency of Social Security. Many think Social Security is \nnot contributing to the deficit because it has a positive balance in \nthe Social Security trust fund. But what is in that trust fund? It is \nnotes that the United States Government has given to the Social \nSecurity trust fund every time we have borrowed from it. Of course, we \nare bound to pay that money back.\n  The fact is, today Social Security is running a deficit on a cashflow \nbasis. In other words, the payments into the system are not as great as \nthe payments out, and they will continue to do that in increasing \nnumbers for the foreseeable future.\n  What does that mean? It means the Social Security trust fund has to \ncome to the Federal Government to redeem the bonds the government gave \nSocial Security when it borrowed the money. How does our government pay \nback the Social Security trust fund? By borrowing over the next two \ndecades $2.6 trillion, currently held in IOUs, plus interest. If we \ndon't do something to save Social Security, when we hit the year of \n2036, Social Security will only\n\n[[Page S5210]]\n\nbe able to pay benefits to the extent that they are covered by incoming \nreceipts, and that will mean a sudden, shocking, painful 23-percent cut \nin benefits for senior citizens.\n  We have to begin to enact reforms now to slowly save Social Security, \nand we can do it. I wish to indicate today to my colleagues that \nSenator Coburn and I are working again on a bipartisan proposal to \nsecure Social Security for America's seniors for the long term, and we \nhope to have that done in time to also forward to the special committee \nfor their consideration.\n  So the bottom line: We can't protect these entitlements as well as \nhave the national defense we need to protect us in a dangerous world \nwhile we are at war against Islamic extremists who attacked us on 9/11, \nand will be for a long time to come. We can't not touch the \nentitlements or raise taxes and create a tax reform proposal and expect \nto protect all the programs of investment in our future that mean so \nmuch to America's families: education particularly, alternative energy, \ninvestments in our transportation system.\n  To be able to do all that in the right way, we need this special \ncommittee and Congress to take the next steps. But this is a \nsignificant beginning, as imperfect as it is.\n  If I may, finally, for all of us--and particularly for the President, \nthe Speaker, the majority leader, the Republican leader in the House, \nand the Democratic leader in the Senate, and everybody who worked so \nhard, coming close to the kind of grand bargain I think we needed, that \nthe Simpson-Bowles Commission adopted, that the Gang of 6, our 6 \ncolleagues, recommended to us, which I support, and that the President \nand the Speaker, President Obama and Speaker Boehner, were close to but \nunfortunately fell apart--there is disappointment that a lot of us \nfeel. But perhaps to put it in a broader context, I wish to quote from \nan op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal today written by David Rivkin \nand Lee Casey, who are two lawyers whose work I have long admired. Here \nis what they say to take us back and perhaps remind us that we fill \nthese seats for a short period of time. We act within the system \ncreated by our Framers, and we do our best. They wrote:\n\n       The debt-ceiling crisis has prompted predictable media \n     laments about how partisan and dysfunctional our political \n     system has become. But if the process leading to the current \n     deal was a ``spectacle'' and a ``three-ring circus,''\n\n  As someone put it--\n\n     the show's impresarios are none other than James Madison and \n     Alexander Hamilton. Our messy political system is working \n     exactly the way our Founders intended it to.\n\n  Then I go toward the end of their op-ed piece:\n\n       The key point has been made--\n\n  Excuse me. Let me start a paragraph ahead:\n\n       Rarely in our system do the participants--\n\n  Whether in the White House, Senate, or House--\n\n     achieve all or even most of their goals in a single political \n     battle. . . . The key point has been made. Few now suggest \n     that we can continue on our current spending binge. That is \n     the beginning of a consensus, and a good start towards \n     genuine change.\n       The Framers would be pleased at the spectacle.\n\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this is not a solution I would have \npreferred, but the compromise finally reached by the White House and \ncongressional leaders has the potential to end this manufactured \ncrisis. It is a solution that puts common sense and the national \ninterest above partisanship and ideology.\n  The country has been pushed to the brink of catastrophe. The choice \nat hand is not this bill or something better. The choice is between the \nonly bipartisan practical solution to the debt ceiling crisis, or a \ndevastating default on the Nation's debts for the first time in our \nhistory. A default would send shock waves throughout our fragile \neconomy. It would slap a credit rate tax on every household and every \nbusiness in Vermont and across the country.\n  The solution before us includes $3 trillion in spending reductions \nreached through bipartisan negotiations that will yield the greatest \noverall budget savings ever. Just as Vermont families are having to \nmake difficult financial decisions, we need to make long-term budget \nreforms, and the country should be spared the ordeal of having to go \nthrough this same kind of torment again just a few months from now.\n  The special congressional committee chartered by this legislation to \nrecommend future deficit reduction can consider revenue measures, and I \nwill continue to push for an end to outdated tax loopholes for giant \noil firms and companies that ship American jobs overseas. I also \ncontinue to believe that the wealthiest Americans should pay their fair \nshare in these solutions.\n  If the special congressional committee fails to make bipartisan \nrecommendations, then the agreement calls for cuts in defense spending \nand protections for Social Security, Medicare benefits, Medicaid, \nveterans benefits and child nutrition. I strongly support these \nprotections.\n  All along the American people have wanted this debt-limit crisis \nresolved promptly and fairly through the give-and-take of our \nrepresentative government. It is extremely unfortunate that many who \nmanufactured this crisis in the first place then stood in the way of a \nsolution for weeks on end, threatening the first default on United \nStates obligations in our history.\n  Many in this body recall, as I do, the period just two short decades \nago when Congress and a Democratic President were able to balance the \nFederal budget and create budget surpluses that were on their way to \npaying off the national debt altogether. I remember also the key Senate \nvote to put us on that path, which had to be achieved without any \nsupport from the other side of the aisle. Those balanced budgets and \nsurpluses also were achieved without any constitutional amendment \nrequiring them. And those surpluses grew, until subsequent decisions \nwere made by a new administration, and ratified by a new Congress, that \nsquandered the surpluses and piled the debt up once again.\n  What the American people want, need, and deserve right now is a \nreturn to wise and disciplined leadership. We need the return of a \nwillingness to cooperate and to forge solutions across partisan lines \nto solve the most pressing issues facing the country. The economic \nhealth of the Nation and the jobs of thousands of hardworking Americans \nshould not be mired in politics.\n  The Senate throughout history has shown its remarkable ability to \nrise up in times of crisis to reflect the conscience of the Nation. Now \nis such a time, for the good of the country, for Democrats and \nRepublicans in both chambers to rise to the occasion and put an end to \nthis contrived crisis that has put our entire economy at risk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Connecticut on \nhis remarks and, particularly, his closing. I associate myself with \nwhat he said. I will support this bill when it comes to the floor at 12 \no'clock today.\n  On Saturday, I came to the floor at 2 o'clock out of frustration and \nmade a speech critical of the negotiators as we were letting the clock \nrun and had no deal. I was critical because we had pretty much had an \nagreement we were going to cut. We pretty much had an agreement we were \ngoing to establish a select committee to do the cutting. But we had not \nagreed to a balanced budget amendment. We had not agreed to an \nenforcement mechanism on the committee to make sure they did the \ncutting. Probably most importantly of all, we had not agreed to \ntriggers on the debt ceiling increase for accountability.\n  I come to the floor today not frustrated but feeling somewhat \nrewarded because on the three solutions negotiated to those three \ncomponent parts of this particular piece of legislation, the genie is \nout of the bottle, and history is about to be made.\n  No. 1, on the debt ceiling increase, when the trigger was finally \nestablished, it means from now on whenever this debt ceiling increase \nis asked for by a Republican or Democratic President, it will be \ndemanded that there be spending cuts commensurate with any increase. \nThat is historic. That is the first step in the right direction of \nsanity, accountability, and fiscal responsibility.\n  Secondly, they finally came together and agreed there would be a \nbalanced\n\n[[Page S5211]]\n\nbudget amendment vote in the House and the Senate before this year end, \nwith incentives for us to vote for that balanced budget amendment. For \nthe first time since 1995--the first time in 16 years--the Congress of \nthe United States will be debating, forcing itself to do what every \nAmerican family has to do. There is not a family within the sound of my \nvoice who has not had to sit down in the last 3 years in this country--\nbecause of our recession and our economy and because of spending--and \nreprioritize how they spend their money to balance their budget, to \nlive within their means. It is about time the Congress of the United \nStates asked of itself what it imposes on every family in America.\n  As far as the select committee, there was a fear among many that it \nwould only be a paper tiger; that it would not have the claws or the \nteeth to actually do what it needs to do on the cuts. While I would \nhave done a different type of sequestration, I commend those who \nnegotiated this sequestration on putting one in that has enough teeth \nand enough fear to force this select committee to do what it needs to \ndo.\n  Today, when I vote in favor of this agreement, I will be voting for \nus to cut spending where we need to--not as much as I would have liked \nbut a lot more than we have ever seen before--but, most importantly, \nvoting for the assurance that never again will a debt ceiling go up \nwithout a debate for commensurate cuts in spending. That is important. \nI will be voting for this because we will have a balanced budget \namendment on the floor of the Senate and on the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives that we have long needed since the last one failed 16 \nyears ago. And we finally have a sequestration mechanism or an \nenforcement mechanism to enforce the select committee to do what it is \ncharged to do in this particular legislation.\n  My frustration I expressed on Saturday is gone. My pride in the \nSenate is restored, and I look forward to casting my vote in favor of \nthis agreement at 12 o'clock today.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, thank you for recognizing me.\n  I am honored to be, once again, on the Senate floor. I have spoken \nmany times about the issue that is now before us for a vote in just a \nfew minutes.\n  This is a significant point in our country's financial history--a \ntime in which politics has played its course and decisions have to be \nmade. I come here at this moment with no real joy. I think we have put \nthe American people through a lot--certainly, over the last several \nmonths--as we asked them to follow along as we discussed this idea of \nraising the debt ceiling.\n  There was some thought by many of us that we could use this moment of \nraising the debt ceiling to make some significant changes in the way we \ndo business in Washington, DC. In fact, on March 22 of this year, I \nwrote President Obama a letter indicating I could not vote to raise the \ndebt ceiling unless I saw substantial reductions in spending and \nstructural changes in the way we do business in the Congress and \nWashington, DC.\n  Why I say there is no joy for me to be here today, in my view, we \nhave failed to do either one. There are no substantial reductions in \nspending, and there are no significant changes in the way Washington, \nDC, does business.\n  This country needs certainty, and I have said all along we need to \nraise the debt ceiling. There needs to be that certainty. I have said \nit would be irresponsible for us not to raise the debt ceiling, but I \nhave said all along it would be equally as irresponsible if we raised \nthe debt ceiling without meeting the criteria I have outlined.\n  While we will have a discussion among all of us that continues \ntoday--and we will probably play quarterback and Friday morning \nquarterback after this is over to figure out what we have \naccomplished--but, in my view, it is important to know there are no \ncuts in this bill. There is only a reduction in the growth of spending, \nand that reduction is so small--$21 billion reduced in the first year \nin the growth in spending.\n  In Kansas, when we hear the word ``billion,'' we think that is a lot \nof money, and it is. So I think Kansans will hear the words ``$21 \nbillion'' and think: Oh, my, they are finally doing something \nsignificant. But the truth is, we spend $4 billion more each day than \nwe take in, and that $21 billion, if realized, in the slowing of the \ngrowth of spending, will be gone in less than a week. This legislation \ndoes not cut spending.\n  While we promote a balanced budget amendment, which I think is so \ncritical to our success in changing the structure of how we do things, \nthere is no balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution in this \nagreement or one that will necessarily be sent to the States for \nratification. Our national debt will continue to grow and, in fact, at \nthe end of 10 years, if everything in this legislation is \naccomplished--and I think we have to be skeptical about that--our \nnational debt will grow and reach $22 trillion. We are at $14.3 \ntrillion or $14.4 trillion now. Ten years from now, with this \nlegislation in place, $22 trillion. Over the next three decades, our \ndebt will become three times the size of our entire economy.\n  We have talked about changing the way we look at things in \nWashington, DC. For the first time--and I agree with this--we are \ntalking about reducing the growth of spending by the amount we are \nraising the debt ceiling. But can you imagine a family back in Kansas \ncongratulating themselves for changing the topic without ever changing \ntheir spending patterns? Kansas families, when they are in trouble for \nspending too much money, cut the budget today. We are not doing that. \nThey do not just slow the growth, and they do not wait for 10 years to \nsee it realized.\n  The problem is today, and I think this is a significant problem. \nPeople will say we need to raise the debt ceiling today or our credit \nworthiness will be judged by the rating agencies and we will be \ndowngraded. I worry that even with the passage of this bill, its \neffects are so minimal in spending that the downgrade will occur \nregardless.\n  So this is a time for us to make the tough choices as compared to \nkicking the can down the road one more time.\n  It is an honor to serve in the Senate. Nothing in my life, my \nbackground, would ever suggest I would have this opportunity. I am \nhonored to serve Kansans, and I will do my best to make the right \ndecisions on their behalf. But as I have listened to Kansans for the \nlast 2 years on the topic of what is important to them, the economy \nmatters, and the first thing we have to do is get our fiscal house in \norder so the economy can grow and people can find jobs and get better \njobs.\n  While my assumption, based upon the news reports, is the legislation \nI oppose will pass today, I pledge myself to my Kansas constituents \nthat I will work hard to see that every dime that is possible to be \nsaved occurs, and I will redouble my efforts to see we grow the economy \nand put Americans back to work because the revenues we need to balance \nour books are not increases in taxes.\n  The revenue we need to balance our books is a strong and growing \neconomy so every American can put food on their family's table, save \nfor their children's education, and prepare for their own retirement, \nand that we are blessed with the opportunity in this country to see \nevery American child be able to pursue the American dream.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, for weeks, Americans have watched the \ndebate about raising our Nation's debt ceiling. I know it is has been \ndifficult and often frustrating to watch what is happening, but the \ndiscussion could not have been more important for the future of \nAmerica. We have been talking, again, about whether we would increase \nAmerica's borrowing limit.\n  In doing so, we have rightly focused on how to prevent a default on \nAmerica's credit, but also, just as important, rather than just \nreflexively continuing to borrow money we do not have from Chinese \nbankers, how we are going to confront the fundamental behavior in \nCongress that has led us to this culture of borrowing and overspending.\n  I have said from the beginning of this debate that we owe it to the \nAmerican people, and I owe it to my constituents in New Hampshire, to \nconfront both issues--to avoid default and, finally, to\n\n[[Page S5212]]\n\nconfront our debt once and for all, and to change the direction in \nwhich we are headed as a country.\n  To address only default and to continue to kick the can down the road \non making the tough decisions to fundamentally change the path we are \non will surely lead to a downgrade of our credit rating. It will sap \nour economic strength and will lead to the insolvency of the greatest \ncountry on Earth.\n  While I appreciate the difficult work done by the Speaker of the \nHouse and our Senate leadership in coming up with an agreement that \navoids default, I am unable to support a bill that delivers the largest \ndebt ceiling increase in the history of our Nation but does very little \nto confront the underlying problems that have brought us here--problems \nthat have led us to over a $14 trillion debt and which will increase in \nthe next 2 years to over $16 trillion in debt.\n  I have not come to this decision lightly. I have had countless \nmeetings over the last months and weeks with my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to talk about this issue and how we can confront \nthis crisis now. I have said from the beginning we need fundamental \nchanges in the way we do business in Washington, including budget \nreforms, enacting a responsible budget.\n  I am a member of the Senate Budget Committee--the newest member of \nthat committee--and it has been terribly disappointing to me that the \nSenate hasn't allowed the Budget Committee to do its work and come up \nwith a budget for the United States of America.\n  So we do need fundamental budget reforms. I have said we need major \nspending reductions, and we need to reform our entitlement programs. I \ncannot in good conscience agree to a deal that continues to perpetuate \nthe culture of overspending and borrowing in Washington.\n  In coming to this decision, I have asked myself several questions: \nThe first question I have asked is, Does this agreement significantly \nreduce spending? Unfortunately, the answer is no. While it claims to \nreduce the deficit by $917 billion over the next 10 years, only in \nWashington would this be called a spending reduction. Because of \nbaseline budgeting, a reduction of $917 billion in the deficit, as it \nis claimed, is no reduction at all. Over the next 10 years, under this \nagreement, we will spend over $830 billion more in discretionary \nspending.\n  So there is no reduction in spending. If you just look at the \nreduction from what we will spend in fiscal year 2012, it is really \nonly a $7 billion reduction in spending between what we will spend in \n2011 and 2012. We borrow $4 billion a day to sustain our government. So \nthe spending reductions between what we spend in 2011 to 2012 is not \neven 2 days of borrowing for the United States of America.\n  Many of the cuts are in the outyears. And you know what happens in \nWashington when the cuts are in the outyears. Unfortunately, our \nhistory has been that they do not get done. That is why I am concerned \nabout even the $917 billion claim in reductions, which is not a \nreduction in spending.\n  I have also asked myself, Does this agreement in any way reduce the \nsize of government? We know this government has continued to grow even \nas State governments and families have made the tough decisions to \ndownsize, to reduce, to live within their means. This deal does not cut \nor end one government program.\n  In March, the GAO came out with a report that identified hundreds of \nduplicative programs that happen here in Washington where we could save \nbillions of dollars. My colleague from Oklahoma, Dr. Tom Coburn, has \ndone the hard work of identifying hundreds and hundreds of duplicative \nprograms where we could save billions of dollars. Yet this agreement \ndoes not reduce the size of government at all or end one of those \nprograms.\n  Does it avoid a downgrading of our credit? Unfortunately, I think \nthis agreement will also lead us to a downgrade. And why does that \nmatter? Because it will hurt the economic strength of America and our \neconomic growth, our borrowing costs. It will hurt our job creators \nwhen now more than ever we need to create jobs in this country and put \npeople to work. Yet our failure to get our fiscal house in order here \nin Washington is hurting the hard-working people in New Hampshire and \nAmerica.\n  The credit rating agencies and even the President's own fiscal \ncommission have said that the minimum amount of debt reduction that we \nneed over the next decade is $4 trillion just to stabilize our debt and \nto ensure our AAA credit rating is not downgraded. But with this \nagreement, even if everything happens and this congressional committee \ndoes all of its work, we will only see a maximum reduction of $2.4 \ntrillion. And that is assuming everything in those outyears gets done, \nwhich we do not always have a good history of here in Washington.\n  Finally, does it change the trajectory of where we are going with our \ndebt to preserve our country? No. Under this agreement, we will \ncontinue to about $1 trillion a year to our debt--a debt that is \nalready $14 trillion.\n  It does nothing to strengthen our entitlement programs. We know from \nthe trustees of Medicare that program is going bankrupt in 2024. We \nknow from Social Security that program is going to be bankrupt in 2036. \nYet we have not taken on that fundamental problem in this agreement. \nHow do we reform those programs to preserve them for Americans that are \nrelying on them and to sustain them for future beneficiaries?\n  While I appreciate that we are beginning to change the discussion \nhere in Washington, I cannot support this agreement. I appreciate that \nit is very important that we avoid default, but I know we are better \nthan this. I know we can do more to make sure we preserve the greatest \ncountry on Earth. We need to take on the fundamental problems, the \nchronic overspending in Washington. We cannot continue to say that a \nreduction is a reduction when it is not, when we are continuing to \nspend more money, because at home people look at that and say: Give me \na break. That is not how I do my family budget.\n  We have to tell the truth to the American people and make the hard \ndecisions. I know we can come together and get something done that will \nfundamentally change the direction in which we are headed. That is why \nI am disappointed about this agreement, because it does not do that.\n  We must do more than avoid default. We must save our country for the \nsake of our children. I have often come to this floor and talked about \nthe fact that I am the mother of two children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I am the mother of a 6-year-old and a 3-year-old. This \ndiscussion goes beyond those of us who are serving right here; it is \nabout what kind of country are we going to leave for the next \ngeneration. And I know I will not look my children in the eye and have \nthem say: Mom, what did you do about it?\n  We have to solve this crisis now. I know we can. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on behalf of the people of New Hampshire, to \nreally rolling up our sleeves, finally cutting spending, and saving the \ngreatest country on Earth.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, during the past few weeks and months, \nCongress and the President have been involved in discussions to raise \nthe debt ceiling, and reduce spending, deficits and debt. This \ndiscussion is a result of the elections last year. The voters sent a \nstrong message that it was time for Washington to stop the spending \nspree. And it is because of that message that we are even having this \ndebate. Even the President now agrees that to address our fiscal \nsituation we need to reduce spending.\n  That has not always been the case, though. Just last year President \nObama refused to endorse or advance the findings of his own National \nCommission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. On February 14, \nPresident Obama submitted his budget proposal to Congress that refused \nto address our looming deficits and debt. Over the next 10 years, his \nbudget would have added another $13 trillion to our national debt. \nPresident Obama's budget was so out of touch that it was rejected in \nthe Senate by a vote of 97-0. Then he delivered a speech in April that \nmagically found $4 trillion in spending cuts.\n\n[[Page S5213]]\n\nIn just a matter of weeks, President Obama found $4 trillion in \nspending that no longer needed to be spent.\n  The American people have to wonder how Washington can be serious \nabout budgets and spending if the President, in a matter of weeks, can \nfind $4 trillion of spending that was of national importance on \nFebruary 14, but is no longer necessary on April 13. It is this type of \nbehavior that leads people to be cynical of Washington and the Federal \nGovernment. It is little wonder that lofty commitments from Washington \nare received in Middle America as just more empty promises and \npolitical rhetoric.\n  Up until a few months ago, President Obama and members of his \nadministration were calling for a clean debt limit increase with no \nspending cuts. He simply wanted Congress to provide him a blank check.\n  The debate has shifted. We are no longer discussing spending \nincreases. The entire debate today is about cutting spending, how much \nand from where. The fact that we are here today in agreement on the \nneed to cut spending is an enormously important development. I commend \nall of those who worked and insisted that spending cuts be included in \nthis agreement, and I thank those who were involved in working out this \nhard fought agreement.\n  Unfortunately, this bill does too little to address our overspending, \ndeficits and debt. Virtually none of these cuts in this bill come in \nthe next few years. It is all back loaded with no guarantee that \nCongress won't reverse course, and undo these spending reductions. And, \nthere is no guarantee that entitlement programs that are driving the \nlong-term fiscal problems will be reformed. These programs need reform \nso they remain viable, affordable and available for generations to \ncome. But this bill has too little to ensure those reforms take place.\n  The American people sent us to Washington to confront these problems. \nThey want us to stop overspending. They want us to chart a path to \nfiscal responsibility, where Washington spends only what we take in, \nlike the American people themselves must do. And, while this bill is a \nsmall step in the right direction, I believe the American people expect \nand deserve a giant leap in the right direction.\n  In addition to its timidity on spending reductions, I fear that this \nbill will set up a process to increase taxes on the American people in \nthe belief that more tax revenue would lower deficits. This bill \ncreates a bicameral, bipartisan committee that will be tasked with \nproducing the second tranche of deficit savings. Despite the fact that \nour government has a spending problem and not a revenue problem, \nPresident Obama continues to insist that higher taxes must be a part of \na major deficit reduction plan. It is his desire for bigger government, \nand higher levels of taxation that will likely prevent any serious \nfollow-on deficit reduction or entitlement reform package.\n  I want to be clear. I do not wish for the government to be launched \ntoward a threat of default. My vote against this bill is not a signal \nthat I would prefer default. I would not. But, I am compelled to vote \nagainst this package because I see this as a missed opportunity. We are \nproviding President Obama with the largest increase in the national \ndebt ceiling in history. But, instead of using this opportunity to \naddress our near term and long term spending and fiscal problems, we \nare cutting a little now, and kicking the can further down the road.\n  This bill grants a $2.4 trillion increase in our Nation's debt limit, \nthe largest increase in our history. The challenge for Congress and \nPresident Obama was to sketch a deficit reduction plan to address \ndeficits and debt in a significant way. The uncertainty about \nWashington's fiscal management gets in the way of private-sector job \ncreation and economic recovery. But this bill is insufficient in \nputting us on a path to live within our means.\n  To me, this is also a moral issue. It's wrong for this generation to \nover-spend and leave the bills for the next generation to pay. The \ntrajectory of our debt is alarming. It will soon undermine our economy \nand our economic growth. If we do nothing, our children and \ngrandchildren will have fewer economic opportunities than we have had. \nWithout a plan to put our fiscal situation on a better path, the next \ngenerations will have a lower quality of life than the one we've \nexperienced. We can't let that happen. But, I am afraid this bill will \naccomplish too little in this regard.\n  Again, I recognize that this hard fought compromise is a step in the \nright direction, and I am pleased that Congress and the American people \nhave recognized the terrible fiscal path our nation is on. I only wish \nthat this plan was proportional to the size of the problems we face.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring any quorum call be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I stand today to explain my reasons for \nvoting against the debt limit increase we will be voting on in just \nabout half an hour from now.\n  This is a crisis that America faces. It is an ongoing crisis that \nwill neither be created nor eliminated with today's vote. It is a \ncrisis that has been building gradually over the course of years--\ndecades, in fact. It is a crisis that we certainly have known about \never since this Congress was sworn in in January of this year.\n  This is a crisis that threatens potentially every Federal program, \nfrom defense to entitlements, because as we continue to borrow more \nmoney as a nation, adding to the already almost $15 trillion we have \naccumulated in national debt--roughly $50,000 for every man, woman, and \nchild in America; roughly $150,000 for every taxpayer in America--as we \ncontinue to add to that enormous debt, we get closer and closer to the \nunknown but nonetheless existing point at which we will no longer be \nable to borrow, at least not at interest rates that will make this kind \nof borrowing sustainable.\n  If interest rates were to go up even to their historically average \nlevels, within just a few years we could be spending something closer \nto $1 trillion every single year. Just to pay the interest on our \nnational debt, we could be paying more than we pay on Social Security \nin an entire year, more than Medicare and Medicaid combined, and more \nthan national defense in an entire year. What happens when we get to \nthat point? Where does that money come from? The reality is that every \nFederal program, from defense to entitlements, could see its coffers \nraided in an unfortunate Draconian display of fiscal irresponsibility \nif we continue to punt this problem and not to address it.\n  The legislation at issue today addresses this problem by perpetuating \nit. I am pleased, of course, that this legislation does certain things \nand has invigorated a new conversation on the sorts of strategies that \nneed to be in place if we are ever going to address this problem on a \nlong-term basis.\n  Some 7 or 8 months ago, there were still people in this town of \nWashington, DC, who were saying things along the lines of ``we need \nanother stimulus package'' or ``we need more Federal spending of one \nsort or another.'' They are no longer saying that. Now the discussion \nfocuses not on whether to cut but how much.\n  There is, of course, renewed discussion about the need for a balanced \nbudget amendment. But talk is different from outcomes. What we need are \noutcomes. What we need is a fundamental change to the way we spend \nmoney in Washington. What we need is to restrict Congress's authority, \ngranted by clause 2 of article I, section 8, of the Constitution, to \nincur debt in the name of the United States. That power needs to be \nrestricted. The only way we can restrict that on a permanent basis, one \nthat will bind not only this Congress but future Congresses that come \nafter us, is through an amendment to the Constitution.\n  This legislation raises the debt limit by about $2.5 trillion. This \nis a recordbreaking sum. Not too many years ago,\n\n[[Page S5214]]\n\nwhen I was in high school, this was roughly equivalent to our entire \nnational debt. Now, through one piece of legislation, we are \nincreasing, expanding our already huge national debt by roughly that \nsame sum, and it does not contain any permanent, binding structural \nspending reform mechanisms of the sort that would be necessary to make \nsure we get out of this problem, to make sure we end the problem we \nhave created through Congress's reckless pattern of perpetual deficit \nspending.\n  That is why I have insisted since before I was even sworn into office \nthat before we raise the debt limit, we need to pass a balanced budget \namendment and submit it to States for ratification. Nearly every State \nbalances its budget each and every year. It is not news when a State \ndoes this. I look forward to the time when it will no longer be news \nwhen Congress does the same.\n  There are significant cuts discussed in this legislation and \nproposed, but I want to be clear on one thing: Although these cuts are \nlarge on a long-term basis, on a short-term basis they are less so. On \na short-term basis, within the next year, this proposes to cut about $7 \nbillion out of the fiscal year 2012 discretionary spending budget. Some \ndispute this number and suggest, as some of my colleague have already, \nthat, in fact, the fiscal year 2012 budget will spend $23 billion more. \nOthers concede the point and say: OK, let's assume for purposes of this \ndiscussion that it does, in fact, cut $7 billion from what otherwise \nwould be new deficit spending. Now, $7 billion is roughly equivalent to \nthe amount of debt we have added to our total debt portfolio just in \nthe last 30 hours or so, roughly the period of time that has elapsed \nsince this legislation was announced late Sunday night until this very \nmoment, because we are borrowing about $4 billion of new debt every \nsingle day. Stated differently, this amounts to less than two-tenths of \n1 percent of a cut.\n  I do believe we have made progress. I commend our leadership for \nworking so hard to focus the discussion on the need for cuts.\n  We have, unfortunately, had Democratic leadership in this body that \nhas been bent on delaying the announcement of any deal as long as \npossible and preventing legislation such as the Cut, Cap, and Balance \nAct from coming to the floor, where it could have been subjected to an \nopen debate, discussion, and amendment process, as well it should be. I \nregret the fact that it didn't come to that, the fact that that \nlegislation, which could have solved this problem and would have put us \non a path toward fiscal responsibility, toward ending this problem once \nand for all, was not even allowed its day in the Senate to be debated \nand discussed on the merits.\n  At the end of the day, we have to come to terms with the fact that \nthe course we are on, from a fiscal standpoint, is utterly \nunsustainable, and adding more debt to our now-bursting portfolio of \ndebt will only contribute to this problem--unless we adopt a balanced \nbudget amendment. The time to do that is right now.\n  The American people overwhelmingly support a balanced budget \namendment, to the tune of about 75 percent. To my great astonishment, \nsome of my colleagues and even the President have suggested that a \nbalanced budget amendment is somehow a radical idea--so radical as to \nbe absurd and not worth considering--even though three out of four \nAmericans believe we need a balanced budget amendment.\n  I will close by referring to a quote by a man named William Morris, \nwho said this in the late 1800s:\n\n       One man with an idea in his head is in danger of being \n     considered a madman; two men with the same idea in common may \n     be foolish, but can hardly be mad; ten men sharing an idea \n     begin to act, a hundred draw attention as fanatics, a \n     thousand and society begins to tremble, a hundred thousand \n     and there is war abroad, and the cause has victories tangible \n     and real; and why only a hundred thousand? Why not a hundred \n     million and peace upon the earth? You and I who agree \n     together, it is we who have to answer that question.\n\n  It is not just one or two of us who have this idea in our head that \nwe need to restrict Congress's borrowing power because it has been so \nseverely abused over such a prolonged period of time; it is three out \nof four Americans. I urge my colleagues in the Senate and our \ncounterparts in the House of Representatives to join the American \npeople in at least the same proportion in supporting the idea that \nnever again should we raise the debt limit without a balanced budget \namendment in place.\n  This is a permanent, long-term problem. It requires a permanent \nsolution. The only permanent solution is that which involves an \namendment to the Constitution.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, through serious negotiation, leaders \nfrom both parties and the President have reached a bipartisan solution \nthat will lift our debt ceiling and prevent a downgrade of our credit.\n  Make no mistake, this agreement is stark and stern but necessary. It \nincludes cuts that I would have never voted for under different \ncircumstances. However, if we fail to take action, the economy will be \nirrevocably fractured.\n  While it is far from perfect, the agreement meets my principles for \navoiding default and downgrade. It provides a long-term extension of \nthe debt ceiling, a significant downpayment on cuts, and a path forward \nto reform tax earmarks and entitlements.\n  The consequences of a default and downgrade would be significant and \nsevere and would alter the course of the United States for a century. \nDefault would have led to sky-high interest rates that would have \ncreated a new tax on every single American. It means if you have a \nvariable rate mortgage, it would skyrocket. If you have a student loan, \nthe interest would increase. And if you have a car loan, the payments \nwould be greater.\n  Under default, the President would also have to prioritize what \nobligations to pay. First, we would have to pay our troops. Then we \nwould have to meet our obligations to seniors and veterans. Federal \nfunding for State and local governments would run out. This would \naffect infrastructure projects, funding for schools and teachers and \nfirehouses and police stations. Contractors who work for the Federal \nGovernment would face layoffs without pay, and businesses would reduce \nhiring. The economy would be further weakened, and it would be a self-\ninflicted wound. I could not allow this to happen.\n  I took an oath to protect and defend the Constitution. The 14th \namendment says that the validity of America's debt must not be \nquestioned. While the lawyers made the interpretation complicated, the \nframers made it simple. America pays its debt with no exceptions. \nFailure to reach an agreement would be a violation of the American \npeople and our creditors' trust. And it would have violated my oath to \nthe Constitution.\n  America must meet its obligations to its creditors. We must also meet \nour obligations to each other. Throughout this debate, I have insisted \non no benefit cuts to soldiers, seniors, and veterans, and I will \ncontinue to do so. Obligations made must be obligations kept.\n  I will also fight to fulfill our obligations to the next generation \nwho will lead us through the 21st century. We can't cut our way to a \nnew economy. We need to invest in it by rebuilding roads, bridges, and \nincreasing access to broadband. This is what will lead to new jobs, new \nopportunity, and new prosperity.\n  We also need to invest in education, science, research and \ntechnology. These investments will lead to jobs of the future and \nprepare students and workers to compete in a global economy. This means \nmaking sure kids have access to higher or career education. It means \nsupporting scientists who are finding cures for the most devastating \ndiseases. And it means giving businesses the tools they need to develop \nnew products. We can't afford not to make these investments.\n  After wrenching analysis, I will vote for this bipartisan agreement \nbecause it is an achievable and pragmatic solution to the crisis that \nwould be caused by inaction. It will require tough action and strong \nmedicine down the road, but it is necessary to honor our obligations to \nthe greatest generation and the next generation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I support the legislation before us today \nto raise the debt ceiling and at the same time curb government spending \nwithout raising taxes. The United States cannot default on our \nobligations, and this\n\n[[Page S5215]]\n\nbill prevents that from happening. This deal is not perfect. It is not \nwhat I would have written, and I have grave concerns about the cuts to \nour Nation's defense spending that may have to occur as a result of \nthis bill's passage.\n  What this plan does represent is a fiscally sound path forward, and \ntherefore I support its adoption. I applaud the courageous leadership \nof Senator McConnell and Speaker Boehner. They have guided Republican \nmembers on both sides of the Capitol with tremendous skill and \nintegrity and fought hard to ensure that our party's core principles \nwere not negotiated away. I am proud of them, and I thank them. And I \nwould be remiss if I did not also express my gratitude to Majority \nLeader Reid. He has a very difficult job in this body, and he deserves \na tremendous amount of credit for helping get us to this point. He \nfought hard for his caucus and their priorities, and I congratulate him \non successfully negotiating a fair compromise on their behalf.\n  While I will support this bill, I have a great deal of concern about \nthe direction this compromise takes defense spending. I have said many \ntimes, defense spending since 9/11--which was preceded by nearly a \ndecade of drastic reductions in military personnel, equipment, and \nreadiness--is not the cause of the economic dilemma in which we find \nourselves. Cutting defense so deeply that long-term, catastrophic \ndamage to our national security interests would result will not solve \nour deficit spending and debt problem.\n  Since this year began, the President has already asked the Defense \nDepartment to cut more than $178 billion by finding efficiencies and \ntaking top-line reductions in proposed defense spending over the next 5 \nyears. But this compromise deal before us will go much further, with \ninitial defense cuts of about $350 billion over 10 years as part of the \ninitial agreement to raise the debt limit by just over $900 billion.\n  The bigger threat of cuts to national security spending, however, \nwill come not during this first round but through the actions of the \njoint committee this bill establishes to find another $1.2 to $1.5 \ntrillion in cuts as an offset to the next increase in the debt limit \nthat will be required to get us from early 2012 through the balance of \nthe year and into 2013. If the joint committee cannot agree on a \npackage of cuts that can be passed in both the House of Representatives \nand the Senate and signed into law by the President, then a \nsequestration process would come into play that would automatically cut \nboth defense and nondefense spending in order to pay for the next $1.2 \ntrillion in debt ceiling increases. Such an across-the-board \nsequestration of defense funding levels could add another nearly $500 \nbillion to the roughly $350 billion in cuts over the next 10 years.\n  At his confirmation hearing on July 26, GEN Martin Dempsey, who has \nbeen nominated to be the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \ntestified that cuts above the $400 billion in defense spending that \nwere already being studied would be ``extraordinarily difficult and \nvery high risk.'' I agree. But what concerns me most about our current \ndebate is not just the enormous size of the potential reductions but \nthat the defense cuts being discussed have little to no strategic or \nmilitary rationale to support them. They are essentially just numbers \non a page. Our national defense planning and spending must be driven by \nconsidered strategy, not arbitrary arithmetic.\n  These defense cuts, initially about $350 billion over 10 years--but \nespecially those that could result from sequestration that could amount \nto another $500 billion--reflect minimal, if any, understanding of how \nthey will be applied or what impact they will have on our defense \ncapabilities or our national security. While Secretary Panetta has made \nit clear that a comprehensive review will precede any decisions he \nmakes on further defense cuts, the Congress currently has no specific \nindication of how the current debt compromise proposals would impact \nthe size of our military forces, what changes they would require to our \ncompensation system, what equipment and weapons would have to be \ncancelled as a result, or what additional risk to the readiness and \nmodernization of our forces and their equipment we would have to \naccept. If Congress is to make informed decisions about our national \ndefense spending, we need information like this, and it will have a \ncrucial impact on how the joint committee created under this compromise \ngoes about its work. And based on that sort of information, we must do \neverything we can to avoid an exercise in blind sequestration of \ndefense funds that could come into play if the joint committee cannot \nfind a way to find further cuts of $1.2 trillion or more that can be \nenacted into law.\n  For many months, we have been engaged in a political tug-of-war over \nwhether we should raise the debt limit and allow the President greater \nborrowing authority. I joined my colleagues on this side of the aisle \nin our insistence that any increase in our debt ceiling be accompanied \nby meaningful, real cuts in spending, not just typical Washington-style \nsmoke and mirrors. I believe we achieved our goal with this compromise. \nThe deal before us provides at least one dollar of actual spending \ncuts, not gimmicks, for each dollar in debt limit increases. It doesn't \nraise a single dollar in taxes. By including upfront cuts, a joint \ncommittee, a balanced budget amendment, BBA, vote, the debt disapproval \nprocess and sequesters, it continues the pressure on the President and \nCongress to continue cutting spending through the next election and \nbeyond.\n  Some of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle have described \nthe debate on this issue as a ``manufactured crisis.'' They cite the \nfact that, in the past, we routinely raised the debt ceiling with \nlittle or no debate, having done so at least 10 times in the last ten \nyears. Well, I say to my friends, you are leaving out one very critical \ndetail in your analysis--a detail that makes our current situation \nanything but ``routine''--and that is this: Never before in the history \nof this great nation has our debt been $14.6 trillion. Never before in \nour history have we faced the possibility of having our \ncreditworthiness downgraded due to our inability to control our \nspiraling debt, which could very well decimate the good faith and \ncredit of the United States, which would have a severe impact on our \nstanding in the world.\n  This measure represents the beginning, not the end, of what I believe \nwill be a sustained national focus on getting our fiscal house in \norder. We still have a very long way to go and a great deal of hard \nwork to do. Americans are still hurting. Unemployment remains at \nunacceptable levels and is estimated to continue to grow. We need to \ncut spending, spur economic growth, and get people back to work. These \ngoals cannot be achieved by raising taxes on individuals and small \nbusinesses, and they cannot be achieved by expanding the size of \ngovernment and massively increasing federal spending. It is time we \nlearned from the lessons of the past, and the past has taught us that \nwe cannot spend and tax our way to prosperity. America has been driven \ndown that road, and we nearly plunged off of a cliff into economic \ndisaster. I believe that this measure will begin to put us on the right \ntrack.\n  I urge my colleagues to seize this opportunity to put America back on \na path to fiscal solvency and vote in favor of this compromise.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to support the budget agreement \nthat has been so painstakingly negotiated over these past several \nweeks. This is not a perfect bill, but it will start to get our budget \ndeficit under control. Failing to reach an agreement and allowing our \nnation to default is not an option.\n  Failing to raise the debt ceiling would mean failing to honor the \nobligations we have already made. Previous Congresses and \nadministrations have always recognized this duty, raising the debt \nceiling over 70 times since 1962. This is not a partisan issue. \nPresident George W. Bush signed seven debt ceiling increases and \nPresident Clinton signed four. President Reagan raised the debt ceiling \n18 times.\n  We have also agreed to reduce our Nation's debt by over $2 trillion, \nwhich will help to put us on a more sustainable fiscal path. Much of \nthis budget savings will be found by a new joint congressional \ncommittee. Their recommendations will likely be similar to the Bowles-\nSimpson recommendations, the Gang of 6 proposal, and other bipartisan \nefforts.\n  I must say that I am disappointed we could not get a broader \nagreement to\n\n[[Page S5216]]\n\nreduce our deficit. We know what we need to do. Every bipartisan \nproposal works by putting everything on the table: domestic spending, \ndefense, entitlements, and revenue. It is not a good sign that this \nbill would force only spending cuts if Congress fails to pass the joint \ncommittee's deficit reduction bill. Refusing to put everything on the \ntable means refusing to truly solve our budget problem.\n  Our system of government is built on compromise. This deal shows that \nthe Senate is still capable of governing, and now we need to return \nimmediately to the most important job, getting our people back to work \nand getting the economy back on track.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, these are challenging economic times and \nRepublicans have taken us to the edge of the cliff. In the limited time \nleft to prevent government default for the first time in our Nation's \nhistory, I think we can all agree on at least one thing--the \nconsequences of default benefit no one. That is why I made the \nnecessary but difficult decision today to support an agreement to \nprevent our economy from being driven off the cliff.\n  Default and a downgrade of our credit have the potential to cause job \nloss, higher interest rates, and another economic recession or even a \ndepression. Unfortunately, the legislation before us today only staves \noff potential default, while doing nothing to fuel job creation and \nspur economic growth. In fact, it could well increase recessionary \npressures on the economy.\n  As the richest country in the world, we should never have reached \nthis crisis point. The United States always pays its bills. And, let's \nbe clear, the bills we are talking about are not new ones; they exist \nbecause of prior policy decisions.\n  Fault for the linking default on our debt and an ideological budget \nplan rests with my Republican colleagues. The President thought he \ncould negotiate a grand bargain, but it turned out Republicans were not \ninterested in compromise.\n  Since the onset of the debate surrounding the need to raise the debt \nceiling, the American people have made their position clear: They want \na fair and balanced approach to reducing the deficit. Like the majority \nof Americans, I understand the need to get our fiscal house in order, \nand I took tough votes in the 1990s to create a record budget surplus. \nOn Sunday, I also voted for a plan that would have controlled spending \nto a greater extent than the bill before us today.\n  As in the 1990s, and so many other times in the past, reining in the \nbudget deficit has meant spending cuts and revenue from closing \nloopholes in the Tax Code enjoyed by the wealthiest Americans and \nbiggest corporations.\n  Despite this precedent and the fact that such changes would not take \neffect in the short term, Republicans refused to accept a balanced \napproach.\n  Indeed, the price for averting the economic disaster of failing to \nraise the debt ceiling--a failure that some of my Republican colleagues \nwere quite willing to see happen, to have our Nation go off the cliff--\nwas a deal predicated on sacrifice by the middle class and no one else.\n  And so the agreement forged by the President and congressional \nleaders is by no measure ideal. It not only makes fundamental \nconcessions, but ignores the No. 1 issue on the minds of Americans--\nwhich is how to address job creation and the unemployment situation.\n  In doing so, it also evades not only common sense but ignores \neconomists who have warned that this trend toward drastic cuts threaten \nto choke off a faltering recovery. Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich \nexpressed these sentiments in saying that the agreement: ``[. . .] \nhobbles the capacity of the government to respond to the jobs and \ngrowth crisis.''\n  This agreement doesn't extend unemployment insurance at a time when \ntoo many Americans remain out of work. It doesn't stave off automatic \ntax increases on employers in distressed States with outstanding loans \nfrom the UI trust fund. Nor does it include common sense measures to \nsave jobs like work sharing, which has proved so effective in some of \nour states and abroad, nor infrastructure spending to create jobs.\n  Instead, the first part of this agreement includes spending cuts that \ncould hurt the middle class and those in need--nearly $1 trillion--at a \ntime when Americans can literally least afford it. While working men \nand women are coping with stagnant wages, 14 million other Americans \nare simply without a job in an economy that is still climbing out of a \ndeep economic recession. In Rhode Island the jobs situation remains \nespecially difficult and double-digit unemployment persists.\n  Rather than set in place a longer term debt reduction agreement that \nwould bring much-needed certainty to the economy, this agreement brings \nunnecessary uncertainty by tasking a joint committee to come up with at \nleast $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction. These recommendations would \nreceive expedited consideration with no amendments before the end of \nthe year. A failure of this committee to come up with the required \nlevel of cuts or a rejection by the Congress or a veto by the President \nof the committee's recommendations would mean sequestration--automatic \nacross the board cuts, half to domestic and half to defense spending.\n  I support the need to make continued decisions to eliminate wasteful \nand duplicative spending, and I perhaps this committee could come to a \nfair and balanced approach. Yet there remains a real likelihood that \nRepublicans could very well dig in again on the question of ending tax \ngiveaways to very profitable corporations and millionaires and call for \ndrastic changes to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid in order to \nmeet targeted savings. The Joint Committee could also reverse the gains \nwe made to reform health care.\n  In fact, Speaker Boehner, in presenting this legislation to his \nRepublican conference, said that it would be effectively impossible for \nthe joint committee to raise revenue. This means that the joint \ncommittee could recommend legislation even more austere and imbalanced \nthan the $917 billion in cuts we are passing today. Republicans could \nagain choose to balance the budget on the back of middle-class \nAmericans. What should make us think that a few months down the road \nWashington Republicans will sing another tune and be willing to put \nrevenue on the table?\n  Cuts are about more than just numbers. They are about priorities, and \nI worry that the cuts from the joint committee or from sequestration \nwould continue to be based on Republicans' extreme ideological beliefs, \nand not on common sense priorities like jobs and the well-being of the \nmiddle class.\n  The bill before us has two outcomes as I see it. The unknowns of a \njoint committee that, depending on who you talk to, will either fail \nspectacularly or succeed spectacularly in producing a balanced proposal \nof shared sacrifice. The thought is that the threat of sequestration, \nwhich should be considered a meat cleaver approach to priorities, could \nproduce an equitable compromise by the joint committee. Others believe \nsequestration will somehow be ameliorated or avoided altogether--that \nCongress will somehow pass legislation in the future to blunt its \nimpact. I hope those positive predictions prevail, but I am dubious.\n  In this spirit, the agreement marks a turning point for our nation at \nan extraordinary time. Following the Great Depression, we faced another \nset of extenuating economic circumstances. And only after years of \nmisguided cuts urged by fiscal conservatives, did the Congress finally \nlisten to those who voiced the need for spending to buttress economic \ngrowth.\n  It is widely known that the best way to ensure economic recovery is \nto get people working--paying taxes and stimulating demand that has a \nmultiplying effect on our economy.\n  Of course the irony of the situation lies in how we got here. \nPresident Bush was handed the biggest surplus on record, $236 billion--\nindeed, we had 3 straight years of budget surplus before he drowned our \nNation in red ink as far as the eye can see.\n  In fact, Republicans at the time were concerned the budget surplus--\nwhich was projected to be $5.6 trillion over 10 years--was in itself a \ndanger. Federal Reserve Chairmen Greenspan expressed this sentiment: \n``The emerging key fiscal policy need is to address the implications of \nmaintaining surpluses beyond the point at which publicly held debt is \neffectively eliminated.''\n  The resulting Bush policies--led by the $1.8 trillion tax cuts skewed \nto the\n\n[[Page S5217]]\n\nthose making over $250,000--erased this record surplus, and replaced it \nwith a $6.2 trillion deficit over this time period. This is an \nextraordinary swing of $11.8 trillion from fiscal year 2002 to 2011. To \ngive some comparison, our current-dollar-GDP, the market value of the \nNation's output of goods and services, is approximately $15 trillion.\n  While Americans are hard pressed to make ends meet and find work in \nan economy that isn't creating enough jobs, the largest corporations \nare doing extremely well.\n  We are seeing now corporations rack up huge profits. The nonfinancial \nmembers of the S 500 index are sitting on about $1.1 trillion in \ncash. The Federal Reserve indicated similarly that nonfinancial \nbusinesses have about $1.9 trillion in cash defined as liquid assets. \nWe need policies that get businesses to make investments that put \nAmericans back to work.\n  So a better approach would involve a serious commitment to deficit \nreduction that asks more from all Americans in the interest of our \nNation's long-term economic wellbeing. It would be bigger than the bill \nbefore us, perhaps closer to $4 trillion in debt reduction, because it \nwould be balanced and would call for shared sacrifice. It would ask the \nwealthiest Americans and largest corporations to pay their fair share \ninstead of relying solely on spending cuts that will hurt programs that \nAmericans depend on particularly when economic growth remains fragile. \nThis view is in line with numerous economic experts who have voiced \nconcern about how cutting back too soon could undermine our recovery.\n  A better bill would finally discard the perverse tax loopholes that \nreward companies that ship jobs overseas and end ethanol subsidy \ngiveaways to profitable corporations. Put simply, a balanced approach \nwouldn't ask nursing home residents to sacrifice without asking the \nsame of wealthy folks.\n  In fact, I have voted for plans that took this balanced approach in \n1993 and 1997 and helped create a record surplus.\n  I have also voted against those proposals that have built up this \nmound of debt--including the unfunded Bush tax cuts skewed to the \nwealthy; an unpaid for war in Iraq for which we have paid dearly; and \nthe unpaid for, costly, and ill-designed Medicare prescription drug \nplan.\n  We are also missing an opportunity to address the broader problems \nfacing middle-class Americans. They are struggling in large part \nbecause we are going down a road of conservative ideology rather than \ncommon sense. We need to work on economic growth through education, \ninfrastructure, currency exchange fairness, a trade policy that \nsupports our manufacturers, and yes even tax reform to simplify our \nsystem but not as an excuse for more tax giveaways like the Bush tax \ncuts.\n  Just as I have taken tough votes in the past to ensure the long-term \nprosperity of our Nation, today's vote was another difficult choice.\n  However, this agreement is the only option left to prevent default \nand evade what would be the greatest artificial crisis in our Nation's \nhistory. It hopefully provides a powerful lever to achieve significant \nand smart deficit reduction in the future.\n  In the words of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt during his second \ninaugural address, ``Government is competent when all who compose it \nwork as trustees for the whole people.''\n  Now is one of those pivotal times in our Nation's history, where we \nface a stark choice that requires us to make sacrifices that put nation \nahead of self.\n  For over 200 years, this country has been known as a hallmark of \neconomic stability. We have always paid our bills regardless of who was \nPresident and what party was in charge.\n  Now that this manufactured crisis that has distracted us for too long \nis over, we need to get to the business of putting Americans back to \nwork.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I cannot support this plan because it fails \nto actually solve our debt problem, fails to diminish the risk of a \ncredit rating downgrade and is not a long-term solution to avert a debt \ncrisis. This plan still adds at least $7 trillion to our debt over 10 \nyears. It fails to immediately start downsizing government, leaving 98 \npercent of deficit reduction until after the 2012 election. By not \naddressing the biggest driver of our debt, health care spending, this \nplan ensures Medicare's looming bankruptcy, while protecting \nObamaCare's $2.6 trillion blank check.\n  It contains no real structural reforms to spending, such as a \nconstitutional balanced budget amendment. It fails to reduce spending \nby what credit rating agencies say is at least $4 trillion to avert a \ndowngrade. Worst of all is that at a time of 9.2 percent unemployment, \nthis plan fails to include pro-growth measures to help get people back \nto work and create new taxpayers to help us pay down the debt. In fact, \nI fear that the new ``Supercommittee'' in this bill could lead to \nexpedited consideration of big tax hikes on our struggling economy. And \nif Congress rejects new taxes, then up to $850 billion of devastating \nautomatic defense spending cuts would be triggered at a time when the \nworld is as dangerous as it has ever been.\n  Americans are looking at Washington with anger, disgust and concern \nthat maybe America's problems are just too big for our leaders to \nsolve. As I outlined in the Wall Street Journal on March 30, 2011, \nkeeping America exceptional will require spending cuts and caps, saving \nMedicare and Social Security from bankruptcy, a constitutional balanced \nbudget amendment, tax reform and regulatory reform. Above all, it will \nrequire courage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will support this legislation but with very \nserious reservations.\n  I start with the premise that this debt limit extension is not the \none piece of legislation that will change everything wrong in \nWashington. It is, at best, a reversal of previous tax-and-spend \npolicies, with some movement down the road to fiscal responsibility.\n  The bill sets us on a course that, if we adhere to it, will \neventually enable us to balance our budget, draw down our debt, put \nentitlement programs on a sustainable path, and create the conditions \nfor strong economic growth. That it could have been better is \nabsolutely true as a substantive matter, but politically, the White \nHouse and the tax-and-spend Democrats in Congress would not agree to \nmore. They control this Chamber and the executive branch of government.\n  A second premise of Republican leadership was that the U.S. \nGovernment must pay its bills, not just to investors in U.S. bonds but \nto fulfill its commitments to the American people. From Social Security \nto national defense, we have obligations that Republicans insist must \nbe met. So default was not an option. That meant agreeing to terms for \na debt extension that satisfied neither party.\n  Another premise is to focus on job creation and restoring a healthy \neconomy. That meant not only constraining Washington spending through \ngreater accountability but preventing job-killing tax hikes. In this, \nwe succeeded. Contrary to some public talk, there is nothing in this \nlegislation that would cause future tax increases. If there were, I \nwould not support this legislation.\n  With this legislation, we have prevented tax increases demanded by \nthe President, cut spending over the next 10 years, and created a \nmechanism to address additional savings, especially in programs such as \nMedicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, all of which will eventually \ndefault on their commitments without reform, and we averted a credit \ncrisis for the U.S. Government.\n  Here is why I have such serious reservations about the legislation. \nIn an effort to extract a pound of flesh from Republicans, the White \nHouse, frustrated that it could not raise taxes, insisted on massive \ncuts in defense spending--some $350 billion, by White House reckoning, \nover the next 10 years, potentially $18 billion less than the \nPresident's own budget just for next year. Moreover, the White House \ninsisted that defense suffer an additional $492 billion in cuts over \nthe same period if the select committee set up by this bill fails to \nproduce or Congress refuses to adopt recommendations on how to cut \noverall government spending to meet the goals of the bill.\n  Mind you, these cuts in defense were not the result of careful \nplanning and analysis. They were just arbitrary percentages thrown out \nin negotiations, totally unconnected to actual defense requirements. \nWorse, the cuts that\n\n[[Page S5218]]\n\nwould be triggered if the select committee recommendations fail were \nintentionally designed to be so large, so unimaginable, so \nirresponsible that Congress would be incented to approve the select \ncommittee's recommendations. The word ``Armageddon'' was used to \ncharacterize this scheme. Can you imagine anything more irresponsible, \nfor the Commander in Chief of the military to promote--not just promote \nbut insist on the knowing destruction of the U.S. military as a means \nto threaten Congress?\n  The theory was that the consequences of inaction by the Congress must \nbe so severe that no responsible Senator or Representative could dare \nallow the result that we would be forced to accept the select committee \nrecommendations on pain of seeing the U.S. military decimated. This \nshould never have been agreed to by Members of Congress but most of all \nnever promoted by the President. To me, it comes close to violating our \noath of office and the President's responsibilities as Commander in \nChief. But it is done. My vote will not change it.\n  The best way for me to avoid this Armageddon is to stay in the fight \nand, if necessary, urge my colleagues to disregard this provision. \nSixty Senators would have to agree. But I cannot imagine Senators, and \neven the President, when faced with the actual versus the hypothetical \nchoice of knowingly destroying our military capacity to protect the \nUnited States, would allow it to happen when we would have the ability \nto prevent it. As reckless as this President is to even contemplate, \nmuch less threaten, to incapacitate our military, I cannot imagine the \nAmerican people would countenance such action.\n  As I evaluate the work of the committee, if anyone says to me, \nremember, the trigger is Armageddon for the U.S. military, my response \nwill be, let's take that debate to the American people and let them \ndecide. The thought that this trigger would force Senators to make \nunwise concessions underestimates the American people's commitment to \ntheir own security. The White House is miscalculating. It is so \nDraconian that it will not work. Even this President could not \nimplement it.\n  So because we cannot default in our commitments, because we have to \nstart somewhere on our new journey toward fiscal sanity--and this is a \ngood start--because we have to focus on job creation, not more taxes \nthat will kill job creation, we should adopt this legislation. But \nbecause of its irresponsible and dangerous, even cavalier treatment of \nnational defense, we will need to work very hard to restore spending \nnecessary for our national security and commit to reject the threat of \nArmageddon inserted into this bill by the White House.\n  (Mr. DURBIN assumed the Chair.)\n\n\n                         Joint Select Committee\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with my \nfriend the Republican leader, with whom I worked in drafting the \nprovisions of this bill creating a joint committee to address deficit \nreduction. We wrote a number of deadlines in the bill to guide the work \nof the joint committee. I wanted to discuss with my colleague the \nconsequences of missing these deadlines.\n  Section 402(g) of the amendment before us makes clear that if the \njoint committee fails to meet the November 23 deadline to vote on the \nreport and proposed language, or if the Congress fails to meet the \nDecember 23 deadline to pass the joint committee bill, then the joint \ncommittee bill will lose its privilege. It would cease to benefit from \nexpedited procedures under this amendment.\n  But I also want to make clear that if the joint committee or Congress \nfails to meet other deadlines in the title creating the joint \ncommittee, then that failure would not lead to a loss of privilege. We \nattached special importance to the deadlines for the committee to vote \nand the Congress ultimately to act.\n  And so, I would like to inquire whether the Republican leader agrees \nwith that assessment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I agree with the majority leader. We \ndid attach special importance to the deadlines for the committee to \nvote and the Congress ultimately to act. And we did not intend for \nfailure to meet other deadlines in the title to cause the joint \ncommittee bill to lose its privilege.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with my \ncolleague the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Conrad, who \nworked with me as we drafted the joint committee language in this bill.\n  The compromise we are voting on today on the debt limit establishes \nthe Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to build on the more \nthan $900 billion in up-front deficit reduction in the bill. The joint \ncommittee would work to achieve another $1.5 trillion in deficit \nreduction, for a total of $2.4 trillion. This important joint committee \nwill be bicameral and bipartisan, with three members selected by each \nof the four congressional leaders, for a total of 12 members, evenly \nsplit between Democrats and Republicans. Importantly, their \nrecommendations will be guaranteed an up-or-down vote on the floor of \nboth the Senate and the House.\n  For this historic process to work, we felt it important that the \njoint committee be given maximum flexibility, with everything on the \ntable--discretionary spending, entitlements and other mandatory \nspending, and tax reform. To accomplish this goal, the joint committee \nshould similarly be given maximum flexibility in how it analyzes its \nwork and how it determines that it has met the target of $1.5 trillion \nin deficit reduction.\n  Mr. President, over the past year, we have had three distinguished \nbipartisan groups provide us with comprehensive deficit reduction \npackages. We had the President's Fiscal Commission, led by former White \nHouse Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles and former Senator Alan Simpson. We \nhad the Bipartisan Policy Center's Debt Reduction Task Force, led by \nformer Senator Pete Domenici and former CBO and OMB Director Alice \nRivlin. And we just had the so-called Group of 6, a bipartisan group of \nSenators, including Senator Conrad, and Senators Warner, Chambliss, \nDurbin, Crapo, and Coburn. All three of these groups decided that given \nthe comprehensive and complex nature of the work that they were doing, \nthey needed to take advantage of the flexibility to measure the effects \nof their proposals against the most accurate benchmark possible. I \nbelieve that it is critical that the joint committee have the same \nflexibility to decide on and use the most appropriate baseline possible \nfor its work.\n  I believe that the legislation that we will vote on today \naccomplishes that, most directly by mandating the joint committee to \ninclude a statement of deficit reduction as part of the legislation it \nmust vote on. There are no conditions on that statement. But, \nobviously, the legislation will need to have bipartisan support to pass \nthe House and Senate.\n  I wonder if the chairman of the Budget Committee would agree with my \nconclusion.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I think it is absolutely correct that the \nflexibility exists for the Joint Committee to determine the benchmark \nit wishes to use and that such flexibility is entirely appropriate \ngiven the circumstances.\n  The leader mentioned three bipartisan groups that came to a similar \nconclusion. I was a member of two of those groups, the President's \nFiscal Commission and the so-called Group of 6. We devoted considerable \ntime to considering the most appropriate baseline to use in our \ndeliberations given our goals. In both cases, on a bipartisan basis, we \ndecided what made the most sense was not a standard current law \nbaseline, as CBO normally uses for the work we do around here, but a \nbaseline that was adjusted for more realistic policies, such as more \nrealistic war costs, more realistic tax policies, and more realistic \nhealth spending given the need to regularly provide the so-called doc \nfix. I can tell the leader that having that flexibility was critical to \nboth groups reaching completion of its work. The joint committee should \nhave that same flexibility, and I believe the bill provides it.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee, who is the \nSenate's expert on such matters.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, over the past few weeks, Congress has \nbeen engaged in a very important debate. It may have been messy, it \nmight have appeared to some as though their government wasn't working, \nbut in fact the opposite was true. The push\n\n[[Page S5219]]\n\nand pull Americans saw in Washington these past few weeks was not \ngridlock, it was the will of the people working itself out in a \npolitical system that was never meant to be pretty.\n  You see, one reason America isn't already facing the kind of crisis \nwe see in Europe is that Presidents and majority parties here can't \njust bring about change on a dime, as much as they might wish to from \ntime to time. That is what checks and balances is all about, and that \nis the kind of balance Americans voted for in November. The American \npeople sent a wave of new lawmakers to Congress in last November's \nelection with a very clear mandate: Put our Nation's fiscal house in \norder. Those of us who had been fighting the big government policies of \nDemocratic majorities in Congress welcomed them into our ranks. \nTogether, we have held the line, and slowly but surely we have started \nturning things around. That is why those who think that no problem is \ntoo big or too small for government to solve are very worried right \nnow. They are afraid the American people may actually win the larger \ndebate we have been having around here about the size and the scope of \ngovernment and that the spending spree may actually be coming to an \nend. They can't believe those who stood up for limited government and \naccountability have actually changed the terms of the debate here in \nWashington. But today, they have no choice but to admit it.\n  I know for some of our colleagues reform isn't coming as fast as they \nwould wish, and I certainly understand their frustration. I too wish we \ncould stand here today enacting something much more ambitious. But I am \nencouraged by the thought these new Senators will help lead this fight \nuntil we finish the job. I want to assure them that today, although \nthey may not see it this way, they have actually won this debate.\n  In a few minutes, the Senate will vote on legislation that represents \na new way of doing business in Washington. First, it creates an \nentirely new template for raising the Nation's debt limit. One of the \nmost important aspects of this legislation is the fact that never again \nwill any President, from either party, be allowed to raise the debt \nceiling without being held accountable for it by the American people, \nand, in addition, without having to engage in the kind of debate we \nhave just come through. Because, you see, whoever the next President is \nwill be back asking to raise the debt ceiling again, and it will \nprovide another opportunity for us to focus on the subject raised by \nthe request to raise the debt ceiling.\n  So we will be back at it--probably in the early part of 2013--trying \nto continue to make progress toward reducing the size and scope of \ngovernment and reducing our spending. This kind of discussion isn't \nsomething to dread, it is something to welcome. While the President may \nnot have particularly enjoyed this debate we have been through, it is \nthe debate Washington very much needed to have.\n  As for the particulars, this legislation caps spending over the next \n10 years with a mechanism that ensures these cuts actually stick. It \nprotects the American people from a government default that would have \naffected every single one of them in one way or another. It puts in \nplace a powerful joint committee that will recommend further cuts and \nmuch-needed reforms. It doesn't include a dime, not a dime, in job-\nkilling tax hikes at a moment when our economy can least afford them. \nCrucially, it ensures the debate over a balanced budget amendment \ncontinues and that it actually gets a vote.\n  This is no small feat when one considers that last week the President \nwas still demanding tax hikes as part of any debt ceiling increase, and \nthat as recently as May, the President's top economic adviser said it \nwas ``insane'' for anybody to even consider tying the debt ceiling to \nspending cuts. It is worth noting that 2\\1/2\\ months later, that \nadviser is no longer working at the White House and the President is \nnow agreeing, as a condition of raising the debt ceiling, to trillions \nof dollars in spending cuts.\n  Let me be clear: The legislation the Senate is about to vote on is \njust a first step. But it is a crucial step toward fiscal sanity and \nits potentially remarkable achievement given the lengths to which some \nin Washington have gone to ensure a status quo that is suffocating \ngrowth, crippling the economy, and imperiling entitlements.\n\n  We have had to settle for less than we wanted, but what we have \nachieved is in no way insignificant. We did it because we had something \nDemocrats didn't have: Republicans may only control one-half of one-\nthird of the government in Washington, but the American people agreed \nwith us on the nature of the problem. They know government didn't \naccumulate $14.5 trillion in debt because it didn't tax enough. If \nsomeone is spending themselves into oblivion, the solution isn't to \nspend more; it is to spend less.\n  Neither side got everything it wanted in these negotiations, but I \nthink it was the view of those in my party that we tried to get as much \nin spending cuts as we could from a government we didn't control. Our \nview was we would get as much in spending reduction as we could from a \ngovernment we didn't control. That is what we have done with this \nbipartisan agreement.\n  This is not the deficit-reduction package I would have written. The \nfact that we are on a pace to add another $7 trillion to the debt over \nthe next 10 years is certainly nothing to celebrate. But getting it \nthere from more than $9 trillion the President continued to defend \nuntil recently is no defeat either. Slowing down the big government \nfreight train from its current trajectory will give us the time we need \nto work toward a real solution or give the American people the time \nthey need to have their voices heard.\n  So much work remains. To that end, our first step will be to make \nsure Republicans who sit on the powerful cost-cutting committee are \nserious people who put the best interests of the American people and \nthe principles that we have fought for throughout this debate first. \nBut before we move to the next steps, I would like to say a word about \nsome of those who made today's vote possible, and I will start with \nSpeaker Boehner.\n  It should be noted that he helped set the terms of this debate by \ninsisting early on that we would oppose any debt limit that didn't \ninclude cuts that were greater than the amount the debt limit would be \nraised, and he stuck to his guns. The Speaker and I worked shoulder to \nshoulder over the past few months, and it certainly has been a \npleasure. He has been a real partner, and I assure my colleagues we \nwouldn't be here without him.\n  So I want to thank the Speaker and the entire Republican leadership \nin the House for standing on principle, and I want to thank my \nRepublican colleagues in the Senate for their determination, their \nideas, and their support. We wouldn't be here without them either.\n  I thank my friend, the majority leader, for his work in getting this \nagreement over the finish line. We may disagree a lot, but I hope \neveryone realizes it is never ever personal. I think today we can prove \nthat, when it comes down to it, we will get together when the greater \ngood is at stake.\n  I also thank the President and the Vice President and everyone on \ntheir staffs who believed, as we did, that despite our many differences \nwe could all agree that America would not default on its obligations. \nIt is a testament to the goodwill of those on both sides that we were \nable to reach this agreement in time. Neither side wanted to see the \ngovernment default, and I am pleased we were able to work together to \navoid it.\n  This bill does not solve the problem, but it at least forces \nWashington to admit that it has one. The bill doesn't solve the \nproblem, but it forces Washington to admit that it has one. It puts us \non a path to recovery. We are nowhere near where we need to be in terms \nof restoring balance, but there should be absolutely no doubt about \nthis: We have changed the debate, we are headed in the right direction, \nand people are wondering how it happened. Well, it happened because the \nAmerican people demanded it.\n  So in the end, we are back to where we started. The only reason we \nare talking about passing legislation that reins in the size of \nWashington instead of growing it is because the American people \nbelieved they could have a real impact on the direction of their \ngovernment. They spoke out and we heard them. It is only through their \ncontinued participation in this process, and\n\n[[Page S5220]]\n\nlawmakers who are willing to listen to them, that we will complete the \nwork we have begun.\n  As Winston Churchill once said:\n\n       Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak. Courage is \n     also what it takes to sit down and listen.\n\n  I can't think of a better way to sum up this last year and, in \nparticular, these last few months right here in Washington than that.\n  The American people want to see accountability and cooperation in \nWashington, and they want to see that we are working together to get \nour fiscal house in order. This legislation doesn't get us there, but \nfor the first time in a very long time I think we can say to the \nAmerican people that we are finally facing in the right direction. For \nthat, we have them to thank.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader, the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the eyes of the American people and the \nworld have been watching Washington very closely this past week. While \nthey witnessed a lot of political wrangling, they also saw Congress \nmake some historically important decisions and avert a default on our \ndebt that has been so concerning to all of us for such a long period of \ntime.\n  Our country was literally on the verge of a disaster. It was on the \nbrink of a disaster. With 1 day left, we were able to get together and \navert that disaster.\n  Now, this compromise that we have reached is not perfect.\n  Mr. President, could we have order, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order.\n  We welcome all our visitors, and we want to make it clear that any \ndisturbance or manifestation of approval or disapproval is prohibited \nunder the Senate rules.\n  The majority leader may proceed.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the kind words that my counterpart, Senator \nMcConnell, has stated. I have gotten to know him and Speaker Boehner a \nlot better this past month or two, especially the Speaker. Even though \nI disagree vehemently with the direction the Speaker's legislation \ntook, with no bipartisan support at all, it is not the product we have \nhere. The product we have here is one of compromise.\n  Without trying to outline who the winners are, there is principally \none winner throughout all this, and that is the American people. We \nsettled for less than we wanted; so did my friend, the leader of the \nRepublicans, settle for less than he wanted. But that is the way \nlegislation works. That is the way compromise works. But I can't let go \nwithout responding to my friend, who boasted in his own way about the \nnew Senators and new Members of Congress who came here.\n  I welcome them all. But a result of the tea party direction of this \nCongress the last few months has been very disconcerting and very \nunfair to the American people. It stopped us from arriving at a \nconclusion much earlier, and we must go forward.\n  Also, I recognize we have to do more. Of course, we need to do more, \nand that is why we have the joint committee set up that I will talk \nabout in just a minute. The American people are not impressed with the \nno new revenue. The vast majority of Democrats, Independents, and \nRepublicans think this arrangement we have just done is unfair because \nthe richest of the rich have contributed nothing. The burden of what \nhas taken place is on the middle class and the poor.\n  My friend talks about no new taxes. Mr. President, if their theory \nwas right, with these huge taxes that took place during the Bush 8 \nyears, the economy should be thriving. These tax cuts have not helped \nthe economy. The loss of 8 million jobs during the Bush 8 years, two \nwars started, unfunded, all on borrowed money, these tax cuts all on \nborrowed money; if the tax cuts were so good, the economy should be \nthriving.\n  If we go back to the prior 8 years during President Clinton's \nadministration, 23 million new jobs were created. We had, when \nPresident Bush took office, a surplus over 10 years of $7 trillion. \nThat has evaporated, and now we are talking about a $14 trillion debt.\n\n  The compromise we reached is imperfect, and we are going to send \nlegislation to the President today that will not only avert the default \nbut make significant desperate reduction. Is it enough? I repeat, no, \nit is not enough. This legislation will provide our economy with the \nstability it desperately needs.\n  To assure Congress that we will continue working--and I said this \nyesterday, I say it again. I appreciate my friend, the Republican \nleader, putting his arms around the idea that I came up with to have \nthis joint committee. They have worked in decades past. There is no \nreason it can't work now. There is no supermajority. Each leader will \nappoint 3, a committee of 12.\n  We need to do something because the trigger that kicks in is very \ndifficult. We need to do this, and it has to be one that is fair. The \nAmerican people demand fairness. It can't be more cuts to programs that \nhave made this country what it is. There must be a sharing of \nsacrifice. It is unfair for billionaires and multimillionaires not to \ncontribute to the arrangement that we have just made, but they are not.\n  My friends, the Republicans, held firm on no revenue, which is too \nbad. We need to have a fair approach to this joint committee, and I am \nconfident we will do that. The one reason we are going to do that is \nbecause the trigger mechanism kicks in.\n  To this committee that is going to be appointed, the Members must \nhave open minds. We have had too much talk the last few days, as early \nas this morning, Republican leaders in the Senate saying there will be \nno revenue. That is not going to happen; otherwise, the trigger is \ngoing to kick in. The only way we can arrive at a fair arrangement for \nthe American people with this joint committee is to have equal sharing.\n  It is going to be painful. For each party, if they do the right \nthing, it is going to be painful because, to be fair, we have to move \nforward. There has to be equal spending cuts. There has to be some \nrevenue that matches that.\n  The legislation that is going to be sent to the President today ends \nthe standoff that ground the work of Washington to a halt this summer. \nSo Congress must now return to its most important job: creating jobs.\n  Mr. President, there are things we can do to create jobs and we know \nthat. We passed out of here quickly the patent bill: 27,000 jobs we are \ntold that legislation will create. So we will move to that; the first \ntime we get back after the summer break, we are going to move to the \npatent legislation. It is important we do that. There is other work we \ncan do. There is legislation out there that should be bipartisan in \nnature that we can do. We have a highway bill that is due.\n  I have spoken to the chairman of the Finance Committee today, and \nthere are ways we can fund that that should be in keeping with the \nbipartisan approach.\n  The important thing we have, Mr. President, with these infrastructure \njobs we need so very much, is that for every $1 billion we spend in \ninfrastructure, we create 47,500 high-paying jobs. A lot of other jobs \nspin off from that. Now, this isn't where you have $1 billion and you \nhave all these Federal Government jobs. These are moneys that go to the \nprivate sector to build roads and bridges and dams. We need to do that, \nand we can do that. Clean energy jobs are changing the face of this \nNation. We need to do that.\n  I am optimistic and hopeful that the spirit of compromise that has \ntaken root in Washington the last several days will endure. I hope my \nRepublican colleagues will join forces with Democrats when we get back \nto work and not be looking for winners in political parties. Let's \nstart looking for winners with the American people.\n  We have made progress toward our goal of cutting the deficit spending \nthat we have around here. This Nation still faces a jobs deficit as \nwell. There is no issue more important to the American people than job \ncreation. Until every American who chooses to work can find a job, our \njob is undone. So we are going to continue making jobs our No. 1 \npriority. We ask the Republicans to join us in this regard.\n  Adlai Stevenson once called politics ``the people's business, the \nmost important business there is.'' It is time for Congress to get back \nto doing the people's business, creating jobs. Nothing is more \nimportant than that.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my motion to concur.\n\n[[Page S5221]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this question, the yeas are 74 and the nays \nare 26. The motion to concur on the House amendment to S. 365 is agreed \nto.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, while this agreement to raise the debt \nceiling and cut spending is far from perfect, it averts a financial \ncatastrophe that would stifle job creation and stall our fragile \neconomic growth. Default would have increased interest rates for every \nAmerican with a mortgage, car loan, student debt or credit card. For \nthese reasons, I voted to support this agreement.\n  Critically, the deal protects Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare and \nveterans from benefit cuts and leaves open future opportunities to \nfight tax loopholes, sweetheart deals and giveaways for special \ninterests. I will certainly continue these fights and seek \ncomprehensive tax reform to guarantee that there is a fair balance and \ntruly shared sacrifice.\n  Now more than ever, we must move to focus on our number one \npriority--creating jobs and spurring economic growth. Americans are \nstill hurting, seeking to find work, stay in their homes, pay tuition \nfor schools and keep their families together. We must put Connecticut \nand America back to work and get our country moving in the right \ndirection.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, debate over the fiscal future of our \nNation has been at the center of the 112th Congress. With the passage \ntoday of the Budget Control Act of 2011, we have avoided a default on \nour national debt, we have made a significant downpayment on our \ndeficit, and we are establishing a Joint Select Committee that provides \na real opportunity to achieve even greater deficit reduction by the end \nof this year.\n  As chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, I am privileged to have a \nstaff of dedicated professionals who advise me on the complicated \nbudget issues that have been before this body. My staff also shares its \nexpertise with Members on both sides of the aisle. They are a credit to \nthe Senate, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for \ntheir hard work during the session.\n  Budget Committee staff director Mary Naylor deserves particular \ncredit for putting together a team that regularly provides thorough and \naccurate analysis, often on incredibly short notice. Deputy staff \ndirector John Righter also deserves a special mention. Mr. Righter's \nmastery of baselines and scoring has been invaluable as we have \ndeveloped and compared various plans to address our long-term fiscal \nissues. Deputy staff director Joel Friedman and committee chief counsel \nJoe Gaeta have also played a critical role in the committee's work this \nsession.\n  The committee has a dedicated communications staff, including Stu \nNagurka, Steve Posner, Adam Hughes, and Kobye Noel, that ensures that \nthe committee's analysis is made available to Members and the general \npublic in a clear, concise, and timely manner. In addition, committee \nanalysts Steve Bailey, Jeannie Biniek, Amy Edwards, Jennifer Hanson-\nKilbride, Robyn Hiestand, Mike Jones, Sarah Kuehl Egge, Matthew Levy, \nJim Miller, Matt Mohning, Michael Obeiter, Miles Patrie, and Brandon \nTeachout each have expertise in specific policy areas that has proven \ninvaluable to me as the committee has reviewed every aspect of the \nFederal budget. The committee's support staff and staff assistants, \nAnne Page, Josh Ryan, Ben Soskin, and Ronald Storhaug have worked late \nnights and weekends to make sure we all meet the demands placed on us. \nAnd finally, I would like to recognize committee's chief clerk Lynne \nSeymour and administrative staffers George Woodall, Letitia Fletcher, \nCathey Dugan, and Kathleen Llewellyn-Butts, who provide support to both \nsides of the Budget Committee.\n  We as Senators place incredible demands on our staff, and they \ndeserve to have their service to this institution and our country \nrecognized. As we move to the next chapter of our debate over the \nfederal budget, I offer my most sincere appreciation for their hard \nwork.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, over the last several weeks, we have been \ndebating the increase in the debt ceiling. For the time being, that \ndebate is coming to an end. But I would like to address briefly some \nrevisionist fiscal history that we have heard repeated during that \ndebate.\n  We have heard this historical account often over the past decade. You \nhear it from our friends on the other side whenever the Senate \ndiscusses spending policy and tax policy. I have noticed that the \narguments boil down to two points. My friend and colleague, the former \nchairman and ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator \nGrassley, came up with this thumbnail description of this creative \nhistorical account.\n  First, all of the ``good'' fiscal history of the 1990s was derived \nfrom the partisan tax increase bill of 1993.\n  And second, all of the ``bad'' fiscal history taking place within the \npast 10 years is because of the bipartisan tax relief plans originally \nenacted during the last administration and continued under the present \nadministration.\n  You could go one step further and, as a policy premise, refine that \nthumbnail description to two short sentences. First sentence--lower \ntaxes are bad. Second sentence--higher taxes are good. Not \nsurprisingly, these revisionist historians support higher taxes and \nhigher government spending. And not surprisingly, the revisionists \noppose cutting taxes and cutting government spending.\n  Since time is short today, I direct folks to Senate floor remarks I \nmade on February 14, 2011. They are available on the Senate Finance \nCommittee under the Ranking Members Newsroom tab for that date. But it \nis important to reiterate the main point of those remarks. Basically \nthe assertion by our friends on the other side that raising taxes is \nthe key to all good fiscal history can be summarily dismissed.\n  Let's take a quick view of the 1990s data. According to the Clinton \nadministration's Office of Management and Budget--or OMB--the impact of \nthe much-bragged about tax hike bill of 1993 was minimal. The Clinton \nadministration's OMB concluded that the 1993 tax increase accounted for \nonly 13 percent of deficit reduction between 1990 and 2000. Thirteen \npercent puts the 1993 tax increase behind other factors such as defense \ncuts, other revenue, and interest savings. The data show that tax \nincreases did not drive deficit reduction.\n  So as a matter of fact, only 13 percent of the positive fiscal \nhistory of the 1990s is due to the partisan 1993 tax increase? That is \nit. Thirteen percent.\n  Well, what about the last decade? The period of 2001-2010 saw a lot \nof deficits. From what you hear from our friends on the other side, \nthose deficits\n\n[[Page S5222]]\n\nare owing to the tax relief that benefitted virtually every American \ntaxpayer. Yet CBO data tell us a different story.\n  On May 12, 2011, CBO released a recap of the changes over the past \ndecade. At the start of 2001, as everyone agrees, CBO projected a \nsurplus of $5.6 trillion. Over the decade, deficits of $6.2 trillion \nmaterialized. That's a swing of $11.8 trillion. What did CBO say were \nthe causes? My friends on the other side might be surprised to learn.\n  Higher spending accounts for 44 percent of the change. Let me repeat \nthat. Higher spending was the biggest driver of the deficits of the \nlast decade. Economic and technical changes in the estimates accounted \nfor 28 percent of the change. So all tax relief, including the tax \nrelief passed by Democratic Congresses and tax relief signed into law \nby President Obama, accounts for 28 percent. The tax relief \nlegislation, much maligned by our friends on the other side, accounts \nfor less than half of the fiscal change attributable to tax relief. \nSpecifically, the bipartisan tax relief bills of 2001 and 2003, \nincluding the AMT patches in those bills, accounted for 13.7 percent of \nthe fiscal change of the last decade. That is not Orrin Hatch speaking. \nIt's the nonpartisan congressional scorekeeper, CBO.\n  So how much of the bad fiscal history of the last decade is \nattributable to tax relief? Twenty-eight percent. That is it. And that \nincludes partisan bills like the stimulus. If you isolate the \nbipartisan bills that are the object of sharp criticism by our friends \non the other side, the 2001 and 2003 legislation, you'll find that \nthose bills account for only 13.7 percent of the fiscal change in the \nlast decade.\n  Abnormally low levels of spending contributed significantly to the \nsurpluses of the 1990s. Abnormally high spending drove the deficits of \nthe past decade. Abnormally high spending is driving our current \ndeficits, and it will drive our future deficits as well.\n  To my friends on the other side, if we focus instead on hiking taxes \nway above their historic average, we are misreading and mistreating the \nproblem. The reason for our previous surpluses was low spending. And \nthe reason for our current deficits is high spending. We cannot tax our \nway to fiscal health.\n  But that said, for those of my friends on the other side who think \nthat raising taxes is the key to our economic recovery and deficit \nreduction, I urge them to come to the floor and tell us how high they \nwant to raise rates. What will do the trick? If higher taxes are the \ncure to our economic woes, do we want to go back to the pre-1986 reform \nrates of 50 percent? Or how about the Carter era rates of 70 percent? \nOr maybe even the pre-Kennedy rates of 91 percent? How high should \nrates go in order to bring down the deficit and spur our economic \nrecovery?\n  I want to know and America wants to know.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the motion to concur \nin the House amendment to S. 365, the legislative vehicle for the debt \nlimit increase. Given the $14.3 trillion national debt, the $1.6 \ntrillion deficit for the current fiscal year, and the unrestrained and \nskyrocketing growth of Government programs and services, this vote \ncommences the debate that will lead our Government to reevaluate \npriorities and examine its spending with a critical eye.\n  Today's vote was critical to maintaining our country's financial \ncredibility, and it was the first step in what will be many to rein in \nthe U.S. Government's out-of-control spending. This bill reduces \ncurrent spending, caps future spending, and controls previously \nunrestrained Government budgets over the next decade, while also \nprotecting critical Social Security benefits.\n  Just weeks ago, the United States was warned it would lose its \nstellar AAA credit rating on two grounds: if Washington did nothing to \naddress its debt and deficit spending, and if Congress failed to raise \nthe debt ceiling, thus triggering a default. This vote addresses both \nissues by, for the first time in history, requiring spending reductions \nequal or greater to the amount the debt ceiling is raised. That is \nindeed a first, positive step toward making our Government accountable \nto its people.\n  This action was critically important to every family in America. A \ndefault would have resulted in a downgrade in our Nation's credit \nrating and triggered higher interest rates for borrowing at all levels, \nfrom the Federal Government, to states and municipalities, to every \nAmerican who has a mortgage, a car loan, a student loan, or a credit \ncard. Failure to pass this bill would have put retirement funds at risk \nat a time when seniors are looking for financial stability and counting \non predictability in their retirement income.\n  While no one can predict how the ratings agencies will react to this \nlegislation, it at least signals that our country is serious about \ngetting its financial situation in order. In addition, it requires \nCongress to vote on a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, \nwhich is a commonsense reform I have championed since I came to \nCongress. Mandating the Federal Government to do what nearly every \nState legislature is already required to achieve sends a message to \nevery American and the world that Washington finally gets it, and at \nlast understands the consequences of failing to control spending. Let \nthere be no mistake--we can no longer accept budgets that compromise \nour economic growth, living standards, or opportunities that have been \na hallmark of America's greatness.\n  Though this agreement is historic, I have grave concerns about the \nsupercommittee established by this legislation. Creating a 12-person \nWashington commission to do the job of 535 elected representatives is \nanother indication of a broken political system in dire need of repair. \nI will work tirelessly to bring accountability, reason, and \ntransparency to the decisions this supercommittee makes and presents to \nCongress for an up-or-down vote.\n  This legislation initially exempts Social Security, Medicaid, and \nveterans programs from spending cuts. After the initial cuts are \nimplemented, I am deeply concerned that the supercommittee could seek \nsavings from Medicare, Medicaid, and defense spending. The committee \nhas to recommend solid recommendations that Congress must act upon in \norder to avoid automatic cuts designed to incentivize Congress to \nfulfill this responsibility. Indeed, if the committee's recommendations \nare not adopted by Congress, automatic cuts to Medicare providers and \ndefense spending could go into effect while Medicaid would be exempt. \nFor these reasons, I will be especially vigilant about the work of the \nsupercommittee to ensure that its recommendations achieve an equitable \noutcome.\n  Moreover, this bill should have included a pro-growth strategy for \nour economy to address our cumbersome Tax Code, overly onerous and \ninefficient regulatory scheme, and a mountain of new health care costs. \nI have long advocated for a major overhaul of our Tax Code, regulatory \nreform, and a pro-jobs agenda. Indeed, throughout this year I have \nrepeatedly called on our President and this Congress to focus with \nlaser-like precision on jobs and the economy. Once again, I call on the \nPresident and the Congress to immediately turn to focus on concrete \nmeasures that will actually put Americans back to work.\n  Indisputably, debt and deficits are a dangerous combination at a time \nwhen we are experiencing an unprecedented period of long-term \nunemployment with more than 22 million Americans unemployed or \nunderemployed, and another 2.2 million who want a job, but are so \ndiscouraged they stopped looking for work altogether. In the 29 months \nsince President Obama took office, unemployment has dipped below 9 \npercent for only 5 months, and actually increased to 9.2 percent in \nJune. Manufacturing grew at the slowest pace in 2 years in July. The \nhousing downturn is worsening, with no plausible end to foreclosures in \nsight. Home prices in March fell to their lowest level since 2002. \nConsumers, confronted with higher gas and food prices, are spending \nless on discretionary items.\n  And yet at a moment when every dollar Government spends should be \nwisely dedicated to job creation to return us on the path to \nprosperity, we are forced to commit an astounding $200 billion per year \njust to service our debt. The cost of net interest alone will more than \ndouble in the next 10 years to reach nearly $1 trillion per year in \n2021. In fact, the CBO's most recent\n\n[[Page S5223]]\n\nlong-term outlook states that by 2035 interest costs on our Nation's \ndebt would reach 9 percent of GDP, more than the U.S. currently spends \non Social Security or Medicare. And if interest rates were just 1 \npercentage point higher per year, over 10 years the deficit would \nballoon by $1.3 trillion from increased costs to pay interest on our \ndebt alone.\n  It is abundantly clear that we can no longer afford to borrow money \nwithout a clear plan in place to rein in Federal spending and force the \nGovernment to live within its means. Today's legislation is the first \nstep in that direction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5223-1", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CORRECTING THE ENROLLMENT OF S. 365\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise because we have a crisis on our \nhands with the FAA, the Federal Aviation Administration. I know exactly \nwhy we have this crisis. It is another made-up crisis by the \nRepublicans. This is a Republican shutdown.\n  We just got past the most, well, I feel made-up crisis we have ever \nseen. Eighty-nine times we have passed a debt limit extension, and it \ntook us weeks and months of wrangling to get it done. We finally got it \ndone. I am glad we got it done. Unnecessary, people in my State \npanicking that they wouldn't get a Social Security check, small \nbusinesses saying they couldn't get a decent loan--all that for \nnothing.\n  We can do our work. We can take the ideas of the Presiding Officer's \nGang of 6, Senator Coburn's ideas. We have the ideas on the table. We \ncan do this. We did it when Bill Clinton was President. We worked \ntogether, and we solved the problem. We had a deficit and debt. We \nbalanced the budget and created surpluses. We don't have to have this \ntaking government hostage.\n  So we just got done with holding the full faith and credit of the \nUnited States of America hostage, and now we are seeing an extension of \nthe hostage-taking of the Federal Aviation Administration by the \nRepublicans. We need to end it. How do we end it? We end it simply by \nsaying we have our disagreements. On this bill, there are a couple of \nbroad disagreements. They are important disagreements. I honor both \nsides of the argument. The Republicans want to overturn a ruling by the \nNational Mediation Board. This is what they said. They said that rather \nthan count votes by an employee who stays home on a union vote as a \n``no'' vote, only the votes that are cast should be counted. Well, I \nask rhetorically, doesn't that make sense? If you don't vote in an \nelection, your vote shouldn't count. If the people didn't vote for me \nand they didn't vote for my opponent, how can anyone ascertain for whom \nthey would have voted? Only the people who show up should be counted. \nThat is what the mediation board did.\n  This affects the airlines and the rails. There is such a desire to \nstop that and overturn it by my Republican friends--and it is going on \nall over the country, this hostility to working men and women, and now \nit is coming here. It is like a contagion. We see what is happening in \nWisconsin. There are recall elections and everything is in turmoil \nbecause they want to go after organized working people. It is sad.\n  But guess what. It is a legitimate issue for the conference committee \nto deal with. It is a legitimate issue for the Senate--by the way, the \nSenate already had a vote on it, and we said: No, we are not going to \noverturn the mediation board. The vote was well over--I think 56 votes \nsaid: No. Leave it alone. It is not our business. Let it go.\n  But, no, the House wants this. So when they sent over the original \nextension, it had that attached, this overturning of the mediation \nboard, and we said: That is not right. We want a clean extension. So \nthey sent it back to us, and they took up another controversial issue, \nwhich is to shut down essential air service in some of our rural \ncommunities in our country--shut down essential air service.\n  Now, I can tell my colleagues that I know for a fact there is room \nfor negotiation in this area. We can work together and resolve it, but \nit doesn't belong in an extension of the FAA bill. This is too \nimportant. We have thousands of people who have been furloughed who are \nnot getting work. I have a situation in my home county of Riverside \nwhere we have a new airport tower being put up, and unexpectedly there \nwas a rainstorm the day before yesterday, and because nobody was \nworking there, they couldn't do anything about it to protect the \nfacility, and we have damage.\n  We are losing money because of this terrible shutdown. Four thousand \nFAA employees have been furloughed without their pay. Hundreds of them \nhappen to live and work in my State. I wonder how these colleagues in \nthe House who went home to take their break would feel if they stopped \ngetting their pay. Many of the FAA's engineers, scientists, research \nanalysts, computer specialists, program managers and analysts, \nenvironmental protection specialists, and community planners are \nfurloughed because of this take-government-hostage approach by the \nRepublican Party.\n  I have been here a while. I am a person with many opinions, and I \nhave no problem battling out with my esteemed colleagues who is right, \nwho is wrong, who is hurt, who is not hurt. But I know there is no \nquestion that people\n\n[[Page S5224]]\n\nare getting hurt and jobs are being lost.\n  Mr. President, $130 million in investments in California airport \nconstruction will be delayed. The Associated General Contractors of \nAmerica is already hurting and businesses are hurting. There are 70,000 \nconstruction workers and workers in related fields who have already \nbeen affected by the shutdown. The FAA has issued stop-work orders at \n241 airports across the country.\n  In Oakland, CA, I have 60 construction workers building an air \ntraffic control tower. They were told to stay home. They won't get paid \nuntil an agreement is reached. Well, if we ask most Americans, they \nreally do live pretty much paycheck to paycheck. They have some \nsavings.\n\n  This is ridiculous. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the \nproject contractor from Oakland, Devcon Construction, ``is eating \n$6,000 a day in operating costs'' and ``should the delay stretch much \npast the summer, [we are in trouble because] inclement weather would \ndisrupt the installation.''\n  I am telling you, this is another manmade, Republican-made crisis. \nWhat are we trying to prove? That we are tough guys? Let's get a clean \nextension of the FAA. Let's take our battles into the conference \ncommittee.\n  I want to compliment Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison. She is working, \nand she is on our side. She is a Republican Senator from Texas who is \nworking with Senator Rockefeller, the chairman of our committee. We all \nknow the House sent over not a clean extension but an extension that \ncuts this essential air service to some of our rural communities. This \nneeds to be worked on, not agreed to in a ``gotcha'' kind of situation.\n  In Sacramento, maintenance at the air traffic control facility has \ncome to a halt. Seismic modernizations at air traffic control towers in \nLivermore, Palo Alto, and Santa Maria have stopped. At LAX, the biggest \nairport in Los Angeles, and at Carlsbad, power and electrical upgrade \nprojects have stalled.\n  What is going on? Can't we just get over these differences in the \nproper forum? It is wrong. I am not going to be personally hurt by \nthis. The Senator from Oklahoma is not going to be personally hit by \nthis. The Presiding Officer, the Senator from Virginia, is not \npersonally hit by this. It is the people we represent or are supposed \nto represent. It is the American family. It is the construction \nworkers. It is the construction businesses. It is safety. These are \nsafety projects.\n  At the end of the day, are we saving money? We are losing money \nbecause we are not collecting the ticket tax that goes to this \nconstruction fund. And some of the airlines are pocketing it, and that \nis outrageous in and of itself in not reducing the fares.\n  I want to compliment a couple of the airlines that are, in fact, \nreducing the fares. Virgin America is one, and I will put in the Record \nthe other one. Good for them. Good for you.\n  So what I am about to do is ask for a clean extension of the FAA \nauthorization bill. My anticipation is the Senator from Oklahoma will \nobject, and then he will offer his idea of an extension that does, in \nfact, make the cuts in the rural communities, and we are back to square \none.\n  Why not just clear the decks, extend the FAA? We have never added \nanything to the extension in all the times we have done it unless there \nwas unanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I want to thank Senator Boxer for raising this issue. I \ncannot tell you how many people I have heard from in Maryland, not just \nthe workers at the FAA who have been furloughed but small business \nowners who are not getting their contracts who are going to have to lay \noff workers through no fault of their own. So I think it would be \nabsolutely wrong for us to go home on this recess, for this district \nwork period, and not extend the FAA.\n  For those who think it will save the government on the budget \ndeficit, let me remind you that if we do not extend the FAA \nauthorization, we do not collect the revenues on the passenger tax, \nwhich, by the way, is currently being charged by the airlines in extra \nticket prices to the passengers. So the passengers are not even getting \nthe break of lower prices, but we are not getting the revenue. It is \n$30 million a day we are adding to the deficit problems because we are \nnot collecting the revenue associated with the FAA reauthorization.\n  For all those reasons, for the sake of those 4,000 furloughed \nworkers, who are really not at fault here, who are currently on \nfurlough, and that is hurting our economy; for the sake of the \ncontractors, who are depending upon the government funds in order to \npay their workers, many of which are small companies; for the sake of \nthe construction work that needs to be done at our airports, including \nwork being done at our own airport, BWI; and for the importance to \nmoving forward with modernization of the FAA itself, I would urge us to \nfind a way to extend the FAA authorization until we come back. I would \nhope we could get a conference committee together, a reauthorization, \nbut at a minimum we should extend the current provisions during those \nnegotiations.\n  I say to Senator Boxer, she is absolutely right. I strongly urge the \nSenate to allow a short-term, clean extension of the FAA. That is the \nbest way to proceed. I hope we can find a way to get this done now so \nthe damage that is being done no longer will take place.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, I take that as a question, and I will just wrap up \nwith my unanimous consent request because I agree with everything that \nwas said.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 109, H.R. 2553, that a Rockefeller-\nHutchison substitute amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to, the \nbill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I would make note there is nothing we can do now new \nbecause the House has adjourned. So even if we were to pass this, \nnothing would happen with it. I have been assured that from the \nmajority leader's office.\n  I agree with the Senator from California that any action on the \nmediation board is probably inappropriate for this bill. I would not \ndisagree with that. But my reservation--and I plan on objecting, and I \nthink the good Senator from California knows that--is both in the House \nand the Senate, by significant votes, we passed limitations on \nessential air services by majorities that said we could no longer \nafford to spend thousands of dollars on individual seats, on subsidies \nfor people who live 110 miles from an airport or 140 miles from an \nairport. But what we could do is make sure--to major airports--that \nthose under 90, those above 90, we could still do that.\n  So I understand we have placed people in difficult positions, but it \nis us as a body, not individual Senators or parties, that has done that \nbecause we have failed to do our work.\n  So I object to this unanimous consent request, and then I offer one \nof my own, noting that if this unanimous consent request is agreed to, \nit will go directly to the President, not to the House. So I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.R. 2553, which was received from the House, and I \nask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time and passed, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  There was objection to the original request.\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. Objection was heard.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, so there we are. There was objection to a \nclean extension of the FAA, and as a result of Republican objection, \npeople are hurting all over this country. Safety projects are being \ndelayed. And this is\n\n[[Page S5225]]\n\njust part of what we have seen since the Republicans took over the \nHouse.\n  Now, my friend said that everything they have put in this has been \nvoted on by the Senate. It is just not true. It is not true. Not \neverything in this extension was voted on by the Senate, so let's get \nour facts straight.\n  My friend also said that the House has gone; too bad; give it up. Not \ntrue. I served there for 10 years. If you can hotline it over there and \nget everyone to agree, they are going to be able to pass it over there. \nSo do not give the American people misinformation on this. It can be \ndone. It just takes a will to be done.\n  House Members have taken off, gone home. Whatever they are doing, God \nbless them. But I have to tell you, I hope when they go home they hear \nfrom the people who are hurting in their States because of this. I hope \nthey hear from the workers. Construction workers are at the highest \nunemployment rate we have seen in generations--15 percent--and now this \nis going to make it worse. Construction businesses are crying for a \nhighway bill, and I am working on that with Senator Inhofe in our \ncommittee. We are almost there.\n  But I want to put this obstructionism, I want to put this hostage-\ntaking into plain view. You just saw everything come to a halt for at \nleast 3, 4 weeks because the full faith and credit of America was taken \nhostage by the Republicans. And they said to the President--it has \nnever happened before, OK, never. Mr. President, 89 times we have seen \nan increase in the debt limit. We have never ever seen this hostage-\ntaking. They would not allow the President to raise the debt ceiling \nfor things on which they voted to spend money.\n  When you raise the debt ceiling, you are paying your past bills. They \nvoted for two wars on the credit card. They voted for tax breaks to the \nwealthiest among us, the billionaires and the millionaires. They voted \nfor tax breaks for the biggest multinational corporations, including \nBig Oil. Oh, they were happy. They even voted for a prescription drug \nbenefit without paying for it. Then the bill comes due, and they say to \nPresident Obama: Sorry, Mr. President, we are not going to cooperate \nwith you. They walked out on him at least three times.\n  We finally got a deal because some of us--and I say Harry Reid, \nstrong; Vice President Biden, strong; Mitch McConnell, strong; Nancy \nPelosi, strong. The President made sure that at the end of the day we \ndid not default. But what a spectacle in the world. The world cannot \neven believe this. And I know of the Presiding Officer's hard work to \nget what we called a big deal, a major deal, a $4 trillion deficit \nreduction that was fair, that asked the millionaires and the \nbillionaires and the multinational corporations to do something. But, \nno, that was not to be. We wasted time--a lot of time. And what \nhappened? We almost brought the country to its knees. Thank God it did \nnot happen is all I can say. And I felt strongly, if we had not gotten \nan agreement, the President would have had to invoke the 14th amendment \nin order to save our country from this hostage-taking.\n  So that was a made-up crisis. It never happened before. Do you know \nthat the most the debt ceiling was raised was under Ronald Reagan? \nEighteen times. Under George Bush, 9 times. I never heard anything like \nthis before, and I have been around here since the days of Ronald \nReagan, dare I say. I was in the House for 10 years.\n  Ronald Reagan said very clearly--and I am paraphrasing--he was very \nstrong--do not play games with the debt ceiling. It is dangerous. He \nsaid that even the thought of it is dangerous. So we just came out of \nthat mess.\n  Now let's look at what else they have done since they took power--how \nmany months ago? Five months? Is that all it has been? It feels like an \neternity, OK, since they took over the House. They stopped the patent \nbill, which Senator Leahy says would result in hundreds of thousands of \njobs--stopped it cold. Why? Because the Patent Office does not have any \nmoney to work on those brilliant ideas that are coming out of our \npeople. They needed more funding. That bill took care of it. The House \nstopped it cold. Hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n  The Economic Development Administration--I know about that because I \nbrought the bill here. It is a beautiful program. It has been in place \nfor generations. It gives a little seed money in areas that have had \nhigh unemployment, and that seed money attracts private sector money, \npublic sector money, nonprofit money, and jobs are created. They build \noffice parks. We have great examples in California of shopping malls. I \nam sure my friend, the Presiding Officer, has many examples of the EDA \nat work. They stopped it. They filibustered it. It never got a \nvote. That is the small business innovation bill my friend Mary \nLandrieu brought to the floor. The last time we counted, those bills \nhave created 19,000 new businesses. Shut that one down. Then the House \npassed a budget that cut into the highway fund. I want to give you \nspecifically what that would mean. If we wind up cutting the \ntransportation program at the level they cut it in the House--one-\nthird--and that is exactly what Chairman Mica's bill does--we know, \nbecause CBO has told us, we lose 620,000 jobs, construction jobs.\n\n  Then they played with the FAA. They object to a clean \nreauthorization. Projects are shut down and workers are furloughed and \nsmall businesses do not know if they can hang on.\n  OK. I thought this election in 2010 was about jobs. I tell you, I was \nup in 2010. I know it was about jobs. I committed to the people I would \ngo back here and fight for jobs, private sector jobs, public sector \njobs. Jobs. Jobs. Everything the House has done since the Republicans \ntook over is to stop our progress--screeching halt. You can hear the \nbrakes go onto this economy. It is not just one thing now, it is five \nthings I have told you. This is not rhetoric. They have stopped the \nFAA--partial shutdown; they stopped the EPA authorization; they stopped \nthe patent bill; they stopped the small innovation bill; they have cut \ntransportation in their budget by one-third. That is just the tip of \nthe iceberg of what I am telling you.\n  I think it is very sad right now that we had a Republican objection \nto a bipartisan request to allow FAA to be reauthorized. It is very \nsad. I want to again thank Kay Bailey Hutchison, my friend from Texas, \nfor saying that she stands with Chairman Rockefeller, and she believes \nwe should do a clean reauthorization. With that, I think I have made my \npoints. But I am going to make sure I continue to make them throughout \nthis recess. I would suggest that Senators go home and look at the \nprojects in their States that have been stopped due to this Republican \nhostage taking. They are against working men and women having decent \nrights. They are holding this bill hostage. That is what it is all \nabout. It is a very sad day.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to take a moment and add my voice \nto the voices who spoke earlier--the Senator from Maryland and the \nSenator from California--about this situation with the FAA.\n  I would imagine if you are a visitor to our Nation's Capitol and have \ncome to see a little Senate debate, it is a pretty interesting day to \nbe here. It was great news that the country avoided default today. \nAlthough it was an imperfect compromise, I was glad to vote for that. \nWe still have obviously a long way to go on debt and deficits.\n  There is another issue that has not gotten as much attention as the \ndebt ceiling debate, although it is clear that at almost any other time \nin our history this issue would be on the front page of every newspaper \naround the country and on every nightly TV newscast. I am talking about \nthe fact that the Federal Aviation Administration--the entity that \nensures the safety of our skies, the safety of our airplanes, the \nmaintenance of our airports--has been in partial shutdown mode for over \na week.\n  Close to 4,000 FAA employees, many from the Virginia/DC area, have \nbeen\n\n[[Page S5226]]\n\nfurloughed. These folks do not know when they are going to get a \npaycheck or when they are going to be able to go back to work. And they \nhave not been furloughed as a result of anything they have done. This \nsituation is not the result of complaints about the quality of service \nor about safety of the FAA. In fact this shutdown is the result of a \ndispute over a small FAA program that protects rural airports.\n  Only in Washington would a dispute over service to small rural \nairports force the shut down of all ``nonessential services'' in the \nFederal Aviation Administration. Only in Washington would we would put \n4,000 people out of work, and affect the lives of tens of thousands of \nother folks who are depending upon FAA funding for needed improvement \nprojects at airports around the country.\n  We have a number of airports in Virginia where construction has \nbasically stopped as a result of this political standoff. With the FAA \npartially shut down, the airlines, which traditionally charge \npassengers a small tax to help fund the FAA to build, maintain, and \nkeep airports safe, are no longer required to collect the tax. So, \nduring this shutdown, especially if we go through the next month and do \nnot enact an extension, the U.S. Government would lose $1.2 billion as \na result of political back and forth about a program to support rural \nairports--a program that, in total, costs $14 million.\n  If people are scratching theirs head with this math, they have a \nright to scratch their heads. Only in Washington can not collecting \nover a billion dollars in airport ticket taxes because of a dispute \nabout a program that costs $14 million make any sense.\n  The overwhelming majority of Senate Democrats and Republicans alike \nsay we have to go ahead with an extension. We are saying if we have \nissues to dispute let's work those out. But let's not put nearly 4,000 \nFAA employees out of work and let's not, as the Senator from California \nsaid, halt the projects of tens of thousands of construction workers.\n  So it is my hope that, once again, cooler heads will prevail. I thank \nthe chairman of the committee, Senator Rockefeller, and the ranking \nmember, Senator Hutchison, and both Democrats and Republicans for \nworking together to try and get this resolved. I know the American \npeople have looked at Congress--understandably--in the last few weeks \nand have scratched their heads and said, what are these guys doing? Why \ncan't they get their act together and negotiate a compromise, so they \ndon't put our country into default?\n  We managed to dodge that bullet in a way that is a fixed but not a \nlong-term solution. We will continue that discussion. As everybody \nheads back to their home States, dodging the debt and deficit bullet, \nhow are we going to look as we leave town with 4,000 workers \nfurloughed, tens of thousands of construction workers without the \nability to continue projects that are needed, and the U.S. Government \n$1.2 billion deeper in debt--not because of a dispute over of too much \ntax or whether to collect but because we could not reach an agreement \nover a rural airport program?\n  I have cosponsored legislation--and I am sure the Presiding Officer \nsupports it--to make sure that when the furloughed workers get back, \nthey have to get paid. How can we leave town for a few weeks and leave \nthis issue hanging out there?\n  I hope those folks in the House--and the chairman and the ranking \nmember of the committee are working on this issue--will get this done. \nAs the Senator from California said--and this is some of the technical \nprocess stuff that people scratch their head about--the House is in pro \nforma session, so there is a path here to resolve the issue.\n  We have to make sure we do our job not only for the public to make \nsure their airlines and airports stay safe, but also for the furloughed \nworkers who need to get back to work. We've got to do our job so that \nairports all over the Commonwealth of Virginia and the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania can implement their much-needed airport improvements. The \nmoney has already been appropriated. It is not as though it is new \ndollars. Anybody who can read a balance sheet knows we shouldn't end up \nblowing $1.2 billion over a dispute for a program that costs $14 \nmillion total.\n  I hope we get this resolved this afternoon in a way that shows this \nCongress is more up to the task than we have been, unfortunately, over \nthe last few weeks.\n  A closing comment. I know the Presiding Officer has worked hard on \nthe debt and deficit issue as well. I will close with the statement \nthat my hope is that we did take a step today, with about $1 trillion \nin cuts over the next 10 years, and we need to make sure those cuts \ndon't slow down the economic recovery the Nation is still struggling \nwith. But we have to recognize that even with this new supercommittee \nbeing created--and the Presiding Officer would be a great member of \nthat committee when it is chosen--but even if that committee meets its \ngoal of $1.5 trillion in additional cuts, that still doesn't get our \ncountry's balance sheet back in order. We didn't create this debt \novernight. We will not get out of it overnight. It is not one party's \nfault. Both parties have unclean hands on this.\n  Candidly, a lot of our debt and deficit problems are due to the fact \nthat we are all getting older and we are living longer through advanced \nmedicine. The challenge we have before us is that we have to urge the \nsupercommittee to look at something that will get us all out of our \ncomfort zones. We have to recognize how do we make sure our entitlement \npromises we made to seniors with Social Security and Medicare and the \nleast fortunate in terms of Medicaid--I know two-thirds of the seniors \nin nursing homes are on Medicaid. How do we preserve those programs? \nThese programs need some reforms, because with an aging population--for \nexample, in Social Security, there used to be 17 workers for 1 retiree. \nNow there are three. It is nobody's fault, but that is a fact. How do \nwe make sure that promise exists?\n  We have to deal with entitlement reform, and we also need to deal \nwith tax reform. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out if we \nare spending 25 percent of GDP in Federal spending, that has to be \nbrought down. If we are collecting revenues at only 15 percent, which \nis a 70-year low, we are never going to get that 10-percent \ndifferential, unless we find some way to generate more revenues and \nmake cuts in spending. Along with entitlement spending, which is the \nfastest growing part of the budget, we have to do tax reform in a way \nthat will generate more revenue. There are ways we can do that which \nwill lower rates and cut back on some of the tax expenditures. It will \ntake some hard choices.\n  My hope is that while this step of avoiding default was important--\nand it is a good day when America doesn't default, but we have much \nmore work to do--the work of all the previous commissions that have \nbeen set up--and they have all kind of come out in basically the same \nscope of the problem--and, frankly, with about the same kinds of \nrecommendations. A lot of that work of the so-called Simpson-Bowles \ncommission, the President's deficit commission, the Gang of 6--or my \nhope would be the ``mob of 60,'' at some point in the not too-distant \nfuture--that was the framework we worked on, and we put everything on \nthe table.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer and any other colleagues who may be \nstill around, I urge them to join this effort. We have to make sure \nthis supercommittee actually takes on the big issues and that we don't \ndefault back to a series of cuts come next year that, frankly, are not \nwell thought through, or well planned, across the board, without regard \nto effectiveness. The only way is, yes, by additional cutting but doing \nentitlement reform and tax reform.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and with the hopes that we will see not \nonly the hard work on the debt and deficit, but also the resolution of \nthe FAA issue in the coming hours. I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S5227]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5227-1", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         Sergeant Omar A. Jones\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to remember a fallen hero, \nNebraska Army National Guard Sergeant Omar A. Jones of Maywood, NE.\n  Sergeant Jones served as an electrician in the 623rd Engineer \nCompany, Nebraska Army National Guard, out of Wahoo, Nebraska. Sergeant \nJones died at Forward Operating Base Deh Dadi in Balkh Province, \nAfghanistan, on July 18, 2011.\n  Omar grew up in Mississippi and lived in Bogota, Colombia for many \nyears. He graduated from high school in Colorado and chose to enter the \nArmy instead of pursuing a college athletic scholarship. He served two \ntours in Iraq. One as an infantryman in the active duty Army, and one \nwith the Nebraska Army National Guard. His love of country compelled \nhim to seek an assignment in Afghanistan. He volunteered and even \nchanged units and developed new skills for this opportunity.\n  In October 2010, he deployed to Afghanistan with the 623rd \nEngineering Company. It was a tough decision to deploy again because \nhis wife Ava and two children had become the center of his life. But, \nit was for their freedom he chose to serve again overseas.\n  His commanders and fellow Soldiers recall Sergeant Jones as kind, \nfriendly, and helpful. They say they counted on Sergeant Jones for a \nbig smile and a willingness to listen. He loved being a soldier. A \nformer commander put it this way:\n\n       He had the biggest heart of any soldier I knew.\n\n  His decorations and badges earned during a distinguished career over \nthree combat tours speak to his dedication and bravery. He received the \nCombat Infantry Badge, Combat Action Badge, Marksmanship Qualification \nBadge (Expert), Driver and Mechanic Badge, Overseas Service Bar (2), \nArmy Commendation Medal (2), Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense \nService Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal with Bronze Service Star, \nAfghanistan Campaign Medal with Bronze Service Star, Global War on \nTerrorism Expeditionary Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, \nArmed Forces Reserve Medal with ``M'' device (2), Army Service Ribbon, \nOverseas Service Ribbon, and the NATO Medal.\n  I cannot put into words how the death of Sergeant Jones will impact \nthe lives of those closest to him. Nebraska is honored to call him one \nof our own, and I know Nebraskans in Maywood and Wellfleet will provide \nhis family with care and love during this difficult time.\n  Today I join the family and friends of Sergeant Jones in mourning the \ndeath of their husband, son, father, and friend. I ask that God be with \nall those serving in uniform, especially the brave men and women on the \nfront lines of battle. May God bless them and their families and bring \nthem home to us safely.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb).

Mr. President, I stand to address this body to honor the \nlife of one of Utah's great citizens.\n  A good friend of mine is former Utah Governor Norman Bangerter, who \nannounced on Saturday that his beloved wife of 58 years had passed away \nafter a long-time battle with Alzheimer's disease.\n  Colleen Monson Bangerter, having been born in 1935, was the mother of \nsix children, the mother also of one foster son, and in many respects \nwas a friend to all of Utah's 3 million residents.\n  She served faithfully in many capacities, including as PTA president \nand other offices within the PTA. She also served faithfully in a \nvariety of positions as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of \nLatter-Day Saints.\n  Just a few years ago, she and her husband, former Governor Bangerter, \nserved as they presided over the mission of the Church of Jesus Christ \nof Latter-Day Saints in South Africa. They worked hand in hand \nthroughout their entire lives--in raising their children, in running \nGovernor Bangerter's campaigns, and in running the State throughout his \ntime as Governor, which wasn't an easy time for our State.\n  During Governor Bangerter's two terms in office, our State faced \nsignificant financial difficulties, faced significant flooding \nchallenges, and the Bangerters weathered these adverse conditions well, \nserving as standing examples to all the citizens of Utah for what it \nmeans to rise to the challenge of adversity.\n  Colleen Bangerter was someone who had friends in many corners, and \nshe also had many talents, some of which are not known by everyone, \nincluding the fact that she was the State hopscotch champion in the \nState of Utah in 1947. There are not many First Ladies in the United \nStates who can claim that distinction, and she definitely did. She was \nalso pleased to have been the recipient of the highest award that can \nbe granted by the Boy Scouts of America, which she received just a few \nyears ago. But of all the honors, including the honors that went along \nwith being the First Lady of the State of Utah and serving with someone \nwho, in my opinion, was one of the great Governors ever to serve our \nState, her greatest honor, her greatest prize was that of her family.\n  She loved being a mother, loved each of her 6 children, their 30 \ngrandchildren and 18 great grandchildren. We as Utahns mourn the loss \nof this great citizen of our State. We mourn the loss of this friend. \nOur thoughts and our prayers go out to former Governor Bangerter and \nhis family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity to pay \ntribute today to a remarkable woman, quintessential wife and mother, \nand superb first lady for the State of Utah--Colleen Monson Bangerter. \nSadly she passed away on the evening of Friday, July 29, 2011, from the \neffects of Alzheimer's disease. She was at home, the place she loved to \nbe with her husband former Utah Governor Norman H. Bangerter.\n  Colleen was a wonderful human being who was always willing to serve \nothers. She served as Utah's first lady from 1985-1993, while her \nhusband Norman H. Bangerter was the Governor. During her years as first \nlady she undertook many causes close to her heart, including teenage \ndrug use, and challenges facing women and families. She hosted a yearly \ndrug awareness conference for teens and took First Lady Nancy Reagan's \nJust Say No Program to every corner of the State. Additionally she \nhosted an annual conference on strengthening families to address the \nimportant challenges affecting the health and well-being of families \nacross our great State.\n  She stood by her husband's side as he led Utah through a very \nimportant time in our State's history. They advocated for economic \ndevelopment and she was a tremendous ambassador for Utah as they met \nwith leaders throughout the Nation and even overseas encouraging new \nbusiness development.\n  Colleen not only excelled at the initiatives she undertook for our \nstate, she also served in many capacities as she raised her children \nincluding the PTA, and in many important positions for her church--The \nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Colleen and Norm presided \nover the Johannesburg, South Africa Mission from 1996-1999. In this \nrole she was a kind, and loving asset to the many missionaries who \njoined them in the work in South Africa.\n  Colleen and Norm raised six children and one foster son. They now \nhave 30 grandchildren and 18 great grandchildren. She was the light of \nher family and could always be found in the middle of the fun. She \nenjoyed spending time at their cabin in beautiful Utah, as well as \ntheir second home in St. George. She always made people feel welcome \nand embraced many who crossed their paths.\n  Colleen Bangerter will be very missed by her wonderful husband Norm \nand their family. There was a special warmth and goodness about this \nlady and I will never forget her twinkling eyes and bright smile. She \nwas kind to all she met, and was a partner in every sense of the word \nto her husband. Elaine and I love Norm and Colleen very much, and hope \nthat Norm and his\n\n[[Page S5228]]\n\nfamily will find some peace and comfort in the wonderful memories they \nshare with this remarkable woman. Her life's work touched many lives \nand she will be forever remembered as someone who truly cared about \nothers, and in doing good for her family and community.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5228-1", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5228-S5230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BUDGET CONTROL ACT\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I want to speak just momentarily about the \nlegislation that was just passed.\n  I, for the last 14 months traveling my State in almost every nook and \ncranny, have talked about the situation our country is in, talked about \npossible solutions, and offered legislation--the only bipartisan, \nbicameral legislation offered until this point--to deal with our \ncountry's deficits and debt.\n  I had hoped that we would figure out a way to deal with $5 trillion \nto $7 trillion worth of spending and/or savings over the next 10 years, \nand finally decided that $4 trillion was the magic number. I know the \nmarkets had looked at that, the rating agencies looked at that, the \npeople who buy our Treasurys had looked at that number. Over the course \nof the last few weeks, it became apparent that $3 trillion was probably \nthe most that was going to be achieved, and then now we have ended up \nwith this bill that passed today, and I supported that hoping to \nachieve $2.1 trillion to $2.4 trillion in savings over the next decade.\n  Mr. President, obviously, like many of us in this body on both sides \nof the aisle who know our country is in dire straits and we have a lot \nof work to do, I am disappointed at the magnitude of this legislation. \nBut I am hopeful and thankful that we have taken the first step. I \nthink this is going to be a decade of us having to focus on our \ncountry's irresponsibility over the past many years. Both parties, no \ndoubt, have been responsible for putting us in this situation. It is \ngoing to take both parties to move us away from where we are. But I \nthink everyone in this body fully understands that on the present \ncourse our country's best days are behind us. I think all of us want to \nensure that this country's greatness continues; that we can continue to \ndisplay American exceptionalism not only here but around the world.\n  I look at this solely as the first step. I know we are going to have \nan appropriations opportunity to look at even more savings at the end \nof September. I know we are going to have a committee that is going to \nbe looking at this during the months of November and December. I know \nwe are going to have a series of opportunities for us to deal with \nthis. Again, today was just a first step.\n  I learned through a lifetime of business, starting with doing very, \nvery small projects at the age of 25 when I first went in business, \nthat as a company, you can never go broke taking a profit. What I have \nlearned in the Senate is you should never say no to spending cuts.\n  So while these spending cuts are not of the magnitude that I would \nlike to have seen, I think this is a very good first step and is \nsomething that we can all build upon. I look forward to working with \npeople on both sides of the aisle to ensure that this is just the first \nstep and that our country continues to have the discipline, the \nfortitude, the courage, and the will to make the tough decisions that \nall of us know we are going to need to make over the course of the next \nmany years.\n  That is what we owe these young pages who are getting ready to leave \nafter service to this country over the last month; that is what we owe \nfuture generations; that is what we owe Americans; and, candidly, that \nis what we owe the world as citizens of this world; that is, for us to \nbe disciplined and to know that we have to live within our means and to \nknow the best thing we can possibly do as a country at this moment in \ntime is to show we have that courage and that will.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the time to speak on this topic. I \nknow all of us leave here and go home to recess. I know many of us will \nbe talking about the vast amount of work that needs to be done as it \nrelates to making sure we rein in this out-of-control spending that has \nbeen taking place for many years. I look forward to that. I look \nforward to talking to citizens back in Tennessee, and I look forward to \ncoming back in September and dealing with folks on both sides of the \naisle to make sure we put that thought into action.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Tennessee, \nMr. Corker, for what he just said. I want to affirm the extraordinary \namount of effort he has made to not only inform this Senate body of the \ncrisis that we face financially, but also to come forward with some \nvery constructive solutions on how to deal with this crisis.\n  I know he is disappointed that we were not able to reach a better \nsolution than the one voted on today. I know he struggled to decide \nwhat was the best course to follow moving forward. In the end, he \ndecided to support the bill as a first step; but, as he said, this is \nthe first step of what probably will be a decade-long challenge facing \nall of us to successfully address this deep hole of debt we have dug \nfor ourselves as a nation.\n  I rise today to speak, sharing all those concerns, certainly \nbelieving that our work has just started and there is much more to do. \nBut also as someone who decided to vote against the bill that we just \nhad before us. I have not taken this vote lightly.\n  For the past 1\\1/2\\ years, as a candidate I traveled the State of \nIndiana, to just about every town and city in the State, talking to \nthousands and thousands of Hoosiers on a day-after-day basis hearing \nwhat they had to say. If, frankly, I could categorize their thoughts \ninto one statement, it would be a deep concern about the future of our \ncountry and a deep desire to have their elected representatives go to \nWashington and do everything they can to address this situation.\n  I have spent the last 7 months in the Senate hearing from hundreds, \nif not thousands, of Hoosiers who have written, called, visited, and \ntalked with me back at home. Nothing has changed except the urgency of \nthese concerns, and the deep worries that they have expressed have \nsimply grown.\n  We saw, in 2010, Americans across the country express their desire \nfor Congress to get hold of our fiscal situation; that the era of \nspending, of promising beyond our means, was over, and that we had to \ntake major steps to reverse that. That is why I decided to return to \nthe Senate, to come back to work to help repair our country's economic \nfuture. I came back to work on the things that many consider \npolitically toxic: entitlement reform, tax reform, passing a balanced \nbudget amendment to make sure that we would never end up in this \nsituation again; that if there was a legacy that we could pass on to \nour children, if there was something that we could do for the future of \nour country, something that we could do for our children and \ngrandchildren, and everyone's children and grandchildren, it would be \nto never have them have to go through what we are going through now \nbecause we had taken fiscal responsibility, passing a balanced budget \namendment that would, as we are sworn in, require each of us to come \nhere and put our left hand on the Bible and our right hand in the air, \nto repeat the oath to honor the Constitution, and that Constitution \nwould attain a balanced budget amendment as a requirement.\n  So before taking this vote, I pondered for days and nights about the \nmany Hoosiers who had put their faith and confidence in me and sent me \nback to the Senate to do everything I could to accomplish this \ngoal. Some of those Hoosiers had tears in their eyes, worried about the \nfuture for themselves and for their children. Some had fingers in my \nchest, saying: Don't let me down. Don't go and settle for too little. \nDo everything you can. That is what I have tried to do.\n\n  After giving it consideration, I decided not to support this bill \nbecause I could not come to grips with having to come back and tell \nHoosiers that this is the best we could do.\n  I do wish to recognize the work and leadership, the strategy and the \nefforts of our minority leader, Senator McConnell, and whip, Senator \nKyl, those in leadership and others--John Boehner and Eric Cantor in \nthe House and the people who represented Republicans at the White \nHouse.\n\n[[Page S5229]]\n\n  I, like most of us who serve here, appreciate their hard work and \nunderstand their frustration at Washington's inability to accomplish a \nmeaningful goal, a grand bargain or at least a big plan that would put \nus significantly on the way to fiscal reform. I don't hold them liable \nat all or anybody who voted for this bill. As Senator Corker just said \nand as others have said and can say: Look, this is the best we could \ndo. We will keep going.\n  I applaud that. It is just that I thought we could have done so much \nmore when the crisis we face is so severe, when the consequences are so \ngreat and imminent. It is not 2013. It is not even 2012. It is now. I \ndon't know what the rating agencies are going to do because of our \ndebt. Many were saying that this vote would not result in a debt \ndowngrade. I think already we have heard information to the contrary, \nthat that is not the case. That means the full faith and confidence in \nthe United States of America as being that last safe haven of safety is \nput at risk.\n  We have taken a step in the right direction. It is a small step. It \nis a marathon we have to run, and we do need to go much further. I \nbelieve the bill we just passed is significantly short of what is \nneeded to address the severity of the crisis.\n  Senator Corker said there has been a consensus that a minimum of $4 \ntrillion of cuts are needed over the next 10 years, with true \nenforcement mechanisms to lock those cuts in place. We achieved just \nhalf of that in the bill we passed.\n  I have been stating over and over that the reality is if we do not \naddress health care spending and the entitlements that provide benefits \nthrough Medicaid and Medicare, the virtual consensus is, no matter what \nelse we do, we will not be able to solve the problem. This is an area \nthat people do not want to talk about. It is supposedly the third rail \nof politics. It is suicide to bring it up, and there have been a lot of \nefforts to avoid these tough choices. But that is what we are going to \nhave to do.\n  It has been avoided in this bill, pushed off to the selection of a \nspecial committee of six Senators, six Congressmen; balanced, six and \nsix from each party, to come up with an additional $1 trillion of \nsavings or perhaps a little more. I have some real reservations about \nwhether this committee should have to do this in the first place \nbecause that is the job of Congress, all of us. That is what we were \nelected to do and we were not able to do it. We have turned it over to \n12 Members of Congress. I am not sure how they are going to accomplish \nwhat we were not able to. Nevertheless, I hope and pray they are \nsuccessful, and I hope they will address, in whatever recommendation \nthey make to us later this year, entitlement reform and make a \ncommitment to tax reform: entitlement reform because that spending is \nbankrupting this country and is denying future seniors benefits they \nare counting on--who are dependent on Social Security and Medicare--\ndenying them the opportunity to rest easy that their benefits will \nremain the same or increase with the cost of living.\n  The situation the trustees have reported regarding the future of the \nMedicare Part A is that serious cuts will have to be made unless we \ntake measures now to reform the system in a way that preserves those \nbenefits for those currently on it and those within, say, 10 years of \nretirement. We all know we have to do this. We all know, if we do not \ndo this, we simply will not be able to accomplish what we need to, no \nmatter what else we do.\n  The real work is ahead. Congress must commit to address the root \ncauses of our problem and our debt. We have to make the difficult \nchoices necessary to restore economic growth and good-paying jobs for \nthe American people. That is where tax reform comes in.\n  On a bipartisan basis, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, a Democrat, and \nmyself have joined together to put together a comprehensive tax reform \nbill. I give Senator Judd Gregg credit for the 2 years he spent with \nSenator Wyden putting this together. Senator Wyden and I worked \ntogether for the last 7 months, making additional changes and \nimprovements to that product. If we are going to have a growth \ncomponent to grow our way--through a more prosperous economy--out of \nthe debt problem we have, that has to include not only spending cuts, \nbut it has to include real tax reform.\n  Those special interests out there that are receiving exemptions and \nspecial breaks, credits, subsidies--those are going to have to be \nclosed out on a rational basis. We can retain some of the legitimate \ndeductions, such as mortgage interest and charitable deductions, but \nmost have to be eliminated. Those funds and revenues generated from \nelimination of those special interests have to be used to reduce rates \nto make our businesses more competitive, to give them a rate that is \ncompetitive with businesses around the world.\n  We are literally at the highest tax rate of all 36 of our worldwide \ncompetitors. That has to be adjusted. In doing so, we can stimulate our \neconomy to grow, and we can bring in revenue on the basis of that \ngrowth. More companies will be making more money and therefore paying \nmore taxes and more people will be at work and getting paychecks and \ntherefore contributing what they are not contributing now.\n  Past tax reform efforts, on a comprehensive basis, have proven the \nbest stimulus we can provide for an economy and the best thing we can \ndo to get an economy thriving and moving again is getting people back \nto work. So entitlement reform--absolutely necessary to preserve those \nprograms for future retirees and benefits that current retirees are \nreceiving--and tax reform to move our economy forward need to be the \ncore of what this special 12-member committee deals with and \nrecommends.\n  My litmus test for this next tranche is that there be a commitment to \nmove forward in these two critical areas that will have more impact on \nour future than anything else we do or have done so far to date.\n  I know we have committed, through this bill that just passed, to take \nup, debate, and vote on a balanced budget amendment. Clearly, if we \nwant to ensure and guarantee the future solvency of our country and the \nfuture confidence of our citizens, we need to impose upon the \nConstitution an amendment that balances the budget or we will find \nourselves back in this situation as the propensity of Congress to spend \nand not say no to anyone will continue. It seems to be almost part of \nwho we are. It is so hard to say no to someone. It is easier now, \nfirst, because we don't have the money and, second, we have expanded \nthis government beyond its ability to fulfill its responsibilities \ncorrectly.\n  The work is ahead. We have to address the root causes. My sleeves are \nrolled up. I will continue to push forward to rein in spending. I will \ncontinue to work to reform the Tax Code so businesses can provide more \njobs and be more competitive. I will not back away from addressing the \nneed for entitlement reform. We need to restructure those programs to \nkeep them from becoming bankrupt and denying important retirement \nbenefits for our citizens.\n  Now is the time for us in the Congress, whether we voted for this \nbill or against this bill--I am not criticizing anyone who voted for it \nbecause many of those believed it is the first of many steps. It was \nnot adequate, in my opinion, but at least it was a first step. I do not \nbelieve we should be criticizing those who made that decision.\n  It also addressed the question of default. I did not support default, \nwhich is why I suggested a short-term plan. I believed this initial \nbill being presented to us was woefully inadequate for what we need to \ndo right now to send the right signals that we are on a serious path to \nreform. I was willing to allow for a debt increase of a limited period \nof time, 6 to 8 weeks, cancel our recess, work to find a better \nsolution that could achieve more support and gain confidence in the \ninvestment industry that we have taken a serious step forward.\n  That obviously did not go forward. But, nevertheless, when we return \nfrom recess, all of us, whether we voted yes or no, must make a \ncommitment to engage, plunge into the problem, to do whatever is \nnecessary--not political necessary, whatever is necessary for the \nfuture of our country. That is our challenge, and I hope we will rise \nto that challenge.\n  I have not given up on our ability to respond to the will of the \npeople and to respond to the crisis we face. So, yea or\n\n[[Page S5230]]\n\nnay, let's all agree to come back with a focus on where we need to go, \nwhat we need to do, and the courage to make the tough choices for the \nfuture.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is my pleasure but also a sad moment for \nmembers of the Foreign Relations Committee to take this time to \ncelebrate the service of and also to salute the retirement of one of \nthe Senate's great staffers: Ed Levine.\n  Ed is retiring this week after a remarkable 35 years of service to \nthe Senate--a lot longer than most Senators get to serve and that most \nstaff up here have the courage to hang in there and serve.\n  In his decades of service, Ed has provided wise and perceptive \ncounsel to two committees, to many Members, and most recently to the \nForeign Relations Committee. His deep knowledge of foreign policy and \nhis remarkable sense of this institution are truly going to be missed \nand I mean missed enormously.\n  He grew up and he went to school here in Washington, DC, before he \nheaded off to Berkeley and then later to Yale. When he was a young man \nhere in this community, he used to ride the streetcar down to Georgia \nAvenue, where he would watch the Senators play at Griffith Stadium. For \nthose who are too young to remember, there actually was a baseball team \ncalled the Senators once upon a time. He did not watch folks here \nplaying at Griffith Stadium. But when the Washington Senators left for \ngood to become the Texas Rangers, I have to reckon that Ed just decided \nthat the U.S. Senators were the only game left in town, and he has been \nhere ever since.\n  He first came to the Senate in 1976. He joined the Select Committee \non Intelligence back then--literally right after it was established. It \nwas a historic moment. Those who remember their history of the 1970s \nremember that was a time of great consternation about the covert \nactivities of the CIA. The activities and the oversight of the CIA \nbecame a major national issue and concern. So it was a historic moment \nwhen the Senate was reasserting its constitutional responsibility to \nprovide oversight.\n  Ed spent the next 20 years overseeing some of the Nation's most \nsensitive programs and some of its most closely guarded secrets. He was \ntrusted with some of the most secret information of our country because \nhe never had anything but the interests of our country and the security \nof the Nation foremost in his mind.\n  I think that is also borne out in the fact that through the course of \nhis career, he worked for Members of both sides of the aisle while he \nwas on the Intelligence Committee. He served on that committee as the \npersonal representative of Republican Senator Clifford Case and then \nRepublican Senator David Durenberger, and then later for Democratic \nSenators Howard Metzenbaum and Chuck Robb. His work for the \nIntelligence Committee exemplified a standard of public service that \nputs the fulfillment of the Senate's constitutional duties above any \nother partisan concerns.\n  For him, there never was a party issue, Republican or Democrat, or an \nideological issue, liberal or conservative. It was: What are the best \ninterests of the United States of America and how do we protect its \nsecurity? He has applied that very same approach to his work on the \nForeign Relations Committee, where I have had the privilege of watching \nhim work over the course of the 26 years I have been here.\n  He worked mostly previously for now-Vice President Biden. A few days \nago, we held a business meeting at the Foreign Relations Committee, and \nit was characteristic of Ed's diligence in representing the interests \nof country above party that Senator Lugar, the ranking member of the \ncommittee, and who has served with him for a long time, took time to \nacknowledge his service and to note how constructively he had worked \nwith the Republican counterparts on the committee over these many \nyears.\n  We saw that in large measure last year when we considered the New \nSTART treaty, in which Ed played an integral role. You know, I might \nmention to colleagues, when Vice President Biden was Senator Biden and \nchairman of the committee, he coined a nickname for Ed. He called him \n``Fast Eddie.'' And the irony of that for all of us who know him is \nthat Ed does not do ``fast.'' He is one of the most careful and \ndeliberate thinkers on our staff, and that is one of the things people \nvalued in him the most. It was never a hip shot. It was always based on \nthinking, research, experience, and knowledge.\n  His knowledge of arms control, I may say, is encyclopedic. During the \nNew START debate, we had a war room set up one floor below this in the \nForeign Relations Committee room, with dozens of experts from the \nvarious departments of our government, and stacks of briefing books, \nand instant computer linkage to the State Department, to the Defense \nDepartment, Intelligence, and so forth, but often when we had a \nquestion, all we had to do was turn to Ed and he would know the answer \nfrom right up here in his head, from his experience.\n  That is not surprising, given how many treaties Ed has helped this \nbody to consider during his career. He worked on the INF Treaty, on the \nSTART I treaty, on the START II treaty, on the Chemical Weapons \nConvention, on the Convention on Conventional Weapons.\n  I went up to him a moment ago. I saw he was wearing a tie with a \nsword being beaten into plowshares, and he reminded me that came from \nthe mutual and balanced force reduction treaty, which he said was the \nonly thing they could agree on, but he is proudly wearing it today.\n  What all of this adds up to is that Ed spent a great chunk of his \nlife doing his best to help the Senate protect our Nation from the most \ndangerous weapons that ever existed. He did it with such \nprofessionalism, even, I might add, when faced with personal loss, as \nwhen his father died last year right during the consideration of the \ntreaty, but it did not stop Ed from doing his duty.\n  All of his Senate service is a real testament to his character. That \nhe earned the respect from the Members he served and the staff he \nworked with is a testament to his great skill and knowledge. And that \nhe has done so for so many years is a testament to his sense of public \ncitizenship and his love of country.\n  So, Ed, we thank you, all the Members of the Senate, for your \nservice. We will miss you in the Senate. I wish you personally the best \nin all of your future endeavors.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5230-2", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5230-S5233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BUDGET CONTROL ACT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we just passed legislation that would \nraise the debt ceiling. Part of that was an effort to reverse the debt \ntrajectory we are on, but it can only be called, at best, a first step. \nWe can all agree on that.\n  Indeed, there is an article in the Financial Times, written by \nProfessors Rogoff and Reinhart, who wrote a book that has gotten a \ngreat deal of attention and is widely respected, describing and \nanalyzing sovereign debt and countries that have gone bankrupt around \nthe world. They commented that much of what occurred in our debate \noccurred in those other nations. The other nations scramble around when \nthe pressure is on with something like a debt ceiling, and they don't \nreally change anything significantly, but they meet the crisis and tell \neverybody everything is OK.\n  They say in this article in the Financial Times that everything is \nnot OK. Indeed, the debt will increase over the\n\n[[Page S5231]]\n\nnext 10 years by approximately $13 trillion, and this package would \nreduce the increase in our debt by $2.1 trillion to $2.4 trillion. That \nis not much.\n  In addition to that, Larry Lindsey, a former economic adviser to \nPresident Bush, has done some analysis of the Congressional Budget \nOffice score of what the budget would look like over 10 years. He \npoints out that they were predicting nearly 3 percent growth the first \nand second quarter of this year.\n  So now we have re-analyzed first quarter growth. Economic growth \nwasn't 3 percent, it was 2.4 percent. And the second quarter initially \nwas scored at 1.3--not 3 percent or 2.7 but 1.3 percent. Dr. Lindsey \nsaid that loss in GDP alone will mean less economic growth, less tax \nrevenue for the government, and over 10 years it puts the government on \na trajectory to lose $750 billion--it would collect $750 billion less, \nwhich is about one-third of the savings that were to occur in the bill. \nDr. Lindsey says the second, third, and fourth quarters of this year \nwill also be well below that. We may be looking at, in this year alone, \nenough decline in GDP to wipe out half--maybe more--of the savings \nestimated in the bill we just passed.\n  I wanted to point out that I believe many in Congress and in the \nSenate are in denial about how serious the debt threat is and that we \nare too often, as Rogoff and Reinhart noted, saying the same things \nother nations said before their economic crises hit. Indeed, the name \nof their book, ``This Time Is Different,'' refers to what government \nleaders said in those countries--those other countries that went into \ndefault and into debt crises--up until the last minute. They were \nsaying: We have it under control. It is not so bad. This time, they \nsay, it is different.\n  Immediately, there was a crisis, which resulted in a loss of \nconfidence, and they had a serious problem--similar to when people lost \nconfidence in the housing market several years ago, which helped put us \nin this recession.\n  This is worrisome. We are not facing a little problem; we are facing \na problem that will require our steadfast attention for a decade to get \nthis country on the right course.\n  I note that the President had a press conference today. In a way, it \nrejected everything we have been talking about in this debate. It \nreally did not talk about the nature of the crisis as Rogoff and \nReinhart described. He didn't tell the American people that the real \nproblem is spending that is surging out of control. He didn't say we \ncan't continue, as a nation, borrowing 42 cents of every dollar we \nspend or that we can't continue spending $3.7 trillion when we take in \n$2.2 trillion. He did not talk to us honestly about that. He did not \nsend a signal; he has not sounded the alarm. Therefore, I think a lot \nof people--even some in Congress and some outside of Congress--sort of \nthink it must not be so bad. The President hasn't told us it is.\n  More and more people are expressing concerns. There is a growing \nunease nationwide, as demonstrated in consumer confidence and business \ninvestment, and in some bad manufacturing numbers we received \nyesterday. So things are not looking good. We have to be honest with \nourselves that this is a difficult time.\n  He did, however, make repeated statements in his press conference \nabout raising taxes. I don't think that is a good thing to do when the \neconomy is in a fix the way it is. He flatly--and erroneously, I \nbelieve--stated that you can't balance the budget with spending cuts. \nWell, you certainly can. You can argue that you would rather have tax \nincreases and fewer spending cuts, but we can and must balance our \nbudget. It can be done with spending reductions. Quite a number of \nplans are out there proposing to do just that.\n  The President continues to talk as if the problem was the debt \nceiling, but the debt ceiling is really a signal that we have spent too \nmuch, and we borrowed all Congress has allowed the President to borrow, \nand you can't borrow any more unless Congress agrees to raise the debt \nceiling. But that is not the problem. The problem, as Rogoff and \nReinhart said, is our debt. That is the real problem. It is not going \nto be easy to fix. I wish it was. If we work together as a nation, we \ncan do it. This country can rise to meet the challenge. I am totally \nconvinced of that.\n  The President said:\n\n       And since you can't close the deficits with just spending \n     cuts, we'll need a balanced approach.\n\n  That means we need to balance a cut with tax increases. That is what \nthat means.\n  He went on to say:\n\n       We can't make it tougher for young people to go to college \n     or ask seniors to pay more for health care.\n\n  But at some point, when you don't have the money, we might not be \nable to be as generous as we were just a few years ago when we were in \nbetter financial condition. Isn't that common sense? What do you mean \nyou can't make any changes in how we do business? We are going to have \nto make changes in how we do business.\n  He goes on to talk about investments, as he has often done. This is a \nquote from the press conference:\n\n       Yet, it also allows us to keep making key investments in \n     things like education and research. . . .\n\n  Continuing to make investments in education? Does that mean we will \ncontinue our current level in education and that we will try not to cut \nit if we have to make reductions in spending? Is that what the \nPresident means? No.\n  Just last week we saw the spectacle of the Secretary of Education \nappearing before the Senate Appropriations Committee asking for a 13.5-\npercent increase in education funding. Also last week, the President \ntalked about investments--more, more, more--including 13.5 percent more \nfor education. You know, 90 percent of education is funded by States, \ncities, and counties anyway. It is not the Federal Government. It is \nnot our primary role and never has been. We only provide approximately \n10 percent of the money that gets spent on education in America.\n  We can't have double-digit increases when we are borrowing 42 cents \nof every dollar. Every penny of that increase will be borrowed money--\nevery penny. Doesn't common sense tell us we might not be able to \nincrease spending this year even if we would like to?\n  I point out that before the Budget Committee, on which I am the \nranking Republican, we had the Secretary of Energy testify that he \nwanted a 9.5-percent increase for the Department of Energy--the \nDepartment that does more to block energy than create energy. The State \nDepartment was asking for 10.5 percent increase in the President's \nbudget, the President's request to us. The Department of Transportation \nwas to get a 60-percent increase in spending in the President's Budget. \nLast year, it was about $40 billion.\n  I note that this year, interest on our debt will be $240 billion.\n  I say to my colleagues that we are not dealing with reality. \nAmericans know--maybe they are lucky enough to have two wage earners in \nthe family when one loses their job, but do they not change the way \nthey do business? Do they just think they can continue to spend twice \nas much as their income as if they were both still working? People \ndon't do that. All over, Americans are making tough decisions. No \nwonder they are upset at us for pursuing this idea that we don't have \nto make any changes in what we do. It is very, very distressing to me.\n  The President said this about employment:\n\n       That's part of the reason that people are so frustrated \n     with what's been going on in this town. In the last few \n     months, the economy has already had to absorb an earthquake \n     in Japan, the economic headwinds coming from Europe, the Arab \n     spring, and the [increases] in oil prices, all of which have \n     been very challenging to the recovery. But these are things \n     we couldn't control.\n\n  I don't know that those are the big problems here. Rising oil prices \nare. Today, oil prices are just about double--a little more--than what \nthey were when President Obama took office. We have shut down new \nexploration in the gulf, and we are blocking the production of natural \ngas and shale formations, which has so much promise for us. We are \ndoing a lot of things to drive up the cost of energy.\n  Then he goes on to say this, which is surprising. He is the one who \nsaid the crisis was so large, it was a national problem.\n\n       Our economy didn't need Washington to come along with a \n     manufactured crisis to make things worse.\n\n  We had a serious debate over what to do about the debt ceiling that \nwe have\n\n[[Page S5232]]\n\nreached, and Congress--the Republican House--yielded from $6 trillion \nin cuts over 10 years, as they proposed in their budget, to taking $1 \ntrillion in cuts up front as part of this debt deal. The President \nwanted less cuts than that, apparently, and that is not enough. Of \ncourse, it could be $2.4 trillion, if the committee functions \ncorrectly, and we hope it will.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order, Senators are limited to 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for an \nadditional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. What I wanted to point out is in this chart. It gives \nsome indication of how we are operating in the Senate and the Congress, \ndriven in substantial part by the President's desires. It is a chart \nshowing the growth in certain programs that are exempt from the \nautomatic cuts that would occur if a budget agreement is not reached as \npart of the legislation we just passed.\n  These are all programs that we like and wish we could continue to \nallow to grow every year. Unfortunately, we are not going to have the \nmoney to do that. We are going to have to deal with these programs and \nall spending--Defense and non-Defense programs, no doubt about it.\n  We have first over here the Civil Service Retirement and Disability \nFund. The average annual percentage increase of that fund's cost has \nbeen 4.9 percent. The average annual increase in that fund each year--\n2005 through 2010--was 4.9 percent. The average inflation rate during \nthis time was 2.5 percent. So that is about twice the inflation rate.\n  The next fund here--a fund all of us value--is the Military \nRetirement Fund. It has increased at the average annual rate of 5.4 \npercent. Inflation is 2.5. Medicaid--a program that is administered by \nStates but has recently been as much as 66 percent funded by the \nFederal Government--has been increasing at 8.5 percent each year.\n  I think most of us know the rule of seven, where if you have money in \nthe bank and it draws 7 percent interest, that money will double in 10 \nyears. So this means in about 8 or 9 years the entire Medicaid Program \nwill double at that kind of rate of increase. And, remember, inflation \nis 2.5 percent.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program--the CHIP program--has been \nincreasing at 9 percent a year, and the SNAP program--the food stamp \nprogram--has been increasing at 16.6 percent a year for the last 5 \nyears. It has been increasing at 16.6 percent.\n  So I ask, is this sustainable? We are borrowing 42 cents out of every \ndollar. The economy is not growing as much as we hoped and expected, \nand it is not going to bail us out of this so we can sustain these \nkinds of spending levels.\n  We look at all these programs we value--and we hate to talk about it; \nwe don't want to mention it--and the odd thing about the agreement that \nwas passed earlier today, at the insistence of our Democratic \ncolleagues, is that these programs would receive no reductions if an \nagreement to cut spending is not reached by the committee. Under the \nrule, if the committee can't reach an agreement, there will be \nautomatic across the board cuts, except it is not evenly cut across the \nboard because these programs are untouched. They are untouchable \nbecause our Democratic colleagues say we can't deal with them.\n  Well, it is time for us to look under the hood of the food stamps \nprogram, I have to tell you. How could it be increasing at 16.6 percent \na year for 5 years? How could that happen? Don't we need to examine it, \ntake a good look at it? We have had no hearings. We have done nothing \nthis year to confront the surging cost. And what about Medicaid and \nCHIP? Those are also surging. Maybe we could even save a little on some \nof those programs that are growing faster than inflation.\n  I would point out that the military is in line, under the bill that \npassed, if an agreement isn't reached, to take a 10-percent cut. That \nis from the baseline military budget. It does not include Iraq and \nAfghanistan, which are coming down and projected to come down \ndramatically.\n  Forgive me if I am a little bit taken aback here about our priorities \nand about the unwillingness of Congress to deal with out-of-control \nspending. That is a good deal of money we are talking about--the \nMedicaid Program at $270 billion a year. Food stamps have more than \ndoubled. It is now $78 billion a year. By comparison, Alabama's general \nfund budget is about $2 billion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair. I ask unanimous consent for 1 \nadditional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. As I notice no one else is here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is here.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Oh, I am sorry. I didn't see that. Well, I should long \nago have yielded the floor, because he has something worthwhile to say, \nI am sure.\n  I close by saying we are not dealing honestly with the crisis we are \nin. The President is in denial. He is not looking the American people \nin the eye and telling us what a serious fix we are in, or challenging \nus all to deal with the reality that we are going to have to change the \nway we do business. I hate to say it, but I believe that it is true. We \nhave to do better.\n  I thank the Chair and I would be pleased to yield the floor to one of \nour more talented, insightful new Members, Senator Rubio of Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                         SPENDING AND DEFICITS\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. I thank my colleague from Alabama. He does a phenomenal \njob always in outlining the economic realities. I enjoyed listening, \nand I could have sat here longer. According to some, I may be one of \nthe last speakers today, so I don't want to keep the Senate open any \nlonger than it should be. We have done a lot of work here over the last \nfew days.\n  I went back and forth over whether I wanted to speak, because I think \nalmost everything that can be said has been said regarding the events \nof the last few days. But I did ultimately want to share my thoughts \nfor a moment as we head into the August recess, as they call it here in \nWashington, and many of us here in the Senate will be returning to our \nhome States to explain to the people we represent what we did or did \nnot do in the last few days.\n  I will start by pointing out that our Republic is an amazing thing. \nAs heated as the rhetoric may have been over the last few days, I think \nall of us should stop for a moment and understand that all around the \nworld there are countries that solve the problems we solved through \ndebate with civil war and conflict, armed and otherwise. Our Republic \nis amazing. It isn't always pretty. Quite frankly, more often than not, \nit is very messy. But it has withstood 230-some-odd years of pressures \nand choices, and it continues to do so. Even if ultimately what it \ngives us is not always solutions to our problems, we are blessed to \nhave it.\n  I would remind many, such as like myself, who were elected in the \nlast election cycle, tightly embracing the principles of our \nConstitution, that our Constitution is not just a set of words that \noutline our principles. It gives us a system of government. It gives us \nthis Republic. This Republic is valid, and it matters even when the \npeople who are running it may not be people with whom you agree. We \nshould always remember that. What we have here is special and unique, \nand we should embrace it and be thankful to our God each night that we \nhave the opportunity and the blessing of living in a nation such as \nthis.\n  Moving aside from that, however, the facts still remain that this \ncoming month, and every month to come, more or less, this government \nwill spend $300 billion a month. That is a lot of money. It is more \nthan any government has ever spent in the history of man. And $180 \nbillion of that $300 billion is money we collect from the people of our \ncountry through taxes and fees and other ways. But we borrow $120 \nbillion a month to pay our $300 billion a month bill. That is too much \nmoney. That is too much money for Republicans, it is too much money for \nDemocrats. It is too much money. Although we should be happy that \ntomorrow and in the days to come, we are not facing a default and an \ninability to meet our bills, the truth is--an undeniable one that I\n\n[[Page S5233]]\n\ndon't think anyone here would disagree with me when I say it--we can't \nkeep borrowing $120 billion every month or more, because the point and \nthe day will come when the people who lend us that money will stop \nlending us that money. If we keep doing this for long, we will one day \nreach a day in this country where we will face a debt crisis, but it \nwon't be because of the debt limit or because of gridlock in \nWashington. It will be because folks are no longer willing to buy \nAmerica's debt because they seriously doubt our ability to pay it back.\n  That is not hyperbole. It is not an exaggeration. It is a \nmathematical, indisputable fact that no Member of either party would \ndispute. There is general agreement on this. And there is general \nagreement the only way to solve this problem is a combination of two \nthings: No. 1, this government needs to generate more revenue; and No. \n2, this government needs to restrict its growth and spending. Because \nas bad as the $300 billion a month looks, it only gets worse from here \non out, in ways I don't have time to explain in the next 10 minutes. \nSuffice it to say our economy isn't growing. It is not producing enough \nrevenue moving forward. Meanwhile, all the programs we fund are about \nto explode in their growth because more people than ever are going to \nretire, they will live longer than they have ever lived, and the math \ndoesn't add up. These are facts. No one disputes that.\n  The debate in Washington is not about that fact but about how do we \nsolve it. How do we generate more money and reduce the spending at the \nsame time? I will tell you this is not a debate we will solve in the \nmonth of August. In fact, I believe it will characterize the rest of \nthis Congress, the 2012 elections, and the years that lie ahead. The \ndivision on how to solve it goes to the root of the dispute we face in \nAmerica between two very different visions of America's future--by the \nway, one not more or less patriotic than the other. Patriotic, country-\nloving Americans can disagree on their future vision of what kind of \ncountry we should be. But this division--this difference of opinion--is \nthe reason why even though this bill passed, this debate we have had is \ngoing to move forward for some time to come.\n  On the one hand, there are those who believe the job of government is \nto deliver us economic justice--which basically means an economy where \neveryone does well or as well as possibly can be done. There is another \ngroup who believes in the concept of economic opportunity--where it is \nnot the government's job to guarantee an outcome but to guarantee the \nopportunity to fulfill your dreams and hopes. One is not more moral \nthan the other. They are two very different visions of the role of \ngovernment in America. But it lies at the heart of the debate we are \nhaving as a nation. Washington is divided because America is divided on \nthis point, so we have to decide what every generation of America \nbefore us has decided, and that is what kind of government do we want \nand what role do we want it to have in America's future.\n  The fault lines emerge from that. The solutions emerge from those two \nvisions. For those who want to see economic justice, their solution is \nto raise more taxes. They believe there are some in America who make \ntoo much money and should pay more in taxes. They believe our \ngovernment programs can stimulate economic growth. They believe that \nperhaps America no longer needs to fund or can no longer afford to fund \nour national defense and our military at certain levels.\n  Another group believes that, in fact, our revenues should come not \nfrom more taxes but from more taxpayers; that what we need is more \npeople being employed, more businesses being created that will pursue \ntax reform, that will pursue regulatory reform. But, ultimately, we \nlook for more revenue for government from economic growth, not from \ngrowth in taxes. We believe the private sector creates these jobs, not \ngovernment and not politicians; that jobs in America are created when \neveryday people from all walks of life start a business or expand an \nexisting business.\n  I believe and we believe in a safety net program, programs that exist \nto help those who cannot help themselves, and to help those who have \ntried but failed to stand up and try again but not safety net programs \nthat function as a way of life, and believe that America's national \ndefense and our role in the world with the strongest military that man \nhas ever known is still indispensable.\n  These are two very different visions of America and two very \ndifferent types of solutions. Ultimately, we may find that between \nthese two points there may not be a middle ground; that, in fact, as a \nnation and as a people we must decide what we want the role of \ngovernment to be in America moving forward.\n  Let me close by saying this has been a unique week for me in a couple \nways. One has been, of course, the debate that has happened. The other \nis my family has been here for the better part of a week, young \nchildren. We had an opportunity today after the vote to walk around a \nlittle bit and look at all the statues and the monuments that pay \ntribute to our heritage as a people. It reminds us that we are not the \nfirst Americans who have been asked to choose what kind of country we \nwant or what role of government we want in our country. It is a choice \nevery generation before us has had to make.\n  Even in this Chamber, as I stand here, you can sit back and absorb \nthe history of some of the extraordinary debates that took place on \nthis very floor, debates that went to the core and to the heart of what \nkind of country we wanted to be moving forward. The voices of those \nancients call to us even now to remind us that every generation of \nAmerica has been called to choose clearly what kind of country they \nwant moving forward. And that debate will continue. It will define the \nservice of this Congress and for most of us who are here now. I pray we \nchoose wisely. I look forward to the months that lie ahead that we will \nchoose and make the right choice for our future and for our people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Minnesota \nbeing willing to stay in the chair for a few more minutes before I have \nto preside so I can take this time to express my concern about what has \nhappened with the failure to reauthorize the Federal Aviation \nAdministration.\n  The authorization for that administration has expired, and it has led \nto a partial shutdown of that agency and to 4,000 workers being placed \non unpaid furlough. A number of those workers are from New Hampshire. \nWhile I know all of us here are glad we were able to come together to \nreach a bipartisan agreement on raising the debt ceiling and avoiding a \nfinancial crisis, I am deeply disappointed that bipartisanship has \nfailed us when it comes to reauthorizing the FAA.\n  I understand the House may head home for recess today and for the \nrest of August, stranding 4,000 FAA workers and as many as 70,000--that \nis right, 70,000--airport construction workers around the country who \nare out of work until we can get an agreement. So let me review for a \nminute how we got here.\n  Since the FAA's authorization expired in 2007, Congress has passed 20 \nshort-term extensions of the FAA. All of those bills, every single one \nof them, were clean bills intended to keep the FAA running while \nCongress decided how to deal with the complicated policy issues of a \nlong-term reauthorization. Unfortunately, the 21st time around--that is \nthe time that we are in--the House decided it was no longer important \nto keep the FAA operating, and 4,000 people are out of work while the \nHouse of Representatives may head home for recess.\n  I appreciate that there are some significant differences between the \ntwo long-term FAA authorization bills\n\n[[Page S5234]]\n\npassed by the House and the Senate, the most controversial of which \ncentered around the ruling by the National Mediation Board on \nunionization rules. But that is why Chairman Rockefeller and Ranking \nMember Hutchison appointed Members to a conference committee where the \nHouse and Senate could work out our policy differences. So far, the \nHouse has refused to appoint conferees. Instead, they have decided to \nstop negotiating and, unfortunately, to play politics with 4,000 FAA \nworkers and their families.\n  Right now the FAA has been shut down for 11 days and as long as that \nshutdown continues, the government will continue to lose $200 million a \nweek, about $30 million a day, that would pay for airport maintenance \nand safety and for the replacement of our country's outdated air \ntraffic control system. If the shutdown continues through the August \nrecess, we are going to lose over $1 billion in revenue that could be \nused to upgrade our air transportation system. That is waste of the \nworst kind, and it makes our deficit problems worse at a time when \neverybody says they are so focused on the deficits.\n  Every day the shutdown continues has a very real, very painful impact \non people all around the country who have been furloughed. I hope the \nHouse, in leaving for recess, has left open the opportunity to continue \nto address this dispute and resolve it in a way that will bring \neverybody back to work.\n  The FAA has issued stop-work orders for 241 airport construction \nprojects worth nearly $11 billion that support 70,000 jobs. Again, \nthese are real people who are being forced to make real sacrifices.\n  In my State of New Hampshire, a $16 million project to rebuild the \nrunway of Boire Field in Nashua will be delayed if we don't pass an \nextension. Boire Field is the busiest general aviation airport in New \nEngland, and breaking ground this fall on the runway reconstruction \nproject would have created 50 jobs. Instead, because of this delay, \nconstruction likely won't begin until spring and those 50 people are \ngoing to have to wait, something that shouldn't have to happen. The \ntragedy is they won't have jobs, not because they don't have the skills \nor that the project isn't needed but because the House is playing \npolitics with the FAA. Forty-two employees at the FAA's air traffic \ncontrol center in Nashua have been furloughed and this shutdown is \ntaking a terrible toll on them. I want to tell you about one, Steve \nFinnerty from Bedford.\n  I talked to Steve earlier today. He is a civil engineer and he has \nworked for the FAA for the last 15 years. He is the sole breadwinner \nfor his family of five. He has a young daughter and a pair of 1-year-\nold twins who are struggling with medical issues. He has already lost \nnearly 2 weeks of pay, and he is not sure that he is going to get that \npay back even when he does go back to work. He is concerned, \nunderstandably, about how he is going to pay his mortgage and his \ndoctor bills and the grocery bills and all the other needs his family \nhas. Now he is facing the possibility of an entire month without pay.\n  There are thousands of people all across the country who are stuck in \nthe same circumstance who want to get back to work, who we need to get \nback to work. We need them to get back to work so they can pay their \nmortgages and their children's college tuitions and their medical \nbills. We need them to get back to work so they can continue to build a \nGPS-based air traffic control system like every other industrialized \ncountry has. We need to get this economy moving again. That means we \nneed to be serious about our responsibilities here in Washington. Let's \npass a clean extension of the FAA. Let's get these people back to work, \nand let's go about the business of rebuilding a modern air traffic \ncontrol system like we should have in the United States.\n  I yield the floor, and I would suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to recognize the \nimportant contributions of a special Floridian for his unrelenting \ndetermination to protect one of our Nation's unique natural resources; \nthat is, the Florida Everglades. He is a prestigious attorney. He is a \ncommanding litigator. This individual, Thom Rumberger, has dedicated \nmuch of his personal and professional life to advancing the restoration \nand protection of the river of grass. His brilliant, incisive mind, his \ncreativity, and his fearlessness combine to make Thom one of Florida's \nmost influential Everglades leaders.\n  He has been a man proud to serve his country and his community. It \ngoes back to the time he interrupted his college career to volunteer \nfor the Marines. He served in the Korean war. Over the course of his \nlife, he has continued this service as a dedicated public servant, a \nrespected judge, and a respected prosecutor.\n  In his family, he is a dedicated father and grandfather who obviously \nhas always found great happiness with that ever-expanding family of \nhis, and the relentless efforts he undertakes to preserve Florida's \nnatural heritage is a legacy gift, certainly to his family and to his \ncolleagues but to all us Floridians--indeed, to us as residents of \nplanet Earth.\n  He served 2 years in the Marines, earned his degree with honors, a \nlaw degree, and was associate editor of the Florida Law Review. He \nbecame the youngest circuit judge serving in a district in central \nFlorida. He was the Brevard County solicitor, he was special assistant \nState attorney, he was county attorney for Seminole County, he was \nAssistant to the Florida Governor, and he served as a member of the \nFlorida Land Sales Board.\n  I knew Thom back in those early days in Melbourne and Brevard County \nas we were experiencing the explosive growth, at the time, of the \nNation's attempt to catch up with the Soviet Union since they had \nsurprised us by putting up Sputnik and then later beat us into orbit \nwith Yuri Gagarin before we could get Alan Shepard into suborbit and \nthen John Glenn into orbit.\n  Those were exciting times. I will never forget I heard Thom, as we \nwere sitting around one day, saying I am impatient having to sleep \nbecause I am so excited about getting up in the morning and going out \nand doing all these things. Of course, I just listed all those \nimportant positions of public service.\n  Along the way, Thom became a good friend of another Brevard County \nman, George Barley. Actually, I think George was from Orange County. \nGeorge was married to Mary. Both of them dedicated their lives to \nrestoration of the Everglades. George and Mary established the \nEverglades Trust and the Everglades Foundation and then, when George \ndied a very tragic death back in 1995, Thom joined with Mary to make \nsure George Barley's dream of a restored Everglades became a reality.\n  Thom was an active member of the Republican Party, but I can tell you \nthat in the friendship between us, partisan membership did not mean \nanything. We had a personal friendship, and one could often see that as \nhe engaged in public service, but that was especially so when it came \nto the preservation and the restoration of the Everglades. His success \nextends, other than his community and country service, to a career in \nprivate practice. He was one of the founding partners of Rumberger, \nKirk & Caldwell, and under Thom's leadership the firm's modest \nbeginnings were quickly surpassed as it moved to all kinds of new legal \nsuccesses. Today, that firm includes 75 trial attorneys in 5 offices \nall across several southern States. Of course, he has been listed as \none of Florida's superlawyers every year for the last several years.\n  Legend has it Thom Rumberger once convinced a Federal judge to allow \na real automobile in the courtroom as\n\n[[Page S5235]]\n\nevidence. He convinced the judge to have a window in the courtroom \nenlarged--in a historic courthouse, nonetheless--to accommodate a crane \nthat lifted the car right into the courtroom. He has been known \nthroughout his life for his infectious sense of humor, often referred \nto--because he had so many different careers--somewhat derisively as a \ncareer chameleon. Thom worked his way all the way through college, all \nthe way up to these present successes.\n  Let me tell you what he did to support himself and to pay for his \ncollege education. A lot of people do not remember Ross Allen's Reptile \nInstitute in Ocala, at Silver Springs. Guess what the main attraction \nwas: the eastern diamondback rattlesnake. Thom's job, at which he \nearned enough money to put himself through school, was to milk those \nrattlesnakes.\n  Clearly, that is a tourist attraction because that is a fascinating \nthing, to see that snake coiled up, ready to strike, and they stick a \nstick down there and pin his head and then reach down behind the head \nand pick him up and they have this 6-foot rattlesnake. But there is a \npurpose to this other than charming their guests. They squeeze behind \nthat head and the mouth opens and those two fangs come out and they put \nthose fangs down into a glass and they milk that rattlesnake. The \npoisonous venom that was then collected and stored becomes the basis \nfor the anti-snake bite serum that has saved so many lives. I remember \none time he actually went back after he had been judge and prosecutor \nand all these things. He told me he was invited to come back to the \nRoss Allen Reptile Institute. He said when he walked into that cage \nwith all those rattlesnakes, the snakes looked so big. He didn't \nremember the snakes looking that big when he was a college kid earning \nhis way through college. Thom promises that it was right there in that \nsnakepit that he learned the skills of public speaking and working with \nthe public because he had to explain how he was milking the rattlesnake \nto all of the guests who were there, and obviously he had their \nattention.\n\n  He even enjoyed a brief acting career as a stuntman for the movie \n``The Creature of the Black Lagoon.'' Remember that one that scared the \nwits out of all of us when we were children, ``The Creature of the \nBlack Lagoon''? He has had quite a few varieties in his life.\n  He has generously committed himself to public service. Beyond the \npositions I have already mentioned, he was appointed to Florida's \nFederal Judicial Advisory Commission and the Board of Supervisors of \nthe Spaceport Florida Authority. Presently, he is chairman of the \nEverglades Trust. He has served as chairman of the Collins Center for \nPublic Policy, which was named after one of our great Governors of \nFlorida--former Governor, now deceased--Gov. Leroy Collins. He has been \na member of the Board of Visitors of Florida State College of Law and \nBoard of Trustees for the Law Center Association of the University of \nFlorida. He has represented about every environmental organization, \nincluding Save the Manatee, the Everglades Trust, and Save Our \nEverglades. He has been the lead counsel for the Everglades Foundation \nwell past two decades.\n  Notably, Thom was instrumental in the passage of two Everglades-\nrelated Florida constitutional amendments, the Federal Comprehensive \nEverglades Restoration Plan, and in obtaining several billion dollars \nin funding for Everglades restoration. That has been one of my primary \nduties as the senior Senator from Florida, and I have worked with him \nover the years on this Everglades restoration.\n  He has been primarily responsible for Florida's acquisition of one of \nour natural resources, the 75,000-acre Babcock Ranch in the southwest \npart of Florida, which now provides necessary corridors for wildlife, \nespecially the endangered Florida panther. In the late 1980s, Thom \nworked to implement some of the first manatee protection laws.\n  Throughout his four decades in public service, he has demonstrated \nthe importance of looking out for the common good.\n  I just did an interview today in the aftermath of our vote on what \nstarted out to be highly contentious on what we were going to resolve \nin debt reduction and deficit reduction with the pending guillotine \nhanging over our head, the default that would occur at 12 tonight, \nwhich has now been averted. The reporter who was asking me the \nquestions in the interview said: Well, why is it that everything is so \ncontentious and people are all so wrapped up in themselves that they \ntalk past each other and they are only looking out for their own \ninterests and don't respect the other fellow's point of view?\n  Thom Rumberger represents that kind of person who always respected \nthe other person's point of view. So when it was time to draw up the \nsolution to whatever the problem was, then the parties could come \ntogether and find that consensus. That has been sorely lacking in \nWashington and around this country. We saw a shining little moment \nyesterday and today--yesterday in the House of Representatives with an \noverwhelming vote and today on the floor of the Senate with an \noverwhelming vote--to start the process of deficit reduction. It is \nfolks such as Thom Rumberger whom we ought to be looking to in how they \nhave demonstrated their community service instead of what we have seen \nplay out over the last several months.\n  Thanks to the selfless commitment of folks such as Thom, America's \nEverglades will be restored for the benefit of future generations. It \nis not just Florida, it is America that owes Thom a great deal of \ngratitude. My bride of 40 years, Grace, who has known Thom almost as \nlong as I have, joins me in thanking him and his wife Debbie for their \nmany contributions to Florida's treasured landscapes.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to a young woman \nfrom Owensboro, KY, who lost her life while in service to her country. \nU.S. Navy LCDR Jane Lanham Tafoya was assigned to the Naval Branch \nHealth Clinic in Manama, Bahrain, in support of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. She died from non-combat related causes on September 19, 2006. \nShe was 43 years old.\n  For her heroic service, Lieutenant Commander Tafoya received many \nawards, medals and decorations, including the Navy and Marine Corps \nCommendation Medal with Gold Star, the Navy and Marine Corps \nAchievement Medal, the National Defense Service Medal with Bronze Star, \nthe Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Armed Forces Reserve \nMedal, and the Navy Pistol Shot Medal with Sharpshooter Device.\n  Lieutenant Commander Tafoya had served for 18 years in the Navy. \nBefore her assignment in Bahrain she had served at the Naval Hospital \nand Naval Reserve Center in Philadelphia, the Bureau of Medicine here \nin Washington, DC, the Naval Hospital at Camp Lejeune, NC, aboard the \nU.S.S. Ronald Reagan, and at Navy Environmental Preventive Medicine \nUnit 2 in Norfolk, VA. In Bahrain she was working as an industrial \nhygienist.\n  Born in Daviess County, KY, Jane was a graduate of Owensboro Catholic \nHigh School, Murray State University and Temple University. Her mother, \nAvis Lanham, remembers Jane as a smart student who enjoyed learning, \ngot all As in school, and loved to read. In high school Jane played \nsoftball and volleyball, and she was on the Murray State intramural \nbowling team.\n  Avis says that Jane loved to travel, and she loved being in the Navy. \nAnd Jane ``could always see the good in people,'' Avis says of her \ndaughter. Whenever something negative was said about a person, Jane \nwould just respond with, ``Well, nobody's perfect.''\n  We are thinking of Jane's loved ones today, including her husband \nJohn Tafoya; her daughters Rachel and Natalie Tafoya; her mother Avis \nLanham; her brother and sister-in-law Brad and Kathy; her sister and \nbrother-in-law\n\n[[Page S5236]]\n\nPhyllis and Kenny; and many other beloved family members and friends. \nJane was preceded in death by her father Marvin Bill Lanham.\n  Today the Senate honors this loving wife, mother, and daughter for \nher long career of service. And we salute the sacrifice that LCDR Jane \nLanham Tafoya made, half a world away from her native Owensboro home, \non behalf of a very grateful Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5236-1", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               H.R. 2715\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with \nmy colleagues, Senators Durbin and Pryor, over the passage of H.R. \n2715, a bill that passed on the House suspension calendar by a vote of \n421-2 and the Senate by unanimous consent. Due to the fact that this \nbill bypassed regular order and failed to receive consideration in the \nCommerce Committee, I believe it is important to explain our intent in \npassing this bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am frustrated that the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission has taken too long to promulgate rules required by the \nConsumer Product Safety Improvement Act, CPSIA, including the rules on \nthird-party testing obligations and the component part testing rule. I \ndid not oppose H.R. 2715, because it does not delay or impede the \nCommission's ability to implement those rules--although it may place \nsome increased costs on the Commission due to actions required as a \nresult of new CPSC mandates and authorities--and I urge the Commission \nto complete its work expeditiously.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I share the Senator's concerns about the CPSC's \ndelay in promulgating its regulations in accordance with the mandates \nof CPSIA. While I sympathize with the CPSC over its resource \nconstraints, the Commission must accelerate its efforts and complete \nthe important regulations required under CPSIA. The provisions in \nsection 2 of H.R. 2715 were not intended to delay or stop the \nCommission's current rulemaking under section 102 (d)(2) of the \nConsumer Product Safety Improvement Act to implement the critical \nprovision related to the third-party testing of children's products. I \nfully expect the Commission to go forward with these important \nrulemakings with no disruption from the passage of this bill.\n  Given the limited resources of the Commission and recognizing the \nlength of time it has taken to implement the provisions of the Consumer \nProduct Safety Improvement Act, it is intended that most of H.R. 2715's \nnew mandates on the CPSC are not rulemakings. Some of the new \nauthority, such as the functional purpose exemption and the authority \nto restrict the scope of the used products exemption, are subject to a \nnotice and hearing requirement, but not to a rulemaking. Others, such \nas the creation of a new public registry for small batch manufacturers, \ncan be implemented without notice and comment or even a hearing. As \nsuch, the Commission should act to effectuate the new mandates of this \nbill in a most expeditious manner.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I also share the Senator's view that nothing in H.R. 2715 \nis intended to delay the Commission's rulemaking with respect to third \nparty testing and believe that Commission should conclude its testing \nrulemakings in the next 2 months. I supported H.R. 2715 because it made \nminor modifications to an important consumer product safety law and \nsupported implementation of important aspect of the Consumer Product \nSafety Improvement Act such as the consumer product database. This bill \nwill require the CPSC to extend the deadline for posting reports on \ndefective products by 5 days if a business asserts that the information \nin the report is not accurate. However, this change does not alter the \nfact that the Commission still must post the report in the database \nafter those 5 days even if it is still reviewing the merits of the \ncomplaint.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5236-2", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5236-S5237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             COTE D'IVOIRE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I spoke about the situation in Cote \nd'Ivoire just last Friday and pointed out that the person responsible \nfor the chaos and killing--a rebel named Alassane Ouattara--met last \nFriday with President Obama in our Nation's White House. I said then \nand say now again that this was an unwise and grossly misguided \ndecision by Obama. It is in fact an outrage that our President would \nwelcome, with open arms, a potential war criminal who is responsible \nfor the death of at least 3,000 people and displacement of half a \nmillion refugees in the African country of Cote d'Ivoire. Ouattara is \nan illegitimate usurper who has scandalized Cote d'Ivoire's electoral \nsystem, and unlawfully ousted the democratically elected incumbent \nPresident Laurent Gbagbo.\n  Now the Associated Press reports just yesterday that the violence in \nCote d'Ivoire remains uncontrolled. The title of the AP story says is \nall. It reads: ``Warlords in Ivory Coast continue to reign, national \nreconciliation difficult 3 months later.''\n  The AP story highlights the just released Amnesty International \nreport that I spoke about last week that pointed out that ``Ouattara's \nrebel Army continues to carry out violence and intimidation against \nethnicities perceived as having supported President Gbagbo, and that \nalmost 700,000 people remain in refugee camps for displaced people in \nthe country's remote far west.''\n  The AP highlights the fact that although Ouattara is telling the \nworld that he is seeking reconciliation; in fact Ouattara is allowing \n``a pervading culture of criminality to continue.''\n  For example, in the financial capital of Abidjan, warlords have taken \nover parts of the city and death squads roam the streets looking for \nGbagbo supporters. In addition, they are committing ``armed robberies, \nkidnapping and killings almost daily'' without any sign of ceasing. At \nthe very least rebel leader Ouattara has no control over his rebel \ntroops, which in the recent past committed atrocities and massacres on \ntheir march to Abidjan, and at the worst he is tacitly approving their \nactions by not intervening.\n  AP also reports that ``even the French Embassy sent a security \nmessage to its citizens warning that `incidents of unequal gravity are \nstill being reported.' '' And this is 3 months after the French \nthemselves militarily overthrew President Gbagbo and installed \nOuattara! The French are indeed now reaping what they have sown.\n  I point out again that Amnesty International alleges that these \nforces under Ouattara's command are continuing to engage in \n``documented crimes under international law and human rights violations \nand abuses, including extrajudicial executions and other unlawful \nkillings, rape and other sexual violence, torture, other ill-treatment \nand arbitrary arrest and detention; as well as the consequences of high \nlevels of displacement, pervasive insecurity, and intentional \ndestruction of homes and other buildings not justified by military \nnecessity.''\n  The AP story summarizes the current situation by quoting the \nconclusion of the Amnesty International report which states that ``if \n[this situation is] not addressed quickly, the very serious \nconsequences of the recent wave of insecurity and displacement will \nhave further repercussions during the coming years and may fuel growing \ndiscontent and unrest, undermining efforts to promote reconciliation in \na country torn apart by a decade of ethnic strife and violent \nconflict.''\n  This is my ninth time speaking on the Senate floor about the ongoing \nbloodbath of unspeakable acts of violence that are occurring in the \nonce beautiful and prosperous country of Cote d'Ivoire. I again call \nfor the intervention of the African Union--and not the French--to bring \nan end to the violence there, and call for new elections that will this \ntime prevent the electoral fraud by Ouattara that allowed him to claim \nvictory. I also call for the release of President Gbagbo and his wife \nSimone who are being held incommunicado by Ouattara, and either allow \nPresident Gbagbo to seek reelection for President or be allowed to go \ninto exile. I have been in communication with a sub-Saharan African \ncountry which has agreed to grant asylum to the Gbagbos, and I call \nupon our State Department to facilitate such a move as it did for \nformer Haitian President Duvalier in 1986.\n  The killing must stop. My recommendations are a path to stop the \nkilling.\n\n[[Page S5237]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5237-1", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Staff Sergeant Lex L. Lewis\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today \nto honor the life and heroic service of SSG Lex L. Lewis. Staff \nSergeant Lewis died on July 15, 2011, when his dismounted patrol \nreceived small arms fire in Farah Province, Afghanistan. Staff Sergeant \nLewis was serving in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. He was 40 \nyears old.\n  Staff Sergeant Lewis was assigned to B Troop, 1st Squadron, 10th \nCavalry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division, Fort Carson, CO. Friends and \nfamily members remember Staff Sergeant Lewis as a soldier who truly \nloved the Army. His mother Betty said, ``He just liked being a soldier \n. . . this is what he wanted to do.''\n  After graduating from high school, Staff Sergeant Lewis joined the \nNavy and was first stationed in Japan. He joined the Army later, in \n1999, and bravely served three combat tours--two in Iraq and one in \nAfghanistan.\n  Staff Sergeant Lewis's commanders and company-mates alike remember \nhim as a soldier who exemplifies the proudest traditions of the U.S. \nArmy. They often came to him for counsel and advice during difficult \ntimes. His decorations include the Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart, two \nArmy Commendation Medals, five Army Achievement Medals, and two Army \nGood Conduct Medals.\n  Mark Twain once said, ``The fear of death follows from the fear of \nlife. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.'' Staff \nSergeant Lewis's service was in keeping with this sentiment--by \nselflessly putting country first, he lived life to the fullest. He \nlived with a sense of the highest honorable purpose.\n  Mr. President, I stand with Colorado and people nationwide in \nprofound gratitude for Staff Sergeant Lewis's tremendous sacrifice. He \nserved proudly and honorably in Iraq and Afghanistan when his country \nneeded him most. We are humbled by his service and his sacrifice. I ask \nmy colleagues to join me in extending heartfelt sympathy and \ncondolences to Staff Sergeant Lewis's family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5237-2", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5237-S5239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      OSCE PARLIAMENTARY ASSEMBLY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to submit for the Record a report \non the activity of a congressional delegation I led to Belgrade, \nSerbia, from July 7 to 10, to represent the United States at the 20th \nAnnual Session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly. I did so in my \ncapacity as cochairman of the U.S. Helsinki Commission.\n  I was joined by our colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Shaheen, \nwho also traveled to Sarajevo, Bosnia. Senator Shaheen is also a member \nof the Helsinki Commission. Our colleague from Alaska, Senator Begich, \nalso participated on the delegation but was in Dubrovnik, Croatia, as \npart of the official U.S. Delegation to the 6th annual Croatian Summit \nof regional political leaders and European officials.\n  As the report details, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization \nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe, or OSCE PA, has been an \nexcellent opportunity for the U.S. Congress to engage our European \nfriends and allies, and to make clear to less friendly countries that \nour ties to the continent will not be diminished.\n  U.S. engagement also provides a means for us to advance U.S. \ninterests by encouraging Europe to focus more on policy issues of \nconcern to us, from democratic shortcomings within Europe such as \nBelarus to the new challenges and opportunities coming from North \nAfrica and the Middle East and other parts of the world.\n  The revised Senate schedule made us miss the opening days of the \nBelgrade meeting, but we made up for that with an intensive schedule \nfrom Friday to Sunday. All three U.S. resolutions and most of our \ndelegation's amendments to resolutions were adopted, including a \nresolution I submitted on political transition in the Mediterranean \nregion and amendments welcoming the arrest of at-large war crimes \nindictee Ratko Mladic and calling for Turkey to allow the Ecumenical \nPatriarch to open a theological school in Halki.\n  Senator Shaheen and I also used the opportunity of visiting Belgrade \nto encourage progress in Serbia's democratic transition. We met with \nPresident Tadic as well as the Speaker of the Serbian National \nAssembly, the chief negotiator in the technical talks on Kosovo-related \nissues, representatives of civil society, and of Serbia's Romani and \nJewish communities.\n  We came away from our visit impressed with the progress Serbia has \nmade thus far. While there are lingering manifestations of the extreme \nand violent nationalism from the Milosevic era of the 1990s, I believe \nthere is a genuine commitment to overcome them. We should support those \nin and out of government in Serbia who turn this commitment into \naction.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe Report to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nReport of the US. Congressional Delegation (CoDel Cardin) to Belgrade, \nSerbia; Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina; and Dubrovnik, Croatia July 7-10, \n                                  2011\n\n       Senator Benjamin L. Cardin (D-MD), Helsinki Commission Co-\n     Chairman, and fellow Senator and Commissioner Jeanne Shaheen \n     (D-NH) traveled to the 20th Annual Session of the \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \n     Parliamentary Assembly (OSCE PA), held in Belgrade, Serbia, \n     from July 6-10, 2011. The senators were able to do this \n     despite a US. congressional schedule that precluded House \n     Members from traveling to the meeting and curtailed Senate \n     attendance to only three of the session's five days. Three \n     resolutions and more than one dozen amendments to various \n     resolutions initiated by the United States Delegation were \n     nevertheless considered and passed by the Assembly. Senator \n     Shaheen was also able to make a one-day visit to neighboring \n     Bosnia-Herzegovina, and both Senators were able to link with \n     their colleague, Senator Mark Begich (D-AK), attending the \n     Croatian Summit of regional political leaders held in \n     Dubrovnik, Croatia.\n\n\n                              the osce pa\n\n       The Parliamentary Assembly was created within the framework \n     of the OSCE as an independent, consultative body consisting \n     of 320 parliamentarians from the 56 participating States, \n     stretching from Central Asia and Russia across Europe and \n     including the United States and Canada. Annual Sessions are \n     the chief venue for debating international issues and voting \n     on a declaration addressing human rights, democratic \n     development, rule-of-law, economic, environmental and \n     security concerns among the participating States and the \n     international community.\n       The Parliamentary Assembly adopts its declaration by \n     majority voting for resolutions coming from three committees \n     dealing with political/security, economic/environmental and \n     democracy/human rights issues respectively, in addition to \n     other resolutions introduced by delegations to supplement \n     these texts. Following the amendment of these resolutions \n     also by majority voting, this generally allows for \n     considerable verbiage to be accepted each year but also for \n     franker language addressing controversial or new issues to be \n     included than the OSCE itself can achieve on the basis of \n     consensus among the 56 participating States. The heavy focus \n     of OSCE diplomats on issues like trafficking in persons and \n     combating intolerance in society is rooted in initiatives \n     originally undertaken by the parliamentarians in the \n     Assembly.\n       Having the largest delegation with 17 members, the United \n     States historically has played a key role in OSCE PA \n     proceedings, and there has been robust congressional \n     participation since the Assembly's inception two decades ago. \n     This engagement is reassuring to friends and allies in Europe \n     while ensuring that issues of interest or concern to U.S. \n     foreign policy are raised and discussed. In addition to \n     representing the United States as delegates, members of the \n     Helsinki Commission have served as OSCE PA special \n     representatives on specific issues of concern, committee \n     officers, vice presidents and the Assembly president.\n\n\n                      The Twentieth Annual Session\n\n       This year's Annual Session was hosted by the National \n     Assembly of Serbia and held in Belgrade's Sava Center, the \n     1977-78 venue for the first follow-up meeting of the \n     diplomatic process that was initiated by the 1975 signing of \n     the Helsinki Final Act and is the OSCE today. During various \n     interventions at the session, note was made not only of the \n     vast changes in Europe since that time but also in Serbia, \n     which was then a constituent republic of the former \n     Yugoslavia but is today an independent state making progress \n     in democratic development after overcoming more than a decade \n     of authoritarian rule and extreme nationalist sentiment.\n       A meeting of the Standing Committee--composed of OSCE PA \n     officers plus the heads of all delegations--met prior to the \n     opening of the Annual Session. Chaired by OSCE PA President \n     Petros Efthymiou of Greece, the committee heard numerous \n     reports on the activities of the past year, endorsed a budget \n     that has remained frozen for a fourth consecutive fiscal \n     year, and approved for consideration at the Annual Session 25 \n     of the 26\n\n[[Page S5238]]\n\n     items introduced by various delegations to supplement the \n     committee resolutions. Only an Italian draft on Asbestos \n     Contamination failed to achieve a 2/3 vote approving its \n     consideration.\n       With approximately 230 parliamentarians in attendance, the \n     opening plenary of the Annual Session featured a welcome by \n     Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Cvetkovic and National Assembly \n     Speaker Slavica Djukic-Dejanovic and reports by the OSCE \n     Chair-in Office, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Audronius \n     Azubalis, and the newly appointed OSCE Secretary General, \n     Lamberto Zannier of Italy. Zannier welcomed the OSCE PA's \n     interest in fostering closer cooperation with the OSCE \n     Permanent Council in Vienna and committed himself to \n     facilitating greater PA engagement through his leadership of \n     the OSCE Secretariat and coordination with its institutions.\n       In his own remarks, PA President Efthymiou noted the \n     ``spirit of Helsinki'' which developed at the Belgrade \n     meeting more than three decades ago and lamented the crisis \n     in which the OSCE finds itself today. He called for \n     significant changes to the operations of the Vienna-based \n     organization to make it more effective and relevant in \n     addressing the political and security issues of today. The \n     theme for the Annual Session--Strengthening the OSCE'S \n     Effectiveness and Efficiency, a New Start after the Astana \n     Summit--was chosen to address this matter in light of last \n     December's summit meeting in Astana, Kazakhstan, which had \n     heightened the political attention paid to the OSCE's work.\n       The following three days were devoted to committee \n     consideration and amendment of the three resolutions and 21 \n     supplementary items, and plenary consideration of the four \n     additional supplementary items. Two additional resolutions \n     were defeated in the process. The first was another \n     initiative of an Italian delegate focusing on crimes causing \n     serious social alarm, which lacked significant support. The \n     second originated with the Belgian delegation on enlarging \n     the OSCE's Mediterranean Partners for Cooperation to include \n     Lebanon and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). The \n     latter was lost in a close vote after being heavily debated \n     by those who advocate wider engagement in the long-term and \n     those who questioned the timing of taking such an initiative. \n     A number of parliamentarians felt it inappropriate for the \n     OSCE to solicit interest by the Lebanese Government and the \n     PNA while they are both under leadership that does not \n     embrace OSCE principles. Some of the resolutions which did \n     pass examined the deplorable human rights situation in \n     Belarus, the unresolved conflict in Moldova, gender issues in \n     the OSCE and the participating States, national minority \n     concerns including the plight of Roma, cyber security, as \n     well as combating violent extremism, transnational organized \n     crime, and human trafficking for labor and organs.\n\n\n                      U.S. Initiatives in Belgrade\n\n       Despite its small size, the U.S. Delegation remained very \n     active in the deliberations, introducing three resolutions of \n     its own, working closely with the delegation of the \n     Netherlands on a fourth, and suggesting over a dozen \n     amendments to various texts. All four of these resolutions \n     were adopted, as were all but two of the U.S. amendments.\n       Co-Chairman Cardin's major initiative was a resolution on \n     Mediterranean Political Transition, which directs the OSCE \n     and its participating States to make their expertise in \n     building democratic institutions available to Mediterranean \n     Partner States: Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Morocco and \n     Tunisia. The resolution specifically encouraged the interim \n     governments of Egypt and Tunisia to make a formal request for \n     OSCE support following their consultations with the OSCE \n     Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR). \n     It also called for an OSCE civil society forum to be hosted \n     by a Mediterranean Partner State later this year. The Senator \n     collaborated with the head of the Spanish delegation on \n     numerous additional amendments to demonstrate the real \n     priority this should be for the organization, and the \n     initiative received widespread praise among the delegates. \n     ``We have all been inspired by the movements for freedom and \n     change sweeping across the Middle East and North Africa,'' \n     Senator Cardin noted while introducing the resolution, ``and \n     we support the citizens of the countries in the region as \n     they demand respect for their basic human rights, economic \n     opportunity, and open and responsive government . . . The \n     OSCE and our Parliamentary Assembly have substantial capacity \n     to assist our Mediterranean Partners . . . We also must \n     condemn in the strongest terms the unbridled violence \n     unleashed by the governments of Libya and Syria against their \n     own citizens.''\n       Though not in attendance, Commission Chairman Christopher \n     H. Smith (R-NJ) introduced two resolutions for the Assembly's \n     consideration that also were adopted. The first dealt with \n     Combating Labor Trafficking in Supply Chains, urging \n     governments to ensure that all goods they procure are free \n     from raw materials and finished products produced by \n     trafficked labor and to press corporations to independently \n     verify that their supply chains are free of exploitation. The \n     resolution also sought to raise consumer awareness about \n     industries more likely to use trafficked labor. Two \n     strengthening amendments authored by Co-Chairman Cardin were \n     adopted. The amendments welcomed a recent OSCE meeting on the \n     issue and urged diplomats to pass a declaration on the matter \n     during a meeting of OSCE foreign ministers later this year.\n       The second Smith Resolution focused on International \n     Parental Child Abductions and passed without amendment. Its \n     core focus was to press OSCE States to become parties to the \n     1983 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International \n     Child Abduction and to implement its provisions. The \n     resolution also urged that parental child abduction be \n     considered at the 2011 OSCE Ministerial Council in Vilnius \n     this December.\n       Ranking House Commissioner Alcee L. Hastings (D-FL), who \n     serves as the Parliamentary Assembly's Special Representative \n     on Mediterranean Affairs, collaborated with OSCE PA Special \n     Representative on Migration Kathleen Ferrier of the \n     Netherlands on countering racism and xenophobia in Europe \n     with measures to foster inclusion of affected communities. \n     Noting that 2011 has been designated the International Year \n     for People of African Descent, the resolution included a \n     focus on racial bias against citizens and migrants of African \n     descent, and called for specific measures to be taken by OSCE \n     institutions to address reported increases of racial and \n     ethnic discrimination in the OSCE region. The resolution also \n     emphasized the importance of integrating ethnic minorities \n     into economic and political life through capacity building \n     partnerships between the public and private sector. The \n     resolution passed with widespread support.\n       Supported by Senator Shaheen, Co-Chairman Cardin covered \n     several smaller and more detailed issues with amendments, \n     such as one welcoming the arrest in Serbia of at-large war \n     crimes indictee Ratko Mladic, another urging Turkey to allow \n     the reopening of the Ecumenical Orthodox Patriarchate's \n     Theological School of Halki without condition or further \n     delay, and another supporting greater transparency in the \n     energy sector. Working with a German delegate, Senator Cardin \n     also succeeded in removing language from a Serbian resolution \n     which politicized the issue of investigating an organ-\n     trafficking case that originated in neighboring Kosovo during \n     the 1999 conflict. Serbian officials lobbied the PA Assembly \n     directly and through the media to accept the resolution's \n     call for the United Nations to conduct the investigation, \n     contrary to the efforts being undertaken by the U.S. and EU \n     to proceed through an already established EU rule-of-law \n     mission. The U.S.-supported amendment was successful in \n     designating the EU entity and the U.N. Mission in Kosovo as \n     responsible for the investigation. There was insufficient \n     support, however, for a U.S. amendment welcoming EU efforts \n     thus far.\n       During the course of debate, Co-Chairman Cardin also \n     suggested granting Mediterranean Partner countries a greater \n     ability to participate in OSCE PA sessions through changes to \n     Assembly rules. He also highlighted U.S. policy on cyber \n     security in the vigorous debate of a resolution which in some \n     respects diverged from the U.S. approach. In his capacity as \n     an OSCE Vice President, the Senator, as an urgent matter, \n     also supported consideration of a resolution focused on the \n     lack of transparency in the OSCE during the recent selection \n     of a new Secretary General. Language on this matter was also \n     included in the final declaration.\n\n\n          Selecting the OSCE PA Leadership for the Coming Year\n\n       In addition to hearing closing comments from Serbian \n     Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic and adopting the final \n     declaration, the parliamentarians attending the Annual \n     Session voted for contested seats in the Assembly's \n     leadership. President Efthymiou was unopposed, as was \n     Treasurer Roberto Battelli of Slovenia, and both were re-\n     elected by acclamation. In a race among six candidates for \n     three of the nine Vice President positions, Wolfgang \n     Grossruck of Austria was re-elected, with Walburga Habsburg-\n     Douglas of Sweden and Tonino Picula of Croatia elected for \n     the first time. Senator Cardin has one additional year in his \n     term as Vice President and is not eligible for another re-\n     election.\n       Committee officers saw more dramatic changes, with only one \n     officer retaining his position as committee chair. Others \n     moved to higher positions within the committees or ran for \n     the three Vice President seats. Unfortunately for the U.S. \n     Delegation, Representative Robert B. Aderholt (R-AL), a \n     Helsinki Commissioner, did not win his second re-election bid \n     as a committee Vice Chair due to his inability to be in \n     Belgrade. He was unsuccessful in fighting off a challenge by \n     a French delegate who entered the race at the last minute.\n\n\n                        Side Events in Belgrade\n\n       In addition to the formal proceedings, OSCE PA meetings \n     often offer the possibility for delegations to sponsor side-\n     events on issues needing additional attention. A luncheon \n     focusing on gender issues in the OSCE is held annually, \n     including in Belgrade. Non-governmental organizations may \n     also hold their own events and invite the delegates to \n     participate. In Belgrade, a coalition held a session on \n     continued use of torture in OSCE States, with a focus \n     particularly on the situation in Kyrgyzstan following the \n     ethnic violence in 2009. Delegation-sponsored events in \n     Belgrade included one on human rights abuses in Belarus, one \n     on cases of alleged trafficking in human organs in Kosovo and \n     elsewhere, and one featuring a film on two Jewish sisters in \n     Serbia who escaped the Holocaust during World War II. With \n     Senator Shaheen and U.S. Ambassador to Serbia Mary Burce \n     Warlick in attendance, Senator\n\n[[Page S5239]]\n\n     Cardin participated in the latter event with opening comments \n     on the work of the Vienna-based organization Centropa, which \n     prepared the -film. Delegation staff attended most of the \n     other side events as well.\n\n\n  Bilateral Meetings with Serbia and a Side-Trip to Bosnia-Herzegovina\n\n       While the delegation travelled to Belgrade principally to \n     represent the United States at the OSCE PA Annual Session, \n     the Helsinki Commission leadership regularly uses this travel \n     to discuss bilateral issues with the host country and to \n     visit nearby countries of concern. In Serbia, the delegation \n     met with President Boris Tadic, National Assembly Speaker \n     Slavica Djukic-Dejanovic, and chief negotiator for technical \n     talks on Kosovo Boris Stefanovic. Ambassador Warlick briefed \n     the Senators and attended the meetings.\n       Evident in the bilateral meetings was the progress Serbia \n     was making in its internal political transition and \n     attainment of European integration. Serbian officials made \n     clear they were committed to overcoming the nationalist \n     legacy of the Milosevic era, strengthening Serbia's \n     democratic institutions and encouraging greater respect for \n     the rule of law. While there are clear differences between \n     the United States and Serbia regarding Kosovo, the officials \n     asked for an expression of congressional support for \n     agreements being reached in technical talks between Belgrade \n     and Pristina that were of direct benefit to the people and \n     brought an increased sense of regional stability, as well. \n     They also stressed their support for Bosnia-Herzegovina's \n     unity and territorial integrity. The U.S. Delegation welcomed \n     Serbia's approach and encouraged Belgrade to curtail the \n     activity of parallel Serbian institutions in northern Kosovo \n     which are currently the greatest source of instability in the \n     region. The message was amplified throughout the region by a \n     VOA interview conducted with Senator Cardin.\n       The U.S. Delegation also met with representatives of \n     Serbia's civil society and Romani communities. The Senators \n     expressed support for civil society efforts to promote \n     greater tolerance in society, to monitor the extent to which \n     laws and policies adopted were actually implemented, and to \n     tackle issues--such as corruption--that impede prosperity. \n     They learned that the Romani communities in Serbia, similar \n     to those in other countries, have difficulties in obtaining \n     adequate housing, education for their children and personal \n     documentation necessary to exercise their rights and \n     privileges as citizens. In a meeting with Serbia's Chief \n     Rabbi, which also included the President of the Jewish \n     Federation of Serbia, the discussion focused on religious \n     tolerance in the region, cooperation with the other religious \n     groups in Belgrade, and property restitution legislation \n     pending in the Serbian parliament.\n       On July 9, Senator Shaheen left the proceedings of the OSCE \n     Parliamentary Assembly to make a one-day visit to neighboring \n     Bosnia-Herzegovina, where ethnically based political \n     differences continue to hamper government formation and the \n     political and economic reforms necessary for progress on \n     European integration. Visiting two days prior to the 16th \n     anniversary of the genocide at Srebrenica, the Senator met \n     with Kathryne Bomberger of the International Commission on \n     Missing Persons and stood next to Bosniak member of the \n     collective state presidency Bakir Izetbegovic and U.S. \n     Ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina Patrick S. Moon to pay her \n     respects as the procession of 613 victims to be buried during \n     the July 11 Srebrenica memorial service passed by. She \n     expressed U.S. condolences to the families of those mourning \n     in a media interview that received wide and favorable \n     coverage.\n       Senator Shaheen also met with Social Democratic Party \n     Chairman Zlatko Lagumdzija and several officials at the \n     entity and local levels of government to discuss ways to \n     overcome the country's current political impasse and to find \n     a solution in particular on forming a state-level coalition \n     government. She also met with several women entrepreneurs and \n     leaders of nongovernmental organizations to discuss their \n     particular concerns and ability to have a positive impact in \n     an ethnically divided Bosnian society. From the international \n     presence, the Senator met with Head of the OSCE Mission Gary \n     Robbins and the Deputy High Representative Roderick Moore, \n     both from the United States. Senator Shaheen noted the \n     continued commitment of the United States to political \n     stability in Bosnia-Herzegovina and its progress toward \n     increasing integration into European institutions, indicating \n     that that engagement was supported both by the Administration \n     and Congress. In a media interview, she stressed that the \n     political and civil society leaders of Bosnia-Herzegovina \n     need to work together and across ethnic lines if the country \n     is to accede to the European Union or receive IMF funding.\n\n\n                          The Croatian Summit\n\n       At the conclusion of the OSCE PA Annual Session and prior \n     to their return to Washington, Senators Cardin and Shaheen \n     joined their colleague, Senator Begich, who was attending the \n     6th Croatian Summit of regional political leaders and \n     European officials in Dubrovnik, Croatia, as part of the \n     official U.S. Delegation led by Under Secretary of State for \n     Political Affairs William Burns. In his statement to the \n     summit and during meetings with various leaders, particularly \n     with Croatian officials, Senator Begich expressed his \n     appreciation of Croatia's performance as a NATO ally, \n     including its support for NATO operations in Afghanistan, and \n     encouraged Croatia to support neighboring Bosnia's stability \n     and prosperity. He also suggested ways Croatia could enhance \n     its business and investment climate.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       During the course of three days, the delegation led by \n     Senator Cardin was able to advance U.S. objectives at the \n     multilateral OSCE PA as well as the U.S. bilateral agenda \n     with Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. The curtailed \n     schedule precluded additional travel, including a planned \n     visit to Albania, but the Senators compensated with a level \n     of activity that indicated their commitment as well as that \n     of the U.S. Congress and the United States as a whole, to the \n     countries of the Western Balkans and to European security and \n     cooperation through the OSCE.\n       The OSCE Parliamentary Assembly continues to serve not only \n     as a venue for demonstrating the U.S. commitment to Europe, \n     but for advancing new ideas and issues that parliamentarians \n     can press their diplomatic counterparts in the OSCE to \n     incorporate into the organization's work. In the past, \n     Parliamentary Assembly efforts were responsible for the OSCE \n     undertaking action to combat human trafficking and counter \n     anti-Semitism and other forms of intolerance that help define \n     the OSCE today. With proper follow-up in capitals and at the \n     OSCE in Vienna, the recommendations adopted in the Belgrade \n     Declaration will hopefully provide the needed impetus to \n     activity that will keep the OSCE effective and relevant.\n       Meeting in Belgrade gave a greater-than-usual regional \n     dimension to this year's U.S. Delegation to the OSCE PA \n     Annual Session, the immediately preceding Annual Sessions \n     having been held in Oslo, Norway, and Vilnius, Lithuania. \n     Ethnic tensions and suspicions from a decade of wars in the \n     Western Balkans are still strong factors in the bilateral \n     relations of the countries visited by the congressional \n     delegation, and their economic growth has been negatively \n     affected not only by the larger international crisis but by \n     poor economic governance as well. At a time of both promise \n     and uncertainty, the reassurance of continued U.S. engagement \n     was welcomed by government officials, civil society \n     representatives and by the media that extensively covered the \n     delegation's activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5239-1", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5239-S5240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would like to briefly address S. 1458, \nthe intelligence authorization bill for fiscal year 2012, which has now \nbeen reported by the Select Committee on Intelligence. I know that the \nchair and vice chair of the committee, Senator Feinstein and Senator \nChambliss, along with their respective staff, have worked hard on this \nbill, and I support nearly every provision in it. However, I strongly \ndisagree with the decision to include a 3-year extension of the FISA \nAmendments Act of 2008 in this bill, and it is my intention to object \nto any request to pass this bill by unanimous consent. Consistent with \nmy own policy and Senate rules, I am announcing my intention to object \nby placing a notice in the Congressional Record.\n  As most of my colleagues remember, Congress passed the FISA \nAmendments Act in 2008 in an effort to give the government new \nauthorities to conduct surveillance of foreigners outside the United \nStates. The bill contained an expiration date of December 2012, and the \npurpose of this expiration date was to force Members of Congress to \ncome back in a few years and examine whether these new authorities had \nbeen interpreted and implemented as intended.\n  I believe that Congress has not yet adequately examined this issue \nand that there are important questions that need to be answered before \nthe FISA Amendments Act is given a long-term extension.\n  The central section of the FISA Amendments Act, the part that is now \nsection 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act itself, \nspecifically stated that it was intended to address foreigners outside \nthe United States, and it even required the Attorney General to develop \nprocedures designed to make sure that any individuals targeted with \nthis new authority are believed to be outside the United States. So one \nof the central questions that Congress needs to ask is, Are these \nprocedures working as intended? Are they keeping the communications of \nlaw-abiding Americans from being swept up under this authority that was \ndesigned to apply to foreigners?\n  I wanted to know the answer to this question, so Senator Udall of \nColorado and I wrote to the Director of National Intelligence if it was \npossible to count or estimate the number of people inside\n\n[[Page S5240]]\n\nthe United States whose communications had been reviewed under section \n702 of the FISA Amendments Act. The response we got was prompt and \ncandid. The response said ``it is not reasonably possible to identify \nthe number of people located in the United States whose communications \nmay have been reviewed under the authority'' of the FISA Amendments \nAct.\n  I should be clear that I do not plan to accept this response as a \nfinal answer. I understand that it may be difficult to come up with an \nexact count of the number of people in the United States whose \ncommunications have been reviewed, but I believe Congress at least \nneeds to obtain an estimate of this number so that people can \nunderstand the actual impact of the FISA Amendments Act on the privacy \nof law-abiding Americans.\n  During the markup of the intelligence authorization bill, Senator \nUdall of Colorado and I proposed an amendment that would have directed \nthe inspector general of the Department of Justice to review the \nimplementation of the FISA Amendments Act and attempt to estimate how \nmany people inside the United States have had their communications \nreviewed under this law since it was passed 3 years ago. Our amendment \nalso would have directed the inspector general to examine other \nimportant aspects of the FISA Amendments Act, including the problem of \nrecurring compliance violations, and report back to Congress within 1 \nyear.\n  I regret that the amendment that Senator Udall of Colorado and I \noffered was not adopted, but I obviously plan to keep trying to get \nmore information about the effects of this law. I hope that I will find \nout that no law-abiding Americans, or at least very few, have had their \ncommunications reviewed by government agencies as a result of this law, \nbut I believe that I have a responsibility to get concrete facts rather \nthan just hope that this is not the case. And I believe that it would \nbe not be responsible for the Senate to pass a multiyear extension of \nthe FISA Amendments Act until I and others who have concerns have had \nour questions answered.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to amend this bill, and \nI am hopeful that they will be willing to modify it to address the \nconcerns I have raised. In the meantime, I should be clear that it is \nmy intention to object to any request to pass the current version of S. \n1458 by unanimous consent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5240-1", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COMBATTING ILLEGAL GUN TRAFFICKING\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I speak today in support of a new Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, ATF, rule requiring \nfederally licensed firearm dealers in four Southwest border States to \nreport the sale of multiple semi-automatic assault rifles to the same \npurchaser. This narrowly tailored reporting requirement, similar to one \nalready in place for multiple handgun sales, will provide ATF with an \nimportant tool to combat straw purchases and the illegal trafficking of \nfirearms, including the supply of weapons to drug cartels in Mexico.\n  Under the rule, federally licensed dealers in California, Arizona, \nNew Mexico, and Texas must report to ATF the sale of multiple semi-\nautomatic rifles that have a caliber greater than .22 and accept \ndetachable magazines to the same person within 5 consecutive business \ndays. Weapons covered by the rule include AR-15s and AK-47s, military-\nstyle assault rifles favored by Mexican drug gangs. The rule focuses on \nsales in these four border states because they are the source of 75 \npercent of the firearms recovered and traced in drug-related crimes in \nMexico, according to an analysis of Department of Justice statistics by \nthe organization Mayors Against Illegal Guns. This rule allows ATF to \ncollect information on guns that are frequently trafficked and used in \ncrimes, improving in the Bureau's tracing efforts. Among other things, \ngun trace information can be used to identify potential trafficking \nnetworks and to link a suspect to a firearm in a criminal \ninvestigation.\n  Unfortunately, there are some who want to block ATF's ability to \nrequire this information, effectively hindering its efforts to combat \ngun trafficking and reduce violence along the U.S.-Mexico border. The \nNational Rifle Association and some Members of Congress have claimed \nthat ATF does not have the authority to implement the rule and that the \nrule would cause an unmanageable burden on law-abiding gun dealers. \nBoth of these claims are false. The Firearm Owners' Protection Act of \n1986, Public Law 99-308, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 923 (g)(5)(A), explicitly \nstates that each Federal firearm licensee shall, when requested by ATF, \nsubmit to the ATF any information required to be kept by that law, like \nthe name and address of a purchaser and a firearm's serial number, or \nsuch lesser information as ATF may request. Information on the sale of \nmultiple semi-automatic rifles is part of the record which firearm \ndealers are required to maintain.\n  The claim that ATF's new rule will unfairly burden firearm dealers is \nalso unfounded. ATF estimates that completing the form to report \nmultiple rifle sales will take 12 minutes for gun dealers, and \nsubstantially less time for those with computerized sales systems. I \ncannot imagine that the overwhelming majority of Federal firearm \nlicensees who are law-abiding will take offense to 12 minutes of work \nin the name of combating illegal trafficking and preventing violence.\n  The mandatory reporting of multiple sales of semi-automatic rifles to \nthe same person is a measured, common sense step to help combat illegal \nfirearm trafficking. The terrible drug cartel-related violence plaguing \nMexico and spilling north of the border into the United States \ncontinues to be fueled by weapons illegally trafficked from the \nAmerican Southwest. Again, I support ATF's new rule, and I urge my \ncolleagues in Congress to oppose any legislative efforts to block ATF's \nability to carry it out.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5240-2", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5240-S5241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO GENERAL JAMES E. CARTWRIGHT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to GEN \nJames E. Cartwright, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who \nwill retire tomorrow after 40 years of distinguished service to his \ncountry.\n  General Cartwright is one of America's most respected four-star \ngenerals. His leadership and dedication to the security of this country \nwill be sorely missed and I wish him all the best in his future \nendeavors.\n  On a personal note, I will miss the detailed briefings, insightful \ndiscussions, and honest assessments that I have come to expect from \nGeneral Cartwright.\n  Simply put, he has had a notable record of achievement throughout his \ncareer.\n  As head of the U.S. Strategic Command, STRATCOM, General Cartwright \nled the effort to develop new strategies to tackle cyber, nuclear \nproliferation, space, and missile defense issues.\n  He transformed Strategic Command from an organization largely \ndominated by its mission with respect to nuclear weapons and nuclear \ndoctrine to being the true center in the U.S. military for all \nstrategic issues.\n  Of special note was General Cartwright's interest and action on \ncybersecurity and the use of cyberspace. He saw this as a major \nemerging threat and responsibility of the Department, and put STRATCOM \non a footing to deal with cyber as a major strategic issue.\n  He distinguished himself as one of those special leaders who is able \nto foresee and understand the constantly evolving national security \nenvironment rather than getting stuck in the old ways of seeing the \nworld and doing things.\n  Based on his notable record of service, on June 28, 2007, President \nBush nominated General Cartwright to succeed ADM Edmund Giambastiani as \nVice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  General Cartwright was confirmed by the full Senate on August 3, 2007 \nand was sworn in on August 31 as the eighth Vice Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff. Recognizing his exceptional leadership, General \nCartwright was confirmed for a second term on July 31, 2009.\n  He has, not surprisingly, used his capacity as the second most senior \nmilitary officer in the Pentagon to make the Armed Forces a more \nstrategic and more nimble military.\n\n[[Page S5241]]\n\n  As the Vice Chairman, General Cartwright has helped guide the United \nStates through many pivotal moments in our history: notably, the end of \nthe military mission in Iraq, the implementation of a new strategy for \nthe war in Afghanistan, and securing ratification of the New START \nagreement with Russia which will reduce the number of deployed \nstrategic nuclear warheads by 30 percent.\n  I spoke with General Cartwright many times over the course of the \ntreaty negotiations, and during the Senate's debate that ultimately led \nto ratification and signing New START.\n  He never failed to provide me with his frank and honest assessment \nand I greatly appreciated his clear and persuasive support for the \ntreaty.\n  He recognized, as I do, that if we are to convince other nations to \nforgo acquiring nuclear weapons, it is imperative for the two nations \nthat possess more than 90 percent of these weapons to take meaningful \nsteps to reduce our stockpiles.\n  General Cartwright knows that lowering the number of nuclear weapons \nin the world and stopping their spread will enhance our national \nsecurity, not diminish it. And we will still maintain a robust arsenal \nfor our defense.\n  As he stated:\n\n       I think we have more than enough capacity and capability \n     for any threat that we see today or that might emerge in the \n     foreseeable future.\n\n  General Cartwright's commitment to providing his honest and blunt \nassessments go beyond nuclear forces and extend to all security threats \nfacing our nation, and the best way to prepare and respond to them, \neven when it was not popular to do so.\n  In his recent book, ``Obama's Wars,'' Bob Woodward describes General \nCartwright as committed to providing the President his candid advice. \nWoodward quotes General Cartwright as saying ``I'm just not in the \nbusiness of withholding options. I have an oath, and when asked for \nadvice I'm going to provide it.''\n  He certainly has come a long way.\n  General Cartwright grew up in Rockford, IL, and joined the Marine \nCorps in 1971.\n  After numerous operational assignments as both a naval flight officer \nand naval aviator, the pinnacle of his Marine Corps operational \naviation career came as the Commanding General of First Marine Aircraft \nWing in Okinawa, Japan, from 2000 to 2002.\n  After a tour with the Joint Staff, in 2004, General Cartwright became \nthe first Marine Corps general to lead the United States Strategic \nCommand, STRATCOM.\n  As always, the security and defense of our Nation has been his top \npriority. That, along with his commitment to the active, guard, and \nreserve members of the Armed Forces and their families, is probably his \ngreatest attribute and lasting impact.\n  I wish General Cartwright all the best as he retires from 40 years of \nservice to his country and, on behalf of the people of California and \nall Americans, I offer him my most sincere and heartfelt thanks and \ngratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5241-1", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            COLD REGIONS RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING LABORATORY\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 50th \nanniversary of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Research and \nDevelopment Center's Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory, \nCRREL. For half of a century, the men and women at CRREL have provided \noutstanding service to our military, our Nation, and our friends and \nallies around the world by advancing science and engineering and \napplying these disciplines to complex environments, materials, and \nprocesses in all seasons and climates.\n  CRREL's mission dates back to 1867, when the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers first began exploration and development of the newly acquired \nAlaskan territory. Formally established in 1961 under Army General \nOrder No. 3, CRREL merged the Snow, Ice and Permafrost Research \nEstablishment with the Arctic Construction and Frost Effects \nLaboratories, and continues to serve as one of seven laboratories under \nthe U.S. Army Corp of Engineers' Engineer Research and Development \nCenter, ERDC.\n  To complement its dedicated staff, CRREL operates some of the most \nadvanced and unique research facilities in the world. At its \nheadquarters in Hanover, NH, my home State, CRREL operates the 73,000 \nsquare foot Ice Engineering Facility, the 27,000 square foot Frost \nEffects Research Facility, as well as 24 separate low-temperature \nresearch cold rooms, capable of reaching temperatures down to \n-35 deg.C. Other CRREL facilities include the Corps of Engineers' \nRemote Sensing/Geographic Information Systems Center of Expertise, the \nCold Regions Science and Technology Information Analysis Center, as \nwell as a permafrost research tunnel and 133 acre permafrost research \ncenter, both located in Alaska.\n  As part of the ERDC, CRREL's distinguished service record includes \nbeing recognized as the Army's top research and development laboratory \n5 of the last 8 years and the last 3 consecutive years, a feat \nunmatched by any other Army laboratory. CRREL's scientists, engineers \nand staff continue the critical research that ensures that the men and \nwomen of our Armed Forces are the most capable and well prepared in the \nworld.\n  I along with the entire State of New Hampshire would like to \ncongratulate and honor the scientists, engineers and staff of CRREL for \ntheir honorable service to the Army, our Nation and our State. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in celebrating CRREL's 50 years of success and \nwishing them well as they work toward another 50 years of innovation \nand service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5241-2", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5241-S5242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               VIOLATIONS DURING THE SRI LANKAN CIVIL WAR\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, this past spring marked the 2-year \nanniversary of the end of Sri Lanka's civil war. After more than two \ndecades of fighting and estimated losses of far too many innocent \npeople, Sri Lankans now seek to build a peaceful future from their \nrecent violent past. The task will not be easy. Infrastructure must be \nrebuilt. Good governance must be established. Education, health care, \nand a thriving economy must be available for millions of citizens. And \nso, too, must there be accountability and investigation into alleged \nviolations and abuses of international human rights.\n  From July 1983 until May 2009, Sri Lanka's civil war claimed the \nlives of innocent civilians including children and women, seniors and \nstudents, many of whom may have fallen victim to violations of \ninternational human rights and humanitarian laws. The families of these \nvictims deserve to know the truth about their loved ones' deaths. They \nneed to know that those responsible for the atrocities and violations \nof basic human rights will be held accountable. This is the only way \nSri Lanka can come to grips with its past as it moves forward toward \nits future.\n  We have seen how accountability can lead to reconciliation for \nsocieties emerging from violent civil strife. South Africa and Northern \nIreland are just two recent examples.\n  The Report of the United Nations Secretary-General's Panel of Experts \non Accountability In Sri Lanka, released on March 31, 2011, found \n``credible allegations, which if proven, indicate that a wide range of \nserious violations of international humanitarian law and international \nhuman rights law was committed both by the Government of Sri Lanka and \nthe Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), some of which would amount \nto war crimes against humanity.''\n  This report further states that ``the conduct of the war represented \na grave assault on the entire regime of international law designed to \nprotect individual dignity during both war and peace.''\n  Under international law, parties responsible for serious violations \nof international humanitarian or human rights law must be held \naccountable.\n  In order to ensure that the Sri Lankan people receive the truth, an \nindependent international inquiry must be established to investigate \nthe credible reports of human rights abuses and humanitarian law \nviolations by the LTTE and the Government of Sri Lanka.\n  This position is shared by Amnesty International, and other \ninternational human rights organizations; the European Union; and the \npanel of experts who authored the U.N.'s Report on Accountability in \nSri Lanka.\n\n[[Page S5242]]\n\n  Ignoring and denying abuse and accountability delays the progress of \nnation building and the creation of the stable, multiethnic democracy \nit seeks.\n  A truly independent international investigation with credible \naccountability will give Sri Lanka the ability to reconcile its past \nand build a peaceful future. The people of Sri Lanka deserve to know \nthe truth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5242-1", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO HARRIET HAGEMAN\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, it is fitting that Harriet Hageman will \nbe inducted into the 2011 Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame. Harriet is \nknown across Wyoming and across our Nation as a stalwart promoter and \ndefender of agriculture. With this honor, she is following in the \nfootsteps of her father Jim Hageman, who was previously inducted in the \nAgriculture Hall of fame in 2002.\n  Harriet comes from a long history of agricultural producers. Her \ngreat grandfather homesteaded in Wyoming in 1879 and her parents bought \ntheir first ranch near Fort Laramie in 1961. Harriet grew up on the \nfamily's cattle ranches in the Fort Laramie area. Rather than pursuing \na career in agriculture, she earned a law degree from the University of \nWyoming. Yet she did not stray from the agriculture industry. Much of \nher legal practice has been focused on protecting agriculture's land, \nwater, and natural resources. She uses her Ag background coupled with \nher fine mind to effectively argue on behalf of Wyoming's ranchers and \nfarmers in courtrooms at all levels of the judiciary.\n  A few of her many accomplishments should be noted. Harriet was the \nlead attorney for the State of Wyoming in protecting its share of the \nNorth Platte River. She fought the USDA to protect Wyoming's access to \nnational forest lands. She successfully defended Wyoming's Open Range \nLaw before the Wyoming Supreme Court. Her clients include ranchers, \nfarmers, irrigation districts and grazing permitees. Harriet represents \nthem with a passion that can only come from love of agriculture.\n  I have had the honor of working with Harriet Hageman and have \nbenefitted from her wisdom. I would ask my colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating Harriet on this well-deserved honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5242-2", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO NIELS HANSEN\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, at Wyoming's State Fair, I will have the \nhonor of inducting Niels Hansen into the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of \nFame.\n  Forty-eight percent of Wyoming's 97,100 square miles are managed by \nthe Federal Government. Often, a Wyoming ranch will consist of a \ncheckerboard of public and private lands. Running a profitable ranch, \nwhile negotiating various Federal and State regulations, is a \nchallenge. However, Niels Hansen has done just that operating the PH \nLivestock Company. Niels is known as the public lands ranching leader \nof Wyoming. He has dedicated himself to building relationships with \nFederal land managers. He creates partnerships and opens lines of \ncommunication with fellow ranchers and government agencies. According \nto my friend, Wyoming Stock Growers Association vice president Jim \nMagana, Niels is highly recognized for his relentless efforts to \nmaintain sustainable public land ranching.\n  Niels' efforts not only benefit his four-generation Wyoming ranch, he \nis also an asset to agriculturalists across Wyoming. He has worked \nclosely with the Bureau of Land Management's, BLM, field office range \nstaff and has been a State leader on agreements in conjunction with the \nBLM, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, the Wyoming Game and Fish \nDepartment, and the Wyoming State Grazing Board. Realizing that energy \nis the backbone of Wyoming's economy, Neils has brought oil and gas \ndevelopers to the table.\n  Anna Helm, Niels' sister and ranch partner, said, ``Many ranchers \nhave come to depend upon his insightful wisdom, understanding of the \nissues and willing leadership to help them through difficult times of \ntheir own.''\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Niels Hansen, the \n2011 inductee into the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Centennial of \nNiobrara County, WY.\n  The residents of Niobrara County are fortunate to live in such a \ntimeless and scenic place. Nearly 2,500 residents live in the \ncommunities of Lusk, Manville, Lance Creek, and Van Tassel. Its many \nnatural wonders that fill the landscape make Niobrara one of the top \nplaces to visit in the State. Part of the county includes land set \naside and known as the Thunder Basin National Grasslands. This area \nprovides a valuable habitat for Wyoming's wildlife and numerous \nrecreation opportunities for its residents. Two rivers, the Cheyenne \nand the Niobrara, run through the county and can be credited for \ncreating rich, fertile soil in the area.\n  Although Niobrara County is one of the smallest counties in the \nState, it certainly has one of the most fascinating histories. The \ncounty boasts a wide array of prehistoric dinosaur fossils at its \npremier Spanish Diggings site. Several rare artifacts have been found \nand are displayed in national exhibits. The region also saw heavy \ntraffic from Native Americans who used the grasslands as prime hunting \nand camping areas. Members of the Lakota Sioux, the Cheyenne, and the \nKiowa tribes settled in the area many years ago.\n  With the great westward expansion came the greater urbanization of \nthe West. Niobrara County was not immune from such development--\ninstead, it embraced the changes. The grassland area of the county \nbecame a popular area for fur traders, homesteaders, and other \nemigrants caught in the throes of gold rush excitement. One popular \nstage stop, Running Water, was located along the banks of the Niobrara \nRiver and was used by several travelers as a spot to rest and refuel. \nThe Cheyenne-Deadwood Stage Route, which traveled the length of the \ncounty, provided important transport of freight, gold, and passengers. \nThis important route and the additional stage lines which passed \nthrough were essential to the development of the county.\n  Today, the residents of Niobrara County have capitalized on that \nindustrious spirit. Thanks to the temperate climate and the fertile \nsoil in the Powder River Basin, Niobrara County's primary industry is \nagriculture. The county's farmers consistently produce profitable crops \nlike grain, wheat, and beans, and its ranchers work diligently in \nlivestock production. The county's vast mineral resources played a key \nrole in the county's robust economy. Several minerals and precious \nmetals have been discovered and mined in the grasslands of Niobrara \nCounty. Both gold and silver were discovered and mined in the early \ndays of settlement. Later, uranium was discovered near Lusk, a \ndiscovery which sparked a statewide boom in uranium drilling. Finally, \nthe discovery of oil in Lance Creek was perhaps the most profitable of \nall mineral extraction. During World War II, Lance Creek was one of the \ncountry's important oil rigs, producing vast amounts of oil needed for \nthe American war effort.\n  It is an honor to help the residents of Niobrara County celebrate \ntheir 100th anniversary. I invite my colleagues to visit this \nenterprising community in person. The residents of Niobrara County \nshould be proud to present this heritage to visitors from all over the \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5242-4", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5242-S5243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              UCON, IDAHO\n\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate and \nacknowledge the centennial anniversary of the founding of the city of \nUcon, ID. On August 13, 2011, the citizens of Ucon will gather at \nSimmons Park to commemorate its 100th year and unveil a monument to its \nfounders. This is a very historic and special day for this community.\n  Once a barren wilderness, the city of Ucon is an example of the \nWestern spirit and determination in making the desert bloom. First \ncolonized in 1884 by George Simmons, early settlers were confronted \nwith challenging terrain. Despite the harsh conditions, the settlement \nquickly grew. Within 13 years, a church, school, amusement hall, and \nseveral dozen homes were built. In 1898, the power of steam and iron \ntransformed the town with the introduction\n\n[[Page S5243]]\n\nof the Oregon Short Line Railroad. In order to take greater advantage \nof commercial opportunities provided by the railroad, the main town \nsite was moved a mile west. Within a decade several businesses sprang \nup around the railroad tracks and the community began to take shape. On \nApril 16, 1911, it was officially incorporated as the city of Ucon.\n  In the ensuing decades, changes in the railroad and the effects of \nthe Great Depression transitioned Ucon from a commercial hub to a \nresidential community. Today, many in southeastern Idaho can trace \ntheir roots to the pioneers and patriots who settled Ucon. \nCongratulations to the people of Ucon for 100 years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5243-1", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    REMEMBERING JUSTICE DOUGLAS GRAY\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I honor the memory of the \nlate Douglas Gray, a former New Hampshire Superior Court justice and an \nextraordinary public servant who dedicated his life to serving the \nGranite State.\n  Originally from Portsmouth, Justice Gray moved at the age of seven to \nRye, where he resided for the remainder of his life. He graduated from \nPortsmouth High School and served his country in the U.S. Army from \n1951 to 1954. After graduating from the University of New Hampshire in \n1959, he earned his juris doctor from Boston College Law School, and \nwent on to pursue a successful career practicing law in Portsmouth. \nDuring 1973-1983, he served as part-time special justice in the New \nHampshire District Court system.\n  In 1983, he was appointed by Governor John H. Sununu to serve as \nassociate justice of the New Hampshire Superior Court, where he \npresided until 1998. He was then elected to serve as a senior justice \nand presided on a part-time basis until his retirement in 2003.\n  As a judge, Justice Gray possessed exceptional intelligence and a \ndeep respect for upholding the rule of law. And as a prosecutor, I had \nthe privilege of trying cases before him. In fact, I tried my first \nmurder case before Justice Gray. He was tough, but always fair, and I \nknow that I and many of my peers in the New Hampshire bar learned a \ngreat deal from him. I deeply admired his integrity and his principled \ndedication to the law.\n  With Justice Gray's passing, New Hampshire has lost a devoted public \nservant and Rye has lost a beloved member of the community. My thoughts \nand prayers are with his wife Cornelia and his entire family. At this \nsad time, we celebrate his life--grateful to have known a person who \nexemplified the very best of New Hampshire's tradition of public \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5243-2", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH CONKLIN LaNIER, II\n\n Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, today, August 2, 2011, I wish to \nthank Joseph Conklin LaNier, II for his service to the United States of \nAmerica as a member of the U.S. Navy during World War II, and for \nchoosing to make Colorado his home. His has been a life of service for \nColorado and for all Americans.\n  A native Southerner, Mr. LaNier was among the first African Americans \nto serve in the Navy with the rating of seaman, before President Truman \nsigned the Executive order that desegregated the Armed Forces. He \nfought with the 23rd Special CB, ``Seabee'', unit, a part of the 3rd \nMarine Division, in some of the most horrific battles of the South \nPacific.\n  I had the honor of meeting Mr. LaNier this past week during his visit \nto Washington, DC, with The Greatest Generations Foundation, a Colorado \nnonprofit organization that organizes trips for WWII veterans to return \nto locations where they have served.\n  We can all learn from Mr. LaNier. He entered the Armed Forces at the \nage of 17 in order to help support his family and serve his country. He \nserved bravely from 1944 to 1946, supporting operations in Iwo Jima and \nOkinawa, and achieved a rank not commonly held by African Americans at \nthe time.\n  Upon returning home from the war and finding strict laws and \npractices of segregation still in place throughout the South, Mr. \nLaNier followed the advice of his father regarding the importance of \neducation as the primary tool for bettering one's future, and finished \nhigh school. With the aid of the G.I. bill, he enrolled in the Pharmacy \nSchool at Xavier University in New Orleans and took heavy course loads \nto make sure he completed his degree in 4 years. Despite the challenges \nof segregation, he studied and succeeded in his career, while keeping a \nconstructive attitude, a trait he attributes to the teachings of his \nfather.\n  Mr. LaNier is a role model for the many servicemembers who reside in \nColorado and the veterans who elect to make Colorado their home after \nserving in the Armed Forces. His story exemplifies the successful \ntransition that many returning veterans have made from active duty to \ncivilian life.\n  Although he is a native of the South, and has traveled to a number of \nlocations in the United States, it struck me as interesting that, out \nof all the places he traveled while in the Navy, Mr. LaNier chose to \nmake Denver, CO, his home. In his autobiographical essay, ``My War on \nTwo Fronts,'' LaNier recollects that during a period of leave, he had a \nstopover in Denver, where in a relatively brief period of time, the \nState showed him its character. A White female clerk at a drugstore \nseemed to sense his hesitation about sitting down, and invited him to \ntake a seat and enjoy his ice cream. Later, when visiting a local movie \ntheatre, he was surprised and delighted to find that there was no sign \ndirecting him to sit in segregated seating in the balcony. Mr. LaNier \nfelt so welcomed by our State that he decided to make Colorado his home \nafter the Navy. Following his graduation from pharmacy school, he moved \nto Denver and worked in pharmacies and in hospitals, and eventually \nopened up his own drugstore. Mr. LaNier found that, in Colorado, his \nvoice could be heard on critical issues of the day, including the fight \nfor fair housing measures to end discrimination in housing. Today, Mr. \nLaNier and his wife of more than 50 years, Eula Inez Long, continue to \nmake Colorado their home.\n  Mr. President and all other Members here today, please join me in \nhonoring the life and continued work of Joseph Conklin LaNier, II. A \nman who, despite all the discrimination he faced, is proud to be an \nAmerican. A man who, despite returning home after the war and being \ndenied his right to vote while wearing his uniform, is proud of his \ndistinguished service in the Navy. A man who recognizes that even in \nthe face of adversity, one can find a way forward and help our country \nto become a better place, a more perfect union. For his perseverance, \nhope, service and patriotism, I thank and commend Joseph LaNier, a \ngreat citizen of Colorado.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5243-3", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5243-S5244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PAUL SANDOVAL\n\n Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, on behalf of all Coloradans, I want \nto recognize the extraordinary character and lifetime achievements of \nColorado native Paul Sandoval. His far-reaching accomplishments--from \ncivil rights to community organizing to business and to his passion, \neducation--show an unwavering commitment to making Colorado a better \nplace, and reflect, in noblest form, the enterprising spirit of the \nWest.\n  I am sad to tell my colleagues that Paul has contracted locally \nadvanced pancreatic cancer, and the Sandoval family is going through a \ndifficult time now. And as he struggles to beat this terrible disease--\nand we need him to prevail--I cannot help but be reminded of all he has \nachieved in life, and all the social change he has helped bring about. \nTo honor Paul and his many contributions, I would like to share a few \nmoments from his life.\n  Paul and his wife Paula have for decades run a tamale shop in \nDenver--La Casita--that has served as the city's unofficial epicenter \nof political activity. According to Wellington Webb, the former Denver \nmayor whom Sandoval first met while the two worked delivering \ngroceries, Paul could always be found ``holding court'' at his \nrestaurant with firemen and city officials.\n  ``I'm just a lowly tamale maker,'' Sandoval has grown accustomed to \nsaying. But his life suggests there is\n\n[[Page S5244]]\n\nnothing ordinary about this accomplished man. A fixture in his \ncommunity, Paul would make a name for himself by lifting up those \naround him. He cultivated enduring relationships in his community that \npropelled several generations of Colorado public servants. In short, \nPaul Sandoval has woven himself inextricably into Colorado's political \nfabric, and all Coloradans are the better for it.\n  Born in 1944 as 1 of 11 children to Jerry and Camilla Sandoval, Paul \ncame from modest beginnings. Before he could even read newspaper \nheadlines, Paul was selling copies of the Denver Post to help pay for \nhis schooling at Annunciation Grade School in northeast Denver. From an \nearly age, Paul thrived on the energy of those around him. By the time \nthe young Sandoval finished middle school, he had helped his father win \nthe presidency of the local meatpackers union and regularly canvassed \nfor local candidates for office.\n  Paul graduated from high school in 1962, earning a scholarship to \nLouisiana State University. His education put him in close proximity to \na fierce civil rights debate unfolding in neighboring Mississippi, \nwhere James Meredith sought to become the first African American to \nenroll at Ole Miss. Paul took up the cause and organized his fellow \nstudents for a bus trip. He participated firsthand in the \ndemonstrations, receiving blows from the Oxford, MS, riot police.\n  Upon returning to Denver, Paul applied all he learned about the \nimportance of equal opportunity in education to Colorado public life as \nwell. He cofounded the Chicano Education Project, which focused on \nimplementing bilingual curricula in schools and promoting civic \nengagement. During one trip to the San Luis Valley in southern \nColorado, Paul met a young attorney named Ken Salazar who shared his \npassion for education. The two would become close allies for life.\n  Paul assumed his first official public role in 1974 when he \nsuccessfully ran for a Colorado State Senate seat. He won the seat \nagain in 1978. While serving in office, Paul became a leader in the \neducational community by personally sponsoring several Chicano doctoral \nstudents finishing their degrees. Rather than seeking a third term in \nthe Senate, Paul pursued and won an at-large seat on the Denver school \nboard in 1983, in which he would serve in a distinguished manner for 5 \nyears.\n  After nearly 15 years serving in public office, Paul joined his wife \nand began serving Coloradans in a different equally satisfying way--at \ntheir tamale shop. And you can talk to anyone who has eaten there--you \nhaven't lived until you've tried one of Paul and Paula's tamales with \ngreen chile. While I am in Washington during the week, one of the many \nreasons I look forward to getting back home to Denver is so that I can \nenjoy a meal courtesy of Paul.\n  A jack-of-all-trades if not master-of-all-trades, Paul has also \nremained a fixture in Colorado public life as a successful small \nbusiness owner. He has provided invaluable advice to aspiring public \nservants. I cannot tell you how often I encounter people in my state \nwho tell me how they have benefited from Paul's counsel and contagious \nenthusiasm. I can tell you that he helped me find my way as \nsuperintendent of Denver Public Schools. I have been truly privileged \nto know him, and I know I rank among many who are rooting for Paul and \nwho stand by in support of his family.\n  Colorado is profoundly grateful for Paul Sandoval's public service. \nHis efforts to advance the prospects of young Latino students and \nstudents of all backgrounds represent an enormous step forward in \ncreating the next generation of selfless Coloradans who have been \naffected by Paul's unconquerable spirit. I ask my colleagues to join me \nin honoring Paul, his wife Paula, Kendra, Chris, Andrea and Amanda, his \nchildren, and his entire family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5244-1", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING GEORGE RAMOS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments \nto remember George Ramos, a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist with the \nLos Angeles Times who served his beloved hometown for decades and \ninspired countless others to follow in his extraordinary footsteps.\n  Born in 1947, George Ramos was a native of East Los Angeles. At a \ntime when only a small number of Latino students enrolled in college, \nRamos graduated in 1969 from California Polytechnic University in San \nLuis Obispo with a bachelor's degree in journalism.\n  Shortly after completing his studies, Ramos enlisted in the U.S. Army \nand served in West Germany and South Vietnam before returning to \njournalism. He worked for several newspapers before arriving at the Los \nAngeles Times, where he served for more than 25 years.\n  As an editor and reporter for the Los Angeles Times, Ramos joined \nwith 17 Latino journalists to write the Pulitzer Prize winning ``Latino \nProject'' and also contributed to the Los Angeles Times' Pulitzer \nPrize-winning coverage of the 1992 Los Angeles riots and the 1994 \nNorthridge earthquake. In addition to his award winning work in print \nmedia, Ramos also briefly co-hosted the Emmy Award-winning show ``Life \n& Times'' and served as a part-time faculty member at the University of \nSouthern California. When he left the Los Angeles Times in 2003, he \nreturned to California Polytechnic University in San Luis Obispo as a \nmember of the journalism faculty.\n  Ramos lived in the Los Angeles area for most of his life and enjoyed \nthe diversity of its vibrant neighborhoods. He maintained close ties to \nhis childhood community of East Los Angeles and frequently visited \nlocal schools to speak about journalism and the importance of higher \neducation. Ramos served as a mentor to many aspiring journalists and \nalso as two-term president of California Chicano New Media \nAssociation--a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting diversity \nin the field of journalism.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me in recognizing and honoring the \nmemory of George Ramos for his long and distinguished service to our \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5244-2", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5244-S5245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO SISTER MARY NORBERTA MALINOWSKI\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in 1855 in Warsaw, Poland, Blessed \nAngela founded the Congregation of the Sisters of St. Felix, an order \ndedicated to serving the poor, the sick, and the disabled. Today, \nthousands of Felician Sisters carry on a tradition of compassionate \nservice around the world.\n  Today I wish to pay tribute to one of their number, a remarkable \nwoman in Bangor, ME, the city where I live. Her name is Sister Mary \nNorberta Malinowski, but she is known and loved throughout Maine simply \nas Sister Norberta. She has dedicated her life to serving God by \nserving those in need.\n  Sister Norberta became a registered nurse in 1956 and began her \ncareer as one of the first pediatric nurse practitioners at \nMassachusetts General Hospital. After earning advanced degrees in \npublic health and management, she received faculty appointments at \nHarvard Medical School and the Boston College Graduate School of \nNursing.\n  In 1982, Sister Norberta became president and chief executive officer \nof St. Joseph Hospital in Bangor. As she prepares to step down after 29 \nyears of service, her accomplishments are being celebrated by the Maine \nLegislature, the city of Bangor, the Honor Society of Nursing, the \nMaine chapter of Business and Professional Women, and many others.\n  There is much to celebrate. Under Sister Norberta's courageous and \nvisionary leadership, St. Joseph has been transformed into the largest \ncommunity hospital in Maine. She was instrumental in bringing many \nfirsts to the region and to the State, from digital mammography and \nlaparoscopic surgery to allowing fathers in the delivery room.\n  The Felician Sisters were founded with a particular focus on serving \nthe Polish countryside. Sister Norberta continues that tradition by \nleading the effort to ensure primary care services for rural Maine and \nto organize small community hospitals under the Maine Health Alliance \nto create a statewide network of care.\n  Sister Norberta's contributions as a health care executive are only \npart of her inspiring story. She has given thousands of hours of her \npersonal time to charity and has applied St. Joseph's facilities to \nsuch needs as providing laundry and food services to the area's\n\n[[Page S5245]]\n\nhomeless shelters. Countless other quiet acts of kindness testify to \nher caring heart and deep humility.\n  The 16th century Capuchin friar canonized as St. Felix was known in \nhis time as ``the saint of the streets of Rome'' for his daily journeys \nthrough the city dispensing food, medicine, and comfort to the poor, \nthe sick, and the troubled. Sister Norberta has lived that legacy \nthrough the streets of Bangor and the country roads of Maine, and I \njoin in thanking her for her blessed service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5245-1", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING DR. GERARD J. MANGONE\n\n Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I wish to honor Dr. Gerard J. \nMangone's life of service to this country and my home State of \nDelaware. Dr. Mangone passed away on Wednesday, July 27 at his home in \nNewark, DE. He was 92.\n  Born in the Bronx in 1918, Dr. Mangone's career as an international \nlegal scholar spanned close to six decades, including almost 40 years \nas professor of marine policy at the University of Delaware. Dr. \nMangone received his bachelor's degree from the College of the City of \nNew York in 1938. Following 4 years of active military service, he \nearned his master's degree and doctoral degree in international law \nfrom Harvard University in 1947 and 1949 respectively. His dissertation \nwon the Charles Sumner Award for the most distinguished contribution to \ninternational peace.\n  Before joining the University of Delaware, Dr. Mangone held faculty \nand administrative positions at institutions including Wesleyan \nUniversity, Swarthmore College, and Syracuse University, where he \nserved as associate and acting dean of the Maxwell Graduate School of \nCitizenship and Public Affairs, as well as Temple University, where he \nserved as dean for the College of Liberal Arts, vice president for \nacademic affairs, and provost.\n  Dr. Mangone was appointed soon thereafter as executive director of \nthe President's Commission on the United Nations during the creation of \nits Convention on the Law of the Sea and was the first senior fellow at \nthe new Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars. Dr. Mangone \nalso served as a consultant to the White House, U.S. Department of \nState, the United Nations, Japan, the Ford Foundation, and the Carnegie \nEndowment for International Peace.\n  Dr. Mangone joined the University of Delaware in 1972 as professor of \nmarine studies and political science. In 1973, he created the Center \nfor the Study of Marine Policy--the first research center at an \nAmerican university to study the legal, political, and economic issues \nfacing the ocean, seabed, and coastal zone--and served as its director \nfor the next 16 years. In 2003, the center was renamed in his honor as \nthe Gerard J. Mangone Center for Marine Policy.\n  Dr. Mangone initiated the International Straits of the World book \nseries in 1978 with a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. For this \nseries, he contracted with authors from around the globe to provide \ndetailed information on some of the world's most critical navigation \npassages, much of which is still used today.\n  Dr. Mangone earned numerous accolades throughout his career. He was a \nvisiting professor at Yale University, Mt. Holyoke College, Trinity \nCollege, Princeton University, and Johns Hopkins University as well as \na visiting lecturer at the University of Bologna, Peking University, \nthe University of Natal, Capetown University, and the University of \nWestern Australia. At Calcutta University in India, he was honored as \nthe Tagore Law Professor, and at the University of Delaware, he \nreceived the most distinguished faculty award as Francis Alison \nProfessor. In 2010, UD awarded Dr. Mangone an honorary doctor of \nscience degree.\n  The Young Scholars Award, which recognizes promising and accomplished \nfaculty at the University of Delaware, was named in his honor. In \ncelebration of his 90th birthday in 2008, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers \nestablished the Gerard J. Mangone Prize to be awarded annually to the \nauthor of the best contribution published in the International Journal \nof Marine and Coastal Law, of which Dr. Mangone was editor-in-chief.\n  With his remarkable energy and constant dedication to academic \nexcellence, Dr. Mangone was an exemplary mentor, having advised 45 \nUniversity of Delaware students in achieving graduate degrees. He wrote \nmore than 20 books and edited 25 others, and he authored scores of \nscholarly papers.\n  Dr. Mangone's vision, passion, and dedication forever changed the way \nwe view and manage our ocean resources. His contributions to marine and \ncoastal policy will continue to have a lasting effect on our country \nand our world for generations. Dr. Mangone made a significant impact in \nhis field and his legacy will live on in his students, his ideas, and \nhis influence on our laws and international agreements.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in remembering Dr. Gerard J. \nMangone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5245-2", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WHITE RIVER, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota.

In just 2 years it was home \nto a newspaper, a bank, and daily mail service. Thousands of people \ncame to Wood for its renowned Fourth of July celebrations, as well as \nthe Mellette County Fair. Like many towns in South Dakota, the railroad \nserved as a major lifeline to the town of Wood. This first train from \nthe Chicago Northwestern Railroad rolled into Wood from Winner on \nOctober 19, 1929. Wood claims many exceptional residents including \nJames Abourezk, the first Arab American to serve South Dakota in the \nU.S. Senate.\n  Today, Wood stands as a testament to the steadfast commitment of the \nresidents to their small town. Wood still maintains close ties to the \nrich agricultural heritage of South Dakota. Small communities like Wood \nare a vital part of the economy of South Dakota and a reminder of the \nhard struggles endured by our frontier-era forefathers. One hundred \nyears after its founding, Wood remains a strong community and a great \nasset to the State of South Dakota. I am proud to honor Wood on this \nhistoric milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5245-4", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5245-S5246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO GEOFFREY B. SHIELDS\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I honor the dean and president \nof Vermont Law School, Geoffrey B. Shields, as he announces his \nretirement after four decades as a practicing attorney, educator, and \nscholar. He will leave a legacy about which he should be very proud.\n  Dean Shields arrived at Vermont Law School in 2004, following a \ndistinguished career in the public and private sectors. He received a \nbachelor of arts in economics, magna cum laude, from Harvard University \nin 1967. He earned his juris doctor from Yale Law School in 1972.\n  Over the last 8 years, Dean Shields has guided Vermont Law School \nalong\n\n[[Page S5246]]\n\na path of steady growth. Through his leadership the school has gained \nmany new and talented faculty members, and has seen substantial growth \nin its endowment. He has initiated capital improvement projects on the \nschool's campus, expanded the school's international partnerships, and \nhas developed new clinics and institutes to focus on distinct fields of \nlegal study. And he has sustained and built upon Vermont Law School's \nenvironmental law program, which has been rated the best program in the \nNation for the last three consecutive years, and in the top two for the \nlast 21 years. These continuing successes are reflective of Dean \nShields' strong leadership and the dedication of the faculty, staff, \nand students who sustain a vital community of learning and innovation \nin the hills of central Vermont.\n  During his career in public service, Dean Shields served as assistant \nto the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and \nWelfare, counsel to the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and \nas counsel to Senator Frank Church. After he earned his law degree, he \nserved as a law clerk for the late Judge James Oakes of the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Second Circuit, for whom a class room building at \nVermont Law School is named.\n  In the private sector, he served as a partner at the Chicago and \nWashington, DC, law firm of Gardner Carton and Douglas, where he was \nnationally recognized for his expertise in nonprofit law, corporate \nlaw, health care law and international trade law.\n  Dean Shields has also made important contributions to education and \nscholarship beyond Vermont Law School. In Brattleboro, VT, he served as \na foreign student advisor and assistant to the president at the \nExperiment in International Living and as an adjunct professor of \neconomics at Marlboro College in Marlboro, VT. Dean Shields has also \nbeen involved in foreign policy issues through editing and writing, and \nas a member of the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations and the Council \non Foreign Relations in New York.\n  In addition to his professional accomplishments, Dean Shields \nrecently overcame serious illness with grace, humility, and \ndetermination. As he moves into the next chapter of his life, Marcelle \nand I wish him and his wife Genie the best for continued health and \nhappiness.\n  I thank Dean Shields for his 8 years of dedication to Vermont Law \nSchool, and I convey my admiration and respect for the contributions he \nhas made to Vermont. He will leave Vermont's young law school and its \nfaculty, staff and students in a strong position for continued growth \nand success. I am sure he will be greatly missed by all of those who \nhave worked with him and learned from him. I wish him all the \nbest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5246-1", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOHN CROSIER\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor John \nCrosier for his outstanding service to the State of New Hampshire's \nresidents and business community.\n  John retired as president of our State's largest business \norganization, the Business and Industry Association of New Hampshire, \nin 2004 after 16 years. He has served the residents of my State as a \ntrustee of the University System of New Hampshire, a position which I \nam proud to have first appointed him to, as a member of the board of \ngovernors for the New Hampshire Forum on Higher Education, as a member \nof the executive committee of the Whittemore School of Business and \nEconomics, and as a member of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Committee \nrepresenting State chambers of commerce. Before he came to New \nHampshire, he worked in Massachusetts as the head of the Massachusetts \nBusiness Roundtable and as Commissioner of Employment Security for our \nneighboring State. He was appointed by a Republican Governor and \nreappointed by a Democratic Governor.\n  John has been a board leader at numerous nonprofits in my State, \nlending his energy, intellect and voice to some of New Hampshire's most \ninfluential and important organizations: the New Hampshire Charitable \nFoundation, Junior Achievement, Leadership New Hampshire and the \nAmerican Cancer Society.\n  Throughout his years as the head of the Business and Industry \nAssociation, and through his nonprofit board leadership, John's guiding \nprinciple has been what's best for New Hampshire.\n  When I was Governor of New Hampshire, John Crosier was one of my most \ntrusted advisors. A gentleman always, his courage of conviction and \npragmatic optimism for our State's future always trumped ideology. He \nhas been, and continues to be, a role model for civility in public \ndiscourse.\n  John's commitment to New Hampshire was evident in his visionary work \non the State's most extensive research project, which resulted in a \nstatewide economic strategy in 1996--An Agenda for Continued Economic \nOpportunity in New Hampshire. That plan set forth by John has been \ncredited with my State's recent strong economic recovery in relation to \nneighboring States. Pieces of it are still being used today as a \nframework for New Hampshire, and it served as the foundation for a \nsimilar report by my administration during my second term as Governor. \nHis belief that the health of the business sector is closely tied to \nissues of education, environment, and the nonprofit sector has \ncontributed to the leadership of our State and will continue to guide \nour State in the future.\n  I thank John Crosier for his service to New Hampshire as he prepares \nfor his well-deserved retirement. I am grateful for his friendship, \nleadership and advice throughout the years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5246-2", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5246-S5247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING FALCON PERFORMANCE FOOTWEAR\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, in cities and towns all across \nAmerica, there are businesses that are synonymous with the communities \nthey serve. Maine has historically been home to a number of these \ncompanies, from local paper mills to Bath Iron Works. In the Lewiston-\nAuburn region, Falcon Performance Footwear has been part of the fabric \nsince 1963, producing high-quality shoes and boots for generations of \nMainers and Americans. On Tuesday, August 23, Falcon Performance \nFootwear will be recognized by the Maine Manufacturing Extension \nPartnership, or MEP, with its 2011 Manufacturing Excellence Award. I \ncommend Falcon for its fine work and congratulate the company on its \nrecognition.\n  Falcon Shoe Manufacturing Company got its start in 1963, when Ted \nJohanson opened the factory's doors at the Roy Continental Mill in \nLewiston. Originally, Falcon produced children's shoes, but over time \nfocused its efforts on manufacturing boots for a number of uses. In the \nlate 1970s and early 1980s, Falcon began implementing a number of \nforward-thinking and innovative processes, including the first in the \nshoe industry to utilize computerized stitching equipment, as well as \nthe first direct-attach polyurethane outer sole for shoes in the \ncountry. The company was also the first to make Timberland boots. To \nprovide the company with the ability to expand, Falcon moved from its \nlongtime home in Lewiston to a larger location in the neighboring city \nof Auburn earlier this year.\n  Today, Falcon's sole focus is on making reliable, sturdy, comfortable \nboots, particularly for consumers in labor-intensive jobs. The company \nproduces a number of cutting-edge industrial boots, and in 2006 began \nworking with Globe Firefighter Suits, a New Hampshire small business, \nto create a state-of-the-art boot for firefighters designed with an \nathletic shoe platform rather than a more rigid welted sole to provide \nadded flexibility. Falcon added mining boots to its repertoire in 2009, \nwhich feature a type of leather that resists many of the salts and \nminerals frequently encountered by miners.\n  Over the past decade, Falcon has worked with the Maine MEP to improve \nits efficiency and productivity, allowing the company to better compete \nin the global economy. As a result of this collaboration, Falcon has \nincreased its productivity by 60 percent, retained over 50 jobs, \nincreased its sales, and trained all of its employees in a number of \nadvanced manufacturing techniques. I have long been a supporter of, and \nadvocate for, the MEP program, and recognize the immense value of its \nservices to small- and medium-sized manufacturers across the country. \nIndeed, as a result of their partnership with the Maine MEP over the \npast 5 years, clients have reported increased and retained sales\n\n[[Page S5247]]\n\nover $368 million, $40.1 million in cost savings, and the creation or \nretention of over 2,500 jobs--or nearly 5 percent of Maine's \nmanufacturing workforce. I commend Falcon for working with the Maine \nMEP to become a leaner, more efficient company that is poised for \nfuture success, and I am pleased to honor the company and its employees \nas it receives the Maine MEP's 2011 Manufacturing Excellence Award.\n  Maine was once home to dozens of shoemakers and tanneries, which \nprovided thousands of jobs and enormous benefits to the State's \neconomy. But over time, foreign competition and rising costs have \ndevastated the shoe industry across America. That is what makes Falcon \nPerformance Footwear's story all the more remarkable. I thank everyone \nat Falcon for their hard work and endurance, and wish them continued \nsuccess as they remain an icon in the Lewiston-Auburn \ncommunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5247-1", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING LARRY GERLACH\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Larry Gerlach. \nLarry Gerlach was born October 6, 1946, in Britton, SD. In 1967, he \nmarried Susan O'Connor, and they made their home in Aberdeen. Larry \nquickly made himself known throughout the community for his love of the \narea and his resolve to see it grow and prosper.\n  Larry became a member of the Brown County Fair Board in the 1980s and \nserved on the board for 6 years. He became the president in 1989, and \nin January 1992, Larry was named the Brown County Fair manager. His \nambition and driven attitude helped develop the Brown County Fair into \none of the largest fairs in the region. He was able to book some of the \nbiggest names in country music to perform at the grandstand that is \nbeing named in his honor. His friends, family, and coworkers all \nremember him as having an upbeat and positive attitude, and he was \nregarded by all as a joy to be around.\n  Larry received many prestigious awards in his life, among them was \nthe 1996 People's Choice ABBY Award from the Aberdeen Chamber of \nCommerce. In addition, he served as the president of the South Dakota \nAssociation of Fairs from 1997-2001, and in 2003, Larry was inducted \ninto the South Dakota Fairman's Hall of Fame.\n  Unfortunately, Larry passed away in February of 2011. Although we are \nsaddened by this loss, Larry's memory will live on through his loved \nones and those who were fortunate to work closely with him. Larry's \nsense of determination, ambition, and positive attitude helped make the \nBrown County Fair the tremendous success it is today, as well as made \nhim a greatly respected man within the Brown County community and the \nentire state. He will be greatly missed by all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5247-2", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BO BRUINSMA\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to require reporting on the capacity of foreign \ncountries to combat cybercrime, to develop action plans to improve the \ncapacity of certain countries to combat cybercrime, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the \nInternational Cybercrime Reporting and Cooperation Act with Senator \nKirsten Gillibrand, which if enacted, will establish a framework for \nglobal cooperation on the fight against cybercrime. As the United \nStates continues to work on combating cybercrime here at home, we must \nsimultaneously direct our attention to the international arena. With \nbipartisan support and valued input from affected industry, we have \nworked together on drafting a bill that encompasses reporting measures, \naction plans, and multilateral efforts in support of government \ncooperation to dismantle this global threat.\n  This bill increases the U.S. Government's focus on combating \ncybercrime internationally by requiring the President, or his designee, \nto annually report to Congress on the assessment of the cybercrime \nfighting efforts of the countries chosen by key federal agencies in \nconsultation with private sector stakeholders. The countries to be \nreviewed are those with a significant role in efforts to combat \ncybercrime impacting U.S. Government, entities and persons, or \ndisrupting U.S. electronic commerce or intellectual property interests.\n  Cyberspace remains borderless, with no single proprietor. \nAccordingly, the United States must take the lead on maintaining the \nopenness of the Internet, while securing accountability. If a country \nis a haven for cybercrime, or simply has demonstrated a pattern of \nuncooperative behavior with efforts to combat cybercrime, that nation \nmust be held accountable. The government of each country must conduct \ncriminal investigations and prosecute criminals when there is credible \nevidence of cybercrime incidents against the U.S. government, our \nprivate entities or our people.\n  With so many U.S. companies doing business overseas, we must do our \npart to safeguard their employees, their jobs, and their clients from \ncyber attacks. Our objective is simple: We need international \ncooperation to increase assistance and prevention efforts of cybercrime \nfrom those countries deemed to be of cyber concern. Without \ninternational cooperation, our economy, security, and people will \ncontinue to be under threat.\n  Cybercrime is a tangible threat to the security of our global \neconomy, which is why we need to coordinate our fight worldwide. Until \ncountries begin to take the necessary steps to fight criminals within \ntheir borders, cybercrime havens will continue to flourish. Countries \nthat knowingly permit cybercriminals to attack within their borders \nwill now know that the United States is watching, the global community \nis watching, and there will be consequences for not acting.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Coburn):\n  S. 1476. A bill to reduce the size of the Federal workforce and \nFederal employee cost relating to pay, bonuses, and travel; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, after a contentious several months \nnavigating the increase in the debt ceiling, Congress will be returning \nhome in the next few days. I think many of us are anxious to go back to \nthe States, where we will hear from our fellow citizens about their \nthoughts on what we are doing well and where we are falling short.\n  Getting out of Washington and returning to our States will be a \nrelief, but I am fully aware that after this brief respite, we will \ncome back to Washington in the fall with many more contentious issues \nstill on our plates.\n  Our Nation is still on an unsustainable fiscal path, even with \ntoday's temporary resolution of the issues surrounding the debt \nceiling. In addition, we have a government that has grown far too large \nand has taken on far too many obligations.\n  Today, with all these concerns in mind, I am joined by Senator Tom \nCoburn in introducing the Federal Workforce Reduction and Reform Act of \n2011. If enacted, this bill will go a long way toward reducing the size \nof the Federal Government and helping to get our Nation's fiscal house \nin order.\n  Specifically, our bill would extend the current pay freeze for \nFederal civilian employees for another 3 years. Bonuses paid Federal \nemployees would also be frozen during that time. Currently, Federal \nworkers receive an automatic cost-of-living adjustment every year and \nare eligible for relocation, retention, and performance bonuses as \nwell.\n  While I don't begrudge government employees their compensation, these \nautomatic increases come with significant costs and far outpace those \ntypically offered in the private sector. By simply extending the \ncurrent pay freeze for another 3 years, we will save the Federal \nGovernment roughly $140 billion over 10 years.\n  In addition, our bill would require the President, in consultation \nwith the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel \nManagement, to reduce the size of the Federal workforce by 15 percent--\nroughly 300,000 employees--over the next 10 years. This could easily be \naccomplished through attrition and would save taxpayers over $225 \nbillion over that time.\n  The bill would require a similar reduction in the Federal contract \nworkforce as well. We have nothing against Federal agencies contracting \nservices out to private venders. However, the significant increase in \nthis practice\n\n[[Page S5255]]\n\nover the last several years has masked the size of the Federal \nGovernment. Indeed, when you include the contract workforce, the \nFederal Government is even larger than it appears.\n  Our bill would require that the President work with OMB and OPM to \ncount the number of employees working on Federal contracts and reduce \nthat number by 15 percent over the next 10 years. This would provide an \neven greater reduction in the size of the Federal Government and save \ntaxpayers another $230 billion over the next decade.\n  Finally, this bill would reduce the travel budgets of Federal \nagencies by 75 percent over time. All told, the Federal Government \nspends over $15 billion a year on travel expenses. Most businesses \nrespond to difficult financial times by reducing or eliminating \nunnecessary expenses. Most private sector leaders would tell you that \ntravel expenses are one of the first things on the chopping block. \nFurthermore, improvements in teleconferencing technology and web-based \ncommunication have made much of the government-sponsored travel that \nwas required in the past unnecessary.\n  Our bill would cut Federal travel expenses in half for the first 2 \nyears, and then by three quarters thereafter. This will save American \ntaxpayers something in the neighborhood of $40 billion over 10 years.\n  Mr. President, our Nation is currently in the midst of a fundamental \ndebate over the constitutional limits on the Federal Government. The \nPresident and his allies see no bounds for a living Constitution, while \nconservatives like myself believe that Federal power has far exceeded \nthe Founders' limits and is a genuine threat to personal liberty.\n  While this debate will likely not be resolved anytime soon, most of \nus can agree that we need to take immediate steps to address our \nNation's looming fiscal crisis. The deal that was approved today was a \nstep in the right direction, but it was only one step. We must do more, \nand we can do more, to right our fiscal ship. Some may see things \ndifferently, but I don't see any way that we can restore the integrity \nof the Nation's fiscal position without significantly reducing the size \nand cost of the Federal Government. The bill we are introducing today \nwould be an important and measurable step toward that goal.\n  According to the numbers and methodology used by the National \nCommission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, these changes combined \nwill save American taxpayers more than $600 billion over 10 years. \nThese are significant numbers. They represent more than half of the \ndeficit reduction required in the first part of the deal agreed to \ntoday, and they could easily be realized if we enact this small handful \nof relatively simple reforms.\n  I want to thank Senator Coburn--who continues to be a leader in the \nfight to bring us back to fiscal sanity--for his help and support on \nthis bill. His has been a tireless voice against government excess and \nI am proud to join with him in this fight.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support the Federal Workforce Reduction \nand Reform Act of 2011.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 1483. A bill to ensure that persons who form corporations in the \nUnited States disclose the beneficial owners of those corporations, in \norder to prevent wrongdoers from exploiting United States corporations \nin ways that threaten homeland security, to assist law enforcement in \ndetecting, preventing, and punishing terrorism, money laundering, and \nother misconduct involving United States corporations, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Today, I along with my colleague, Senator Grassley, am re-\nintroducing the Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement \nAssistance Act, a bill designed to combat terrorism, money laundering, \ntax evasion, and other wrongdoing facilitated by U.S. corporations with \nhidden owners. This commonsense bill would end the practice of our \nStates forming over about 2 million new corporations each year for \nunidentified persons, and instead require the States to ask for the \nidentities of the persons establishing those corporations. With those \nnames on record, U.S. law enforcement faced with corporate misconduct \nwould then have a trail to chase instead of what today is too often a \ndead end.\n  Our bill is supported by key law enforcement organizations, including \nthe Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the Fraternal Order \nof Police, the National Association of Assistant United States \nAttorneys, the National Narcotic Officers' Associations Coalition, the \nUnited States Marshals Service Association, the Society of Former \nSpecial Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the \nAssociation of Former ATF Agents. It is also endorsed by a number of \nsmall business and public interest groups, including the Main Street \nAlliance, Sustainable Business Network of Washington, Global Financial \nIntegrity, Global Witness, Public Interest Research Group, Project on \nGovernment Oversight, Jubilee USA, Citizens for Tax Justice, Tax \nJustice Network USA, and the FACT Coalition.\n  This is the third time this bill has been introduced. In the 110th \nCongress, when the bill was introduced for the first time and he was a \nmember of the U.S. Senate, President Obama served as an original \ncosponsor. It's an issue that has become more urgent with time.\n  Right now, it takes more information to get a drivers license or open \na U.S. bank account than to form a U.S. corporation. Under current law, \nU.S. corporations can be established anonymously, by hidden owners who \ndon't reveal their identity. Our bill would change that by requiring \nany State that accepts anti-terrorism funding from DHS to add a new \nquestion to their existing incorporation forms asking applicants who \nwant to set up a new U.S. corporation or limited liability company to \nanswer a simple but important question: who are the actual owners?\n  That is it. One new question on an existing form. It is not a \ncomplicated question, yet the answer could play a key role in helping \nlaw enforcement do their job. Our bill would not require States to \nverify the information, but penalties would apply to persons who submit \nfalse information. States, or licensed formation agents if a State has \ndelegated the task to them, would supply the ownership information to \nlaw enforcement upon receipt of a subpoena or summons.\n  We have all seen the news reports about U.S. corporations involved in \nwrongdoing, from facilitating terrorism to money laundering, financial \nfraud, tax evasion, corruption, and more. Let me give you a few \nexamples.\n  We now know that some terrorists use U.S. shell corporations to carry \nout their activities. Viktor Bout, an arms dealer who has been indicted \nand incarcerated in the United States for conspiracy to kill U.S. \nnationals, used shell corporations around the world in his work, \nincluding a dozen formed in Texas, Delaware, and Florida. Mr. Bout was \nrecently extradited from Thailand to answer for his conduct at which \ntime Attorney General Eric Holder stated: ``Long considered one of the \nworld's most prolific arms traffickers, Mr. Bout will now appear in \nfederal court in Manhattan to answer to charges of conspiring to sell \nmillions of dollars worth of weapons to a terrorist organization for \nuse in trying to kill Americans.'' It is unacceptable that Mr. Bout was \nable to set up shell corporations in three of our States and use them \nin illicit activities without ever being asked who owned those \ncorporations.\n  In another case, a New York company called the Assa Corporation owned \na Manhattan skyscraper and, in 2007, wire transferred about $4.5 \nmillion in rental payments to a bank in Iran. U.S. law enforcement \ntracking the funds had no idea who was behind that shell corporation, \nuntil another government disclosed that it was owned by the Alavi \nFoundation which was known to have ties to the Iranian military. In \nother words, a New York corporation was being used to ship millions of \nU.S. dollars to Iran, a notorious supporter of terrorism.\n  U.S. corporations with hidden owners have also been involved in \nfinancial crimes. In 2011, a former Russian military officer, Victor \nKaganov, pled guilty to operating an illegal money transmitter business \nfrom his home in\n\n[[Page S5256]]\n\nOregon, and using Oregon shell corporations to wire more than $150 \nmillion around the world on behalf of Russian clients. U.S. Attorney \nDwight Holton of the District of Oregon used stark language when \ndescribing the case: ``When shell corporations are illegally \nmanipulated in the shadows to hide the flow of tens of millions of \ndollars overseas, it threatens the integrity of our financial system.''\n  Another recent case involves Florida attorney Scott Rothstein who, in \n2010, pled guilty to fraud and money laundering in connection with a \n$1.2 billion Ponzi investment scheme, in which he used 85 U.S. limited \nliability companies to conceal his participation or ownership stake in \nvarious real estate and business ventures.\n  Tax evasion is another type of misconduct which all too often \ninvolves the use of U.S. corporations with hidden owners. In 2006, for \nexample, the Subcommittee showed how Kurt Greaves, a Michigan \nbusinessman, worked with Terry Neal, an offshore promoter, to form \nshell corporations in Nevada, Canada, and offshore secrecy \njurisdictions, to hide more than $400,000 in untaxed business income. \nIn 2004, both Mr. Greaves and Mr. Neal pled guilty to Federal tax \nevasion. Also in 2006, the Subcommittee showed how two brothers from \nTexas, Sam and Charles Wyly, created a network of 58 trusts and shell \ncorporations to dodge the payment of U.S. taxes, including using a set \nof Nevada corporations to move offshore over $190 million in stock \noptions without paying any taxes on that compensation.\n  Still another area of abuse involves the misuse of U.S. corporations \nin handling corruption proceeds. One example involves Teodoro Obiang, \nwho is the son of the President of Equatorial Guinea, holds office in \nthat country, and is currently under investigation by the U.S. Justice \nDepartment, along with his father, for corruption and other misconduct. \nBetween 2004 and 2008, Mr. Obiang used U.S. lawyers to form multiple \nCalifornia shell corporations with names like Beautiful Vision, \nUnlimited Horizon, and Sweet Pink; open bank accounts in the names of \nthose corporations; and move millions of dollars in suspect funds \nthrough those and other U.S. banks.\n  One last example involves 800 U.S. corporations whose hidden owners \nhave stumped U.S. law enforcement which, as a result, has given up \ninvestigating their suspect conduct. In October 2004, the Homeland \nSecurity Department's division of Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nor ICE identified a single Utah corporation that had engaged in $150 \nmillion in suspicious transactions. ICE found that the corporation had \nbeen formed in Utah and was owned by two Panama entities which, in \nturn, were owned by a group of Panama holding corporations, all located \nin the same Panama City office. By 2005, ICE had located 800 additional \nU.S. corporations in nearly all 50 states associated with the same \nshadowy group in Panama, but was unable to obtain the name of a single \nnatural person who owned one of the corporations. ICE learned that \nthose corporations were associated with multiple investigations into \ntax fraud and other wrongdoing, but no one had been able to find the \ncorporate owners. The trail went cold, and ICE closed the case. Yet it \nmay be that many of those U.S. corporations are still operative.\n  These examples of U.S. corporations with hidden owners involved in or \nfacilitating terrorism, financial crime, tax evasion, corruption, or \nother misconduct provide ample evidence of the need for legislation to \naddress the problem.\n  The Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association or FLEOA, which \nrepresents more than 26,000 federal law enforcement officers and is a \nstrong supporter of the bill, has stated that ``the unfortunate lax \nattitude demonstrated by certain states has enabled large criminal \nenterprises to exploit those State's flawed filing systems.'' FLEOA has \nstated further: ``[W]hile all Americans are inspired by the spirit of \nfree enterprise, our membership does not want to see the United States \nadopt the financial hideaway image of Switzerland. We regard corporate \nownership in the same manner as we do vehicle ownership. Requiring the \ndriver of a vehicle to have a registration and insurance card is not a \nviolation of their privacy. This information does not need to be \npublished in a Yellow Pages, but it should be available to law \nenforcement officers who make legally authorized requests pursuant to \nofficial investigations.''\n  The National Association of Assistant United States Attorneys which \nrepresents more than 1,500 federal prosecutors, urges Congress to take \nlegislative action to remedy inadequate state incorporation practices. \nNAAUSA has written: ``[M]indful of the ease with which criminals \nestablish `front organizations' to assist in money laundering, \nterrorist financing, tax evasion and other misconduct, it is shocking \nand unacceptable that many State laws permit the creation of \ncorporations without asking for the identity of the corporation's \nbeneficial owners. Your legislation will guard against that from \nhappening, and no longer permit criminals to exploit the lack of \ntransparency in the registration of corporations.''\n  Just last week, the Administration released a new Strategy to Combat \nTransnational Organized Crime that focused, in part, on the problem of \ncorporations with hidden owners. It stated that transnational organized \ncriminal networks ``rely on industry experts, both witting and \nunwitting, to facilitate corrupt transactions and to create the \nnecessary infrastructure to pursue their illicit schemes, such as \ncreating shell corporations, opening offshore bank accounts in the \nshell corporation's name, and creating front businesses for their \nillegal activity and money laundering.'' The Strategy established as \none of its action plans to ``[w]ork with Congress to enact legislation \nto require disclosure of beneficial ownership information of legal \nentities at the time of company formation in order to enhance \ntransparency for law enforcement and other purposes.''\n  We need legislation not only to stop the abuses being committed by \nU.S. corporations with hidden owners, but also to meet our \ninternational commitments. In 2006, the leading international anti-\nmoney laundering body in the world, the Financial Action Task Force on \nMoney Laundering, known as FATF, issued a report criticizing the United \nStates for its failure to comply with a FATF standard requiring \ncountries to obtain beneficial ownership information for the \ncorporations formed under their laws. This standard is one of 40 FATF \nstandards that this country has publicly committed itself to \nimplementing as part of its efforts to promote strong anti-money \nlaundering laws around the world.\n  FATF gave the United States two years, until 2008, to make progress \ntoward coming into compliance with the FATF standard on beneficial \nownership information. That deadline passed three years ago, and we \nhave yet to make any real progress. Enacting the bill we are \nintroducing today would bring the United States into compliance with \nthe FATF standard by requiring the States to obtain beneficial \nownership information for the corporations formed under their laws. It \nwould ensure that the United States meets its international commitment \nto comply with FATF anti-money laundering standards.\n  The bill being introduced today is the product of years of work by \nthe Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair. \nOver ten years ago, in 2000, the Government Accountability Office, at \nmy request, conducted an investigation and released a report entitled, \n``Suspicious Banking Activities: Possible Money Laundering by U.S. \nCorporations Formed for Russian Entities.'' That report revealed that \none person was able to set up more than 2,000 Delaware shell \ncorporations and, without disclosing the identity of the beneficial \nowners, open U.S. bank accounts for those corporations, which then \ncollectively moved about $1.4 billion through the accounts. It is one \nof the earliest government reports to give some sense of the law \nenforcement problems caused by U.S. corporations with hidden owners. \nThe alarm it sounded years ago is still ringing.\n  In April 2006, in response to a second Subcommittee request, GAO \nreleased a report entitled, ``Corporation Formations: Minimal Ownership \nInformation Is Collected and Available,'' which reviewed the corporate \nformation laws in all 50 States. GAO disclosed that the\n\n[[Page S5257]]\n\nvast majority of the States do not collect any information at all on \nthe beneficial owners of the corporations and limited liability \ncompanies, or LLCs, formed under their laws. The report also found that \nseveral States have established automated procedures that allow a \nperson to form a new corporation or LLC in the State within 24 hours of \nfiling an online application without any prior review of that \napplication by State personnel. In exchange for a substantial fee, at \nleast two States will form a corporation or LLC within one hour of a \nrequest. After examining these State incorporation practices, the GAO \nreport described the problems that the lack of beneficial ownership \ninformation has caused for a range of law enforcement investigations.\n\n  In November 2006, our Subcommittee held a hearing on the problem. At \nthat hearing, representatives of the U.S. Department of Justice, the \nInternal Revenue Service, and the Department of Treasury's Financial \nCrimes Enforcement Network or FinCEN testified that the failure of \nStates to collect adequate information on the beneficial owners of the \nlegal entities they form had impeded federal efforts to investigate and \nprosecute criminal acts such as terrorism, money laundering, securities \nfraud, and tax evasion. At the hearing, the Justice Department \ntestified: ``We had allegations of corrupt foreign officials using \nthese [U.S.] shell accounts to launder money, but were unable--due to \nlack of identifying information in the corporate records--to fully \ninvestigate this area.'' The IRS testified: ``Within our own borders, \nthe laws of some states regarding the formation of legal entities have \nsignificant transparency gaps which may even rival the secrecy afforded \nin the most attractive tax havens.'' As part of its testimony, FinCEN \ndescribed identifying 768 incidents of suspicious international wire \ntransfer activity involving U.S. shell corporations.\n  The next year, in 2007, in a ``Dirty Dozen'' list of tax scams active \nthat year, the IRS highlighted shell corporations with hidden owners as \nnumber four on the list. It wrote:\n\n       4. Disguised Corporate Ownership: Domestic shell \n     corporations and other entities are being formed and operated \n     in certain states for the purpose of disguising the ownership \n     of the business or financial activity. Once formed, these \n     anonymous entities can be, and are being, used to facilitate \n     underreporting of income, non-filing of tax returns, listed \n     transactions, money laundering, financial crimes and possibly \n     terrorist financing. The IRS is working with state \n     authorities to identify these entities and to bring their \n     owners into compliance.\n\n  It was also in 2007, that we first introduced our bipartisan \nlegislation, which was S. 2956 back then, to stop the formation of U.S. \ncorporations with hidden owners. It was a Levin-Coleman-Obama bill. \nWhen asked about the bill in 2008, then DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff \nwrote: ``In countless investigations, where the criminal targets \nutilize shell corporations, the lack of law enforcement's ability to \ngain access to true beneficial ownership information slows, confuses or \nimpedes the efforts by investigators to follow criminal proceeds.''\n  In 2009, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee held two hearings which examined not only the problem, but \nalso possible solutions, including our by then revised bill, S. 569. At \nthe first hearing entitled, ``Examining State Business Incorporation \nPractices: A Discussion of the Incorporation Transparency and Law \nEnforcement Assistance Act,'' held in June 2009, DHS testified that \n``shell corporations established in the United States have been \nutilized to commit crimes against individuals around the world.'' The \nManhattan District Attorney's office testified: ``For those of us in \nlaw enforcement, these issues with shell corporations are not some \nabstract idea. This is what we do and deal with every day. We see these \nshell corporations being used by criminal organizations, and the record \nis replete with examples of their use for money laundering, for their \nuse in tax evasion, and for their use in securities fraud.''\n  At the second hearing, ``Business Formation and Financial Crime: \nFinding a Legislative Solution,'' held in November 2009, the Justice \nDepartment again testified about criminals using U.S. shell \ncorporations. It also noted that ``each of these examples involves the \nrelatively rare instance in which law enforcement was able to identify \nthe perpetrator misusing U.S. shell corporations. Far too often, we are \nunable to do so.'' The Treasury Department testified that ``the ability \nof illicit actors to form corporations in the United States without \ndisclosing their true identity presents a serious vulnerability and \nthere is ample evidence that criminal organizations and others who \nthreaten our national security exploit this vulnerability.''\n  The 2009 hearings also presented evidence of dozens of Internet \nwebsites advertising corporate formation services that highlighted the \nability of corporations to be formed in the United States without \nasking for the identity of the beneficial owners. These websites \nexplicitly pointed to anonymous ownership as a reason to incorporate \nwithin the United States, and often listed certain States alongside \nnotorious offshore jurisdictions as preferred locations in which to \nform new corporations, essentially providing an open invitation for \nwrongdoers to form entities within the United States.\n  One website, for example, set up by an international incorporation \nfirm, advocated setting up corporations in Delaware by saying: \n``DELAWARE--An Offshore Tax Haven for Non US Residents.'' It cited as \none of Delaware's advantages that: ``Owners' names are not disclosed to \nthe state.'' Another website, from a U.K. firm called \n``formacorporation-offshore.com,'' listed the advantages to \nincorporating in Nevada. Those advantages included: ``Stockholders are \nnot on Public Record allowing complete anonymity.''\n  During the 2009 hearings, I presented evidence of how one Wyoming \noutfit was selling so-called shelf corporations--corporations formed \nand then left ``on the shelf'' for later sale to purchasers who could \nthen pretend the corporations had been in operation for years. More \nrecently, a June 2011 Reuters news article wrote a detailed expose of \nhow that same outfit, called Wyoming Corporate Services, has formed \nthousands of U.S. corporations all across the country, all with hidden \nowners. The article quoted the website as follows: ``A corporation is a \nlegal person created by state statute that can be used as a fall guy, a \nservant, a good friend or a decoy. A person you control . . . yet \ncannot be held accountable for its actions. Imagine the \npossibilities!''\n  The article described a small house in Cheyenne, Wyoming, which \nWyoming Corporate Services used to provide a U.S. address for more than \n2,000 corporations that it had helped to form. The article described \n``the walls of the main room'' as ``covered floor to ceiling with \nnumbered mailboxes labeled as corporate suites.'' The article reported \nthat among the corporations using the address was a shell corporation \ncontrolled by a former Ukranian prime minister, Pavlo Lazarenko, who \nhad been convicted of money laundering and extortion; a corporation \nindicted for helping online-poker operators evade a U.S. ban on \nInternet gambling; and two corporations barred from U.S. federal \ncontracting for selling counterfeit truck parts to the Pentagon. The \narticle observed that Wyoming Corporate Services continued to sell \nshelf corporations that existed solely on paper but could show a \nhistory of regulatory and tax filings, despite having had no real U.S. \noperations. That's what is going on right now, here in our own \nbackyard, with respect to U.S. corporations.\n\n  Despite the evidence of U.S. corporations being misused by organized \ncrime, terrorists, tax evaders, and other wrongdoers, and despite years \nof law enforcement complaints, many of our States are reluctant to \nadmit there is a problem in establishing U.S. corporations and LLCs \nwith hidden owners. Too many of our States are eager to explain how \nquick and easy it is to set up corporations within their borders, \nwithout acknowledging that those same quick and easy procedures enable \nwrongdoers to utilize U.S. corporations in a variety of crimes and tax \ndodges both here and abroad.\n  Beginning in 2006, the Subcommittee worked with the States to \nencourage them to recognize the homeland security problem they'd \ncreated and to come up with their own solution. After the \nSubcommittee's 2006 hearing on this issue, for example, the National \nAssociation of Secretaries of State or\n\n[[Page S5258]]\n\nNASS convened a 2007 task force to examine state incorporation \npractices. At the request of NASS and several States, I delayed \nintroducing legislation while they worked on a proposal to require the \ncollection of beneficial ownership information. My Subcommittee staff \nparticipated in multiple conferences, telephone calls, and meetings; \nsuggested key principles; and provided comments to the Task Force.\n  In July 2007, the NASS task force issued a proposal. Rather than cure \nthe problem, however, the proposal had many deficiencies, leading the \nTreasury Department to state in a letter that the NASS proposal ``falls \nshort'' and ``does not fully address the problem of legal entities \nmasking the identity of criminals.''\n  Among other shortcomings, the NASS proposal would not require States \nto obtain the names of the natural individuals who would be the \nbeneficial owners of a U.S. corporation or LLC. Instead, it would allow \nStates to obtain a list of a corporation's ``owners of record'' who can \nbe, and often are, offshore corporations or trusts. The NASS proposal \nalso did not require the States themselves to maintain the beneficial \nownership information, or to supply it to law enforcement upon receipt \nof a subpoena or summons. Instead, law enforcement would have to get \nthe information from the suspect corporation or one of its agents, \nthereby tipping off the corporation to the investigation. The proposal \nalso failed to require the beneficial ownership information to be \nupdated over time. These and other flaws in the proposal were \nidentified by the Treasury Department, the Department of Justice, and \nothers, but NASS decided to continue on the same course.\n  NASS enlisted the help of the National Conference of Commissioners on \nUniform State Laws or NCCUSL, which produced a proposed model law for \nStates that wanted to adopt the NASS approach. NCCUSL presented its \nproposal at the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee's \nJune 2009 hearing, where it was subjected to significant criticism. The \nManhattan District Attorney's office, for example, testified: ``I say \nwithout hesitation or reservation--that from a law enforcement \nperspective, the bill proposed by NCCUSL would be worse than no bill at \nall. And there are two very basic reasons for this. It eliminates the \nability of law enforcement to get corporate information without \nalerting the target of the investigation that the investigation is \nongoing. That is the primary reason. It also sets up a system that is \ntime-consuming and complicated.''\n  The Department of Justice testified: ``Senator, I would submit to you \nthat in a criminal organization everyone knows who is in control and \nthis will not be an issue of determining who is in control. What we are \nconcerned about here from the law enforcement perspective are the \ncriminals and the criminal organizations and so what we are asking is \nthat when criminals use shell companies, they provide the name of the \nbeneficial owner. That is the person who is in control, the criminal in \ncontrol, as opposed to the NCCUSL proposal where they are suggesting \nthat instead two nominees are provided--two nominees between law \nenforcement and the criminal in control.''\n  Despite these criticisms, NCCUSL finalized its model law in July \n2009, issuing it under the title, ``Uniform Law Enforcement Access to \nEntity Information Act.'' At the November 2009 hearing, law enforcement \nagain criticized the NCCUSL model law. At the hearing, Senator Levin \nasked: ``Now the NCCUSL, in their proposal just requires a records \ncontact and that records contact could simply be an owner of record, \nwhich could be a shell corporation, putting us right back into a circle \nwhich leads absolutely nowhere in terms of finding the beneficial \nowners. Would you agree that the approach of NCCUSL in this regard is \nnot acceptable, Ms. Shasky?'' The Justice Department representative, \nJennifer Shasky, responded: ``Yes, Senator. To allow companies to \nprovide anything less than the beneficial owner information merely \nprovides criminals with an opportunity to evade responsibility and put \nnominees between themselves and the true perpetrator.'' With regard to \nNCCUSL's proposal, the Treasury representative, David Cohen, testified: \n``[T]here is not an obligation for that live person to not be a \nnominee. And what I think is important in the legislation is that we \nget at the true beneficial owner and not someone who may be a \nnominee.''\n  In addition to its flaws, the NCCUSL model law has proven unpopular \nwith the States for whom it was written. Despite the effort and fanfare \nattached to this uniform law, after two years of sitting on the books, \nnot a single State has adopted it or given any indication of doing so.\n  It is deeply disappointing that the States, despite the passage of \nfive years since FATF first called upon the United States to meet its \ncommitment to collect beneficial ownership information, have been \nunable to devise an effective proposal. Part of the difficulty is that \nthe States have a wide range of practices, differ on the extent to \nwhich they rely on incorporation fees as a major source of revenue, and \ndiffer on the extent to which they attract non-U.S. persons as \nincorporators. In addition, the States are competing against each other \nto attract persons who want to set up U.S. corporations, and that \ncompetition creates pressure for each individual State to favor \nprocedures that allow quick and easy incorporations, with no questions \nasked. It's a classic case of competition causing a race to the bottom, \nmaking it difficult for any one State to do the right thing and request \nthe identity of the persons behind the incorporation efforts.\n  That is why Federal legislation in this area is critical. Federal \nlegislation is needed to level the playing field among the States, set \nminimum standards for obtaining beneficial ownership information, put \nan end to the practice of States forming millions of legal entities \neach year without knowing who is behind them, and bring the United \nStates into compliance with its international commitments.\n  The bill's provisions would require the States to obtain from \nincorporation applicants a list of the beneficial owners of each \ncorporation or LLC formed under their laws, to maintain this \ninformation for a period of years after a corporation is terminated, \nand to provide the information to law enforcement upon receipt of a \nsubpoena or summons. The bill would also require corporations and LLCs \nto update their beneficial ownership information on a regular basis. \nThe ownership information would be kept by the State or, if a State \nmaintains a formation agent licensing system and delegates this task, \nby a State's licensed formation agents.\n  The particular information that would have to be provided for each \nbeneficial owner is the owner's name, address, and unique identifying \nnumber from a State drivers license or U.S. passport. The bill would \nnot require States or their licensed formation agents to verify this \ninformation, but penalties would apply to persons who submitted false \ninformation.\n  In the case of U.S. corporations formed by individuals who do not \npossess a drivers license or passport from the United States, the bill \nwould require the incorporation application to include a written \ncertification from a formation agent residing within the State \nattesting to the fact that the agent had obtained and verified the \nidentity of the non-U.S. beneficial owners of the corporation, by \nobtaining their names, addresses, and identifying information from a \nnon-expired non-U.S. passport. The formation agent would be required to \nretain this information in the State for a specified period of time and \nproduce it upon receipt of a subpoena or summons from law enforcement.\n  To ensure that its provisions are tightly targeted, the bill would \nexempt a wide range of corporations from the disclosure obligation. It \nwould exempt, for example, virtually all highly regulated corporations, \nbecause we already know who owns them. That includes all publicly-\ntraded corporations, banks, broker-dealers, commodity brokers, \nregistered investment funds, registered accounting firms, insurers, \nutilities, and charities that file returns with the IRS. The bill would \nalso exempt corporations with a substantial U.S. presence, including at \nleast 20 employees physically located in the United States, since those \nindividuals could provide law enforcement with the leads needed to \ntrace a corporation's true owners. In addition, the bill would exempt \ncorporations whose beneficial\n\n[[Page S5259]]\n\nownership information would not benefit the public interest or assist \nlaw enforcement. These exemptions dramatically reduce the number of \ncorporations who would be required to provide beneficial ownership \ninformation to ensure that the bill's disclosure obligation is focused \non only those whose owners' identities are currently hidden.\n  The bill does not take a position on the issue of whether the States \nshould make the beneficial ownership information available to the \npublic. Instead, the bill leaves it entirely up to the States to decide \nwhether, under what circumstances, and to what extent to make \nbeneficial ownership information available to the public. The bill \nexplicitly permits the States to place restrictions on providing \nbeneficial ownership information to persons other than government \nofficials. The bill focuses instead on ensuring that law enforcement \nwith a subpoena or summons is given ready access to the beneficial \nownership information.\n  Relative to the costs of compliance, the bill provides States with \naccess to two separate funding sources, neither of which involves \nappropriated funds. For the first three years after the bill's \nenactment, the bill directs both the Treasury and Justice Departments \nto make funds available from their individual forfeiture programs to \nStates seeking to comply with the requirements of the Act. These \nforfeiture funds are not appropriated taxpayer dollars; instead they \nare the proceeds of forfeiture actions taken against persons involved \nin money laundering, drug trafficking, or other wrongdoing. The two \nforfeiture funds typically contain between $300 and $500 million at a \ntime. The bill would direct a total of $30 million over three years to \nbe provided to the States from the two funds to carry out the Act. \nThese provisions would ensure that States have adequate funds for the \nmodest compliance costs involved with adding a new question to their \nincorporation forms requesting the names of the covered corporations' \nbeneficial owners.\n  It is common for bills establishing minimum Federal standards to seek \nto ensure State action by making some Federal funding dependent upon a \nState's meeting the specified standards. Our bill, however, states \nexplicitly that nothing in its provisions authorizes DHS to withhold \nfunds from a State for failing to modify its incorporation practices to \nmeet the beneficial ownership information requirements in the Act. \nInstead, the bill calls for a GAO report in 2015 to identify which \nStates, if any, have failed to strengthen their incorporation practices \nas required by the Act. After getting this status report, a future \nCongress can decide what steps to take, including whether to reduce any \nfunding going to noncompliant States.\n  The bill also contains a provision that would require corporations \nbidding on Federal contracts to provide the same beneficial ownership \ninformation to the Federal Government as provided to the relevant \nState. The Subcommittee has become aware of instances in which the \nFederal Government has found itself doing business with U.S. \ncorporations whose owners are hidden. It's important that when the \nFederal Government contracts to do business with someone, it knows who \nit is dealing with.\n  Finally, the bill would require the Treasury Department to issue a \nrule requiring U.S. formation agents to establish anti-money laundering \nprograms to ensure they are not forming U.S. corporations or LLCs for \nwrongdoers. The bill requires the programs to be risk based so that \nformation agents can target their preventative efforts toward persons \nwho pose a high risk of being involved with money laundering. GAO would \nalso be asked to conduct a study of existing State formation procedures \nfor partnerships, trusts, and charitable organizations.\n  We have worked with the Departments of Homeland Security, Treasury, \nand Justice to craft a bill that would address, in a fair and \nreasonable way, the homeland security problems created by States \nallowing the formation of millions of U.S. corporations and LLCs with \nhidden owners. What the bill comes down to is a simple requirement that \nStates change their incorporation applications to add a single question \nrequesting identifying information for the true owners of the \ncorporations they form. That is not too much to ask to protect this \ncountry and the international community from wrongdoers seeking to \nmisuse U.S. corporations.\n\n  For those who say that, if the United States tightens its \nincorporation rules, new corporations will be formed elsewhere, it is \nappropriate to ask exactly where they will go. Every country in the \nEuropean Union is already required to have their formation agents \ncollect beneficial information for the corporations formed by those \nagents. Most offshore jurisdictions also already require request this \ninformation to be collected, including the Bahamas, Cayman Islands, and \nthe Channel Islands. Countries around the world already request \nbeneficial ownership information, in part because of their commitment \nto FATF's international anti-money laundering standards. Our 50 States \nshould be asking for the same ownership information, but there is no \nindication that they will any time in the near future, unless required \nto do so.\n  I wish Federal legislation weren't necessary. I wish the States could \nsolve this homeland security problem on their own, but ongoing \ncompetitive pressures make it unlikely that the States will do the \nright thing. It is been more than five years since our 2006 hearing on \nthis issue and more than two years since the States came up with a \nmodel law on the subject, with no progress to speak of, despite \nrepeated pleas from law enforcement.\n  Federal legislation is necessary to reduce the vulnerability of the \nUnited States to wrongdoing by U.S. corporations with hidden owners, to \nprotect interstate and international commerce from criminals misusing \nU.S. corporations, to strengthen the ability of law enforcement to \ninvestigate suspect U.S. corporations, to level the playing field among \nthe States, and to bring the United States into compliance with its \ninternational anti-money laundering obligations.\n  There is also an issue of consistency. For years, I have been \nfighting offshore corporate secrecy laws and practices that enable \nwrongdoers to secretly control offshore corporations involved in money \nlaundering, tax evasion, and other misconduct. I have pointed out on \nmore than one occasion that corporations were not created to hide \nownership, but to protect owners from personal liability for corporate \nacts. Unfortunately, today, the corporate form has too often been \ncorrupted into serving those who wish to conceal their identities. It \nis past time to stop this misuse of the corporate form. But if we want \nto stop inappropriate corporate secrecy offshore, we need to stop it \nhere at home as well.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this \nlegislation and putting an end to incorporation practices that promote \ncorporate secrecy and render the United States and other countries \nvulnerable to abuse by U.S. corporations with hidden owners.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a bill summary be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Summary of Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance \n                                  Act\n\n                             August 2, 2011\n\n       To protect the United States from U.S. corporations being \n     misused to support terrorism, money laundering, tax evasion, \n     or other misconduct, the Levin-Grassley Incorporation \n     Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act would:\n       Beneficial Ownership Information.

A bill to amend the Tariff Act of 1930 to include ultralight \nvehicles under the definition of aircraft for purposes of the aviation \nsmuggling provisions under that Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the \nUltralight Aircraft Smuggling Prevention Act, legislation that will \ncrack down on smugglers who use ultralight aircraft, also known as \nULAs, to bring drugs across the U.S.-Mexico border. I am pleased to be \nworking on this in a bipartisan manner with Senator Heller, who \nintroduced a very similar bill last year in the House with \nCongresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. That bill passed overwhelmingly by a \n412-3 vote. I hope we can have a similar bipartisan result here in the \nSenate.\n  ULAs are single-pilot aircraft capable of flying low, landing and \ntaking off quickly, and are typically used for sport or for recreation. \nHowever, because of increased detection and interdiction of more \ntraditional smuggling conveyances, ULAs have increasingly been employed \nalong the Southwest border by Mexican drug trafficking organizations to \nsmuggle drugs into the United States.\n  The use of ULAs by drug smugglers presents a unique challenge for \nBorder Patrol and prosecutors. Every year hundreds of ULAs are flown \nacross the Southwest border and each one can carry hundreds of pounds \nof narcotics. Under existing law, ULAs are not categorized as aircraft \nby the Federal Aviation Administration, so they do not fall under the \naviation smuggling provisions of the Tariff Act of 1930. This means \nthat a drug smuggler piloting a small airplane is subject to much \nstronger criminal penalties than a smuggler who pilots a ULA.\n  Our bill will close this unintended loophole and establish the same \npenalties if convicted--a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a \n$25,000 fine--for smuggling drugs on ULAs as currently exist for \nsmuggling on airplanes or in automobiles. This is a common sense \nsolution that will give our law enforcement agencies and prosecutors \nadditional tools they need to combat drug smuggling.\n  The bill would also add an attempt and conspiracy provision to the \naviation smuggling law to allow prosecutors to charge people other than \nthe pilot who are involved in aviation smuggling. This would give them \na new tool to prosecute the ground crews who aid the pilots as well as \nthose who pick up the drug loads that are dropped from ULAs in the U.S. \nFinally, the bill directs the Department of Defense and Department of \nHomeland Security to collaborate in identifying equipment and \ntechnology used by DOD that could be used by U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection to detect ULAs.\n  In addition to Senator Heller, I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nBingaman and Feinstein in introducing this legislation. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Ultralight Aircraft Smuggling Prevention Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nan article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1485\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The incursions are hard to detect and are on the upswing.\n\n                          (By Richard Marosi)\n\n       They fly low and slow over the border, their wings painted \n     black and motors humming faintly under moonlit skies. The \n     pilots, some armed in the open cockpits, steer the horizontal \n     control bar with one hand and pull a latch with the other, \n     releasing 250-pound payloads that land with a thud, leaving \n     only craters as evidence of another successful smuggling run.\n       Mexican organized crime groups, increasingly stymied by \n     stepped-up enforcement on land, have dug tunnels and \n     captained boats to get drugs across the U.S.-Mexico border. \n     Now they are taking to the skies, using ultralight aircraft \n     that resemble motorized hang gliders to drop marijuana \n     bundles in agricultural fields and desert scrub across the \n     Southwest border.\n       What began with a few flights in Arizona in 2008 is now \n     common from Texas to California's Imperial Valley and, mostly \n     recently, San Diego, where at least two ultralights suspected \n     of carrying drugs have been detected flying over Interstate \n     8, according to U.S. border authorities.\n       The number of incursions by ultralights reached 228 in the \n     last federal fiscal year ending Sept. 30, almost double from \n     the previous year. Seventy-one have been detected in this \n     fiscal year through April, according to border authorities.\n       Flying at night with lights out, and zipping back across \n     the border in minutes, ultralight aircraft sightings are \n     rare, but often dramatic. At least two have been chased out \n     of Arizona skies by Black Hawk Customs and Border Protection \n     helicopters and F-16 jet fighters. Last month, a pair of \n     visiting British helicopter pilots almost crashed into an \n     ultralight during training exercises over the Imperial \n     Valley.\n       The smuggling work is fraught with danger. High winds can \n     flip the light aircraft. Moonlight provides illumination, but \n     some pilots wear night-vision goggles. Others fly over major \n     roads to orient themselves. Drop zones are illuminated by \n     ground crews using strobe lights or glow sticks. There is \n     little room for error.\n       At least one pilot has been paralyzed; another died in a \n     crash.\n       In Calexico, Det. Mario Salinas was walking to his car one \n     morning last year when he heard something buzzing over the \n     Police Department on 5th Street. ``I hear this weird noise, \n     like a lawn mower. I look up and I see this small plane,'' \n     said Salinas, who pursued the aircraft before it eluded him \n     as it flew over the desert.\n       The ultralight activity is seen as strong evidence that \n     smugglers are having an increasingly difficult time getting \n     marijuana over land crossings. Authorities noticed a surge in \n     flights in Imperial County after newly erected fencing along \n     California's southeast corner blocked smugglers from crossing \n     desert dunes in all-terrain vehicles.\n       U.S. Border Patrol agents, accustomed to scouring for \n     footprints and tracks in the sand, have had to adapt. They \n     are now instructed to turn off their engines and roll\n\n[[Page S5261]]\n\n     down their windows so they can listen for incursions by air.\n       ``We're trained to look down and at the fence. Now we have \n     to look up for tell-tale signs of ultralight traffic,'' said \n     Roy D. Villarreal, deputy chief patrol agent of the El Centro \n     sector in the Imperial Valley.\n       Although the new trend poses serious challenges, \n     authorities point out that ultralights are a decidedly \n     inefficient way of getting drugs across the border. \n     Traffickers who once moved thousands of pounds of drugs \n     across the border now appear to be packing their loads by the \n     pound, not the ton, authorities say.\n       The ultralights--lightweight planes typically used as \n     recreational aircraft--are customized for smuggling purposes. \n     All-terrain wheels are added for bumpy landings. Second seats \n     are ripped out to add fuel capacity. Drugs are loaded onto \n     metal baskets affixed to the bottom of the framing. From 150 \n     to 250 pounds of marijuana are generally carried, depending \n     on the weight of the pilot. Some ultralights are shrouded in \n     black paint, with even the plastic tarp covers for the \n     marijuana blackened for stealth entries.\n       Radar operators at Riverside County's Air and Marine \n     Operations Center, where general aviation air traffic across \n     the country is monitored, have trouble detecting the \n     aircraft.\n       Flying as low as 500 feet, their small frames are hard to \n     distinguish from trucks. Many appear, then disappear from \n     radar screens. Others never appear at all, and the ultralight \n     trend has prompted border authorities to develop new radar \n     technologies specifically designed to detect the aircraft.\n       ``There are indications of larger amounts of activity,'' \n     said Tony Crowder, director of the Air and Marine Operations \n     Center, which is housed at March Air Reserve Base.\n       The close cooperation among radar operators, helicopter \n     pilots and agents on the ground has resulted in some \n     successes.\n       Ultralight pilots no longer land on U.S. soil after \n     authorities began responding quickly to offloading sites. The \n     Mexican Army has seized four ultralights around Baja \n     California in recent weeks after being tipped off by U.S. \n     authorities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBERTS (for himself, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Crapo, \n        Mr. Wyden, Mr. Toomey, and Mr. Heller):\n  S. 1486. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nclarify and expand on criteria applicable to patient admission to and \ncare furnished in long-term care hospitals participating in the \nMedicare program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Long-Term \nCare Hospital Improvement Act of 2011, with the support of my colleague \nMr. Nelson of Florida. This legislation develops new federal standards \nand certification criteria for Long Term Acute Care Hospitals, LTCHs.\n  We are also joined by Senators Crapo, Wyden, Toomey and Heller, in \nintroducing this bill. We hope to get the support of many more of our \ncolleagues.\n  This legislation has the support of the major hospital associations, \nincluding the American Hospital Association, AHA, the Federation of \nAmerican Hospitals, FAH, and the Acute Long Term Hospital Association, \nALTHA.\n  As many of you know, Long-Term Acute Care Hospitals, referred to as \nLTCHs, specialize in treating medically complex patients who need \nlonger than usual hospital stays, on average 25 days. By comparison, \nthe average stay for a patient in a general acute hospital is only 5-6 \ndays.\n  LTCHs, like rehabilitation hospitals and nursing homes, often care \nfor patients who are discharged from a general hospital. Because of \nthat, LTCHs are sometimes referred to as post-acute care providers. \nHowever, LTCHs are fully licensed and certified as acute care \nhospitals. There are approximately 425 LTCHs in the nation, compared to \napproximately 12,000 nursing homes and 1,400 rehabilitation hospitals. \nLTCH patients are very ill, with many suffering from complex \nrespiratory issues, including those who are ventilator dependent, or \nother complex medical issues. LTCHs account for about of Medicare \nspending.\n  The bill that I am introducing today implements a comprehensive set \nof federal criteria that will supplement existing Medicare \nclassification criteria for LTCHs. These criteria are designed to \nensure that LTCHs are treating high acuity patients who need extended \nhospital stays. Analysis by the Moran Company estimates that these \ncriteria could generate approximately $374 million over 5 years and \n$2.7 billion over 10 years. The bill is expected to result in a net \nsavings of $500 million over 10 years. I plan to work with CBO to \nconfirm that estimate.\n  This legislation will generate savings for the Medicare program; \npromote patients being cared for in the most appropriate setting; and, \nprotect access to LTCH care for medically acute beneficiaries who need \nextended stays due to their complex condition.\n  This is not a new concept and the American Hospital Association has \nbeen working on this issue for years. In August 2010, the AHA initiated \na workgroup representing a cross section of the nation' LTCHs and \nlarger general hospital systems including Geisinger Medical System, \nPennsylvania, and Partners HealthCare System, Inc., Boston. The goals \nof the AHA workgroup were to develop policy recommendations for uniform \nLTCH patient and facility criteria; distinguish LTCH hospitals from \ngeneral acute hospitals and all post-acute settings; assess fiscal \nimpact, with goal of showing overall Medicare savings; develop \nconsensus among AHA's LTCH members; and achieve relief from the LTCH \n``25 percent Rule.''\n  We believe that we have accomplished these goals with my legislation. \nAdditionally, for a body that just voted on a debt ceiling increase, \nthis bill has the potential to achieve significant savings.\n  I hope that my colleagues will agree with me and that this \nlegislation is something that they can support. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in cosponsoring the Long-Term Care Hospital Improvement Act of \n2011.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 1491. A bill to amend the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act \nof 1978 to expand the electric rate-setting authority of States; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the PURPA PLUS \nAct.\n  In my home State we have numerous emerging small renewable energy \ntechnologies, such as wave energy buoys, hydropower turbines in \nirrigation canals, biomass burning cogeneration facilities and rooftop \nsolar installations. Like Oregon, many States have sought to advance \nnew electricity technologies by providing these kinds of projects with \nhigher power purchase rates for their power than utility companies \nnormally pay for electricity. These incentive rates allow individuals \nand small businesses to recover money they invest in solar panels or \nother electricity generation projects over a reasonable period of time.\n  The PURPA PLUS Act simply provides States the clear legal authority \nto set these incentive rates for small renewable energy projects. \nCurrently, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, has \nexclusive jurisdiction over wholesale energy prices. Under the Public \nUtility Regulatory Policies Act, PURPA, FERC regulates the price that \nutility companies pay for electricity from small, independent power \nproviders and that rate can be no higher than what it would normally \ncost a utility company to buy additional power, known as ``avoided \ncost''. My bill would transfer the authority for setting power purchase \nrates for small power projects of less than 2 megawatts from FERC to \nthe States. This transfer is voluntary. If a State chose to exercise \nthis authority to promote small wind energy development, or solar, or \ncogeneration projects, it could. If a State chose not to use this \nauthority, FERC would continue to regulate these projects as before. By \ncapping the project size at 2 megawatts, the bill only extends this new \nauthority for small projects that are providing very small amounts of \npower to the local utility company. It would leave regulation of large \nwind farms, hydroprojects and other large renewable energy projects \nthat often sell their power to out-of-state customers unchanged. \nConversely, it shouldn't be necessary for the Federal Government to get \ninvolved in setting rates for solar panels on top of a house or \napartment building.\n  At a time when both State legislatures and the Federal Government are \ntightening their purse strings on grants, loans and tax incentives for \nthe development of renewable energy projects, this legislation would \ngive State public utility commissions another tool to promote small \nrenewable resources. In Oregon, the State legislature and State utility \ncommission have already established a pilot program to spur residential \nrooftop solar projects.\n\n[[Page S5262]]\n\nOregon's utility commission also has a program that allows net metering \nof renewable customer-produced energy where customers are charged for \nthe extra energy they buy from the utility company minus the amount of \nelectricity produced themselves. This bill will simply provide these \nprograms stronger legal footing, and allow States to expand these sorts \nof programs if they wish.\n  While I acknowledge that the power from these small projects may be \nmore expensive than a large central generation station powered by coal \nor gas, I believe that States should be able to consider the associated \nbenefits of small renewable power and set higher prices when the \nbenefits outweigh the costs if they choose. Benefits of small renewable \nenergy projects include local job creation, less investment in high-\nvoltage transmission lines, diversity in an area's power generation \nportfolio, and the environmental benefits of green energy.\n  The bill has the support of the National Association of Regulatory \nUtility Commissioners, which represents the individual State \ncommissions, as well as the Solar Energy Industry Association, the \nDistributed Wind Energy Association, the Clean Coalition and the Oregon \nPublic Utility Commission. I am very pleased to be introducing this \nbill with my colleague on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nSenator Coons. I hope that many of our colleagues will join us in \nsupporting this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Heller):\n  S. 1492. A bill to provide for the conveyance of certain Federal land \nin Clark County, Nevada, for the environmental remediation and \nreclamation of the Three Kids Mine Project Site, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Three Kids \nMine Reclamation Act of 2011. My legislation transfers approximately \n900 acres of federal land to the city of Henderson to facilitate the \nremediation and redevelopment of a dangerous abandoned mine site near \nLake Mead.\n  The Three Kids mine was originally developed during World War I to \nprovide manganese needed to harden steel used by the U.S. military. The \nmine and mill continued to support the building of warships and tanks \nthrough 1961 after which it was mostly abandoned and used occasionally \nas a storage site for federal manganese reserves. The Three Kids site \nwas forgotten for decades until the population explosion in southern \nNevada put the mine right in people's backyards.\n  The Three Kids Mine site is littered with hazards that include three \nlarge mine pits that are hundreds of feet deep, ruins from the mine \nfacility, and a sludge pool of mine tailings made up of arsenic, lead, \nand diesel fuel. As a result of how the mine was developed and managed, \napproximately 75 percent of the area is federal land managed by the \nBureau of Land Management, BLM, and the Bureau of Reclamation, while \npart of the site is privately owned. Unfortunately, because of the \ncomplicated land ownership pattern and the immense cost of clean-up, \nthe Federal Government was never able to initiate the reclamation \nprocess.\n  To turn the Three Kids Mine site into a job-creating opportunity \nwhile also cleaning up this public health and safety hazard, my \nlegislation directs the BLM to convey the Federal portions of the site \nto the Henderson Redevelopment Agency for the fair market value after \ntaking into consideration the cost of cleanup for the whole mine site. \nThe city of Henderson will then be able to take advantage of Nevada \nredevelopment laws and work with local developers to finance and \nimplement a plan to remediate the abandoned toxic mine site. Local \nofficials and developers will finally be able to turn this wasteland \ninto safe, productive land for the local community. The project will \ntake decades from start to finish, but the city and the developers are \ncommitted to the effort and worked hard to put together a viable plan \nto fix this old problem without costing taxpayers a dime for cleanup.\n  Keeping our communities safe, healthy, and livable is critical. \nRemoving this physical and environmental hazard from southern Nevada is \na high priority for the city of Henderson and our delegation. I \nappreciate your help and I look forward to working with the Senate \nEnergy Committee to move this legislation forward in the near future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1492\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the school dropout prevention program in the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce Early \nIntervention for Graduation Success Authorization Act. This legislation \nwould, if enacted, amend the current School Dropout Prevention \nprovisions of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It would \nfocus attention on identifying and helping students who are at risk to \nnot graduate from high school as early as pre-kindergarten and through \nelementary and middle school.\n  Some may ask, ``Why are you concentrating on toddlers and elementary \nschool children when you are trying to solve the high school dropout \ncrisis facing our Nation? Why not focus attention and our Nation's \nscarce resources on high school students, or even middle school \nstudents?''\n  The reason is simple. Early on is when children's troubles in school \nbegin, and an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. High school \nand middle school students do not just wake up one day and say, ``I \nthink I'll drop out of school today.'' Twenty-five years of research \ntells us that dropping out is a long process of frustration, \nalienation, and even boredom, it is not a sudden decision. We know that \nstudents with disabilities, minority and poor children, and students \nwhose home lives are, in all sorts of ways, difficult have lower \ngraduation rates than their peers. The challenges children face today \nare all too prevalent, and we know the factors that make it harder for \nthem to succeed in school. We know this.\n  It only makes sense that we re-work the program that is intended to \nhelp schools increase their graduation rates so that it actually helps \nschools help children when we can make the most difference. We need to \nact before these children have fought for years just to stay afloat, \nand before they are too tired, frustrated, alienated, and angry to \nfight anymore.\n  Factors that have been shown to present a significant risk factor \neven in elementary school include: low achievement, grade retention, \npoor attendance, misbehavior and aggression, and low socioeconomic \nstatus. Family background characteristics play a role as well, such as \nfamily disruption, not living with parents, and parents' low \neducational attainment. Even low birth weight has been shown by \nnumerous studies to be linked with poor educational outcomes.\n  My ``Early Intervention for Graduation Success'' bill would focus \nFederal funds on states that have the lowest graduation rates. State \neducation agencies would be required to develop or update their plans \nto increase graduation rates. They would also be required to work with \nhealth, social services, juvenile justice, and other relevant state \nagencies to help school districts and early childhood education \nproviders better identify which of their students have research-based \nrisk factors. In turn, schools and early learning providers would be \nrequired to develop and update individual learning plans for these \nstudents and ensure that the next school of enrollment has the child's \nplan.\n  My bill also gives States and partnerships a menu of research-based \nactivities from which to choose to improve services to students, \nincluding professional development, program quality improvement, \ncurriculum alignment, community integration and support services, and \nsetting high expectations for academic achievement.\n  In short, my bill helps States and schools to give students the \nsupport they need to achieve their dreams, and inspires them to dream \nbig, right from the very start.\n  We can continue to spend millions of dollars every year on intensive \nservices for teenagers who are far behind in school, who are frustrated \nbeyond all measure, and who gave up on success long ago. We may even \nhave some limited success helping some young people get back on track \nand graduate from high school. Or, we can start at the beginning, \nmaking sure that the children who already have challenges get the help \nthey need to succeed.\n  I look forward to passage of this bill or incorporating it into the \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Begich):\n  S. 1496. A bill to amend title 46, United States Code, to prohibit \nthe delegation by the United States of inspection, certification, and \nrelated services to a foreign classification society that provides \ncomparable services to Iran, North Korea, North Sudan, or Syria, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Ethical Shipping \nInspections Act of 2011. This bill would prohibit the Secretary of \nHomeland Security and U.S. Coast Guard from delegating vessel \ninspection and certification authority to a foreign-based \nclassification society that also provides these services on behalf of \nthe governments of Iran, North Korea, North Sudan, or Syria.\n\n[[Page S5264]]\n\n  I am joined in the effort to close this critical loophole by my \ncolleagues, Senators Lieberman and Begich. With the introduction of the \nEthical Shipping Inspections Act of 2011, we seek to end U.S. \nrelationships with foreign-based classification societies that also \nrepresent nations like the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n  Each year, non-governmental classification societies conduct more \nthan 4,500 statutory inspections of U.S. flagged vessels to verify that \nthese vessels meet international maritime conventions and national \nregulatory requirements. World-wide, more than 100 governments have \nestablished relationships with classification societies. In addition, \nthe vast majority of commercial ships are built to and surveyed for \ncompliance with the standards developed by classification societies.\n  The relationship between classification societies and the U.S. \nGovernment was established in statute in the Merchant Marine Act of \n1920, when the Secretary of the Department overseeing the U.S. Coast \nGuard was granted the authority to delegate certain inspection and \ncertification services to the American Bureau of Shipping, ABS, or \nanother recognized Class Society. In 1996 Congress expanded this \nprogram to allow foreign-based classification societies to also serve \non behalf of the U.S. Government in this capacity. Today, there are \nfour foreign-based classification societies that have established \nMemorandums of Understanding with the U.S. Coast Guard to conduct these \ninspections on the Coast Guard's behalf.\n  While this act would allow this relationship between the U.S. \nGovernment and foreign-based classification societies to continue, it \nwould eliminate a loophole in the law that allows the foreign-based \nclassification societies that represent the United States to also \nrepresent the governments of Iran, North Korea, North Sudan, or Syria. \nIronically, the current law provides more latitude to foreign-based \nsocieties than we allow the American Bureau of Shipping. As a U.S.-\nbased non-profit, non-governmental organization, ABS is restricted from \nproviding such services in Iran under existing Iranian Transaction \nRegulations. Yet, the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996, as amended by the \nComprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of \n2010, does not prevent foreign-based classification societies from \nrepresenting both the U.S. and Iranian governments.\n  With this in mind, my colleagues and I have introduced this \nlegislation to prohibit the U.S. from obtaining vessel inspection, \ncertification, and related services from a foreign-based class society \nthat also provides these services on behalf of the Iranian, North \nKorean, North Sudanese, or Syrian governments. For the United States to \nmaintain such relationships runs directly contrary to the spirit of \nUnited States policy.\n  It is important that we all understand the special nature of the \nrelationship between classification societies and our Government and \ntake action to ensure that our Government is represented by \nclassification societies in a manner befitting of our nation's values \nand consistent with U.S. foreign policy. For these reasons, my \ncolleagues and I believe it is imperative that we amend the law to \nprohibit this activity, and we urge our colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1496\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ethical Shipping Inspections \n     Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. LIMITATION ON DELEGATION OF INSPECTION, \n                   CERTIFICATION, AND RELATED SERVICES.\n\n       Section 3316 of title 46, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(e) The Secretary may not make a delegation, and shall \n     revoke an existing delegation made, to a foreign \n     classification society pursuant to subsection (b) or (d) to \n     provide inspection, certification, or related services if the \n     Secretary of State determines that the foreign classification \n     society provides comparable services--\n       ``(1) in Iran, North Korea, North Sudan, or Syria; or\n       ``(2) for the government of Iran, North Korea, North Sudan, \n     or Syria.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1504. A bill to restore Medicaid eligibility for citizens of the \nFreely Associated States; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicaid \nRestoration for Citizens of Freely Associated States Act of 2011. This \nbill would reinstate eligibility for critical Federal health benefits \nfor citizens of certain Pacific Island nations who have been invited by \nthe Federal Government to live in the United States, but for whom the \ncosts of services have fallen to individual states, Hawaii in \nparticular. I would like to thank Senators Inouye and Bingaman for \njoining me in introducing this bill.\n  The Freely Associated States, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, \nthe Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau, are \nisland nations that have a unique political relationship with the \nUnited States.\n  At the end of World War II, the United Nations established the \n``Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands,'' which was administered by \nthe United States between 1947 and 1986. It included the islands that \nnow make up the FAS nations, as well as other Pacific islands liberated \nfrom Japan after World War II.\n  This U.S. Trusteeship presented the Federal Government with new \nstrategic and military opportunities, allowing the United States to \nestablish military bases and station forces in the Trust Territory and \nclose off areas for security reasons. It also bestowed upon the United \nStates the responsibility to promote economic development and self-\nreliance for the territory.\n  In the 1980s, the United States entered into a new phase in its \nrelationship with the FAS through the Compact of Free Association and \nthe Palau Compact of Free Association. The Compacts allow FAS citizens \nto freely enter, reside, and work in the United States and authorize \ntheir participation in certain Federal programs.\n  As a part of the Compacts, FAS citizens were extended Medicaid \neligibility.\n  Unfortunately, when the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \nAct of 1996 was enacted, FAS citizens lost many of their public \nbenefits, including Medicaid coverage.\n  Subsequently, state and territorial governments have been the sole \nsources of funding for meeting the social service and public health \nneeds of this ever growing population. And FAS migrants to Hawaii often \narrive with serious medical needs, requiring costly health care \nservices such as dialysis and chemotherapy.\n  These costs will continue to rise, even as the State's resources are \nincreasingly constrained.\n  Restoration of Medicaid eligibility for these individuals is crucial \nfor states where many FAS citizens reside. In the Pacific, this \nincludes Hawaii, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands.\n  In the continental U.S., this includes California, Oregon, \nWashington, and Arkansas. Health care providers that operate in areas \nwith high rates of uninsured are having difficulties meeting the health \ncare needs of their communities. Uninsured FAS citizens who seek health \ncare services contribute to the uncompensated costs that are creating \nan ever-greater burden on health care providers.\n  I ask my colleagues for their support of the Medicaid Restoration for \nCitizens of Freely Associated States Act of 2011.

A bill to provide protections from workers with respect to \ntheir right to select or refrain from selecting representation by a \nlabor organization; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I have introduced the Employee Rights \nAct, a comprehensive workers' rights bill that would address many \nissues plaguing America's workers.\n  Our Nation's labor laws were designed to preserve the rights of \nemployees to join labor unions and engage in collective bargaining. \nContrary to what some may think, I am not anti-union and I do not want \nto stand in the way of unionization if the decision to unionize is \ntruly the will of the employees. However, I believe that the right not \nto join a union is equally important. It is this right that far too \noften goes overlooked under our current laws, and particularly under \npolicies implemented by unelected bureaucrats at various administrative \nagencies.\n  I am under no illusions that this legislation will be \nnoncontroversial. There will most certainly be opposition. Indeed, I \nfully expect the unions and their supporters to come out against the \nEmployee Rights Act, and characterize it as a radical, anti-union bill.\n  But, that just isn't the case. There is not a single provision in \nthis bill that will empower employers at the expense of the union. The \nonly parties whose position will be improved by the Employee Rights Act \nare employees. Anyone whose real concern is preserving the rights of \nindividual workers should support this bill.\n  Let me take a few minutes to go over the specific provisions.\n  First, the bill would conform and equalize unfair labor practices by \nunions with those of employers under the National Labor Relations Act. \nCurrently, under Section 8 of the NLRA, employers face penalties if \nthey ``interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees'' in the exercise \nof their rights under the Act. The same section punishes labor \norganizations only if they ``restrain or coerce'' employees in the \nexercise of those same rights.\n  There is no reasonable or logical justification for this difference, \nand workers should have the benefit of equal protection against abuse \nfrom both sides. That is why, under the Employee Rights Act, both sides \nwill be held to the higher standard.\n  Next, my bill would ensure that employees are guaranteed a right to a \nfederally supervised, secret ballot vote before a union can be \ncertified. According to the NLRB, 38 percent of all unions certified in \n2009 did not have to go through a secret ballot election. Instead, \nthese unions were able to use card checks to unionize employees. True \nenough, in such cases, employers voluntarily opted to recognize the \nunion without demanding a secret ballot election. But what about the \nworkers who wanted a secret ballot vote?\n  There is, of course, a long-standing debate over the integrity and \nappropriateness of card check elections. But even the most committed \nunion supporter must admit that the card check process is unregulated \nand less reliable than a secret ballot vote. Indeed, that's exactly why \nthe unions prefer it. Anyone who claims otherwise is either lacking in \ncommon sense, on a union's payroll, or both.\n  We have all heard the accounts of unions obtaining signatures through \ndeception and intimidation. And, we've all heard about union organizing \ncampaigns and boycotts that have all but forced employers to give up \ntheir right to demand a secret ballot vote. Well, Mr. President, under \nthe Employee Rights Act, that right will belong to the employees, and \nit will be guaranteed.\n  For the record, the American people agree with me on this issue. \nEarlier this year, the Opinion Research Corporation conducted a poll of \n1,000 adults that addressed a number of these issues. All told, 75 \npercent--three out of every four--were somewhere between strongly \nsupportive and somewhat supportive of a rule requiring that all \nemployees be given the right to a secret ballot election when deciding \nwhether to join a union.\n  There is no way around it. If you are pro-worker, and not just pro-\nunion, you have to support the right to a secret ballot.\n  Next, my bill would require every unionized workplace to conduct a \nsecret ballot election every three years to determine whether a \nmajority of employees still want to be represented by the union.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, less than 10 percent of \ncurrent union members voted for the union at their workplace. Most \nunion members simply took jobs at sites that were already unionized, \nmany of which require union membership as a condition of employment.\n  Under current law, if any of these employees want to decertify a \nunion, they must go through an arduous process. It is a nearly \nimpossible task. In addition to overcoming the many procedural hurdles \nprovided by laws and regulations, they are required to speak out \npublicly against the union and subject themselves to public criticism, \nif not outright intimidation. Not surprisingly, very few even make the \neffort.\n  As a result, millions of American workers belong to unions they never \nvoted for and will never get to vote for. No one who claims to support \nthe rights of workers can argue that this is a good thing. Every \ncitizen is guaranteed an opportunity to vote out their representatives \nin State, local, and Federal Government. Yet, a union, once certified, \nis in place for perpetuity. This just shouldn't be the case.\n  Once again, I am not alone in my thinking. In the same survey I cited \nearlier, 75 percent, again, 3/4 of those polled, supported a change \nthat would require unions to be periodically recertified.\n  This proposal is not outlandish or punitive. It is simply common \nsense. It is fair to both employers and unions, and,\n\n[[Page S5266]]\n\nfar more importantly, it is fair to workers.\n  Another provision of the bill would put a stop to the NLRB's current \nproposal to shorten the required length of time between the filing of a \nunion certification petition and an election, commonly referred to as \nthe quickie or snap election proposal.\n  With this proposed rule, which is set to be finalized later this \nyear, the pro-union NLRB hopes to help unions catch unwitting employers \nunprepared. Although there is no specific timeline in the proposal, \nexperts have concluded that, if the regulation is finalized, union \nelections could occur within 7 days of a union filing a petition. Even \nworse, the proposal would eliminate many of the pre-election \nopportunities to appeal the petition and to resolve fundamental issues, \nlike the size and scope of the bargaining unit.\n  There is no need for this new rule. According to the NLRB, the \naverage time between the filing of a petition and an election is 39 \ndays. This gives both the union and the employer an opportunity to \ncommunicate their perspective on union membership to employees and \nensures that workers are able to make informed decisions.\n  Though the current rule is eminently reasonable and appears to be \nworking well for everyone, including the unions who already win the \nmajority of elections, the Obama Administration can't risk losing the \nsupport of Big Labor. Richard Trumka, President of the AFL-CIO, \nrecently remarked that this and other similar so-called reforms are \neffectively consolation prizes for the Democrats' loss in the fight to \npass the deceptively-named Employee Free Choice Act.\n  Indeed, the Obama administration, for obvious reasons, has \nconsistently been all too eager to stack the deck in favor of the \nunions. Since they haven't been able to do it through the legislative \nprocess, they're trying to do so via regulation.\n  Sadly, employees are caught in the middle. The NLRB doesn't care if \nthey have enough time to consider all their options. They simply want \nto make sure the unions win more elections. To combat this, the \nEmployee Rights Act would preserve substantive and procedural \nprotections in the election process and ensure that workers have an \nopportunity to make informed decisions.\n  The bill would also prevent a union from ordering a strike or work \nstoppage unless it obtains the consent of a majority of the affected \nworkforce through a secret ballot vote.\n  This is important because the rules governing when and how a union \ncan order a strike are not uniform. They are determined by each union's \nconstitution. There is no federal rule whatsoever requiring that unions \nobtain majority support before they can force members into unemployment \nand possible replacement.\n  Many would be surprised to learn that union strike funds, kept to \nprovide financial assistance for striking union members, rarely pay \nmore than 20 percent of an employee's salary during a work stoppage. \nAnd, more often than not, a member cannot receive any compensation for \nlost wages unless they participate on a picket line.\n  Isn't it only fair to give workers an opportunity to weigh in before \na union orders a strike? Most people seem to think so. According to the \nsame poll I mentioned earlier, 74 percent of Americans support this \nproposal.\n  Another provision of the Employee Rights Act would prevent an \nemployee's union dues or fees from being used for purposes unrelated to \nthe union's collective bargaining functions--including political \ncontributions and expenditures--without that member's written consent.\n  Exit polls have shown that America's union members are almost evenly \nsplit between Democrats and Republicans, yet more than 90 percent of \nunion political contributions go to Democrats. This is, not to put too \nfine a point on it, the reason why I expect strong opposition to this \nbill.\n  However I would like anyone who would oppose this provision to \nexplain to me why it is fair to force workers to contribute to \npolitical campaigns at all, regardless of the party on the receiving \nend. Once again, the only people who would object to empowering \nindividual workers in this way are those who have a vested interest in \nthe status quo.\n  When asked about this issue, 78 percent of those polled agreed with \nthis idea.\n  The Employee Rights Act would do several more things. It would make \nunions liable for lost wages, unlawfully collected union dues, and even \nliquidated damages if they coerce, intimidate, or discipline workers \nfor exercising their rights under the NLRA, including the right to file \na decertification petition. Any union found to have unlawfully \ninterfered with the filing of a decertification petition would be \nbarred from filing objections to the subsequent decertification vote.\n  The bill would also strengthen prohibitions on the use or threat of \nviolence to achieve union goals, overturning an egregious Supreme Court \ndecision that all but exempted unions from Federal racketeering \nstatutes.\n  It would allow all affected workers, union and non-union alike, the \nsame rights as union members to vote to ratify a collective bargaining \nagreement or to begin a strike.\n  These are not outlandish proposals. They would simply introduce some \nlong-overdue common sense into our labor laws. Not surprisingly, polls \nhave demonstrated that each of these ideas has broad support among the \npublic.\n  We have had many fierce debates in this chamber about the role of \nlabor unions in our nation's economy. In fact, I have been on the floor \nseveral times in the last week decrying the steps taken by the Obama \nAdministration when it comes to helping out Big Labor.\n  But truthfully, I'm not interested in stopping unions from organizing \nor preventing collective bargaining. I simply want to protect the \nrights of individual workers and ensure that, if they do opt for union \nrepresentation, that choice is freely made and fairly determined.\n  For too long, American workers have been treated by union leaders as \nlittle more than human ATMs. They claim to be progressives, supportive \nof equality and democracy and the working man. This bill is consistent \nwith those principles, providing working men and women with a real and \nmeaningful voice in decisions regarding unionization. It is supported \nby the National Right to Work Committee, and I am proud to have \nCongressman Tim Scott of South Carolina introducing companion \nlegislation in the House.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support the Employee Rights Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 1509. A bill to provide incentives for States to improve the well-\nbeing of children in the child welfare system through systemic reforms \nand innovations, increased collaboration between State agencies, and \nincorporation of higher standards of accountability; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nPromoting Accountability and Excellence in Child Welfare Act, a bill \nthat would pave the way for new innovations that improve the lives and \nwell-being of vulnerable children and their families.\n  The Federal government spends roughly ten times as much money on \nfoster care as it does on preventative services, when foster care is, \nin nearly every case, the worst possible outcome for a child. The \nPromoting Accountability and Excellence in Child Welfare Act would \nestablish a 5-year grant program to give States and localities greater \nflexibility to implement comprehensive reforms to existing child \nwelfare programs provided they can demonstrate success in improving \nchild well-being. This flexibility would allow States to use early-\nintervention techniques to prevent youth from entering foster care, \nheightened reunification or adoption practices to decrease a child's \ntime in care, and strengthened support services to ensure that children \nand youth do not fall behind their peers while they remain in foster \ncare. Importantly, this act establishes strong performance measures \nthat allow successful practices to serve as scalable models.\n  Children and families that come into contact with the child welfare \nsystem are often served through multiple local, State, and Federal \nagencies including the Department of Health and Human Services, the \nDepartment of Justice, the Department of Education, the Department of \nLabor and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Too often, \nthese agencies operate in silos, with the effects playing\n\n[[Page S5267]]\n\nout at the State, local, and even individual level. This act promotes \ncollaboration by requiring an inter-agency working group to identify \nexisting Federal resources and streamline them to reduce duplication \nand allow grantees to access additional services and funding streams.\n  States and localities have proven their ability to save money through \ninnovation while also working to promote the best interest of children \nand families and the Federal government often turns to state best \npractices to improve national laws. The history of subsidized \nguardianship serves as one such example. Due to an all-time high in the \nnumber of children in State foster care, in 1996 Illinois was granted \nthe authority to allow grandparents, aunts, uncles and other adult \nrelatives to receive Federal foster care payments if they opened their \nhomes permanently to their relative children in foster care. Raising a \nchild is expensive and these modest payments gave relatives the \nfinancial means to care for their kin.\n  Allowing children and youth to remain with relatives is not only a \ncompassionate way to prevent unnecessary disruptions in a child's life \nand keep families together, it also saves money. The Illinois \ndemonstration proved that children and youth did better living with \nrelative caregivers than they did when they remained in foster care. In \naddition, offering guardianship assistance to relatives actually \nincreased the odds that they would be adopted. Due to the success of \nkinship care in Illinois and other States, the Federal government now \nrealizes a cost savings by reimbursing States for a portion of the cost \nof offering guardianship assistance. The Promoting Accountability and \nExcellence in Child Welfare Act would further enable such innovations \nand savings while improving child well-being.\n  Furthermore, the legislation directs the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to report to Congress with recommendations on how to \nupdate Federal foster care financing. Under current law, eligibility \nfor Federal foster care assistance remains tied to the obsolete AFDC \nprogram, meaning each year fewer children in foster care are eligible \nfor Federal funding. As a result, States are required to take on an \never-increasing share of foster care financing. This structure forces \nStates to compensate by drawing funds from other programs such as \nTemporary Assistance to Needy Families, TANF, and the Social Security \nBlock Grant, SSBG, to provide for children in care.\n  As a country, we cannot afford to let children fall through the \ncracks of the many systems that exist to serve them. By targeting our \nresources, improving collaboration, spurring innovation, and, above \nall, holding ourselves accountable, we can systemically serve the best \ninterest of at-risk children, their families and communities, and the \nNation as a whole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5267-1", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 250--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n   MEMORIAL PARK ON HERO STREET USA, IN SILVIS, ILLINOIS, SHOULD BE \n   RECOGNIZED AS HERO STREET MEMORIAL PARK AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE \n SUPPORTED AS A PARK BY THE TOWN OF SILVIS AT NO COST TO UNITED STATES \n                               TAXPAYERS\n\n  Mr. KIRK submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 250\n\n       Whereas in the small town of Silvis, Illinois, there is a \n     street that is only one and a half blocks long;\n       Whereas formerly known as Second Street, today it is \n     officially known as Hero Street USA;\n       Whereas from this short street, brave men and women of \n     Hispanic ancestry have served in the United States Armed \n     Forces;\n       Whereas today, young men and women from Hero Street USA, \n     valiantly join the United States Armed Forces to defend the \n     Nation;\n       Whereas the memorial on Hero Street USA is located near the \n     intersection of Highway 84 and 2nd Street;\n       Whereas on the east side of Hero Street USA, the memorial \n     will honor the personal sacrifice of eight young men from \n     Hero Street USA, who were killed in defense of the United \n     States, including six during World War II, PFC Joseph H. \n     Sandoval, PFC Frank H.

Mr. President, I rise today in honor of the fallen soldiers \nfrom Hero Street USA in Silvis, Illinois and ask that the Senate \nrecognize the memorial park on Hero Street as Hero Street Memorial \nPark.\n  In 1967, 2nd Street in Silvis, Illinois was renamed ``Hero Street \nUSA'' in recognition of the fallen soldiers and their families who grew \nup on that street. When World War II and the Korean Wars broke out, 78 \nyoung Mexican-American men, who lived on Hero Street, bravely went to \nwar to serve our Nation and defend our freedoms in battle.

Res. 251\n\n       Whereas maximizing the recycling economy in the United \n     States will create and sustain additional well-paying jobs in \n     the United States, further stimulate the economy of the \n     United States, save energy, and conserve valuable natural \n     resources;\n       Whereas recycling is an important action that people in the \n     United States can take to be environmental stewards;\n       Whereas municipal recycling rates in the United States \n     steadily increased from 6.6 percent in 1970 to 28.6 percent \n     in 2000, but since 2000, the rate of increase has slowed \n     considerably;\n       Whereas a decline in manufacturing in the United States has \n     reduced both the supply of and demand for recycled materials;\n       Whereas recycling allows the United States to recover the \n     critical materials necessary to sustain the recycling economy \n     and protect national security interests in the United States;\n       Whereas recycling plays an integral role in the sustainable \n     management of materials throughout the life-cycle of a \n     product;\n       Whereas 46 States have laws promoting the recycling of \n     materials that would otherwise be incinerated or sent to a \n     landfill;\n       Whereas more than 10,000 communities in the United States \n     have residential recycling and drop-off programs that collect \n     a wide variety of recyclable materials, including\n\n[[Page S5268]]\n\n     paper, steel, aluminum, plastic, glass, and electronics;\n       Whereas, in addition to residential recycling, the scrap \n     recycling industry in the United States manufactures \n     recyclable materials collected from businesses into \n     commodity-grade materials;\n       Whereas those commodity-grade materials are used as \n     feedstock to produce new basic materials and finished \n     products in the United States and throughout the world;\n       Whereas recycling stimulates the economy and plays an \n     integral role in sustaining manufacturing in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas, in 2010, the United States recycling industry \n     collected, processed, and consumed over 130,000,000 metric \n     tons of recyclable material, valued at $77,000,000,000;\n       Whereas many manufacturers use recycled commodities to make \n     products, saving energy and reducing the need for raw \n     materials, which are generally higher-priced;\n       Whereas the recycling industry in the United States helps \n     balance the trade deficit and provides emerging economies \n     with the raw materials needed to build countries and \n     participate in the global economy;\n       Whereas, in 2010, the scrap recycling industry in the \n     United States sold over 44,000,000 metric tons of commodity-\n     grade materials, valued at almost $30,000,000,000, to over \n     154 countries;\n       Whereas recycling saves energy by decreasing the amount of \n     energy needed to manufacture the products that people build, \n     buy, and use;\n       Whereas using recycled materials in place of raw materials \n     can result in energy savings of 92 percent for aluminum cans, \n     87 percent for mixed plastics, 63 percent for steel cans, 45 \n     percent for recycled newspaper, and 34 percent for recycled \n     glass; and\n       Whereas a bipartisan Senate Recycling Caucus and a \n     bipartisan House Recycling Caucus were established in 2006 to \n     provide a permanent and long-term way for members of Congress \n     to obtain in-depth knowledge about the recycling industry and \n     to help promote the many benefits of recycling: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses support for improvement in the collection, \n     processing, and consumption of recyclable material throughout \n     the United States in order to create well-paying jobs, foster \n     innovation and investment in the United States recycling \n     infrastructure, and stimulate the economy of the United \n     States;\n       (2) expresses support for strengthening the manufacturing \n     base in the United States in order to rebuild the domestic \n     economy, which will increase the supply, demand, and \n     consumption of recyclable and recycled materials in the \n     United States;\n       (3) expresses support for a competitive marketplace for \n     recyclable materials;\n       (4) expresses support for the trade of recyclable \n     commodities, which is an integral part of the domestic and \n     global economy;\n       (5) expresses support for policies in the United States \n     that promote recycling of materials, including paper, which \n     is commonly recycled rather than thermally combusted or sent \n     to a landfill;\n       (6) expresses support for policies in the United States \n     that recognize and promote recyclable materials as essential \n     economic commodities, rather than wastes;\n       (7) expresses support for policies in the United States \n     that promote using recyclable materials as feedstock to \n     produce new basic materials and finished products throughout \n     the world;\n       (8) expresses support for research and development of new \n     technologies to more efficiently and effectively recycle \n     materials such as automobile shredder residue and cathode ray \n     tubes;\n       (9) expresses support for research and development of new \n     technologies to remove materials that are impediments to \n     recycling, such as radioactive material, polychlorinated \n     biphenyls, mercury-containing devices, and \n     chlorofluorocarbons;\n       (10) expresses support for Design for Recycling, to improve \n     the design and manufacture of goods to ensure that, at the \n     end of a useful life, a good can, to the maximum extent \n     practicable, be recycled safely and economically;\n       (11) recognizes that the scrap recycling industry in the \n     United States is a manufacturing industry that is critical to \n     the future of the United States;\n       (12) expresses support for policies in the United States \n     that establish the equitable treatment of recycled materials;

Res. 256\n\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics are nonprofit \n     community-based health care sites that offer primary care and \n     wellness services based on the nursing model;\n       Whereas the nursing model emphasizes the protection, \n     promotion, and optimization of health, the prevention of \n     illness, the alleviation of suffering, and the diagnosis and \n     treatment of illness;\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics are led by advanced \n     practice nurses and staffed by an interdisciplinary team of \n     highly qualified health care professionals;\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics offer a broad scope of \n     services including treatment for acute and chronic illnesses, \n     routine physical exams, immunizations for adults and \n     children, disease screenings, health education, prenatal \n     care, dental care, and drug and alcohol treatment;\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics have a proven track \n     record, as the first federally funded nurse-managed health \n     clinic was created more than 35 years ago;\n       Whereas, as of June 2011, more than 250 nurse-managed \n     health clinics provided care across the United States and \n     recorded more than 2,000,000 client encounters annually;\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics serve a unique dual \n     role as both health care safety net access points and health \n     workforce development sites, given that the majority of \n     nurse-managed health clinics are affiliated with schools of \n     nursing and serve as clinical education sites for students \n     entering the health profession;\n       Whereas nurse-managed health clinics strengthen the health \n     care safety net by expanding access to primary care and \n     chronic disease management services for vulnerable and \n     medically underserved populations in diverse rural, urban, \n     and suburban communities;\n       Whereas research has shown that nurse-managed health \n     clinics experience high patient retention and patient \n     satisfaction rates, and nurse-managed health clinic patients \n     experience higher rates of generic medication fills and lower \n     hospitalization rates when compared to similar safety net \n     providers; and\n       Whereas the use of nurse-managed health clinics offering \n     both primary care and wellness services will help meet this \n     increased demand in a cost-effective manner: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of October 2 through October 8, \n     2011, as ``National Nurse-Managed Health Clinic Week'';\n       (2) supports the ideals and goals of National Nurse-Managed \n     Health Clinic Week; and\n       (3) encourages the expansion of nurse-managed health \n     clinics so that nurse-managed health clinics may continue to \n     serve as health care workforce development sites for the next \n     generation of primary care providers.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today Senator Alexander and I rise to \nrecognize over 250 Nurse-Managed Health Clinics in a Resolution \ndesignating the week of October 2, 2011, as National Nurse-Managed \nHealth Clinic Week. Nurse-managed health clinics provide primary care \nand wellness services to a diverse population through all age groups \nand ethnicities. These clinics provide care to over two million \npatients in underserved or vulnerable areas across this country. Nurse-\nmanaged health clinics offer a full range of accessible and affordable \nhealth services, including primary care, health promotion, and disease \nprevention to low-income, as well as un-and under insured patients, \nregardless of their ability to pay. The care is primarily provided by \nnurse practitioners working in partnership with an interdisciplinary \nteam of health professions including clinical nurse specialists, \nregistered nurses, health educators, community outreach workers, health \ncare students, and collaborating physicians. As recognized by the \nInstitute of Medicine's ``Future of Nursing'' report, the nurse managed \nclinics play a critical role in community-based preventive health care \nand have done so since their inception three decades ago.\n  A Senate resolution will help pave the way for this effort. We ask \nour colleagues to join us in supporting this tribute to Nurse-Managed \nHealth Clinics.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5270-1", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 28--AUTHORIZING THE USE OF EMANCIPATION \n     HALL IN THE CAPITOL VISITOR CENTER FOR AN EVENT TO AWARD THE \n     CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL, COLLECTIVELY, TO THE 100TH INFANTRY \nBATTALION, 442ND REGIMENTAL COMBAT TEAM, AND THE MILITARY INTELLIGENCE \nSERVICE, UNITED STATES ARMY, IN RECOGNITION OF THEIR DEDICATED SERVICE \n                          DURING WORLD WAR II\n\n  Mr. INOUYE (for himself and Mrs. Boxer) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, first of all, I appreciate your patience \npresiding over the Senate at this late hour. I extend my appreciation \nto this staff, everybody here, for all this work. About the last month \nhas been very difficult. I appreciate very much the professionalism \nthat is shown here in the Senate and the efforts they go to to make all \nof us look good. Sometimes that takes a lot of effort. But I do \nappreciate their working so hard together here at the desk. If there is \never anything that is bipartisan, it is right here, Republicans and \nDemocrats, and there is no partisanship on the Senate floor. Step back \na little bit and there is when we are away from the professional staff, \nbut I appreciate very much their hard work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5280-3", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5280-S5281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            EXTENSION OF THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have tried for days now to change what \nthe Republicans in the House have tried to do to the American people. \nIn fact, it appears they are going to be able to do it. We have the \nextension of the Federal Aviation Administration legislation that is \nbeing held up. We wanted a temporary extension for the next few weeks. \nWe have already extended it more than 20 times. We thought we should do \nit again. We have done that. That has been routine until we get some of \nthe big issues worked out. But Republicans wanted to increase the ante \na little bit this time with essential air service. In Pennsylvania, \nsome of the rural areas--the Presiding Officer is from Pennsylvania; of \ncourse, Nevada has a lot of rural areas, and other States. Even the \nheavily populated State of New York has essential air service. \nEssential air service was set up a long time ago to allow \nunderpopulated areas to be able to be in touch with the rest of the \nStates.\n  The Republicans have tried to eliminate essential air service. That \nis the ransom we are asking now for an extension of the FAA bill. I am \nnot going to ask consent today; we have asked it many times. But I want \nthe Record to be spread with how unreasonable it is, what the \nRepublicans have done. As a result of their activities, the House \nRepublicans, we have 80,000 people who will not be working now--80,000 \npeople, more than 70,000 construction workers and thousands of people \nwho are employees of the Federal Aviation Administration.\n  For example, in Nevada we have an air traffic control tower, a new \none that needs to be built. It is going to be big, expensive, and \nnecessary. The work has stopped. They worked there for less than a \nmonth. The work has stopped. The construction work has stopped.\n  I talked to the Senator from California, Senator Boxer, today. In \nPalm Springs they have one that is essential, is badly needed. Work has \nstopped on that.\n  Construction projects all over America are held up at our airports. \nIt is so very unreasonable what they have done. I appreciate Kay Bailey \nHutchison, the Republican Senator from Texas, who has worked with the \nchairman of the committee, Jay Rockefeller, to try to work past this. \nShe agrees with Senator Rockefeller it is unreasonable that they have \ndone this.\n  What I want to do is read a column out of the New York Times of July \n29. The writer introduces his column by saying:\n\n       The facts of the crisis over the debt ceiling aren't \n     complicated. Republicans have, in effect, taken America \n     hostage, threatening to undermine the economy and disrupt the \n     essential business of government unless they get policy \n     concessions they would never have been able to enact through \n     legislation.\n\n  That is where we are with the FAA problem. He goes on to say:\n\n       As I said, it's not complicated. Yet many people in the \n     news media apparently can't bring themselves to acknowledge \n     this simple reality. News reports portray the parties as \n     equally intransigent; pundits fantasize about some kind of \n     ``centrist'' uprising, as if the problem was too much \n     partisanship on both sides. Some of us have long complained \n     about the cult of ``balance,'' the insistence on portraying \n     both parties as equally wrong and equally at fault on any \n     issue, never mind the facts. I joked long ago that if one \n     party declared that the earth was flat, the headlines would \n     read ``Views Differ on Shape of Planet.'' But would that cult \n     still rule in a situation as stark as the one we now face, in \n     which one party is clearly engaged in blackmail?\n\n  He went on to say more and then he said:\n\n       The answer, it turns out, is yes. And this is no laughing \n     matter: The cult of balance has played an important role in \n     bringing us to the edge of disaster. For when reporting on \n     political disputes always implies that both sides are to \n     blame, there is no penalty for extremism. Voters won't punish \n     you for outrageous behavior if all they ever hear is that \n     both sides are at fault.\n\n  Mr. President, I wish the press would report this outrageous conduct \non the part of the House Republicans, in effect closing down work for \n80,000 people in America because of their trying to eliminate essential \nair service.\n  The issue is certainly more than that. We know it is a labor issue. \nWe have one airline that is terribly anti-union and they are the ones \nbehind all this. They are using the essential air service as a guise to \nget what they want.\n  I am not going to ask consent, but I want the American people to know \nwhy essential air service is being attacked\n\n[[Page S5281]]\n\nand why 80,000 people are basically today not going to be able to go to \nwork tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/08/02/senate-section/article/S5281-1", "month": "08", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations: \nCalendar Nos. 95, 230, 232, 254, 255, 256, 257, 265, 266, 267, 268, \n269, 275, 277, 278, 279, 280, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 288, and \nCalendar Nos. 291 through 323, and nominations placed on the \nSecretary's Desk in the Air Force, Army, Foreign Service, Marine Corps, \nand Navy; that the nominations be confirmed en bloc, the motions to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no \nintervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to \nany of the nominations; that any related statements be printed in the \nRecord; and that President Obama be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for the second year in a row, the Senate \nhas failed to take significant steps before the August recess to \naddress the serious crisis of judicial vacancies on courts around the \ncountry. Last August, Senate Republicans left 17 judicial nominations \npending and consented to confirm only four Federal circuit and district \ncourt nominations before the recess. I noted at that time what a \nserious blow that was to our ability to make progress addressing the \njudicial vacancies crisis that had already persisted for well over a \nyear. Today, as the Senate recesses with judicial vacancies still near \n90 as they were a year ago, the Senate is doing even worse, confirming \nonly 4 judicial nominations of the 24 nominees already considered by \nthe Judiciary Committee and awaiting a Senate vote.\n  Last week, I urged the Senate to confirm the two dozen judicial \nnominations already fully considered by the Judiciary Committee and \nready for final action by the Senate. Of them, 20 were unanimously \nreported, without a single negative vote. Many have been pending \nwithout final action for months. I am, again, disappointed as Senate \nRepublicans continue to delay these much needed and long awaited \nconfirmations.\n  Even though Federal judicial vacancies have remained near or above 90 \nfor more than 2 years, the Senate's Republican leadership has refused \nto consent to vote on these qualified, consensus nominations, leaving \n16 of the 20 unanimously reported nominees in limbo. This is not the \nway to make real progress. The American people should not have to wait \nmore weeks and months for the Senate to do its constitutional duty and \nensure the ability of our Federal courts to provide justice to \nAmericans around the country.\n  In the past, we were able to confirm consensus nominees more \npromptly. They were not forced to languish for months. In the second \nyear of the Bush administration, in 2002, before the August recess the \nSenate moved ahead to confirm a dozen judicial nominees. The next year, \nwith a Republican Senate majority, Senate Democrats consented to seven \nconfirmations before the August recess. With the delays that have been \nbacklogging confirmations for years now, we have 20 unanimously \nreported judicial nominees who could all have been confirmed before \nthis recess. Regrettably, 16 will not go forward today because \nRepublicans refuse to consent.\n  At a time when judicial vacancies remain near 90, these needless \ndelays perpetuate the judicial vacancies crisis that Chief Justice \nRoberts wrote of last December and that the President, the Attorney \nGeneral, bar associations, and chief judges around the country have \nurged us to join together to end. The Senate can and should be doing a \nbetter job working to ensure the ability of our Federal courts to \nprovide justice to Americans around the country.\n  Just last week, the Congressional Research Service released a report \nthat confirms what many of us have been saying for some time: This is \nthe longest sustained period of historically high vacancy rates on the \nFederal judiciary in the last 35 years.\n  This is hardly surprising. Republican obstruction kept the total \nconfirmations in the first year of the President's term to the lowest \ntotal for a first year in more than 50 years, when only 12 judicial \nnominees were allowed to be considered. Republican obstruction kept the \n2-year total of confirmations to the lowest total in 35 years, for the \nfirst 2 years of a President's term, with only a total of 60 Federal \ncircuit and district court nominations confirmed during the course of \nthose entire first 2 years of the Obama administration. Accordingly, \njudicial vacancies have perpetuated needlessly and caused needless \ndelay on consensus nominees.\n  We are seeing it, again, this week as we approach the August recess \nin the third year of the Obama administration. In the 17 months I \nchaired the Judiciary Committee during President Bush's first term, the \nSenate confirmed 100 of his Federal circuit and district court \nnominees. It looks like it will take twice as long to reach 100 \nconfirmations of President Obama's Federal circuit and district court \nnominees. President Obama has been in office for 31 months and only 95 \nof his Federal circuit and district court nominees have been confirmed. \nThere are two dozen more that are stalled, awaiting final Senate \naction. By the August recess in the third year of the Bush \nadministration, the Senate had confirmed 143 Federal circuit and \ndistrict court judges. This year, the comparable number is only 95.\n  It is not accurate to pretend that real progress is being made in \nthese circumstances. Vacancies are being kept high, consensus nominees \nare being delayed and it is the American people and the Federal courts \nthat are being made to suffer. This is another area in which we must \ncome together for the American people. There is no reason Senators \ncannot join together to finally bring down the excessive number of \nvacancies that have persisted on Federal courts throughout the Nation \nfor far too long.\n  I have always taken seriously the responsibility of the Senate to \nmake sure that the Federal judiciary has the resources it needs. Senate \nRepublicans had pocket-filibustered more than 60 of President Clinton's \njudicial nominations and refused to proceed on them while judicial \nvacancies skyrocketed to more than 110. Despite that, in the 17 months \nI chaired the Judiciary Committee during President Bush's first 2 years \nin office, the Senate proceeded to confirm 100 of his judicial \nnominees; during the next 24 months, with a Republican majority in the \nSenate, confirmed 105 more, for a total of 205 confirmed judges during \nPresident Bush's first term. We have a long way to go for the Senate to \nbe as productive as we were during President Bush's first term.\n  We were able to lower vacancies dramatically during President Bush's \nyears in office, cutting them in half during his first term. The Senate \nhas reversed course during the Obama administration, and with \nRepublican objections slowing the pace of confirmations, judicial \nvacancies have been at crisis levels for over 2 years. Over the 8 years \nof the Bush administration, from 2001 to 2009, we reduced judicial \nvacancies from 110 to a low of 34. They now stand at 88 vacancies. The \nvacancy rate--which we reduced from 10 percent to 6 percent by this \ndate in President Bush's third year, and ultimately to less than 4 \npercent in 2008--is back above 10 percent.\n  Time and time again over the last 2\\1/2\\ years, I have urged the \nSenate to come together and work to address this crisis. At the \nbeginning of this year, I called for a return to regular order in the \nconsideration of nominations. We\n\n[[Page S5286]]\n\nhave seen that approach work on the Judiciary Committee. I have thanked \nthe Judiciary Committee's ranking member, Senator Grassley, many times \nfor his cooperation with me to make sure that the committee continues \nto make progress in the consideration of nominations. His approach has \nbeen the right approach. Regrettably, it has not been matched on the \nfloor, where the refusal by Republican leadership to come to regular \ntime agreements to consider nominations has put our progress--our \npositive action--at risk.\n  Republican obstruction has led to a backlog of two dozen judicial \nnominations pending on the Senate's Executive Calendar. More than half \nof the judicial nominations on the calendar would fill judicial \nemergency vacancies. Yet, due to Republican objections, we have lost \nanother opportunity to make progress by confirming consensus \nnominations.\n  Before the Memorial Day recess, I urged that the Senate to take up \nand vote on the many consensus judicial nominations then on the \ncalendar and ready for final action. But Republican Senators would not \nagree to consider a single one. With nearly 20 judicial nominees \navailable to the Senate for final action, only 1 was considered before \nthe July 4 recess. In fact, the Senate has now considered only 11 \nnominations in the last 10 weeks and has only confirmed a total of 18 \njudicial nominees who had their hearings this year.\n  Senate Republicans have departed from the Senate's traditional \npractice by refusing to confirm even unanimous, consensus nominees. I \nstill await an explanation from the other side of the aisle why these \nnominations could not be considered and confirmed. Republican \nleadership should explain to the people and Senators from Tennessee, \nSouth Carolina, Florida, Texas, Missouri, Louisiana, Maine, New York, \nArkansas, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania why there continue to be \nvacancies on the Federal courts in their States that could easily be \nfilled if the Senate would do its constitutional duty and vote on the \nPresident's nominations. These judicial nominees have the support of \nRepublican home State Senators. In fact, there are multiple nominees \nstill pending from Louisiana and Pennsylvania. Yet those nominees still \nwait for months on the Senate's calendar without explanation for the \ndamaging delays, leaving the people of those States to bear the brunt \nof having too few judges.\n  All 24 of the judicial nominations on the calendar have been \nfavorably reported by the Judiciary after a fair but thorough process. \nWe review extensive background material on each nominee. All Senators \non the committee, Democratic and Republican, have the opportunity to \nask the nominees questions at a live hearing. Senators also have the \nopportunity to ask questions in writing following the hearing and to \nmeet with the nominees. All of these nominees have a strong commitment \nto the rule of law and a demonstrated faithfulness to the Constitution. \nThey should not be delayed for weeks and months needlessly after being \nso thoroughly and fairly considered by the Judiciary Committee.\n  Last week, the president of the American Bar Association, Stephen \nZack, wrote to the Senate leaders ``to urge [them] to redouble [their] \nefforts to fill existing judicial vacancies promptly so that the \nfederal courts will have the judges they need to uphold the rule of law \nand deliver timely justice.'' He wrote:\n\n       As lawyers who practice in federal courts across this \n     nation, ABA members know firsthand that long-standing \n     vacancies on courts with staggering caseloads impede access \n     to the courts and create strains that will inevitably reduce \n     the quality of our justice system and erode public confidence \n     in the ability of the courts to vindicate constitutional \n     rights or render fair and timely decisions.\n\n  Mr. Zack's concerns echo those of Chief Justice Roberts, the \nPresident, the Attorney General, bar associations, and chief judges \naround the country who have also urged us to join together to end the \njudicial vacancies crisis. The Senate can and should be doing a better \njob working to ensure the ability of our Federal courts to provide \njustice to Americans around the country.\n  The four nominees the Senate will consider today like so many others \nleft on the calendar have the strong support of their home State \nSenators--Republicans and Democrats--and all were reported unanimously \nby the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  Kathleen Williams was first nominated over a year ago to fill a \njudicial emergency vacancy in the Southern District of Florida. Her \nnomination has the support of both of her home State Senators--Senator \nBill Nelson, a Democrat, and Senator Rubio, a Republican--and was \nreported without objection by the Judiciary Committee on May 12. Ms. \nWilliams has been the Federal public defender for the Southern District \nof Florida for 15 years, having been appointed five times by the \nEleventh Circuit, most recently earlier this year. Ms. Williams was \npreviously a Federal prosecutor in the Southern District of Florida, \nand she also worked in private civil litigation. Her balance of \nexperience as a prosecutor and as a public defender providing legal \nservices to thousands of defendants who cannot afford their own \nattorney will serve her well on the Federal bench.\n  Sara Darrow was nominated over 8 months ago to fill a judicial \nvacancy in the Central District of Illinois. Ms. Darrow has the \nbipartisan support of her home State Senators, Senator Durbin, a \nDemocrat, and Senator Kirk, a Republican. Ms. Darrow has been a \nprosecutor for over 12 years, working as a State's Attorney for \nIllinois and later as a Federal prosecutor in Illinois and Iowa. She is \ncurrently chief of the violent crimes unit in the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice for the Central District of Illinois. Her nomination was \nreported by the Judiciary Committee without objection on May 12.\n  Nelva Gonzales Ramos was nominated in January of this year to fill a \njudicial emergency vacancy in the Southern District of Texas. Her \nnomination has the strong support of both her Republican home State \nSenators, Senators Cornyn and Hutchison, and was reported by the \nJudiciary Committee without objection May 12. She has served for over \n12 years as a State judge in Texas, where she has presided over more \nthan 1,200 cases. Judge Ramos has been reelected twice by the people of \nTexas to serve as a State judge. Prior to joining the bench, she also \nhad a successful career as a litigator in private practice.\n  Richard Brooke Jackson was first nominated over 10 months ago to fill \na judicial emergency vacancy in the District of Colorado. He is \ncurrently the chief judge for the First Judicial District in Colorado, \nwhere he has served for over 13 years, earning recognitions as the \n``Best State Judge in Colorado'' in 2010. Prior to joining the bench, \nJudge Jackson practiced law for 26 years in Denver, CO, where he was \nmade a fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers. Judge Jackson's \nnomination has the strong support of both of his home State Senators, \nSenator Udall and Senator Bennet, and was reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee without objection on May 12.\n  The Senate's failure to take action and vote on 20 of the 24 judicial \nnominees reviewed by the Judiciary Committee and reported favorably to \nthe Senate is yet another in a long line of missed opportunities to \ncome together for the American people. This is not how the Senate has \nacted in years past with other Presidents' judicial nominees. Vacancies \nare being kept high, consensus nominees are being delayed, and it is \nthe American people and the Federal courts that are being made to \nsuffer.\n  I hope that when we return from the August recess, Senators can \nfinally join together to begin to bring down the excessive number of \nvacancies that have persisted on Federal courts throughout the Nation \nfor far too long. We can and must do better.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a recent letter from the President of \nthe American Bar Association and a recent column by Professor Carl \nTobias be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     American Bar Association,\n\n                                       Chicago, IL, July 28, 2011.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: On \n     behalf of the\n\n[[Page S5287]]\n\n     American Bar Association, I am writing to urge you to \n     redouble your efforts to fill existing judicial vacancies \n     promptly so that the federal courts will have the judges they \n     need to uphold the rule of law and deliver timely justice.\n       There is no priority higher to the Association than to \n     assure that we have a fully staffed and fully operating \n     federal bench. That is why I have used my position as ABA \n     president this past year to speak out repeatedly about the \n     urgent need to fill existing vacancies.\n       We commend the Congress for starting the session by \n     instituting procedural changes and approaching the \n     confirmation process with a fresh sense of urgency, which has \n     helped restore regular order to the process. As a result, the \n     President has made 87 judicial nominations and the Senate has \n     regularly scheduled up-or-down votes and confirmed 31 \n     nominees this session.\n       However, no significant reduction in the high number of \n     vacancies has been achieved: there are only 4 fewer vacancies \n     on the federal bench today than there were January 1 of this \n     year, and 10 percent of the authorized judgeships remain \n     vacant. During the past two years--since August 2009--the \n     vacancy rate has fluctuated, but it has never dropped below \n     10 percent.\n       Thirty-eight of the present vacancies have existed for so \n     long and created such untenable workloads for the remaining \n     judges on the courts that the seats have been declared \n     judicial emergencies by the Administrative Office of the U.S. \n     Courts. As lawyers who practice in federal courts across this \n     nation, ABA members know firsthand that long-standing \n     vacancies on courts with staggering caseloads impede access \n     to the courts and create strains that will inevitably reduce \n     the quality of our justice system and erode public confidence \n     in the ability of the courts to vindicate constitutional \n     rights or render fair and timely decisions. In Arizona, for \n     example, the Speedy Trial Act has been temporarily waived, \n     and criminal defendants wait up to 6 months for a trial, \n     while businesses and individuals wait up to 2 years before \n     their cases are heard.\n       We realize that the aging of our federal judiciary has \n     contributed to the growing vacancy crisis. In July alone, 10 \n     new vacancies were created through death, retirement and \n     elevation, and we already know that an additional 11 \n     vacancies will arise before the end of this year solely as a \n     result of planned retirements. According to Department of \n     Justice estimates, 60 new vacancies will be created through \n     attrition each year for the next decade. Obviously, progress \n     toward reducing vacancies requires a confirmation rate that \n     outpaces the attrition rate; at present, it is barely keeping \n     abreast of it.\n       The inescapable conclusion is that despite good intentions \n     and modest progress, the current pace of nominations and \n     confirmations is inadequate to the job. To achieve a \n     significant and lasting reduction in the vacancy rate, both \n     the Administration and the Senate need to engage in a \n     concerted and sustained effort to expedite the process; there \n     is an obvious starting point.\n       We believe the positions of both Senator Leahy and Senator \n     Grassley with regard to the pending consensus nominees \n     provide useful guidance: Senator Leahy has long urged swift \n     action and up-or-down votes on all consensus nominees, and \n     Senator Grassley, recently attesting to Republican \n     ``cooperation and positive action,'' observed, ``We are \n     moving forward on the consensus nominees.''\n       At present there is a backlog of 24 nominees awaiting a \n     floor vote, 20 of whom were reported out of the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee on voice vote with no recorded \n     opposition. We urge you as Majority and Minority Leaders to \n     schedule immediate up-or-down votes on these 20 consensus \n     nominees before the Senate adjourns for the upcoming August \n     recess.\n       Swift confirmation of these nominees would provide \n     immediate relief to some of the most overburdened courts and \n     would lower the vacancy rate to approximately 8 percent. \n     Longterm permanent progress, however, will require more than \n     this one-time fix. To effect lasting change, we also continue \n     to urge the President and members of the Senate to act with \n     common purpose to fill judicial vacancies promptly throughout \n     this Congress so that the federal courts will not be deprived \n     of the judges they need to do their important work.\n           Sincerely,\n     Stephen N. Zack.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      [From FindLaw, Aug. 1, 2011]\n\n             Confirming Circuit Judges in the 112th Senate\n\n                            (By Carl Tobias)\n\n       When President Barack Obama was inaugurated, the United \n     States Courts of Appeals experienced vacancies in fourteen of \n     the 179 judgeships. Thus, it was critical that the \n     administration promptly fill those openings. The White House \n     has instituted many practices to facilitate appointments. \n     However, numerous seats remain vacant and more have opened, \n     as judges have retired or assumed senior status, so the total \n     is presently nineteen. A trenchant example is the August 2009 \n     Sixth Circuit nomination of Nashville practitioner Jane \n     Branstetter Stranch. Because the empty appellate seats \n     undermine the judiciary's expeditious, economical and fair \n     disposition of appeals and Ms. Stranch had waited thirteen \n     months for a floor vote, the Senate ultimately approved her \n     last September. Now that the 112th Senate has concluded its \n     first seven months and Obama has proffered nominees for ten \n     of the appeals court openings, he must swiftly nominate \n     excellent candidates for the remaining vacancies, while the \n     upper chamber must expeditiously confirm the appellate \n     nominees. Indeed, Senator Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the \n     Minority Leader, should agree on a floor debate and vote for \n     Sixth Circuit nominee Bernice Donald before the August recess \n     because she is a well qualified, uncontroversial District \n     Judge whom Obama nominated last December 1.\n       There are a few reasons for the empty judgeships. For \n     instance, President George W. Bush ineffectively attempted to \n     fill Sixth Circuit openings. He rarely consulted with \n     senators from jurisdictions with vacancies or tapped \n     consensus picks. Two Michigan Sixth Circuit posts lacked \n     judges for a decade and were only filled when the parties \n     reached a 2008 compromise.\n       Obama has invoked several measures to promptly fill all the \n     current openings. He rapidly consulted home-state elected \n     officials before actual nominations. Most officers have \n     cooperated with the White House and promptly suggested \n     candidates who are very smart, ethical, independent and \n     diligent and have balanced temperament. The White House \n     specifically consulted Tennessee Republican Senators Lamar \n     Alexander and Bob Corker, who agreed to support Ms. Stranch. \n     The President nominated the lawyer in August 2009, while the \n     Judiciary Committee afforded her an October hearing at which \n     the Tennessee senators appeared and voiced their support. The \n     committee reported Stranch on a 15-4 vote in November 2009. \n     The nominee then languished on the Senate floor for ten \n     months.\n       Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the Judiciary Committee \n     Chair, worked on securing Ms. Stranch's Senate floor \n     consideration. For instance, Leahy cooperated with Senator \n     Alexander in requesting that Senator McConnell work with \n     Senator Harry Reid (D-Nev.), the Majority Leader, to swiftly \n     arrange the nominee's debate and vote. On July 20, 2010, \n     Senators Leahy and Alexander worked together on the floor. \n     Leahy lauded Ms. Stranch's capabilities, emphasized her \n     protracted wait and sought unanimous consent to consider the \n     nominee. Senator Alexander agreed that ``Jane Stranch is a \n     well-qualified nominee [and] is the longest pending circuit \n     court nominee'' and asked for a prompt vote. Senator \n     McConnell stated that some Republicans voted against Ms. \n     Stranch in committee and that he would attempt to have the \n     Senate act on her soon. One week later, President Obama asked \n     that McConnell cooperate in filling the ``vacancies that \n     continue to plague the judiciary'' and seemingly alluded to \n     Ms. Stranch when he observed that nominees have been \n     ``waiting up to eight months to be confirmed.''\n       Obama meticulously picked Stranch as his first nominee for \n     the Sixth Circuit, which includes Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, \n     and Tennessee, because she had assembled a stellar record as \n     a Nashville attorney over three decades. The nominee earned \n     the highest ABA ranking of well qualified from a minority of \n     its committee and a rating of qualified from a substantial \n     majority. Notwithstanding Stranch's excellent background, the \n     chamber failed to hold her floor debate and vote before the \n     Senate recessed last August. However, the chamber agreed to \n     schedule a vote the day that the Senate returned. After brief \n     debate, senators finally approved Stranch 71-21.\n       Openings in more than ten percent of the federal appellate \n     judgeships show that President Obama must expeditiously \n     proffer nominees for all nineteen vacancies and the Senate \n     ought to swiftly confirm them. Jane Branstetter Stranch's \n     experience demonstrates that there is no reason for delay. \n     Senator McConnell must specifically agree to a floor vote for \n     Judge Donald prior to the August recess because she has been \n     waiting eight months. Quickly filling the empty posts is \n     essential because the courts need all of their judges to \n     deliver justice.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today the Senate will confirm four \nnominees to be U.S. district judge. Three of these seats, the vacancy \nfor the Southern District of Texas, the vacancy for the Southern \nDistrict of Florida and the vacancy for the District of Colorado, have \nbeen designated as judicial emergencies. With the votes today, we will \nhave confirmed 33 article III judicial nominees. Twenty-one of those \nconfirmed have been for judicial emergencies.\n  We continue to make great progress in processing President Obama's \njudicial nominees. As we head into our August recess, the Senate has \nconfirmed 62 percent of President Obama's nominees since the beginning \nof his Presidency. That is not including the two the Supreme Court \nJustices nominated by President Obama. As my colleagues are aware, \nthose nominations consumed a considerable amount of time in the \ncommittee and on the Senate floor.\n  During this Congress, the Judiciary Committee has held hearings on \nmore than 75 percent of the President's judicial nominees. During the \ncomparable time period for President Bush, only 70 percent of President \nBush's nominees\n\n[[Page S5288]]\n\nhad hearings by this time. We have also reported 61 percent of the \njudicial nominees, which is comparable to President Bush's nominees.\n  I support these nominations and congratulate each of them. I would \nlike to say a few words about each one of the nominees.\n  Sara Lynn Darrow is nominated to be U.S. district judge for the \nCentral District of Illinois. Ms. Darrow graduated from Marquette \nUniversity in 1992 and received her J.D. degree from St. Louis \nUniversity School of Law in 1997.

After graduation from the University of \nTexas School of Law in 1991, Judge Ramos began her career as an \nattorney at Meredith & Donnelly in Corpus Christi.

Williams is nominated to be U.S. district judge for the \nSouthern District of Florida. She received her B.A. in 1978 and her \nJ.D. in 1982 from the University of Miami School of Law.

Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the nomination \nof Sara Darrow to serve as a district court judge for the Central \nDistrict of Illinois.\n  Sara Darrow is a superb nominee, and she will make an excellent \naddition to the Federal bench.\n  Her nomination is not controversial. She had her hearing before the \nJudiciary Committee in April and was reported out of the committee by \nunanimous voice vote on May 12.\n  Sara Darrow's name was recommended to me by a bipartisan merit \nselection committee that I established to consider applicants for \njudicial vacancies.\n  I was proud to recommend her name to the President last year, and I \nwas pleased to see the President nominate her to fill the Central \nDistrict judgeship that was vacated when Judge Joe Billy McDade took \nsenior status last year.\n  I want to thank Chairman Pat Leahy of the Judiciary Committee for \nmoving Ms. Darrow's nomination through the committee. I also want to \nthank Senator Mark Kirk for his support of this nomination.\n  Once the Senate confirms Sara Darrow, we will finally have a full \ncomplement of judges for the Central District of Illinois. Last year \nthere was only one judge in this district--Chief Judge Mike McCuskey--\nand three judgeships were vacant.\n  These vacancies left the Central District in a dire situation. Cases \nwere grinding to a halt, and Judge McCuskey had to drive all across the \nState to try to keep the dockets moving.\n  Fortunately, earlier this year the Senate confirmed Judge Jim Shadid \nand Judge Sue Myerscough to serve in the Central District. They are \nserving on the bench now.\n  And with Sara Darrow on the bench as well, the Central District will \nfinally be operating at full strength. That is good news for the people \nwho live in the 46 Illinois counties that make up the Central District.\n  Sara Darrow has a distinguished record, including her service as a \nprosecutor both at the State and Federal level.\n  She currently serves as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Illinois \nCentral District, where she has worked since 2003. She works out of the \nRock Island branch of the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n  She has investigated and prosecuted hundreds of defendants for \nvarious Federal crimes including gang offenses, drug conspiracies, gun \ncrimes, bank robbery, money laundering, and fraud. She has also written \nand argued numerous appeals.\n\n[[Page S5289]]\n\n  Since 2007, Ms. Darrow has served as the violent crimes chief for the \nU.S. Attorney's Office. She has also served as the office's project \nsafe neighborhoods coordinator.\n  Before becoming a Federal prosecutor, Ms. Darrow worked in private \npractice in Rock Island, and she also worked as a prosecutor in the \nHenry County State's Attorney's Office.\n  She served as an assistant State's attorney in Henry County from 1999 \nto 2000, and then as first assistant State's attorney from 2000 to \n2003.\n  While serving at the State's Attorney's Office she prosecuted a wide \nrange of State felony cases. She also was responsible for supervising \nstaff attorneys and managing the office's caseload.\n  Ms. Darrow enjoys an excellent reputation among the legal community \nin the Central District. She will serve the people of Illinois well in \nher new capacity as a Federal judge.\n  In addition to her impressive professional accomplishments, Sara \nDarrow is an impressive person with a wonderful family.\n  She is a graduate of Marquette University and Saint Louis University \nSchool of Law.\n  While a college student at Marquette, she interned in Washington, DC, \nfor Senator Carl Levin. It was on Capitol Hill where Sara met and began \ndating her husband Clarence, who was then working for Congressman Lane \nEvans.\n  Sara and Clarence are now blessed to be the proud parents of six \nchildren: Connor, age 14; Lilia, 13; Augie, 12; Anna Grace, 10; Ella, \n8; and Danny, 5.\n  And Sara Darrow also has an impressive record of service in the \ncommunity of Rock Island, IL. She is truly a credit to this community.\n  In short, Ms. Darrow has the experience, qualifications and \ntemperament to be an excellent Federal judge.\n  I enthusiastically support her nomination and urge my colleagues to \ndo the same.\n\n\n                        nomination of gary locke\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to \ncongratulate and pay tribute to Gary Locke, who has been the Secretary \nof Commerce since March 2009 and was recently confirmed by the Senate \nto be the U.S. Ambassador to China. Secretary Locke has been a truly \noutstanding public servant, and I applaud him as he continues his \nservice to our country in China. His service truly makes our country a \nbetter place.\n  As Secretary of Commerce, Gary Locke has been an aggressive leader at \nthe Department of Commerce, and has earned a reputation as a strong \nmanager and an innovator.\n  Among his many successes at Commerce, he has helped innovators by \npushing the Patent and Trademark Office to streamline the process to \nget a patent.\n  Secretary Locke worked with the Economic Development Administration \nto streamline its approval process. The EDA is a crucial program, which \nmakes business-development grants to distressed communities. Programs \nsuch as EDA help ordinary Americans and small businesses and will help \nmove the economy forward. I appreciate Secretary Locke's commitment to \nprograms such as EDA and helping these communities.\n  In this time of fiscal austerity, he brought the 2010 census in 25 \npercent under budget, saving taxpayers $1.9 billion. He led an \norganization that still got the census information that we need to get \na true picture of the makeup of our Nation.\n  I also appreciate his hard work to meet the Obama administration's \ngoal to double exports within 5 years. Currently, only 1 percent of \nAmerican companies export, and Secretary Locke understands the crucial \nneed for expanded U.S. exports as part of our economic recovery.\n  I know we will look back and say that Secretary Locke's time at the \nDepartment of Commerce was the beginning of America's return to \nprominence as an export nation. As he said, ``It is almost like [we're] \nbuilding the foundation of a house or an office tower. All the \nfoundation work takes a long, long time. You don't really see it. It is \nall happening below the street level. . . . After that, then things \nreally begin to take off''\n  Thank you, again, Gary, now Ambassador Locke. You are a true public \nservant, and that is one of the highest compliments I can convey. I \nwish you luck as you continue to serve this great Nation in your new \npost.\n  The nominations considered and confirmed en bloc are as follows:\n\n\n                          DEPARTMENT OF STATE\n\n       David Bruce Shear, of New York, a Career Member of the \n     Senior Foreign Service, Class of Minister-Counselor, to be \n     Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United \n     States of America to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.\n\n\n               SUPERIOR COURT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n\n       Jennifer A.
