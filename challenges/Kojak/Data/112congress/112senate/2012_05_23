The bills will \nbe placed on the calendar under rule XV.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, when 67-year-old Pamela Gunter started \ntreatment for breast cancer, her doctor knew it would be a grueling \nfight. He also knew it was a fight she could win. Pamela's doctor put \nher on Taxol, a common chemotherapy drug. The results were excellent. \nHer tumor shrank. Her prognosis was good.\n  Then one day last spring, no more Taxol. The doctor could not get it. \nIt is one of the most popular and effective treatments for breast, \nlung, and ovarian cancer, and it suddenly disappeared from the markets \nin Nevada. Doctors couldn't get it; drug suppliers could not say why. \nSo Pamela's doctor was forced to use a much more expensive and much \nless effective course of treatment. The cancer spread. By the time \nTaxol was available again, Pamela was dead. She left behind a loving \nhusband, two grown sons, and a grandchild. But with the right treatment \nshe would still be alive today. Her Las Vegas doctor said a shortage of \nthis common generic medicine directly contributed to her death. Had \nthis product been available, she would have been fine. She of course \nwould have suffered; that is what patients on chemo do. But their \nsuffering is worth it because they know it is lifesaving.\n  Pamela is not the only American affected by a shortage of Taxol and \nother lifesaving drugs. Every day in hospitals across the country \nAmericans already dealing with devastating illnesses must also face \nshortages of FDA-approved medications that could keep them alive. Today \nTaxol is still scarce. And chemotherapy drugs are not the only ones in \nshort supply; supplies of nausea medication. The Capitol physician is, \namong other things, an oncologist, Dr. Monahan. I have talked to him \nabout cancer a lot in the last year, he and other doctors. My wife \nwould go every week to this place where everybody was hooked up to \nchemo. Most of them were women, but there were a few men. Just a few \nyears ago that would have been a place where these women were retching \nby virtue of their vomiting. Sometimes--in fact a lot of the times--\nthey had to hospitalize these women to stop the vomiting from these \nmedicines.\n\n  Now we have nausea medication these patients are given to stop their \nsuffering. At least, although they may be going through a lot of \nnausea, they are not throwing up most of the time. But supplies of \nnausea medications and other drugs that reduce the side effects of \ncancer treatment are limited. On Monday, one Las Vegas oncologist said \nhe ordered 10 drugs from his supplier. He could get eight. He said that \nis typical; doctors never know which drugs will be accessible and which \nwill not.\n  Last year FDA reported shortages of 231 drugs, including a number of \nchemotherapy medicines. In the last 6 years, drug shortages have \nquadrupled, gone up 400 percent. Congress cannot solve every problem in \nthis country, we know that, but this is one problem we can solve with \ncooperation from the drug manufacturers. It will come about much more \nclearly if we pass the bill that is before the Senate now.\n  The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, the one I \nhave talked about several times already today, will help establish \neffective lines of communication between drugmakers, the Food and Drug \nAdministration, and doctors. When the FDA gets early warning from \nmanufacturers that shortages are coming, it can act quickly to find \nalternative sources of medication and ease supply problems by, for \nexample, taking from one place where they have a lot of a medicine and \nmoving it someplace where they do not. Drugmakers averted 200 shortages \nlast year by voluntarily notifying the FDA of trouble on the horizon. \nBut many shortages, perhaps all 231 last year, could have been \nprevented if drugmakers had shared information with FDA.\n  Our bill would make that necessary and force it to take place. That \nis why Congress must act quickly to pass the legislation that is now \nbefore the Senate, which will ensure the FDA has the resources to \napprove new drugs and medical devices quickly and efficiently.\n  Passing this legislation would not bring Pamela back, it would not \ngive her another day to spend with her husband, another week to say \ngoodbye to her sons, or another year to get to know her grandchild. But \nthis legislation will help prevent drug shortages like what took Pamela \naway from her family far too soon.\n  As I indicated, we are very close to an agreement, a path forward on \nthis bill, and that would be very good for this country. I hope we can \narrive at that by 11 o'clock today.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, yesterday morning I came to the floor \nto call attention to a quiet and costly PR campaign that President \nObama is mounting on the taxpayers' dime. While the President and his \nsurrogates spend most of their time deflecting attention from his \nrecord, he has Washington bureaucrats working overtime to try to put on \na good face.\n  I mentioned yesterday the administration is spending yet another $20 \nmillion in taxpayer money to promote a health care bill that most \nAmericans would like to see repealed. Let me repeat that--$20 million \nto promote a health care bill that most Americans would like to see \nrepealed.\n  There is more. There is a pattern that I, and I am sure many other \nAmericans, find pretty outrageous at a time of trillion-dollar deficits \nand a near $16 trillion debt. The administration also spent more than \n$25 million in stimulus funds on grants to public relations firms--PR \nfirms--ostensibly to do public relations related to promoting the \nstimulus. It spent nearly $20 million on mailings to seniors to tout \nObamaCare--a mailer, by the way, that the Government Accountability \nOffice found overstated the law's benefits.\n  Millions of taxpayer funds were spent on postcards that promote \nObamaCare's small business tax credit--a credit the GAO said was \nineffective and infrequently used. These are just a few of the ways the \nadministration is quietly promoting its own fatal policies; how it is \ntrying to change people's minds about the President's policies with \ntheir own money, and using our tax money to try to promote the \nPresident's policies. The campaign is one thing, but using our tax \nmoney to promote the President's policies is outrageous.\n  There is a larger issue than the fact that the President is quietly \nmarketing policies with taxpayer dollars that he is clearly afraid to \ntalk about in public. That is bad enough, but the larger point is the \nfact that we have a nearly $16 trillion debt, the largest tax hike in \nhistory right around the corner, chronic unemployment, and sky-high gas \nprices, and the President thinks it is a good idea to spend $20 million \nto promote ObamaCare. We don't have the money to begin with, and he is \nspending it to market his policies.\n  The President needs to face the facts. Americans do not want him \nspending their hard-earned money trying to spin policies they don't \nlike. How about setting some priorities first? How about working with \nus to lower the deficit and the debt? How about working with us to fund \nthings we actually need? We are more than ready to work with the \nPresident, as I said time and time again over the past few years, but \nhe needs to set some priorities and lead.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  Under the previous order, the following hour will be equally divided \nand controlled between the two leaders or their designees with the \nRepublicans controlling the first half and the majority controlling the \nfinal half.\n\n\n                             Second Opinion\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I would like to follow up on the \nwonderful comments made by the minority leader. Specifically, I want to \ntalk about the health care law and the ways that taxpayer dollars are \nnow being wasted and spent in what appears to be a propaganda campaign \nby this administration to promote a health care law the American \npeople--at least the majority of them when asked about it--\n\n[[Page S3461]]\n\nthink should be found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court and \nso many Americans want to see repealed and replaced.\n  Over 2 years ago, President Obama and Democratic leaders in \nCongress--in this very body and across the Hall--jammed a health care \nlaw through Congress that was drafted completely behind closed doors. \nWe all recall Nancy Pelosi famously saying at the time: First you have \nto pass it before you get to find out what is in it.\n  I have come to the floor week after week after that with a doctor's \nsecond opinion about the health care law to make sure the American \npeople know what is in it. Week after week there have been more things \nfound out about the health care law that has made it even more \nunpopular today than it was at the time it was passed and signed into \nlaw by President Obama.\n  Americans knew what they wanted. They did want health care reform. \nThey wanted to be able to get the care they need from the doctor they \nwant at a price they can afford. Yet when I go to townhall meetings and \nmeetings in other communities across my home State of Wyoming and ask \nthe question: Do you think under the President's health care law you \nwill be paying more or less for your health care, the hands go up that \nthey are going to be paying more. Then I ask them: Do you think the \nquality and availability of your care is going to go down under the \nhealth care law? Again, the hands go up.\n  That is not what Americans want, not to pay more and get less. Yet \nthat is what the American people are receiving under this health care \nlaw. So I will continue to deliver this second opinion on the Senate \nfloor so we can continue to talk about what is going to be the impact \non Americans' lives as a result of the health care law.\n  Now, for over 2 years, the news about the law has not been good for \nthose who support it, and the country has had opposition to the law \ncontinue to increase. Today 56 percent of Americans oppose the \nPresident's health care law.\n  One may ask: Why is that? Well, there are a number of reasons. One is \nthe health care law is adding to the national debt. We heard the \nRepublican leader talk about the incredible national debt the American \npeople are facing. The health care law has increased premiums that \npeople have to pay for their own insurance directly as a result of the \nhealth care law being passed. The President promised: If you like what \nyou have, you can keep it. But actually the health care law has made it \nharder for workers to keep their employer-sponsored health care \ncoverage.\n  People want to have choices. They want to have patient-centered care. \nYet this health care law established an unprecedented board with \nunelected bureaucrats who will, by their decisions, have a direct \nimpact on whether patients can get to see a doctor or whether they can \nreceive care.\n  When I look at the incentives that are part of this health care law, \nto me, the incentives actually appear to encourage employers to either \nfire workers or stop providing health care coverage. To me, this health \ncare law is discouraging to students who otherwise might pursue a \ncareer in the medical field and potentially provide care for Americans.\n\n  In my opinion, this is a law that has actually weakened, not \nstrengthened, Medicare. It has done that by taking $500 billion away \nfrom our seniors on Medicare, not to help strengthen Medicare but to \nstart a whole new government program for someone else.\n  The Medicare Actuary came out with a report last Friday to say that \nwhen we actually get into a realistic assessment of the impact of this \nhealth care law on Medicare, it weakens it. It shows Medicare going \nbroke sooner than initially thought. This report has a realistic look \nat the impact of the health care law on Medicare and shows that it will \nmake it that much harder for our seniors on Medicare to get the \ntreatment they need and to actually get to see a doctor to find someone \nto care for them. The implementation of this law, which takes $500 \nbillion away from Medicare, is not to strengthen or save Medicare but \nto start a whole new government program for someone else.\n  So I could go on and on with legitimate complaints about the law. We \nmade it clear for over 2 years that the law is bad for patients, bad \nfor providers, nurses, and the doctors who take care of those patients, \nand it is terrible for taxpayers.\n  This week we got a response to our long list of serious issues, \nresponses from the administration and members of the administration. \nWhat they are doing is essentially doubling down on the President's \nfailed law. Instead of addressing the serious concerns the American \npeople have about the law and about their own health care, the White \nHouse has come to the conclusion they have actually done a bad job of \neducating the American people about the law. So now, just months before \nthe Presidential election, the 2012 election, the administration has \njust signed a $20 million contract for a private PR firm to educate the \nAmerican people about the law.\n  Of course, this is taxpayer funded. So let me repeat: The Obama \nadministration is not even going to acknowledge any of the real \nproblems with the law. Instead it is going to spend 20 million taxpayer \ndollars on press releases and more government propaganda.\n  It is important to remember this isn't the first time the White House \nhas spent millions of taxpayer dollars on trying to spin this law. They \nrealize it is unpopular, but are they addressing the fundamental flaws? \nNo, they want to do more public relations.\n  In fact, this administration spent $700,000 on an advertisement \nstarring Andy Griffith, the television star, about how the law will \nimpact Medicare. The Internal Revenue Service spent nearly $1 million \nin taxpayer funds to pay for 4 million postcards to promote tax credits \nin the law for small businesses. Of course, what we have seen, and what \nthe President would say, and I would say, is fewer and fewer small \nbusinesses than anticipated found they were not able to qualify for the \nso-called benefits of the health care law.\n  So what we have seen is the President's law continues to be \nunpopular, and now the administration chooses to spend taxpayer dollars \nto try a public relations campaign to make it more popular instead of \ndealing with the fundamental problems.\n  So here we are millions of dollars later, and it is clear that the \nWhite House still has not learned what most Americans understand--good \npolicy is good communication. When a law is good, it sells itself and \nAmericans immediately reap the rewards and appreciate what has been \ndone. But when a law such as this health care law is a bad one, there \nis no way another slick PR campaign, paid for with taxpayer dollars, \ncan make it look any better.\n  The American people deserve real solutions to their health care \nproblems, not more Washington spin. Yesterday I called on the President \nto cancel this program immediately, to retain the taxpayer dollars and \nuse it to pay off the debt, use it as part of lowering the deficit. \nDon't send it to a PR firm to try to spin this law.\n  We need to repeal this law. We need to repeal this health care law \nand replace it with a better plan. Instead of wasting millions of \ntaxpayer dollars on this PR campaign, we need to go back to the drawing \nboard. Americans deserve to be able to get the care they need from the \ndoctor they want and at a price they can afford. That is what I will \ncontinue to talk about on the Senate floor as I offer a doctor's second \nopinion about the significant failure of the law that passed the \nSenate, was crammed through the House, and was signed by President \nObama 2 years ago.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                              Job Creation\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, yesterday a group of four Senators \nintroduced legislation that I would like to highlight in this brief \nopportunity on the Senate floor. We introduced S. 3217. This \nlegislation is called Startup 2.0 and was introduced by Senator Warner, \nSenator Coons, Senator Rubio, and me to begin the process of trying to \ncreate a better entrepreneurial environment in the United States, to \ncreate opportunities for entrepreneurials for innovation and to grow \nthe economy and create jobs.\n  I want to personally thank those three Senators--two Republicans, two \nDemocrats--who decided that this common phrase we hear around \nWashington, DC--we can't do anything this\n\n[[Page S3462]]\n\nyear because it is an election year--is nothing that we are willing to \ntolerate. We didn't get the marching orders and instructions to say we \ncannot work and accomplish good work for America because there is a \nNovember election.\n  I want to highlight to my colleagues and ask them to join us in this \neffort to grow the number of Senators who find this kind of legislation \nvaluable and appealing and to commit myself to work with Senator \nWarner, Senator Rubio, and Senator Coons to see that we are successful \nin 2012. I have talked about this legislation before. In fact, Senator \nWarner and I introduced the Startup Act months ago. We then joined with \nSenator Coons and Senator Rubio, who had introduced legislation called \nthe AGREE Act. We took the best components of our two pieces of \nlegislation and yesterday, as I said, introduced S. 3217, the Startup \n2.0 Act.\n\n  This legislation has about five components. In broad terms, it is \nbased upon the Kauffman Foundation Center for Entrepreneurship based in \nKansas City, which is the most world-renowned organization that studies \nand promotes entrepreneurship. Their proposals were based upon their \nresearch and are included in many aspects of this legislation. Part of \nit is dealing with the regulatory environment that a startup company \nfaces and to require that the benefits of that regulation exceed the \ncosts. That kind of requirement has been in the law before but only for \nthe departments, not for the independent agencies. So we know the \nindependent agencies create lots of hurdles and handicaps in regard to \nthe ability of particularly a young company, a beginning company, a \nstartup company to succeed.\n  In fact, in my view, our legislation is based upon something I was \ntold once by an engineer who said that for an airplane to fly, there \nare two forces at work: one is thrust and the other is drag. The thrust \nhas to be sufficient to overcome the drag or you could reduce the drag \nso the thrust is not so necessary. What I like about this legislation \nis that it is so focused on reducing the drag--getting things out of \nthe way. It is not a thrust program, meaning more government programs, \nmore government spending, more government. This legislation provides \naspects that are designed to get government out of the way and to \nreduce the drag so that the airplane can launch and can fly and can \nsucceed.\n  One of those, of course, is the regulatory environment. Another is \nthe tax environment. Startup companies face significant challenges in \naccessing enough capital to get off the ground. We were successful in \npassing the JOBS Act signed by the President a few weeks ago. This \nlegislation picks up where that legislation left off.\n  Incidentally, I read this morning that crowdfunding is already \nbeginning to develop a piece--a development that occurs as a result of \nthe passage of the JOBS Act. So once Washington, DC--let me say that \ndifferently. Once Washington, DC, gets out of the way so that the \nprivate sector can pursue opportunities, those opportunities are \npursued. We see that already happening with the passage of the JOBS Act \nin regard to crowd source funding in which we are gathering capital \ninvestments from people across the country to help new businesses \ncommence.\n  This legislation, the Startup Act, makes permanent the 100-percent \nexemption on capital gains taxes for investments held at least 5 years \nin qualified small businesses so investors can provide financial \nstability at this critical point in their growth. The legislation also \nincludes a limited, targeted research and development tax credit for \nstartups less than 5 years old. So we alter R, we alter income taxes, \nand we alter capital gains in a way that is designed to create better \nopportunities for access to credit.\n  We attempt in this legislation to accelerate the commercialization of \nresearch. Billions of dollars are being spent--taxpayer dollars--at \nuniversities and colleges across the Nation. We want to incent that \nresearch to be devoted toward what can be commercialized, that brings \nnew products, new businesses to market. So we take existing resources \nand utilize those dollars to reward those universities that take their \nresearch dollars and use them in ways that are more likely to be \ncommercialized--in other words, create products, pursue dreams, and \nultimately create jobs.\n  In addition, we create competition--at least knowledge of \ninformation, knowledge that allows somebody who is thinking about \nstarting a business to decide which States are the most progrowth-\noriented and make decisions about their location--where they should \nlocate--based upon information. That then would also encourage States \nto be very entrepreneurial and progrowth, pro-innovation in their State \npolicies.\n  Perhaps the most significant portion of this legislation creates two \nnew visas. The first is an entrepreneur's visa to help foreign-born \nentrepreneurs currently legally in the United States to register their \nbusiness and to employ Americans. In many instances, foreign-born \nentrepreneurs, here legally, have an idea and want to begin a company \nthat will employ Americans but are told their visa does not allow them \nto remain in the United States.\n  The second visa that is created in this legislation is related to \nSTEM--and this is a topic of conversation I think is so important--to \nretain foreign students who are studying in the United States, who have \na Ph.D. or a master's degree in science, technology, engineering or \nmathematics. It is silly, it is wrongheaded for us to educate these \nindividuals and tell them we no longer want them in the United States \nonce they receive their degree. So the Startup Act 2.0 makes two \nimportant modifications to that current system of visas.\n  In addition, we include a provision from the legislation introduced \nby Senators Rubio and Coons, a provision that eliminates the per-\ncountry numerical limit for employment-based immigrant visas, which is \nanother handicap in our system that prevents those who have the \ngreatest skills and talents and intellect from being eligible for a \nlegal visa to remain in the United States.\n  I heard a story from an entrepreneur in California who was ready to \nhire foreign-born immigrants who were U.S.-educated individuals with \nPh.D.s in computer education--computer science, for example--and yet \nthe H 1B visa program failed them. There were no slots available. So, \nyes, the company hired these 68 Ph.D.s--technicians, highly skilled and \neducated individuals--but they hired them in Canada, not in the United \nStates. So not only is that a loss of 68 jobs, but many of those people \nwho are now working in Canada will be the next set of entrepreneurs, \nand they will start their businesses, their startup companies, and grow \ntheir companies in Canada, not in the United States. So we lose in both \nemployment today and in opportunity for American jobs in the future \nbecause we have a visa system that handicaps our ability to get the \nhighly educated, trained, and technically skilled individuals in the \nUnited States.\n  Today in the local paper I read some statistics that I think are \nimportant for us to remember and to know. Research by the Partnership \nfor a New American Economy and Partnership for New York City shows a \nwidening gap between the supply and demand of American graduates \neducated in the so-called STEM fields of science, technology, \nengineering, and mathematics. The number of job openings requiring such \ndegrees is increasing three times the rate of the rest of the job \nmarket. However, college students majoring in non-STEM fields still \noutnumber math and science-minded counterparts five to one, according \nto the National Science Foundation. So five people are majoring in \nsomething other than science or mathematics for every one who majors in \nmath or science in the United States.\n\n  If this trend continues, American businesses will be looking for an \nestimated 800,000 workers with advanced STEM degrees in 2018--just 6 \nyears away--but will only find 550,000 American graduates with that \ntype of training. Not only do we need to fill that gap with those who \nare available to us today, but we also need to encourage education in \nthe United States and educate American students in the STEM field as \nwell. Without easing these restrictions, we will continue to have 60 \npercent of foreign graduate students in the United States enrolled in \nscience and engineering today. So 60 percent of foreign students are \nmajoring in science and mathematics--not true of American students--and \nwe need to reverse that course.\n\n[[Page S3463]]\n\n  A study earlier this year showed that half of the Nation's top \nventure-backed companies have at least one immigrant founder. Three out \nof four claim at least one foreign-born executive.\n  The point is that we want the economy to grow, we want to create \njobs, and we want to do the commonsense things that get government out \nof the way to allow the private sector to be entrepreneurial, to be \ninnovative, and to create great opportunities for Americans today and, \nequally important, for Americans tomorrow. We want our kids and \ngrandkids to have the opportunity to live and work in a growing, \nexciting economy. That requires the Congress to take actions today to \ncreate that environment for the private sector to succeed in creating \nentrepreneurship in the United States.\n  When we look at the last few years, we see that the net jobs filled \nin the United States have been filled by entrepreneurs, by new startup \ncompanies, not by existing companies. In fact, the trend is that big \ncompanies are often laying off workers while startup companies are the \nones obviously hiring individuals.\n  I ask my colleagues to take a look at the legislation that my \ncolleagues, Senators Warner, Rubio, Coons, and I introduced. I look \nforward to working with the leadership of the Senate to see that it \nreceives appropriate consideration. We ought to do all we can do. We \nought not ever use the excuse that we can't do everything; therefore, \nwe can do nothing. These are all commonsense ideas that, in my view, \nwill be supported by at least 80 percent of my colleagues here in the \nSenate. We ought not use the idea that it is an election year so we \ncan't accomplish anything. The country cannot afford to wait. It needs \nour action now.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator Nevada.\n\n\n                           The Housing Crisis\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Madam President, last September I had the honor of coming \nto the floor to give my maiden speech to my fellow Nevadans and to the \nAmerican people. In that speech, I quoted a great Nevadan, Mark Twain, \nwho wrote: ``You are a coward when you even seem to have backed down \nfrom a thing you openly set out to do.'' I have always said that I ran \nfor office to make a difference, and since my first day here I have set \nout to provide solutions to fix our current housing problems.\n  Nevada is the epicenter of our Nation's housing crash. Home prices \ncontinue to decline in Nevada. In February of 2006 the average home \nvalue was $309,000. Today that has dropped to $120,000. Let me give my \ncolleagues another fact: 5 years is how long Nevada has led the country \nin foreclosures.\n  The people of Nevada have suffered far too long because of the \nrecklessness of Wall Street that caused this crash. Many Nevadans are \nstruggling to pay for mortgages or have their homes in foreclosure as a \nresult of the poor job market and the economic downturn. Because of the \nhigh rates of foreclosure devastating Nevadans, many are being forced \nto move, to find a new place to live.\n  Washington must provide solutions that help those who have been hit \nthe hardest by this tough economy. I have worked on several solutions \nthat I believe will provide some relief for many of those who are \nstruggling.\n  In February I introduced the Keeping Families in their Home Act or \nthe Home Act. This legislation would allow banks, Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac, to offer long-term leases for foreclosed homes. By doing \nso, it gives families the opportunity to stay in their homes while also \neasing the pressure that foreclosures put on home values.\n  The next month I joined Senator Stabenow to introduce the bipartisan \nMortgage Forgiveness Tax Relief Act, which would ensure that homeowners \nwho owe more on their mortgages than their homes are now worth would \nnot be hit with an additional income tax if a part of their mortgage \nloan is forgiven. The current mortgage relief act expires at the end of \nthis year, and this bill extends this critical safety net for \nunderwater homeowners through 2015.\n  Today I am proud to announce the introduction of the SOLD Act. Home \nbuyers, sellers, and real estate agents have long observed that banks \nhave been slow to approve home short sales. Current delays in approving \nshort sales are a major challenge to consumers and to realtors. These \ndelays can cause canceled contracts and homeowners being forced into \nforeclosure. Those short sales are seen as a far better outcome than \nforeclosure, and finding a way to improve and make this process more \nefficient has been very difficult.\n  My legislation, the SOLD Act, would require that mortgage servicers \nrespond to a short sale request within 30 days and make a final \ndecision within 60 days of receiving the purchase offer. By placing a \nshot clock on these decisions, it will reduce the amount of time it \ntakes to sell property, improve the likelihood that the transaction \nwill close, and reduce the number of foreclosures in Nevada and across \nthis country.\n\n  Stability in the housing market is critical for long-term economic \ngrowth. As Nevada continues to lead the Nation in unemployment, it is \nmore important now than ever for Washington to provide solutions and \naddress our Nation's biggest problems. Getting Americans back to work \nand helping families who find themselves in tough economic times should \nbe a priority of every Member of Congress.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the SOLD Act and help \nthose who have fallen on tough times.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that execution of \nthe previous order with respect to S. 3187 be delayed until 12:30 p.m. \ntoday; that at 12:30, the majority leader be recognized prior to \nexecution of the order, and that all provisions under the previous \norder remain in effect at that time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Toxic Chemicals\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I come to the floor today because we \ndare not stand here while a menace threatens children across our \ncountry with too many untested chemicals present in everyday consumer \nproducts, products intended for children's use, such as baby bottles \nand nursery furniture. Many of them contain chemicals that have never \nbeen tested for human safety. These chemicals should be tested in \nindustry laboratories, not in our children's bodies. It is time to \nupdate the law to protect them.\n  This picture shows some of the moms, many who traveled long distances \nyesterday to come to the Capitol with signs demanding ``safer chemicals \nnow.'' Many of the moms had little children with them.\n  They are pleading with us. They are saying: Senators, understand what \nis taking place. Threats to our children should not be tolerated in \nAmerica.\n  These moms are right to be concerned that their families are not \nbeing protected from dangerous chemicals. It is our responsibility, the \nresponsibility of those in the Senate and the House, to fix our broken \nchemical laws. But until these laws are fixed, toxic chemicals--the \nword ``toxic'' is a replacement word for poisonous--toxic chemicals \nwill continue to gnaw away at our children's bodies, their health, and \ntheir well-being.\n  Studies by CDC scientists found 212 industrial chemicals, including 6 \ncarcinogens, coursing through America's children's bodies.\n  ``Toxic Chemicals Pose Significant Health Risks.''\n  This chart tells a very bad, a very sad story: Five percent of \npediatric\n\n[[Page S3464]]\n\ncancers, 10 percent of diabetes, 10 percent of Parkinson's disease, and \n30 percent of childhood asthma are significant health threats to \nchildren. And instead of protecting us from harmful chemicals, our \ncurrent law falls short.\n  A law called TSCA was designed to eliminate these threats to \nchildren's health. It passed in the 1970s. It is so severely flawed \nthat the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office testified that it \nis a ``high-risk area of the law.'' Imagine that: TSCA, because of the \nfact that it is so severely flawed, is a high-risk area of the law.\n  In nearly 35 years, TSCA has allowed EPA to require testing of only \n200 of more than 80,000 chemicals. Thousands of new chemicals are \nintroduced every year in industrial and research facilities, but only \n200 over that time were tested. What does that say? When you think \nabout the number of children we are trying to protect, 80,000 \nchemicals, and EPA could require testing for only 200 of them, and only \n5 were banned. It is hard to believe the chemical industry fought for \nyears to keep the status quo alive at the expense of our lives, our \nchildren's lives, our children's health.\n  Recently the Chicago Tribune exposed how the industry used dirty \ntricks and junk science to drive their public misinformation campaign. \nThey wanted to mislead the public about what is going on. Their series \ndetailed how the industry repeatedly bullied and lied to State \nlegislators to prevent commonsense reform. They bankrolled phony \nexperts. A doctor in one instance prominently stood up there and \ndefended a chemical material, a fire retardant. They are brought in \nthere to invent stories that spout the company line, protecting not the \nhealth of children but protecting their profits. It is a terrible \nexchange--all at the expense of safety and health.\n  It is clear that chemical manufacturers purposefully hid the dangers \nof toxic flame retardants. We have a chart here that shows the average \ncouch, for instance, has over 2 pounds of flame-retardant chemicals in \nits foam cushions, chemicals that have been linked to developmental \nproblems and other health risks. The Presiding Officer has cautioned us \nabout this, as well, that there are discharges when these are \ncompressed that release the toxic chemicals into the air. Scientists \nhave warned us about these chemicals since the 1970s, and yet they show \nup in household furniture, including baby crib mattresses and high-\nchair cushions.\n  The Chicago Tribune report said that:\n\n       A typical American baby is born with the highest recorded \n     concentrations of flame retardants among infants in the \n     world.\n\n  But we are not here to attack chemicals. We are saying sort out those \nthat are necessary and good for our sustainability, but there are \nhidden in there products that are dangerous, that are contaminants, \nthat can bring terrible things to children, terrible health threats. \nHundreds of useful everyday products contain chemicals, but it is our \nresponsibility to make sure they are all safe, and today we don't know \nwhat is in the air, the atmosphere, and is poisonous.\n  Here is an example. Everybody recognizes what this is, a baby bottle. \nWe have all bought them or seen them used for our kids. But chemicals \nin some baby bottles have been linked to serious health threats. \nImagine, as a child takes nourishment, they are taking in a substance \nthat can be dangerous to their health and make them sick--or worse.\n  When we use these products, the chemicals in them can end up in our \nbodies. In essence, the American public has become a living, breathing \nrepository for chemical substances. No one should accept this standoff, \nand most do not. Those who are aware of what is taking place don't want \nto hear any excuses. They say: Get rid of these things. Let us know \nwhat is in there so we can protect our children and shield them from \nthese threats to their health and their well-being.\n  Everyone--from some chemical manufacturers to businesses that use \nchemicals in their products, to environmental, labor, and health \ngroups--has called for reforming our chemical laws, and we will not \nwait. I ask my colleagues not to wait here. Join us in this quest to \nsave our children's health to make sure they grow up as healthy as we \ncan enable them to do. We will not wait any longer, and we cannot let \nlobbyists run out the clock.\n  Lobbyists. Those are people, who for a fee, will represent almost \nanybody. But in this case, we are looking at not those who bring in \ngood information or a good product, but those who are defending \ncompanies that are producing products that are dangerous for all the \nchildren who are exposed.\n  My bill, the Safe Chemicals Act, lays out a vision for strong, \neffective, and pragmatic regulation of chemicals. The bill simply \nrequires the chemical makers to prove that their products, their \nchemicals are safe before they end up in children's bodies by being put \ninto a product that children use.\n  Most of the thousands of chemicals we use every day are safe, but \nthis bill will separate the safe chemicals from the ones that are not--\nthe ones that threaten our children and our families. It will ensure \nthat chemicals are tested and that EPA can take unsafe uses of \nchemicals off the market.\n  This bill is common sense. I am sure those who might be listening and \nthose who might read the story from the Chicago Tribune and the \nresearch they did will find it very difficult to understand why it is \nwe can't take the steps in here in the Congress to make their children \nsafe. We do it in all kinds of ways to protect our kids. We want them \nto be able to grow and develop as children should--healthy, healthy \nkids.\n  Some chemical industry lobbyists say the cost of testing all these \nchemicals would be too high. Talk to a parent whose children carry lots \nof toxins in their bodies already. Talk to the mothers who carry these \ntoxins in their bodies and can transmit them very easily to their \nchildren, particularly in pregnancy. So, too high? Too high has to be \njudged not by the chemical company making a profit and wanting to make \nmore.\n  We cannot violate our responsibility to the mothers and fathers and \nthe relatives and the families, where little kids live and enjoy life. \nWhat about that cost to the damage of their health? What about the cost \nto them? How high is that cost?\n  I would like one of these chemical manufacturer executives to stand \nup to parents who are worried about the health and the well-being of \ntheir children and say they are not making enough money and they are \ngoing to have to pump more of these threatening materials into the \natmosphere without submitting them for testing. What about the cost to \nthe parents who have to pay for their care?\n  The bottom line is this: If we don't act to protect Americans from \nthousands of toxic chemicals in everyday consumer products, who is \ngoing to do it? It is our responsibility.\n  Throughout this process we have invited input from all sides of this \nissue, including the chemical industry. I have extended an open \ninvitation to my Republican colleagues: Think about it. Look at it \nthrough the eyes of your children and of your families. Think about it. \nOr would you rather go to the bank with a larger deposit because you \nare doing something that is a threat to children of any age and any \nstage? So I asked colleagues from the Republican side to work with us. \nWork with me to fix this broken law.\n\n  The one thing we will not do--and I know I speak for many others who \nare cosponsoring this legislation--we will not accept inaction. It is \ntime to act. We want to mark up legislation to reform TSCA and move \nthis legislation to the Senate floor, where decisions can be made. \nOpinions of individuals who may say, No, we would rather go ahead and \nenlarge our bank accounts, our cash reserves--let them say it in front \nof the public. That is when we will be conducting the kind of a test we \nshould be doing here.\n  We want to move the legislation to the Senate floor and have a vote \non it. Hopefully good judgment and good sense will prevail and this \nwill get through and get to the President's desk so he can sign it and \nstart the process of protecting our kids. It is time to come together \nto finally fix this law and protect our families from toxic chemicals.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I thank Senator Lautenberg for his \nleadership and dedication to protecting\n\n[[Page S3465]]\n\nour families. And I know why he is concerned. I know, because I think \nabout these issues every single day.\n  I washed my son's hair last night in his bath. I want to make sure \nthe chemicals in that baby shampoo are safe. I put sunblock on him this \nmorning. I want to know that I know what the level of that protection \nof that sunblock actually is.\n  When my other son was sick last week, he had three different \nmedications. I need to know what those medications will do for him, if \nthey will have side effects, what the impact is.\n  This is exactly the question every parent asks every single day in \ntheir normal daily lives: Are the products, are the chemicals, are the \nthings surrounding my family safe? Will they cause harm? Will they \ncause disease? These are real questions that we have to have answered. \nSo I thank Senator Lautenberg for his leadership on the Safe Chemicals \nAct.\n  Yesterday hundreds of mothers gathered here in the Capitol, right in \nfront of the Capitol building, with their kids and with advocates from \nall across the United States to tell Congress one simple thing: It is \ntime to stop playing politics with the health of our families. They \nremind us that the effectiveness of our Nation's chemical regulations \nis an issue that matters to all of us, every single American and every \nsingle parent who has children.\n  Our families are exposed to a variety of chemicals in every aspect of \ntheir daily lives, whether it is the soap we wash our hands with, \nwhether it is the shampoo we wash our children's hair with, whether it \nis the detergents we put in our clothes washer when we are doing our \nlaundry at night, whether it is detergents we use to wash our dishes. \nEvery day we are bombarded with chemicals, and understanding how these \nchemicals impact our health and the health of our families is a growing \nconcern not just for me but for constituents all across the \ncountry. But because of a very broken and ineffective system, our \nregulatory agencies are not able to provide us with enough information. \nThe challenge our regulatory agencies face is a substantial one. Since \nthe Toxic Control Substances Act was enacted in 1976, the EPA has faced \nthe daunting challenge to investigate more than 84,000 chemicals in \ncommerce, and their track record for success has been poor. Of the tens \nof thousands of chemicals in the marketplace, only 200 have been \nidentified for further investigations and only 5 have been regulated.\n\n  Weekly there are news reports highlighting a new study of chemical \nconcern found in everyday products in our homes, in our schools, and in \nour places of work. These reports have caused growing concern amongst \nconsumers because we have seen links. There are studies that linked \nthese chemicals to the rising causes of cancer, autism, learning \ndisabilities, diabetes, asthma, obesity, developmental disorders, and \ninfertility. These are the gravest concerns any family is ever going to \nface--any one of these. So we want to know if these things we were \nexposed to are affecting outcomes. Is there a relationship?\n  As a mother of young children, who are most vulnerable to chemical \nexposure, I am particularly concerned about what chemicals affect them, \ntheir well-being, and their development. I have one story of a young \ngirl from Ithaca, Mira Brouwer, who died at the age of 4 because of the \ncomplications of her brain cancer treatment. Faced with the loss of her \ndaughter, her mother Christina Brouwer founded Mira's Movement to make \nsure she could raise awareness about pediatric cancers and to serve as \na resource for families facing their own battles with these diseases.\n  After an exhaustive study and review that identified potential links \nbetween chemicals and our environment and cancers such as the one young \nMira had, I believe it is time for Congress to take action. We have a \nnumber of amendments today that will, again, enhance the work we are \ndoing.\n  Of the two amendments I care a lot about, one is very simple. It \nmakes sure that parents have as much information as possible when there \nare disclosures that accompany medicine so we know what are all the \nimpacts there could be of that medication. I know most of my colleagues \nand certainly most consumers didn't realize the leaflets that come with \nour prescriptions are not regulated by anyone, and it is usually \nwritten by a contractor.\n  In 1995 the FDA recommended standards to improve the information \nprovided to patients, but by 2008 only 75 percent of the information \npatients were receiving met the standards for usefulness.\n  I have to say I met with one mother named Kate, and her personal \nstory about what happened to her son who was suffering from allergies \nand asthma. When he took a different medication, she saw him go into a \ndepression. She didn't know there could be a relationship. That \ninformation was never provided to her. But the pain and loss she goes \nthrough every single day, remembering her son, has encouraged her to be \nan advocate for reform to make sure every parent has basic information \nthat has some level of accountability so they know what the \nimplications of all medicines can be.\n  The AARP and Consumer Reports have spent years trying to ensure their \npatients that when they receive FDA approval, standardized and up-to-\ndate information about their medications will be provided. They support \nthis amendment that will make that requirement.\n  Consumers basically have a fundamental right to know the risks \nassociated with their prescription medications, and my amendment would \ngive them this knowledge.\n  Last, and quite simply, we use sunscreen every day. In my family my \nkids have very fair skin. I want to know that the label on that \nsunscreen is accurate. I want to know if it has the protection it says \nit does, and this is an area that desperately needs regulation. I \nsupport the bill of Senator Reed of Rhode Island to finally give \nconsumers the information they need with regard to sunscreen.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, for this opportunity. All America's \nfamilies basically have a right to know if these products are safe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it was 10 days ago the Chicago Tribune \nhad a Sunday exclusive investigative report on fire-retardant \nchemicals, and the report went on for several days. I called the \nwriters and commended them on the wonderful job they did on this \nreport. It was as good as any investigation I have ever seen by a \ncommittee of Congress. It raised some serious issues I had never \nthought about.\n  We probably have all heard from time to time there are certain \nchemicals which, when put on fabric, for example, will reduce the \nlikelihood that it will flame and injure someone. I accepted that as \ntruth, and I guess most people would. There was testimony given, even \nby medical doctors and so-called experts, that said that is a fact.\n  Well, the Tribune series took a look at the so-called experts, and \nguess what they found. They were on the payroll of the chemical \ncompanies that made the fire-retardant chemicals, and the doctors were \nactually kind of manufacturing cases of burns to make the case that \nStates should apply these new standards. Over the years this testimony \nby these people, who had a built-in conflict of interest, ended up \nbeing persuasive at many levels in many States. As a result, there were \nrequirements to add fire-retardant chemicals to fabrics in clothing, \npajamas, furniture, and the like.\n  Then a closer look was taken. The Underwriters Laboratories took a \nlook at these chemicals and said: You know what. They don't stop a fire \nfrom flaming up. The tests they are using are totally inadequate. These \nchemicals don't achieve what they are supposed to achieve. But there is \nanother side to the story. The chemicals themselves can be dangerous. \nThese are chemicals that haven't been tested in terms of their exposure \nto human beings. The Chicago Tribune article said the average couch had \n2 pounds of fire-retardant chemicals built into it. They put it \nparticularly in those foam cushions. I will get back to that in a \nmoment. Remember that, the foam cushions.\n\n[[Page S3466]]\n\n  Madam President, in your wonderful State last November my daughter \ngave birth to twins. November 15 was a source of great celebration. It \nstill is. My wife and I were there with our son-in-law and daughter to \nwelcome this little boy and little girl into the world. After a couple \nof days we brought them home from the hospital to the condo where my \nson-in-law and daughter live. We were so careful. I think about it now. \nWe used hand sanitizers. We never had that when we were raising our \nkids, but we were careful to make sure we washed our hands. Every \nsingle thing these kids would come in contact with, the little onesies \nand the blankets that had to not only be cleaned but cleaned with the \nright detergent--we wanted to get the right detergent so it wouldn't \ncause any problems with these children.\n  Of course, when we are giving them formula, we are sterilizing \neverything in sight to make sure it is perfectly clean. Then I recall \nat that moment when I had that tiny little baby, and I was going to \ngive this baby a bottle--and see if I still remembered how to do it--\nthey said get a comfortable place. Why don't you sit down on the couch? \nIt never crossed my mind as I sat down on the couch and pressed that \ncushion on the couch that I was releasing a spray of toxic dust from \nfire-retardant chemicals. That never crossed my mind at one moment.\n\n  When we went to buy a little cradle with a cushion for each of the \nkids, we took the subway to Columbus Circle to Babies ``R'' Us. It \nnever occurred to me to think about whether the cushion on that baby's \ncradle or crib had fire-retardant chemicals in it that might, in fact, \nbe sprayed every time someone sat on it or the baby was put on it. It \nnever crossed my mind.\n  Well, I can say that as a result of the Chicago Tribune article, I \nthink about it all the time now. I also think about this: How many \nAmerican families can make that judgment when they buy a couch or a \nchair or children's furniture? They cannot. They cannot physically do \nit. I am a political scientist, but that doesn't count; I am not a real \nscientist. I can't judge what is safe and what isn't.\n  Who can we trust? Can we trust the company making the product? We \nwant to think so, but sometimes not. Can we trust the spokespeople for \nthe chemical industry? Unfortunately, they come into this with a \nconflict of interest.\n  So Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey created legislation that \ncalls on the chemical industry to take care with the chemicals they put \ninto everything we use every single day. It is also to make sure that \nAmericans and families have peace of mind when they buy products to \nknow the Environmental Protection Agency is at least reviewing the \nchemicals that are being put in those products that cite they are safe.\n  If the Environmental Protection Agency doesn't do this, who will do \nit? Can we trust the chemical industry to do it? I don't think so. Can \nwe trust the furniture industry? I am not sure. We know if the EPA does \nit, it can make a difference. There are 80,000 different chemicals out \nthere now. Many of them are critically important for our safety and \nhealth. There are safe chemicals we can be exposed to every single day \nwithout concern, but there are others that are not. The flame-retardant \nchemicals are a good example of that.\n  As the Presiding Officer said when she was speaking on the Senate \nfloor, over the years they have reviewed 200 of these chemicals out of \n80,000, and at the end of the day, they banned 5. What about the rest \nof them? Have they taken a look? Where does the first level of \nresponsibility start?\n  Senator Lautenberg's bill says it starts with those who put the \nchemicals in the marketplace and that there be a certain level of \nsafety established before they can be sold across the board. I think \nthat is essential.\n  We are on a bill that will not bring up the toxic chemical issue, but \nI hope that will come up in and of itself soon. We are on a bill \ndealing with the Food and Drug Administration, and I heard about the \namendment, and I support it. I think it is a good one.\n  Let me tell you something else we should know. The Food and Drug \nAdministration is a small agency with big responsibility. Literally \nbefore any drug can be sold as a prescription drug in America, the Food \nand Drug Administration has to establish, No. 1, it is safe, and No. 2, \nit is effective. If it says it is going to do certain things, it has to \naccomplish those things. So there is lengthy testing in terms of these \ndrugs before they will actually be licensed and allowed legally in \nAmerica. The drugs that make it through all of these tests can generate \nmillions, even billions, of dollars in profits for the pharmaceutical \ncompanies, but many don't make it through the testing process. But the \nFDA is there to establish that those drugs are safe and effective, and \nof course the consumers rely on them. When the doctor writes a \nprescription, we feel pretty certain this is going to be something the \ndoctor knows is good for you and it has already been tested through the \nFDA.\n  There is a whole other category of goods, though, that we buy every \nsingle day that are treated differently and they are called dietary \nsupplements. They include things such as vitamins and minerals that you \ntake in the morning. I take a multivitamin every day. I don't know for \nwhat reason, but I do.\n  Dietary supplements also include things such as energy drinks. Heard \nabout energy drinks lately? We can hardly escape them. The 5-hour \nEnergy drink, the Monster drink. There are all of these different \ndrinks we can buy that turn out not to be the same as soda or soda pop, \nbut they are dietary supplements with small print on the back of the \nlabel. What is the difference? The difference is this: If you wanted to \nsell a bottle of cola, for example--and I won't give any proprietary \nnames--there is a limitation by the FDA about how much caffeine can be \nput in each bottle of cola. If they decide they are not going to sell \ncola, which is classified as a beverage or food, and instead sell \nMonster Energy Drink and call it a dietary supplement, there is no \nregulation on the amount of caffeine that can be included.\n  Yesterday I met a woman who came here with her parents and her \ndaughter to be in the gallery as I talked about her late daughter. Her \nlate daughter's name was Anais Fournier from Hagerstown, MD, 16 years \nold. This young girl, with no history and no warning, drank two 24-\nounce Monster Energy Drinks in a 24-hour period of time, and it killed \nher. There was almost 500 milligrams of caffeine in those two drinks. \nIt was too much for her. She died of cardiac arrest. Those were billed \nnot as beverages or sodas but as dietary supplement energy drinks.\n  Here is what it comes down to. I have a simple amendment I am going \nto offer, and this amendment will come up, I hope, on the Food and Drug \nAdministration. Here is what it says: Every dietary supplement \nmanufacturer that wants to sell their product in America has to \nregister with the FDA. They have to tell the FDA the name of the \nproduct, the ingredients of the product, and a copy of the label. That \nis it. There is no requirement for testing, just so we know what is out \nthere.\n  Let me add, dietary supplements are coming from all over the world \ninto the United States. When we walk into that vitamin store or \nnutrition store and we think everything in there has been tested, no, \nvirtually nothing has been tested. Do we still have a right to buy it? \nYes, and I will fight to defend our right to buy it, but I also think \nwe have a responsibility too. If people get sick and die because of a \ndietary supplement, we ought to do something about it, and the people \nacross America expect us to. It starts with registration, simple \nregistration, so the Food and Drug Administration knows what is out \nthere.\n  A few years ago there was a pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles who, in \nan effort to lose a few pounds before the season, took a dietary \nsupplement that included a compound called ephedrine. Ephedra is a \nstimulant. He died as a result of that compound he took. We ended up \nbasically banning ephedra from dietary supplements as a result. I think \nit is important for the Food and Drug Administration to have lists of \nthe dietary supplements and their ingredients in what they are selling, \nand a copy of the label, so that some future ephedra, some future \ncompound that we find can be dangerous could then be traced to the \nactual dietary supplement product in order to protect American \nconsumers and families.\n\n  The dietary supplement industry hates my amendment like the devil\n\n[[Page S3467]]\n\nhates holy water. The notion that they would have to register and \ndisclose the name of their product and its ingredients? No way. They \nsay: You can't do that. It is a violation of basic rights.\n  I say: Baloney. If they want to sell in America, then sell what is \nsafe or at least tell us what they are selling. If a seller lives in \nChina, for goodness' sakes, and wants to sell in the United States, is \nit too much to ask that they register with the FDA and tell us what \nthey are putting on the shelves across America? That is basic.\n  So we will have a choice. I am fighting now to put this amendment on \nthis bill. Let's have a choice. Let's have a vote: Should the dietary \nsupplement industry have to register their products? It is pretty \nbasic.\n  This amendment is based on a recommendation from the 2009 GAO report \nwhich said the FDA has insufficient information to regulate dietary \nsupplements and analyze adverse event reports. That is what happens \nwhen people get sick or die from dietary supplements. The amendment \nrequires facilities which manufacture, package, or hold dietary \nsupplements to register the products with the FDA, provide a \ndescription of each dietary supplement, a list of ingredients, and a \ncopy of the label. Facilities notify the FDA within 30 days and provide \nthe required registration information when a product is introduced or \nremoved from the market. So they have 30 days to do it.\n  Any product that is not registered is to be considered misbranded and \nillegal to sell. In other words, they have to do it. It is a real law.\n  That is it. Just register. They have to tell us what they are selling \nto Americans. Give us the name, give us the ingredients, and give us a \ncopy of the label.\n  Well, get ready, because the industry is coming in to say this is an \noutrage. I think it is outrageous that they would not comply with this \nbasic amendment. I say this to them: I am not opposed to people buying \nvitamins. I have gone to these nutrition stores, and about every other \nmonth they say: Stop the latest Durbin amendment. Well, I buy vitamins. \nI take vitamins. It is OK. I think it is fine. We shouldn't have to \nhave a prescription for it. But Americans have a right to know what \nthey are taking, and they have a right to know what, if anything, the \ngovernment is doing to protect them.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I thank the Presiding Officer for the time to speak on the \nSenate floor.\n  I am supportive of the bill that has come out of the HELP Committee \nto reauthorize user fees for the Food and Drug Administration. We have \ntried these user fees in the past, and under this bill they would be \nreauthorized for prescription drugs and for medical devices. This seems \nto be a way to help get these items to the consumer faster, to get them \nthrough the approval process more quickly, and to allow the companies \nthat develop new medical devices or new prescription drugs to recoup \ntheir investment in a quicker way, which also allows them to get to the \ngeneric market in a quicker way.\n  I think it serves the purpose of health care well, and the community \nthat pays the user fees appears to be in support of their continued \nuse, and I am too. This bill provides for faster verification of \ngenerics. It also adds a product called biosimilars to the process \nwhere fees would be paid. For all of the same reasons, it seems that \nthose fees would also make sense for health care and make sense for \nhealth care costs. Again, it allows for recouping the investment that \nis made to develop a new drug quicker. That allows it to go to the \ngeneric market quicker.\n  I hope this bill can be approved, and I hope it will be approved even \nbefore we leave for the Memorial Day work period.\n  I think Senator Harkin, Senator Enzi, and their committee, the HELP \nCommittee, have worked hard. I don't serve on that committee. I am on \nthe appropriating committee for the Food and Drug Administration--for \nagriculture, rural development, and FDA. I am glad to be on that \ncommittee, and I have the contacts I have with FDA because of that. \nBut, certainly, I support this bill.\n  There will be amendments, and we will look at those amendments as \nthey are offered; although I think the committee has worked hard in a \nbipartisan way to bring a bill to the floor that is legislated the way \nwe should legislate wherein the committees do their work and there is a \nbipartisan approach. That approach seeks input, continues current \npolicies, and improves on those policies in a way I hope the Senate and \nthen the House can be supportive of.\n  I know one of the areas where we are likely to have amendments will \nbe the debate we have had over and over on whether prescription drugs \ncan be imported into the country. If that amendment is brought up, I \nwould have the same position I have had in the past, which is it is \nfine as long as someone from our government is willing to say those \nprescription drugs are what they appear to be. They have been out of \nthe chain of custody, out of the closed pharmaceutical chain supply \nsystem that we believe is always essential to be sure that the drug one \nis getting is the drug one is getting.\n  Senator Durbin spoke about vitamins earlier. I don't know what is in \nthat capsule and neither does he unless someone has verified what is \npurported to be in there is really in there. It is very easy for that \nnot to be the case. There are all kinds of examples of that all over \nthe world. We want to be sure that American consumers who are taking a \nhealth product take that product for a good cause.\n\n  The Senator from Illinois even mentioned that he thought dietary \nsupplements should be filed with the FDA. Certainly anyone who would \nthink that should also think the same for prescription medicines, \npharmaceutical medicines--that someone would need to verify that a \nprescription medicine is the medicine one believes it to be because a \nperson is not taking it for some additional dietary reason; a person is \ntaking it because their doctor has told them it is a medicine they need \nto take. It means there must be some medical reason they are taking it, \nand they must be certain, in my view, that a specific health care \nreason is being met.\n  Also, I read this week that in a time of trillion-dollar deficits, \nthe Department of Health and Human Services announced it was going to \ngo forward with a provision in the affordable health care act that \napparently allows the department to spend $20 million of taxpayer money \nto launch a PR campaign to convince Americans they should like the \naffordable health care act better than they apparently do.\n  We are spending $20 million at a time when we have trillion-dollar \ndeficits, at a time when, in fact, the health care law is even being \nchallenged in Court. We will find out within the next month what the \nCourt thinks about the potential constitutionality of the health care \nlaw.\n  This is the same Department of Health and Human Services that, during \nthe health care debate, told insurance companies they could not tell \ntheir customers--they could not communicate with their customers in any \nway that suggested any possible negative impact this law might create. \nI thought that was an incredible position for the government to take at \nthe time, so maybe I shouldn't be surprised that now the government \nwould spend $20 million on a PR contract to convince people they should \nlike this health care plan better than they do.\n  In fact, poll after poll shows the more people know about the health \ncare proposal, the less they like it. Two years after its passage, \nopposition to the health care law, I believe, is stronger than it has \never been. The recent Rasmussen poll said 56 percent of voters favor a \nrepeal of the affordable health care act, believing that it is perhaps \nneither all that affordable or all that good for health care.\n  According to a USA Today Gallup poll, 72 percent of Americans think \nthis bill will make things worse or would not help their family health \ncare situation. They believe it would not make things better or it will \neven make things worse. It is clear, in my view, that this is a bad law \nthat we can't afford--bad for families, bad for seniors, bad for job \ncreators. I guess maybe that is why the government is going to spend \n$20 million to convince me and others that it is not nearly as bad as \nwe think it is.\n  This is not the first time the administration has used taxpayer money \nto\n\n[[Page S3468]]\n\nroll out publicity initiatives or to move forward in a way that will \ntry to encourage the use of this law. Last year, the Department of \nHealth and Human Services asked Congress to quadruple the budget for \nits public affairs office to $20 million. So the request was, let's \nhave $20 million in public affairs to double the staff, quadruple the \nbudget. Let's have another $20 million to hire a PR firm to convince \nthe American people that the affordable health care act is going to be \ngood for them. Let's sway seniors by using $3 million for an ad \ncampaign featuring Andy Griffith, who is one of my favorite actors of \nall time, who took on the role to convince people the health care law \nis good for seniors.\n  The nonpartisan factcheck.org concluded that the ads used--they said \n``weasel words'' to mislead seniors. I certainly would not imagine that \nAndy Griffith would use weasel words, but I do know they used taxpayer \ndollars--taxpayer-paid-for words--to talk about how this plan is going \nto be good for them.\n  Then the administration recently decided to spend $8.35 billion--now \nwe are talking about real money; we are not talking about $20 million \nor $3 million. We are talking about $8.35 billion to postpone the vast \nmajority of the Medicare Advantage cuts until after the end of this \nyear, which is, coincidentally, after Election Day as well. This \nsupposedly comes out of money that would usually go for a demonstration \nproject.\n  As I understand demonstration projects, it is to take an idea and \nprove whether it will work. Well, apparently, this demonstration \nproject is merely to not allow these provisions of the affordable \nhealth care act to go into effect until after the election. I think we \ncan all see what that demonstrates. It demonstrates there must be \nsomething the administration believes the American people and seniors \nwould not like if they found out before the election that $8.35 billion \nwas scheduled to be taken out of Medicare and put into another health \ncare program. In fact, the affordable health care act will spend $500 \nbillion that will come out of Medicare at a time when Medicare, we all \nknow, is about to be in real trouble.\n  If someone made this argument anywhere but Washington, DC, I think \nthey would be laughed out of the room. We have one fund that is about \nto be in big trouble, so we are going to take money from it and start \nanother program that we also don't quite know how we are going to fund.\n  The Government Accounting Office has said this demonstration \nproject--I think they have identified it as a sham demonstration \nproject because it doesn't demonstrate anything.\n  This is not a health care system proving that if you take care of \nseniors on a per capita basis, you do a better job keeping them well \nthan if you wait until everybody gets sick for them to be able to see a \ndoctor under Medicare. This just simply demonstrates that the \nadministration would not like people to know what the impact of the law \nis going to be during this even-numbered year.\n  Government spending is out of control. Federal debt is at a record \nhigh. It is unacceptable to me that the administration has decided to \nwaste money on a PR campaign or to waste money to see that the impact \nof the law is not evident until after election day. Instead of spending \ntime and taxpayer dollars to try to convince people that unpopular \nthings should be liked, I would like to see the President work with the \nCongress to help us get the 23 million men and women who are either \nunemployed or underemployed back to work. If we are going to spend \nmoney, let's spend money for purposes like that.\n  I yield back and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today we will be considering and are \nconsidering a vital piece of legislation that not only includes all \nfour user fee agreements but also includes policy proposals to improve \nthe Food and Drug Administration review and approval of medical \nproducts, particularly in the pharmaceutical supply chain.\n  In 2008, when Senator Kennedy was still in the Senate, he and I \nintroduced the Drug and Device Accountability Act. This legislation was \nlargely in response to the extensive oversight I conducted on the Food \nand Drug Administration. During these investigations, I identified \nserious problems at the FDA that included severe weaknesses in the \ninspection process, delays in informing the public of emerging safety \nproblems, and lack of enforcement authority.\n  Based on these findings, the Kennedy-Grassley legislation included \nprovisions to ensure the safety of drugs, including foreign-\nmanufactured drugs. It would have expanded FDA's authority to inspect \nforeign manufacturers and importers on a risk-based schedule. It would \nhave required all manufacturers to register with the agency so they can \nproperly identify the number of manufacturers and where they are \nlocated. This would have ensured that when a crisis occurs, we can \nquickly locate the questionable facility. And it would have increased \ncivil and criminal penalties with respect to violations.\n  Unfortunately, Senator Kennedy and I never had an opportunity to \ndebate this legislation, let alone cast a vote on it. However, roughly \na year ago Senators Harkin and Enzi forged a bipartisan working group \nto address these challenges. The group has worked tirelessly to produce \na bipartisan bill that modernizes FDA's authority to ensure that drug \nproducts coming into the United States are safe for American patients.\n  This bill incorporates many provisions in the Drug and Device \nAccountability Act Senator Kennedy and I introduced. It increases \npenalties for knowingly and intentionally counterfeiting drug products. \nIt requires electronic submission of certain key information by a drug \nimporter as a condition to grant entry.\n  I would like to have seen additional enforcement tools included in \nthe legislation. For example, granting FDA the authority to destroy \nunsafe products that are refused admission into our country would \nenhance FDA's ability to protect the public from tainted products.\n  Likewise, I think FDA should have been granted subpoena authority and \nhave it on a par with other Federal law enforcement authorities because \ncurrently FDA lacks subpoena authority and has to go through the \nDepartment of Justice, which is time-consuming and burdensome.\n  Ultimately, this legislation is a needed step in the right direction \ntoward securing our supply chain. This legislation did not address a \ntop priority of mine; that is, ensuring whistleblowers have adequate \nprotections. Four months ago, my office learned of an abusive treatment \nby the Food and Drug Administration toward whistleblowers due to their \nprotected communications with Congress, more specifically with the \noffice of this Senator. Once the agency learned of the communications, \nit began actively monitoring and observing employees' personal e-mail \naccounts for 2 years until the agency was able to have the employee \nfired.\n  Regrettably, I was not shocked to learn that the FDA was mistreating \nwhistleblowers within this agency as it has done on more than the one \noccasion in the past that I have identified. What makes the example \ndifferent and worse is that the FDA intentionally went after an \nemployee because they knew that employee had no protection under the \nWhistleblower Protection Act.\n  The employee in question happened to be a member of the Public Health \nService--the title is the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps. \nBecause of the decision from the Court of Federal Claims, those \nemployees are, in the Public Health Service, along with other members \nof the uniformed services, not covered by Federal employee \nwhistleblower protections.\n  In 2009, the Court of Federal Claims held in Verbeck v. United States \nthat an officer in the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps is a \nmember of the uniformed services and as such is not covered under the \nCivilian Whistleblower Protection Act nor the Military Whistleblower \nProtection Act. This\n\n[[Page S3469]]\n\nsame logic extends to the commissioned corps of NOAA. So under this \nprecedent, officers of the Public Health Service and NOAA currently \nhave no whistleblower protection under Federal law.\n  This is particularly problematic when we consider that the Public \nHealth Service and NOAA officers can be detailed to agencies such as \nthe Food and Drug Administration or the Centers for Disease Control. \nThat is the case here where that Public Health Service officer was \nworking with FDA. At FDA they have to work side by side with civilian \nemployees doing critical work to review and approve drugs, oversee \nmedical devices, and even work on infectious diseases. However, unlike \ntheir civilian colleagues sitting right beside them, if these employees \nuncover wrongdoing, waste, fraud, and abuse, they can be retaliated \nagainst by the agency and have no recourse for it.\n  This is wrong and needs to be fixed. Whistleblowers point out waste, \nfraud, and abuse when no one else will. They do so while risking their \nprofessional careers. Whistleblowers have played a critical role in \nexposing government failures, and retaliation against whistleblowers \nshould never be tolerated whether they are in the Public Health Service \nor otherwise.\n  For this reason, I will offer an amendment that expands whistleblower \nprotection for uniformed employees of the Public Health Service. It \ncorrects the anomaly pointed out in the Court of Federal Claims and \nensures that officers in the Public Health Service have some baseline \nwhistleblower protection. It expressly includes the commissioned corps \nof the Public Health Service within the protections of the Military \nWhistleblower Protection Act. This is consistent with the structure of \nthe commissioned corps functioning like a military organization and \nmatches the fact that these officers receive military-like benefits and \nretirement.\n  All Federal employees should feel comfortable expressing their \nopinion both inside the agency and to those of us in Congress. The \ninclusion of this language will ensure those opinions receive \nappropriate protections. I want to take this opportunity to express my \nappreciation to Senator Harkin and Senator Enzi for their commitment \nand effort over the years to reform and improve the Food and Drug \nAdministration.\n  We have to do what we can to protect whistleblowers. They know where \nthe skeletons are buried. They and enterprising journalists come to us \nin Congress so we can investigate. We need those sources of \ninformation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the execution of the \nprevious order with respect to S. 3187 be delayed until 2:15 today; \nthat at 2:15 p.m. the majority leader be recognized prior to the \nexecution of the order, and that all provisions of the previous order \nremain in effect at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are close to a way to move forward on the \nFDA bill. I do say this, however: On this side we have cleared \neverything. So the disputes now are with the Republicans on the \nRepublican amendment. We are willing to do whatever is necessary on \nthat amendment. So I hope we can get this worked out. It would sure be \nhelpful. We have heard all the speeches about this important bill. It \nreally is important, as I indicated today in talking about some of the \nshortages we have had in Nevada where people die as a result of not \nhaving the medicines.\n  We are nearing a time where we cannot prolong this any more. This \nlegislation is necessary because the bill--the information we have in \nthis bill, everything we need expires at the end of this month.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the \nimportance of passing the Food and Drug Administration Safety and \nInnovation Act, more commonly known as the user fee reauthorization \nbill. This bipartisan legislation would reauthorize the user fee \nprogram for the medical device industry, incredible important in my \nhome State of Minnesota, as well as the pharmaceutical industry.\n  This bill represents over 1 year of negotiations between the FDA, \nCongress, and the industry. I believe we have achieved a good balance \nin terms of the improved performance, incentives through increased \naccountability, more meaningful goals, important process improvements, \nbetter metrics, and additional resources.\n  Not only does this legislation include the user fee agreements \nnegotiated between the industry and the FDA, it also includes several \nreforms that will benefit the entire health care system and improve \npublic health. The bill will make medicines safer for children. It will \nprotect the global drug supply chain. It will improve access to safe, \ninnovative medical devices and treatments, and it will tackle the drug \nshortage crisis that is spreading across the country.\n  On Monday I talked about the work I did leading the effort on drug \nshortages. I am so pleased that Senator Harkin and Senator Enzi \nincluded this provision in this bill. But I also believe it is \nimportant to talk about the guts of the bill; that is, the improvements \nwith the FDA and the work that needs to be done.\n  I commend the HELP Committee, on which the Presiding Officer serves, \nand specifically Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Enzi for being \ndedicated to ensuring that this process was open, transparent, and \nbipartisan.\n\n  At a time when Congress has been deeply divided, this legislation \nshows we can still overcome our differences and address the needs of \nthe country through strong bipartisan cooperation.\n  For the State of Minnesota, passing this bill is vital to our \ncontinued economic growth and strength. With strong institutions such \nas the Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota and innovative \ncompanies such as 3M and Boston Scientific and Medtronic and St. \nJude's, Minnesota's job numbers have fared better than the national \naverage, with our unemployment rate now more than 2\\1/2\\ points below \nthe national average; that is, 5.6 percent compared to 8.1 percent.\n  That is also attributed to the fact that Minnesota has one of the \nlargest and most dynamic pockets of medical device companies in the \ncountry. I mentioned a few of the big ones, but there are also many \nsmall thriving companies. Many of our biggest innovations have come \nfrom the small companies, adding up to about 400 firms employing over \n35,000 people across our State.\n  We cannot forget that it was Minnesota that brought the world one of \nthe biggest innovations in the country. I am not talking about the \nPost-It note, although it is true that did come from our State. I am \ntalking about the pacemaker, which we give thanks to a company called \nMicronic that started out in a garage in Minneapolis.\n  So our roots run deep in this industry. But medical technology is \njust not important to Minnesota, it is important to our country, \nputting billions of dollars in our economy each year. It is important \nto the world. The devices we make in the United States do not just save \nlives locally, they save lives globally.\n  As we look at potential exports and how we are going to reach the \nPresident's goal of doubling our exports in 5 years, and how we are \ngoing to get out of the economic rut we have been in, a lot has to do \nwith exports, new markets, and a rising middle class in countries such \nas China and India where people are finally going to the hospital, will \nuse our medical devices, and will bring jobs to the United States.\n  But that only works if these medical devices get approved and if we \nare able to make them, have the skilled workers to make them, and can \nbeat our competition, basically, of companies in other countries that \nmay be growing unless we make sure we have a proper approval process \nhere that keeps things safe but also moves smoothly and quickly. The \nkind of meaningful, innovative work that our country needs more of is \nthis kind of work. It is high-tech manufacturing, and that is what we \nneed more of in this country.\n  As cochair of the bipartisan Med-Tech Caucus in the Senate, I have \nhad several conversations with FDA about ways to improve this \nregulatory environment. I have introduced bills, as has the Presiding \nOfficer, and looked at the\n\n[[Page S3470]]\n\nimportance of putting in things that guarantee safety but also make \nsure we improve the process so we get more innovation and more jobs in \nthis country.\n  If we are not careful, as we know, continents such as Europe--if they \nmove faster than us, as they have in some instances, then we have a \nproblem because then the venture capital money goes to Europe. With \nChina requiring country-of-origin approval, we can have a situation \nwhere companies decide they can get things done quicker if they move \ntheir business to a place such as Europe and then get the approvals in \nplace so they can sell in China. We do not want that to happen.\n  The FDA will now be responsible for total review time goals. That is \nan important part of this bill. This measures the time from submission \nof a new application to the time the technology is available to \npatients. Putting the FDA on the hook for this measure will streamline \nthe approval process and help get innovative and lifesaving devices and \ntreatments to patients.\n  In addition to improved review times and performance standards, the \none aspect I hear about the most from our medical device companies, \nboth small and large, is they need better communication between the FDA \nand industry. This agreement takes significant steps to address this \nissue by opening clear lines of discussion before a submission is made. \nThis helps provide companies with clear direction and requires the FDA \nto stick to their commitments.\n  It also requires interaction between the FDA and the applicant during \nthe review process to keep everyone on the same page and avoid \nmiscommunication and costly delays. The agreement also requires the FDA \nto work with companies to find the best path forward if goals are not \nmet. Most importantly, this legislation will give the FDA the tools \nnecessary to meet these goals.\n  This agreement provides for $595 million in user fees over the next 5 \nyears. This is meant to provide for additional reviewers, enhanced \ntraining, and increased efficiencies to help improve FDA performance \nand help patients get access to the most innovative and safest products \navailable.\n  But a positive user fee agreement does not guarantee success. We must \nalso focus on the execution and administration of these new resources \nand new guidelines. That is why I introduced a bipartisan bill with \nRichard Burr of North Carolina, a Republican, and Michael Bennet of \nColorado, a Democrat, that would significantly improve the regulatory \nprocess.\n  It would tackle three important things related to the approval \nprocess: First, it would increase efficiency by strengthening the \nagency's least burdensome principle, which has been continuously \noverlooked by FDA's reviewers. The average time to approve an \napplication has increased 43 percent from the 2003-to-2007 time period \nto 2010. This simply is unacceptable.\n  Second, it would improve conflict-of-interest provisions making it \neasier for the FDA to recruit top-line experts to take part in the \nreview process.\n  This would allow the FDA to protect the integrity of the review from \nundue conflicts of interest but also take advantage of available \nexpertise.\n  Third, it would require the FDA to use an independent consulting \norganization to assess the management processes at the Center on \nDevices. This would encourage the agency to consider the impact of its \ndecisions on innovation, while also considering the balance between the \nrisk and benefits of the new devices.\n  I am thankful that, in working with Senators Harkin and Enzi, we were \nable to include these improvements in this bipartisan legislation.\n  Equally as important to improving the regulatory process at the FDA, \nthis legislation also includes my provision on drug shortages. I have \ncome to the floor several times in the past year to talk about the \ncrisis as it has impacted individuals all across our country. There is \nthe story of a little 4-year-old boy who was going to get treatment for \nhis leukemia, and his parents were put in a panic. He was a little bald \nboy with a smile on his face. They found out that the drug he needed, \nCytarabine, was missing in action; it was not in the hospital, not in \nthe pharmacy. They were actually looking into booking flights to Canada \nso that he could get the drug treatment he needed. At the last minute \nsomeone located the drug.\n  Sadly, that doesn't happen in many cases across the country, where we \nhave had people come forward and talk about missing breast cancer \ntreatments and people who have died because drugs were not available. \nThe fact that physicians, nurses, and pharmacists are spending hours \nand hours of their time, which should be spent with patients, looking \nfor pharmaceuticals is an outrage.\n  We know there are many reasons for this. We are glad the industry was \nwilling to work with us to come up with at least a short-term patch \nhere, where the FDA will be alerted as a result of the provisions in \nthis bill when the pharmaceutical companies believe there is going to \nbe a shortage. Right now, they are only required to do it for orphan \ndrugs. Now they will be required to do it for all drugs. These can be \nshortages as a result of raw materials that are not there, as a result \nof mergers in the pharmaceutical industry, or shortages as a result of \na decision not to produce a drug because it may not be as profitable or \nshortages because of all kinds of things that could happen in the \ncourse of commerce.\n  The key point here is that when the FDA finds out early, they have \nbeen able to avert drug crises. They can find another manufacturer in \nour country or abroad, and they get the drugs in; they have done it \nover 200 times in 2 years. This will give them more tools to be able to \navert what is an escalating crisis in this country where we are seeing \nmore and more shortages of drugs on a weekly basis.\n  As I said, I am glad this bipartisan provision--and Senator Casey \nintroduced it originally with me, and we have had support from Senator \nCollins and others, and our working group worked out an agreement to \nget this provision in the Senate bill, with good prospects in the House \nunder the leadership of Congresswoman DeGette from Colorado.\n  I thank my colleagues for their work for two reasons. One, this is \nimportant for medical devices and pharmaceuticals in terms of getting \nfast approval, and that is better for patients and for jobs in America \nas we become a country again that makes products and invests in goods \nthat we export to the world. To do that, you need the regulatory \nprocess working.\n  Second, this bill is good because it contains a drug shortage \nprovision to finally get at something that is long overdue, and that is \nthe escalating crisis of drugs that have gone missing, which should be \nin the hands of patients across this country. Now we put them in a much \nbetter position in terms of being able to find alternative drugs in \neither our country or others, so we don't have these shortages we are \nseeing every day. That is why I think it is very important that we get \nthis bill done soon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            The Disclose Act\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a subject \nthat I know is dear to the heart of the Presiding Officer, which is the \nsorry state of our campaign finance system and the need for the \nDISCLOSE Act of 2012, which we call DISCLOSE 2.0.\n  The Supreme Court's 2010 decision in Citizens United v. Federal \nElection Commission opened the floodgates to unlimited corporate and \nspecial-interest money in our elections, bringing about an era in which \ncorporations and other wealthy interests can drown out the voices of \nindividual voters in our political system. Worse still, much of this \nspending is anonymous, so we don't even know who is spending millions \nto influence our elections.\n  Here is how my State's newspaper, the Providence Journal, explained \nit when the ruling came down:\n\n       The ruling will mean that, more than ever, big-spending \n     economic interests will determine who gets elected. More \n     money will especially pour into relentless attack campaigns. \n     Free speech for most individuals will\n\n[[Page S3471]]\n\n     suffer because their voices will count for even less than \n     they do now. They will simply be drowned out by the big \n     money.\n\n  The Providence Journal had a lot of foresight with that warning. What \nhas happened since then has proven them right. Senator John McCain \nrecently said this:\n\n       I predicted when the United States Supreme Court, with \n     their absolute ignorance of what happens in politics, struck \n     down the law--\n\n  Referring to the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law\n\n       --That there would be a flood of money into campaigns, not \n     transparent, unaccounted for, and this is exactly what is \n     happening.\n\n  Senator McCain, is it ever. In the 2010 midterm election, the first \nafter Citizens United, there was more than a fourfold increase in \nexpenditures from super PACs and other outside groups compared to 2006, \nwith nearly three-quarters of political advertising coming from sources \nthat were prohibited from spending money in 2006. Also in 2010, \n501(c)(4) and (c)(6) not-for-profit organizations spent more than $135 \nmillion in unlimited and secret contributions. This anonymous secret \nspending rose from 1 percent of outside spending in 2006 to 44 percent \nin 2010.\n  We are already seeing the influence of money on the 2012 elections. \nSuper PACs and other outside groups have spent around $140 million in \nthis election cycle. That is about twice what was spent over the same \nperiod in 2008 during the last Presidential election. In the 2 weeks \nleading up to Super Tuesday, outside PACs that supported the Republican \nPresidential candidates spent three times as much on advertising as the \ncampaigns did themselves.\n\n  There are already signs things are going to get even worse. The \nWashington Post reported:\n\n       Groups that do not reveal their funding sources have spent \n     $28.5 million on advertising related to the November \n     presidential matchup, or about ninety percent of the total.\n\n  Ninety percent. And these are groups that don't reveal their funding \nsources.\n  Our campaign finance system is broken. Action is required to fix it. \nAmericans of all political stripes are disgusted by the influence of \nunlimited, anonymous corporate cash in our elections, and disgusted by \ncampaigns that succeed or fail depending on how many billionaires the \ncandidates have in their pockets. More and more, people believe their \ngovernment responds only to wealthy and corporate interests.\n  As they see their jobs disappear and their wages stagnate and \nbailouts and special deals for the big guys, they lose ever more faith \ntheir elected officials are actually listening to them. Over the \ndeafening roar of secret special interest spending, they get harder and \nharder to listen to.\n  This growing consensus across the political spectrum was reflected in \nthe brief Senator John McCain and I filed with the Supreme Court last \nweek in American Tradition Partnership v. Bullock. In that brief, we \nurged the Court to reconsider the flawed central premise of its \ndecision in Citizens United: the proposition that independent \nexpenditures do not lead to corruption or the appearance of corruption.\n  As the statistics about anonymous spending and public perception make \nclear, this premise is discredited. I am proud to have worked on the \nbrief with Senator McCain, who has long been a leader in Congress on \ncampaign finance issues. I hope our partnership will mark the beginning \nof greater cooperation across party lines on this issue of vital \nimportance to the integrity of our great American democracy. I also \nhope the Supreme Court will take heed of the nearly universal opinion \nthat the system they have unleashed in Citizens United puts our very \ndemocracy in jeopardy.\n  Until the Court acts, or until we enact a constitutional amendment to \nrepair what they have done, we are left with one weapon in the fight \nagainst the overwhelming tidal wave of money from special interests--\nand that is disclosure. At least make them fess up to who they are.\n  That is why I stand here today in support of the DISCLOSE Act of 2012 \nor, as I said, DISCLOSE 2.0, in recognition of Senator Schumer's great \nwork on the DISCLOSE Act. This legislation will shine a bright light on \nthese powerful interests and their spending. With this legislation, \nwhich now has 43 cosponsors in the Senate, every citizen will know who \nis spending these great sums of money to get their candidates elected \nand to influence those candidates.\n  I would like to give particular thanks to the previous Presiding \nOfficer, Senator Franken, and the current Presiding Officer, Senator \nTom Udall, as well as Senators Chuck Schumer, Michael Bennet, Jeff \nMerkley, and Jeanne Shaheen for their hard work on developing this \nlegislation. Senator Schumer, as we all know, has been leading the \ncharge for disclosure since Citizens United upended and fouled our \ncampaign finance system.\n  In 2010, with Senator Schumer's leadership, we came within one vote \nof passing the original DISCLOSE Act. Since then, the problem of \nanonymous, unaccountable special interest money has become much worse. \nWe must redouble our efforts and pass DISCLOSE 2.0.\n  DISCLOSE 2.0 says two very simple things: First, if you are an \norganization, such as a corporation, a super PAC, or a 501(c)(4), and \nyou are spending money in an election campaign in support of or in \nopposition to a candidate, you have to tell the public where that money \ncame from and what you are spending it on in a timely manner.\n  That should not be a controversial idea to anyone, at least to anyone \nwho is not seeking secret special influence. This chart shows how easy \nit is under our current system for wealthy interests to anonymously \nspend millions on election ads. This amounts to a form of legalized \nmoney laundering or identity laundering. Super PACs are supposed to \ndisclose their donors under current law. But if someone wants to avoid \nthat disclosure, they can set up a shell corporation, which may be \nnothing more than a P.O. box, and send the money to the super PAC \nthrough that.\n  Worse still, instead of using a shell corporation, they can pass the \nmoney through to a 501(c)(4), a so-called ``social welfare'' \norganization set up just for the purpose of spending money in \nelections. Think about that. The IRS gives nonprofit status to groups \nwhose primary purpose in many cases is to shield billionaires and \ncorporations spending money in elections from having their identities \ndisclosed. In many cases, these 501(c)(4) groups are so closely \naffiliated with their super PACs they have all the same staff and all \nthe same office space, and the (c)(4) groups still don't have to \ndisclose the identities of their donors.\n  On this chart we see the money raised through the end of 2011 by two \npolitical groups started after Citizens United by Republican political \noperatives. These two organizations have the same staff and the same \noffice space, and they run negative ads against many of the same \ncandidates. One, American Crossroads, is a super PAC and is supposed to \ndisclose its donors. The other, Crossroads GPS, is a 501(c)(4) group \nand doesn't have to disclose donors. Guess which one has raised more \nmoney. Of course it is the 501(c)(4) group which doesn't have to \ndisclose its donors. That group has raised $76.8 million as compared to \nonly $46.4 million by its sister super PAC.\n  This is, by no means, a unique situation. For corporations trying to \nbuy influence through spending in elections, ``nondisclosure is always \npreferred,'' as an unnamed corporate lobbyist recently told Politico. \nWhy? Well, for one thing there is no accountability--not to the company \nshareholders, not to their customers, and not to the public. \nNondisclosure is ``preferred'' because it makes it impossible for the \npublic and for law enforcement to track the corrupting influence of the \nmoney these corporations spend in elections. DISCLOSE 2.0 would put an \nend to using 501(c)(4) groups and shell corporations to shield the \nidentities of big campaign contributors.\n  One thing that shouldn't be lost in this discussion of anonymous \nspending is the fact there is one person to whom this spending is \ncertainly not anonymous, and that is the candidate--the elected \nofficial. The donors manage to hide their identities from the public, \nbut they can sure tell the candidate how much money they put into that \ncandidate's super PAC and what positions they want the candidate to \ntake on issues. What this creates is a perfect\n\n[[Page S3472]]\n\nformula for corruption: wealthy corporations and individuals spending \nmillions of dollars to influence a candidate without any oversight or \npublic accountability or scrutiny.\n  Also, as a former Attorney General--and I know the Presiding Officer, \nthe Senator from New Mexico, can appreciate this as well--a well-heeled \ndonor doesn't have to make the contribution necessarily, doesn't have \nto launch the ad necessarily. They can also secretly threaten a massive \nexpenditure against a candidate if the candidate doesn't vote right on \ntheir issue. Political scientist Norm Ornstein recently said:\n\n       I have had this tale told to me by a number of lawmakers. \n     You're sitting in your office and a lobbyist comes in and \n     says, ``I'm working with Americans for a Better America. And \n     I can't tell you who's funding them, but I can tell you they \n     really, really want this amendment in the bill.'' And who \n     knows what they'll do? They have more money than God.\n\n  If the candidate complies and does the right thing by the amendment \nor the right thing by the bill, the expenditure is never made. There \nwill be no paper trail; no trace of the threat that drove that vote--\nthat corrupted that vote--was ever made.\n  The whole rationale for unlimited spending was that it was going to \nbe done independently of the candidate's campaign. That has proven \nfalse. The reality is that super PACs are anything but independent. \nCampaigns and super PACs share fundraising lists, donors, former staff, \nand consultants. Candidates appear at fundraisers for their super PACs, \nand super PACs recycle ads originally run by the candidates. They are \nfree to act as the ``evil twins'' of candidate campaigns, as one FEC \nCommissioner put it, raising unlimited, anonymous money and then \nspending it on massive amounts of advertising--most of it negative--\nwhich further hides the identity of the interest behind the ad because \nif all you are doing is trashing a candidate, you don't even have to \nshow what your interest is, let alone your identity.\n  About 70 percent of ads in this election cycle have, as a result, \nbeen negative ads, up from only 9 percent in 2008. This brings us to \nthe second thing DISCLOSE 2.0 does. If someone is a top executive or a \nmajor donor of an organization spending millions of dollars on campaign \nads, they have to take responsibility for their ads, just the way we do \nas candidates. These are reasonable provisions that should have wide \nsupport from Democrats and Republicans alike. As Trevor Potter, a \nRepublican former Chairman of the Federal Election Commission, said in \na statement submitted to the Rules Committee of the Senate:\n\n       [DISCLOSE 2.0 is] . . . appropriately targeted, narrowly \n     tailored, clearly constitutional, and desperately needed.\n\n  We have made every effort to craft an effective and fair proposal \nwhile imposing the least possible burden on covered organizations. \nPassing this law would remove a dark cloud of unlimited, anonymous \nmoney from our elections, and it would prove to the American people \nthat Congress is capable of fairness, equality, and following the \nfundamental principle of a government ``of the people, by the people, \nand for the people.''\n  I urge my colleagues to support the DISCLOSE Act of 2012.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I was just listening to the \nSenator who is now in the Chair, and I want to congratulate him on \nfiling that amicus brief with Senator McCain in the Supreme Court. I \nbelieve the Supreme Court should heed the good advice both Senator \nMcCain and Senator Whitehouse have given them, and I think if they do \nnot heed that advice, the authority they have undertaken themselves \nwill be taken away from them by the people who are urging a \nconstitutional amendment to give this back to the Congress and back to \nthe State legislatures.\n  I join my colleagues today to highlight what I consider a significant \nproblem in our country--the unprecedented flow of money into our \ndemocratic elections.\n  Over the past several months, a group of us have been working \ntogether to address this problem. We have asked the FEC, IRS, and the \nFCC to take actions that would help curb the impact of money on our \nelections.\n  Led by Senator Whitehouse, we have introduced the DISCLOSE Act. This \nbill would shine a light into the dark corners of the campaign finance \nsystem. Senator Bennet and I have introduced a constitutional \namendment, which currently has 22 cosponsors, to overturn the \ndisastrous judicial opinions that have led to the broken system we have \ntoday.\n  In January 2010, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in Citizens \nUnited v. FEC. Two months later, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals \ndecided the SpeechNow v. FEC case. These two cases gave rise to the \nsuper PACs.\n  Millions of dollars now pour into negative and misleading campaign \nads, and often without disclosing the true source of the donations. But \nour campaign finance system was hardly a model of democracy before \nthese disastrous opinions. The Citizens United and SpeechNow decisions \nrenewed our concerns about campaign finance, but the Court laid the \ngroundwork many years ago.\n  We can go all the way back to 1976. That year, the Court held in \nBuckley v. Valeo that restricting independent campaign expenditures \nviolates the first amendment right to free speech; in effect, that \nmoney and speech are the same thing.\n  The damage is clear. Elections become more about the quantity of the \ncash and less about the quality of ideas; more about the special \ninterests and less about public service.\n  We cannot truly fix this broken system until we undo the flawed \npremise that spending money on elections is the same thing as \nexercising free speech. That only can be achieved in two ways: The \nCourt could overturn Buckley and subsequent decisions based on it, \nsomething the current Court seems highly unlikely to do, or we amend \nthe Constitution to not only overturn the previous bad Court decisions \nbut also to prevent future ones. Until then, we will fall short of the \nreal reform that is needed.\n  In Federalist No. 49, James Madison argued that the U.S. Constitution \nshould be amended only on ``great and extraordinary occasions.'' I \nbelieve we have reached one of those occasions. In today's political \ncampaigns, our free and fair elections--a founding principle of our \ngreat democracy--are for sale to the highest bidder.\n  I know amending the Constitution is difficult. And it should be. But \nwe didn't start this effort last year or even in the last Congress. \nOthers before us have urged that this longstanding problem needs a \nlong-term solution. Many of our predecessors understood the corrosive \neffect money has on our political system. They spent years championing \nthe cause.\n  Senator Fritz Hollings introduced bipartisan constitutional \namendments similar to our amendment in every Congress from the 99th \nCongress to the 108th Congress. Senators Schumer and Cochran introduced \none in the 109th Congress. And those were all before the Citizens \nUnited decision--before things went from bad to worse. The out-of-\ncontrol spending since that decision has further poisoned our \nelections, but it has also ignited a broad movement to amend the \nConstitution.\n  I participated in a panel discussion in January with several \nactivists in this movement. One of the panelists, Maryland State \nSenator Jamie Raskin, was asked about overcoming the difficulty of \namending the Constitution. Jamie said that:\n\n       A constitutional amendment always seems impossible until it \n     becomes inevitable.\n\n  I think we are finally reaching the point of inevitability.\n  Across the country, more than 200 local resolutions have passed \ncalling for a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. \nLegislators in four States--Hawaii, Vermont, Rhode Island, and my home \nState of New Mexico--have called on Congress to send an amendment to \nthe States for ratification. Many more States\n\n[[Page S3473]]\n\nhave similar resolutions pending. Over 1 million citizens have signed \npetitions in support of an amendment, and more than 100 organizations \nunder the banner of United for the People are advocating for \nconstitutional remedies.\n  This grassroots movement is yielding progress. In addition to our \namendment, several other campaign finance-related amendments have been \nintroduced in the House and the Senate. Senators Leahy and Durbin \nrecently announced that Senator Durbin's Judiciary Subcommittee on the \nConstitution will hold a hearing on the Senate proposals in July. I \nthank them for their support. The hearing will be a great opportunity \nto examine the different approaches, to solicit input from \nconstitutional experts, and to have a national discussion about the \nneed to return our elections to the American people.\n  I hope this dialogue will convince some of my Republican colleagues \nto join me. Fixing our campaign finance system is only a partisan issue \nin Washington. A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll found that nearly \n70 percent of registered voters want super PACs to be illegal. Among \nindependent voters, that figure rose to 78 percent. But the Court, in \nits misguided reading of the first amendment, told the Congress that we \ncan't rein in super PACs. In doing so, it gave millionaires and \nbillionaires unchecked power to influence our elections. It has allowed \na flood of PAC money to drown out the voices of average Americans. This \nis a fatal misreading of the real world of political campaigns, and it \nis wrong. Supporters of super PACs and unlimited campaign spending \nclaim they are promoting the democratic process. But the public knows \nbetter. Wealthy individuals and special interests are buying our \nelections. Citizens United has meant citizens denied. Our Nation cannot \nafford a system that says ``come on in'' to the rich and powerful, and \nsays ``don't bother'' to everyone else.\n  The faith of the American people and their electoral system is shaken \nby big money. It is time to restore that faith. It is time for Congress \nto take back control.\n  I know the Senator from Rhode Island, as Senator Whitehouse, has \nworked very hard on this issue, and has pulled us together. I believe \nwe are going to have others join us in this hour. The crucial thing we \nare trying to say is we need reform, we need disclosure. We need to get \nto the bottom of what is happening in this broken system and get our \ndemocracy back for the American people.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, while we are waiting for the next \nspeaker to arrive, I wanted to take a moment and discuss the brief \nSenator McCain and I filed in the Supreme Court last week. It can be \nfound at http://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/download/?id=e3ba7f1b-d132 \n4aef-b5bc-c49fd711fc51.\n  The Supreme Court in the Citizens United decision was in a difficult \nsituation. No member of the Court had ever run in an election for \noffice. It may be the first time in the history of a country that no \nmember of the Supreme Court had ever run for office, so it is a Supreme \nCourt that as a corporate group was uniquely inexperienced in the \nactual ins and outs of elections and politics.\n  Moreover, the way the Citizens United case came up to the Court, the \nquestion they ended up deciding is one that they asked for additional \nbriefing on. It is a question that, in many respects, the Court raised \nitself. And so the Court did not have the benefit of the usual process \nof a case beginning in the trial court and amassing a record of \nevidence, of testimony, of witnesses, of a review of all of that at the \nappellate court level, and then final review at the Supreme Court. So \nthey did something very unusual. They actually made a finding of fact.\n  A finding of fact is not something Supreme Courts are supposed to do \nin the first instance. That is the job of the trial judge and the jury, \nif there is a jury trial. Those are the fact-finders in our system of \nlaw. And certainly for a Supreme Court that has an appellate tribunal \nbetween it and the trial branches, as our Federal system does, it is \nvery unusual for them to be making findings of fact. They made findings \nof fact in this case. And, unfortunately, because they had no \nexperience in elections, any of them, and because they had no record, \nthey made a finding of fact that was not in fact a fact. They made a \nfinding of a false fact.\n  The mistake they made was to determine that no amount of corporate \nspending in an election could create either the risk or the appearance \nof corruption, and I think the practical facts of that are pretty easy \nto rebut.\n  They stood that finding of fact, that premise, on two subordinate \npremises and we rebut both of them in the brief. If I have further \ntime, I will come back to that, but I see that the Senator from New \nHampshire is here and I do not want to cut into her time, so I yield to \nthe distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, and I appreciate her \ngreat work through the long period of discussion and draftsmanship that \nbrought 2.0 to the floor with its now 43 cosponsors.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am pleased that I could be here today \nto join you, to join Senator Whitehouse and our colleagues who have \nbeen working to try to bring to light for the public the serious and \nongoing problem of excessive campaign spending. I congratulate Senator \nWhitehouse for all of his work in leading this effort. It has been very \nimportant.\n  This excessive spending has been a problem for the last 2 years, \nsince the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United, because their \ndecision has allowed for the formation of what has been called super \nPACs, which are really organizations that can spend unlimited amounts \nof money without ever having to disclose where that money came from. So \nthe public doesn't know who is spending the money, doesn't know how the \ndecisions about spending are made.\n  We are actually in the middle of the first Presidential election \nsince that Supreme Court decision, and we can see the dramatic impact \nof that spending. There are now more than 500 super PACs registered \nwith the Federal Election Commission. They are permitted to raise and \nspend unlimited amounts of secret money to fund political \nadvertisements.\n  Again, I want to emphasize the fact that we do not know where this \nmoney is coming from. We do not know if it is coming from corporations. \nWe have heard a lot of stories and seen a lot of stories that there are \nvery wealthy individuals who are putting up money for these super PACs. \nBut the amount of money that has been spent by these super PACs so far \nthis election cycle alone has just topped $100 million. Nearly $80 \nmillion of that came from just five groups.\n  As we are looking at this money being spent, it is important for all \nof us to reflect on our national priorities. What does it say about our \ncountry that we allow this kind of deluge of money to flood our \nelectoral process? Who is really being represented? Are average voters \nin America being represented in this process?\n  To provide some perspective, I think it might be useful to examine \nwhat else this amount of money could pay for. In the past few weeks we \nhave been discussing the importance of providing survivors of domestic \nviolence and sexual assault with the resources they need by \nreauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. What has already been \nspent so far by these super PACs, $100 million, could fund all of the \ndomestic violence and sexual assault assistance in the State of New \nHampshire for 20 years. It could serve more than 320,000 victims.\n  The New Hampshire job training program provides workers with valuable \ninstruction at community colleges across our State. It prepares workers \nfor high-skilled jobs and creates a stronger economy. With the $100 \nmillion that has been spent by these super PACs, we could train 288,434 \nworkers in New Hampshire. Mr. President, $100 million would provide \nlow-income heating assistance to more than 135,000 households. That is \nenough to keep\n\n[[Page S3474]]\n\nNew Hampshire's neediest families warm for three winters.\n  The starting salary for a police officer in the city of Manchester, \nthe largest city in New Hampshire, is $50,000. With $100 million we \ncould put an additional 2,000 police officers on the street. Instead, \nthis money is being spent on political advertisements, millions of \ndollars from groups that refuse to disclose their donors. Most of these \nexpenditures are being made on attack ads. According to a study by the \nWesleyan Media Project, at this point during the last Presidential \ncampaign in 2008, just 10 percent of the ads were negative. Now, in \nthis Presidential campaign, 70 percent of those ads are negative. It is \nno wonder that Americans are becoming increasingly disillusioned with \nour political process.\n  The challenges confronting this country are significant. We need \nAmericans to be engaged and invested in our political process, not \nthrowing up their hands in frustration as the attack ads pile up. We \nneed campaign finance reform.\n  I have been pleased to work with the Presiding Officer, with Senator \nWhitehouse, and with all of our colleagues in developing the DISCLOSE \nAct, which makes some important changes to our system. Senator \nWhitehouse described the DISCLOSE Act very well. It will make sure \nvoters know who is paying for all of these campaign ads. It does not \neliminate super PACs, but it is a very important step in the right \ndirection.\n  I urge all our colleagues to join us in calling for change and urging \nreform of our campaign finance system. I urge everyone in this body to \nsupport the DISCLOSE Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to ask a question \nof my colleague from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I was very engaged by the comments \nSenator Whitehouse was making a short time ago. I was very struck, as I \nhave been all along, by the substantial challenge posed by Citizens \nUnited. My colleague was speaking to the impact on our constitutional \nsystem. When I think about this, I often think about those first three \nwords of our Constitution, ``we the people.'' Is it the Senator's sense \nthat this phrase, ``we the people,'' that starts out the Constitution \nis more than simple window dressing? Does it go to the heart of who and \nwhat we are as a society, as a nation?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The great experiment that the Founders of this \ncountry embarked upon when they founded this country was to allow for a \ndemocratic form of government that was governed by the people--not \nkings, not lords, not pharaohs, by the people. It has been a consistent \nthread throughout our history at important times.\n  As the Civil War came to a close and our beloved President Lincoln \nstood at Gettysburg to give his great address, he talked about the \nimportance of a government ``of the people, by the people, and for the \npeople.'' That has always been the core, heart, and hallmark of the \nAmerican form of government.\n  It has lit a blaze that has illuminated the rest of the world as \nwell. It is not just an American value. People from around the world \nlook at this and say: You know, it can be that way.\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. So I think if any three words would summarize the heart \nof our Constitution, it would be those three words. It would be ``we \nthe people.'' Yet we have a Supreme Court decision, Citizens United, \nthat essentially unleashes a flood of special interest money. Is that \nfundamentally in conflict with the notion of ``we the people''?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I believe it is. We operate in a modern world in \nwhich we are bombarded by media. The average person, the average, \nordinary member of ``the people,'' does not have much access to that \nmedia, cannot get his or her voice much heard in that bombardment. But \nif someone has enormous amounts of money, either because they are a \ncorporation with a vast treasury or because they are a billionaire, \nthey can take a big chunk of that media and can use it to broadcast \ntheir view. That will drown out other voices that do not have that \npower. So it really does attack the basic premise of ``we the people.''\n  Mr. MERKLEY. So Citizens United goes right against the very heart of \nour Constitution. How is it possible that the Supreme Court found, in \nthis 5-to-4 decision, that this has no corrupting impact on our \nelectoral process?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I think three things went wrong. First of all, this \nis a Supreme Court that, unlike most if not all other Supreme Courts, \nhas no political experience. None of them have ever run for office, so \nthey do not have a practical sense of how politics engages in an \nelection.\n  Second, because they sort of invented this question, they did not \nhave a record where people who did know about politics and did know \nabout elections and did know about corruption could assemble a record \nfrom which they could then learn. So they were operating in a much \ngreater vacuum than the Supreme Court usually does.\n  Finally, they made two presumptions that supported it. One was that \nthe super PACs and all these big entities would be independent from the \ncandidates. We have seen that was a false assumption. That was a wrong \npremise. Now the super PACs are connected to a candidate. They have one \npurpose: to get the candidate elected. They have funds raised by the \ncandidate, they share staff with the candidate, they share consultants \nwith the candidate. They use the same footage as the candidate. The \nidea that they are independent has been made preposterous by the facts.\n  The second was that there would be disclosure so the public could at \nleast evaluate, OK, this is the coal mining industry coming after \nsomebody who is fighting for climate change. We get that. We can make \nan appropriate judgment about that use of corporate money to attack a \ncandidate. They were wrong about that as well. That is why we are here \non this DISCLOSE 2.0, and we have been working so hard to make sure \nthis bill has gotten to the floor in the good shape it has been.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. So the Supreme Court envisioned this steel wall, this \nhigh, impenetrable wall between an independent campaign and the \ncandidate's campaign, and thereby saw fit to unleash unlimited money on \none side of the wall while saying the other side has campaign caps, and \nthat made sense together but their fundamental premise was wrong?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Absolutely dead wrong, as proven by reality. It is \nnot just a theoretical wrongness, it is a factual, actual wrongness.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Most of our campaigns for the Senate involve millions of \ndollars--some are $2 million, some are $20 million, some more. There \nare super PACs that have that much money and can bring that much money \nto bear in a single race. Did the Supreme Court wrestle with the type \nof intimidation, that precensorship, the precensorship impact on this \nbody when somebody thinks about what should I say? Do I want to offend \nsomeone who has, not just $1 million but millions and millions of \ndollars to bring to bear? Did they wrestle with the impact on \ncorrupting the debate and dialog and decisionmaking of this body?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Not only did they not wrestle with it, it is not \nclear they even thought about it. When there are people who have come \nout of the judicial monastery--not quite the right word because they \nare men and women alike--but out of the separate province of high-end \nadjudication, they are not familiar with this. They did not think of \nthis. They didn't think of that, and the other thing they didn't think \nof was that the threat of launching a multimillion-dollar negative \nattack against a candidate could have a corrupting effect, even if no \ndollars were ever spent.\n  If the threat is successful, if the scheme works, there is no trail \nleft to it. Before Citizens United, if someone wanted to make a threat, \ntheir threat was limited to a big PAC contribution, having a big \nfundraiser, things like that. It was not a real threat in the sense it \ncould knock somebody out of their office.\n  Now the idea that a corporate identity can hide its identity, can \nlaunder its identity through 501(c)(4)s and then launch a multimillion-\ndollar attack in somebody's State is a credible threat, and I think \nthat is a threat, among others, they overlooked completely.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank my colleague from Rhode Island very much for\n\n[[Page S3475]]\n\nchampioning this bill and for what he has done helping folks to \nunderstand this issue.\n  I will make a few comments on this issue. My friend from Vermont is \nstanding by and, I think, wants to make some remarks as well.\n  I wanted to have the key words we are talking about put up before us. \nThis is a picture of the Constitution, or at least the top of the front \npage, if you will. I was always struck that our Founders saw fit to \nstart this document that lays out the framework for our Nation, the \nframework for our system of government, with three simple words, ``we \nthe people.'' They got to it right from the very beginning. They did \nnot put in three paragraphs of polite this and that and then get to the \nheart of it. They started with the heart: ``We the people.'' They did \nnot put it in small print, they put it in super-sized print. We can see \nit is written in a font that is probably 10 times the size of the rest \nof the Constitution. They deliberately said this is the premise on \nwhich our Nation will operate. This is the foundation on which we \nstand.\n  These words are not ``we the powerful.'' There is a huge distinction \nbetween ``we the people'' and ``we the powerful.'' But the Supreme \nCourt, in Citizens United, attacked the very heart of our \nConstitution--by saying the most powerful companies with vast sums of \nmoney can flood our political system, can buy up the airwaves, and \ncompletely dominate the conversation.\n\n  Free speech wasn't about one side buying up the airwaves. Airwaves \ndidn't exist then. It wasn't about one side buying up the airwaves. It \nwas about all ideas being able to compete in the marketplace of ideas \nso citizens could hear the pros and cons and decide who they wished to \nelect and how they wished to vote based on their understanding of what \nwould work best for ``we the people.''\n  The Supreme Court did not benefit from seeing the Republican \nprimaries of this year in operation. They didn't see how a super PAC \nwould sweep into a State, buy up the airwaves, dominate the \nconversation, and determine the outcome. No, they had some other \nvision. My colleague has referred to the fact that none of the members \nof the Supreme Court had the political experience to understand the \nimpact of this flood of money.\n  You may be thinking to yourself: Well, how much money can we be \ntalking about? Well, money beyond an amount that a working man or woman \ncould ever envision. If it were in dollar bills and stacked in a room \nin your house, it would fill the room in your house, plus. All of those \ndollar bills would not fit into a room. We are talking about such an \nenormous amount of money that it completely controls the sound in the \nairwaves.\n  Let me give you an example. In 2008, if one of the rather well-off \ncompanies in America--I will use one as an example. ExxonMobil made a \nlot of money that year. If they had spent just $3 out of $100 of their \nnet profits on the Presidential race, they would have spent as much as \nthe rest of America put together. That is the type of flood of money we \nare talking about washing across the cities and the countryside of \nAmerica, buying up the newspapers, buying up the airwaves, and \ndominating the debate. That is not a competition of ideas envisioned in \nour Constitution. That is the power. That is not ``we the people.''\n  It is my hope that the members of the Supreme Court will stand back \nand realize their findings of fact were wrong, and their findings of \nfact that there was no corruption from this flood of money were wrong, \ntheir argument that they didn't attack the heart of the Constitution \nwas wrong, the fact that they didn't consider the precensorship this \ntype of flood of money creates was in error, and that they will change \ntheir decision.\n  But we can't be sure this activist rightwing Court will consider the \nfacts and reach a finding consistent with the very heart of the \nConstitution. We can't be sure of that. We have to do what we can in \nthis Chamber, and that is the DISCLOSE Act, the DISCLOSE Act that at \nleast says at a minimum this huge flood of money will be identified by \nthe donor, and it will be identified promptly so citizens will be able \nto find out where it came from; also that the advertisements purchased \nby this money will have disclaimers that will say who the major \ncontributors are so the citizens can see it in real time, so when that \ngroup says they are the group for America's green forests and blue \nskies, and it is really by a very powerful group against blue skies and \ngreen forests, we can find out who it is. That is the heart of this. \nCitizens United is a dagger poised at the heart of the American \nConstitution. We must reverse it, and we must use every tool at our \ndisposal to make that happen.\n  I encourage citizens to summon their full instincts about what they \nvalue in our democracy and make their voices heard. Let's get this \nDISCLOSE Act passed and let's go further to reverse Citizens United.\n  Thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Whitehouse and Senator \nMerkley and everybody else for the very hard work they have done on \nthis monumentally important issue. It is hard for me to think of an \nissue that is more important.\n  A moment ago Senator Merkley used the word ``precensorship,'' which \nis an interesting concept. I want to give an example of this.\n  Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord an article that appeared in the ``American Banker'' fairly \nrecently.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the American Banker, May 23, 2012]\n\n   Bankers Form SuperPac for `Surgical' Strike at Industry's Enemies\n\n                          (By Barbara A. Rehm)\n\n       Frustrated by a lack of political power and fed up with \n     blindly donating to politicians who consistently vote against \n     the industry's interests, a handful of leaders are determined \n     to shake things up.\n       They have formed the industry's first SuperPAC--dubbed \n     Friends of Traditional Banking--that is designed to target \n     the industry's enemies and support its friends in Congress.\n       ``It comes back to the old philosophy of walking softly and \n     carrying a big stick,'' says Howard Headlee, the president \n     and chief executive officer of the Utah Bankers Association. \n     ``But we've got no big stick. And we should. We have the \n     capacity to have one, we just aren't organized.''\n       Think of it as an Emily's List for bankers and their \n     allies.\n       ``Congress isn't afraid of bankers,'' adds Roger Beverage, \n     the president and CEO of the Oklahoma Bankers Association. \n     ``They don't think we'll do anything to kick them out of \n     office. We are trying to change that perception.''\n       Unlike traditional banking PACs, which target hundreds of \n     House and Senate races, the SuperPAC instead is focusing on \n     making a big difference in just a handful of close elections.\n       SuperPACs are the latest campaign finance innovation, made \n     possible by two 2010 court decisions. They are officially \n     known as ``independent-expenditure only committees'' because \n     they are not allowed to coordinate their activities with \n     candidates. SuperPACs are attractive because there are no \n     limits on contributions or expenditures.\n       With a regular political action committee, like the \n     American Bankers Association's BankPAC, an individual may \n     donate no more than $5,000 a year. Then the PAC may \n     contribute up to $10,000 to any one candidate in an \n     election--cycle $5,000 for the primary and another $5,000 for \n     the general election.\n       But Friends of Traditional Banking can direct as much money \n     as it can raise to certain races without such restrictions. \n     Matt Packard, the SuperPAC's chairman and president and CEO \n     of $670 million-asset Central Bank in Provo, Utah, views the \n     SuperPAC as a complement to BankPAC.\n       ``BankPAC is much broader and covers lots of different \n     candidates. This is much more surgical,'' Packard says. ``If \n     someone says I am going to give your opponent $5,000 or \n     $10,000, you might say, `Yea, okay.' But if you say the \n     bankers are going to put in $100,000 or $500,000 or $1 \n     million into your opponent's campaign, that starts to draw \n     some attention.\n       ``That's why I think this is much more instrumental than \n     BankPAC in a close race.''\n       Friends of Traditional Banking will ask contributors to \n     pledge from $150 to $500 to two congressional races each \n     election cycle. An advisory council will research races and \n     select the candidates to be targeted. A board of directors \n     will sign off on the selections, and then information will be \n     sent to those who pledged funding explaining how to donate to \n     a particular candidate.\n       The SuperPAC itself will not touch the money. Unlike \n     Emily's List, which raises money for female candidates, \n     Friends of Traditional Banking will merely point its \n     supporters toward the races and the candidates considered key \n     to the future of traditional banking.\n\n[[Page S3476]]\n\n       If 10,000 supporters sign up at the minimum pledge level--\n     not a high bar considering 2.1 million people work in the \n     banking industry--Friends of Traditional Banking would be \n     channeling more than $1 million. That's enough to make a \n     difference in a tight race.\n       ``My short-term goal is to get to the $1 million mark,'' \n     Headlee says. ``I have a lot of confidence that once we get \n     there we will get way beyond there. People will see how \n     effective it is and they will jump on board.''\n       SuperPACs are considered pretty cutting-edge, which is not \n     a place a lot of bankers feel comfortable. Headlee says the \n     first question most bankers ask him is, ``Is this legal?'' \n     Friends of Traditional Banking got Federal Election \n     Commission approval last September and federal banking \n     regulators have been briefed on the effort.\n       But SuperPACs are still relatively rare. As of early April, \n     407 had been formed and just 18 had raised more than $1 \n     million.\n       ``It would be nice to sit on the sidelines or sit on our \n     hands and say, `Oh we don't get involved in that stuff,' but \n     that just means you get run over,'' says Don Childears, the \n     president and CEO of the Colorado Bankers Association. ``We \n     need to get more deeply involved as an industry in supporting \n     friends and trying to replace enemies.''\n       Childears says he's seen SuperPACs in action, citing a \n     credit union that donated $50,000 to an independent \n     expenditure committee and defeated a candidate in Colorado. \n     ``Regretfully that is our world these days,'' he says. \n     ``Everyone from the Realtors to the credit unions to the \n     consumer groups are playing more hardball. It would be nice \n     not to have to engage in that, but we do.''\n       [The Credit Union National Association, the industry's \n     largest trade group, does not operate a SuperPAC. But it does \n     accomplish many of the same goals by marshalling both \n     institutions and their customers to donate to specific races. \n     PACs are allowed to make these ``independent expenditures,'' \n     or donations that are not coordinated with a campaign, and \n     according to the Center for Responsive Politics, CUNA's PAC \n     spent $837,000 to influence six tight races during the 2010 \n     elections.]\n       The ABA's BankPAC has spent $1.146 million so far in the \n     2011 12 election cycle, which ranks it 9th overall, just \n     behind CUNA at $1.184 million, and well behind the second-\n     ranked National Association of Realtors at $1.629 million, \n     according to the Center for Responsive Politics. BankPAC \n     expects to raise $3.5 million during this election cycle.\n       Gary Fields, BankPAC's treasurer, says it will contribute \n     to 380 House races and virtually all the Senate races this \n     year. Fields says the ABA is considering an effort that would \n     parallel Friends of Traditional Banking loosely dubbed the \n     ``Chairman's Club.''\n       ``For those bankers who want to do more than just \n     contribute to the PAC, Howard has his Friends of Traditional \n     Banking and we're looking at something, the Chairman's Club, \n     which would be a pledge program that would complement Friends \n     of Traditional Banking,'' Fields says. ``But it's only on the \n     drawing board and nothing has been rolled out to the public \n     on that yet.''\n       Fields, however, sounds more focused on the traditional \n     PAC. Asked if he is excited about the prospects for Friends \n     of Traditional Banking, Fields says, ``I'm more excited about \n     the ABA BankPAC . . . What we would like to see is more \n     bankers participate in the PAC.''\n       Why isn't ABA, the industry's broadest trade group, or the \n     Independent Community Bankers of America, the group devoted \n     to Main Street banking, involved in Friends of Traditional \n     Banking?\n       ``We didn't ask the ABA or ICBA to participate,'' Headlee \n     said. ``I don't think they want to have any kind of control \n     over this because we may piss some people off inside the \n     Beltway. We fully intend to. They have to work back there.''\n       ICBA President and CEO Cam Fine is enthusiastic about the \n     effort.\n       ``I am for any PAC that is going to defeat our enemies,'' \n     Fine says. ``I agree with Howard on this. More power to him. \n     I hope he raises a lot of money and hammers these guys.''\n       Beyond Utah, Oklahoma and Colorado, the advisory council \n     currently includes members from eight other state \n     associations: Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, \n     Minnesota, New Jersey and Vermont.\n       Headlee and the other state association leaders see Friends \n     of Traditional Banking going beyond bankers to tap \n     shareholders and customers and anyone else who sees the value \n     in preserving Main Street banking.\n       ``Clearly there are Members of Congress who have absolutely \n     no reservations about kicking traditional banks in the teeth, \n     and we are tired of it,'' says Headlee. ``We've got to be \n     able to defend the folks who have the courage to stand up for \n     us as well.''\n       The vehicle now exists. The potential is there. It's up to \n     bankers to make it happen.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Let me read what this article says. This is a member of \nthe banking industry who contrasts what the old rules would have \nallowed, and that is under the old rules where there are limits as to \nhow much people can contribute into a PAC, and that is $5,000 before \nthe primary, $5,000 after, for a total of $10,000.\n  This is what this gentleman, Mr. Packard, from the banking industry, \nsays:\n\n       If someone says I am going to give your opponent $5,000 or \n     $10,000, you might say, ``Yea, okay.'' But if you say the \n     bankers are going to put in $100,000 or $500,000 or $1 \n     million into your opponent's campaign, that starts to draw \n     some attention.\n\n  What that gentleman is saying, and what this whole issue is about, is \nthat if a Member of Congress is prepared to stand up to Wall Street, \nthey better watch out. If they are going to vote for a bill that \nprotects consumers, they better watch out because--as this banker \nsaid--there may be $500,000 or $1 million going to your opponent and \ngoing into television and radio ads.\n  So when Members of the House and the Senate are thinking about how \nthey want to address the recklessness and irresponsibility on Wall \nStreet--if they are thinking, as I am thinking, about the need to break \nup these huge banks which have so much power and have done so much harm \nto our country; if they want to bring about reform of the Fed so we \ndon't have representatives of the largest banks in America sitting on \nregional Feds--guess what. They are going to think twice about going \nforward because they are going to worry that when they go home on the \nweekend, there are going to be all kinds of ads from the banking \nindustry.\n  Maybe they are concerned as to why in America we spend almost twice \nas much per person on health care as any other Nation. Maybe they want \nto move, as I do, to a single-payer health care system. Well, the \nprivate insurance companies are not going to like that. They are going \nto pour huge amounts of money into advertising.\n  Maybe they are concerned that in America we pay the highest prices in \nthe world for prescription drugs. Are they going to take on the \npharmaceutical industry if they now have the ability to spend unlimited \nsums of money?\n  I come to the Senate floor this afternoon to express my profound \ndisgust with the current state of our campaign finance system and to \ncall for more disclosure until we can finally overturn Citizens United. \nI know the Presiding Officer from New Mexico has a very good \nconstitutional amendment to do just that. I have one. There are other \ngood amendments. Long term, there is no question in my mind that we \nneed to overturn Citizens United. In my view, it will go down in \nhistory as one of the worst decisions ever to come from the Supreme \nCourt by a 5-to-4 decision. Five members on the Court came to the \nbizarre conclusion that corporations should be treated as if they were \npeople and that they have a first amendment right to spend as much \nmoney as they want in elections, even though corporations cannot vote.\n  On election day, the average American, after studying the issues, \ngoes out and with pride votes for the candidate of his or her choice. \nThere are many people in this country who make campaign contributions. \nMaybe they will contribute $25, maybe they will contribute $50. If they \nhave a lot of money, maybe they will contribute $1,000 or $2,000. But \nwhat Citizens United is saying is that a small number of people who run \nlarge multinational corporations can spend as much as they want on \ncampaigns. And if that is what American democracy is supposed to be \nabout, you surely could have fooled me, and I think many of the \nAmericans who have put their lives on the line to defend American \ndemocracy. American democracy is one person, one vote. We are all in \nthis together. You may be rich or you may be poor, but under our \nConstitution you have one vote.\n  This country has had to go through a very rocky process to ensure one \nperson, one vote. In the beginning poor whites could not vote, women \ncould not vote, African Americans could not vote. We struggled and \nstruggled, and we said in America every citizen of this country is \ngoing to have their say on election day. That is what we learned when \nwe were in elementary school. That is what democracy is about. And by a \n5-to-4 Supreme Court vote, the Supreme Court said: Everybody has one \nvote, but if you are rich or if you are the head of a corporation, you \ncan go into corporate treasuries and spend as much money as you want. \nFor the average Joe, it is one vote. Corporate America can spend \nunlimited sums of money buying the airwaves, and we are seeing this \ntoday.\n  This is no academic or intellectual debate. People all over America \nare\n\n[[Page S3477]]\n\nseeing the results of Citizens United today on their television \nstations and on their radio stations. In the past few months the \nAmerican people have seen what Citizens United means.\n  According to the Center for Responsive Politics, super PACs alone \nhave spent over $112 million on this election, and we are still more \nthan 5 months away from election day. If 2 weeks before the election \nthere is a billionaire out there or the head of some corporation, who \nis to say that person cannot take hundreds of millions of dollars out \nof a large corporation and spend it on an election? It is totally legal \nbut not what America is supposed to be about.\n  Mr. President, I know you are aware of it, once again, because of \nyour excellent constitutional amendment. What we are seeing throughout \ngrassroots America is that people are beginning to stand and they are \nsaying: No, we don't want Citizens United. We want to overturn it. We \nwant real democracy in this country.\n  I am very proud that in the State of Vermont, and in four other \nStates, State legislatures have gone on record saying: Overturn \nCitizens United. There are 209 cities that have passed resolutions to \nthat effect, including some 50 or 60 in the State of Vermont, and \npeople are organizing all over America on this issue.\n  I thank Senator Whitehouse and others for the work they are doing on \nthis DISCLOSE bill. This is the very least we can do, and I am eagerly \nwaiting to hear the arguments from those people who oppose it.\n  If I put an ad on as a candidate or if Senator Whitehouse puts an ad \non as a candidate, we have to say: I approve this ad. If you are saying \nsomething nasty or dishonest, the viewers have a right to know you are \nbehind that ad, you are not hiding. Right now the ads that are going \nout over this country--who is paying for them? We don't know who is \npaying for them. We don't see that pretty face on TV saying: I am the \nCEO of this corporation, and I approve this ad. We don't get the \nimmediate disclosure we should as to who is paying for that ad. That is \nall this DISCLOSE legislation does.\n  Long term, no question, we need a constitutional amendment to \noverturn Citizens United. It would be awfully nice if maybe our friends \non the Supreme Court realized the error of their ways and acted \naccordingly. But at the very least here in the Congress, we need to \npass a DISCLOSE piece of legislation and minimize the severe damage \nthat Citizens United is doing to our democracy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. It is my understanding I am to be recognized at 2 p.m. \nfor 10 minutes. I understand the majority leader has something to say \nat about 2:15 in regard to the progress of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the legislation \nthat is actually before us as opposed to the topic before, the Food and \nDrug Administration Safety and Innovation Act that we are currently \ndebating. In addition to reauthorizing the user-fee agreements, this \nlegislation includes many other important provisions. Members should \nknow what is in this bill and how important these provisions are.\n  There is language to permanently reauthorize pediatric research \nincentives, programs to incentivize antibiotic research and \ndevelopment, and more transparency and accountability for the FDA and \nstakeholders, which we hope will help to address drug shortages. That \nis a big problem not only in urban areas but in the rural health care \ndelivery system in every State. Every Senator ought to be aware of \nthat, and I am sure they are hearing about it.\n  In May I joined with Senators Reed, Murray, and Alexander in \nintroducing the Better Pharmaceuticals and Devices for Children Act, \nthe BPDCA. I don't think that makes a very good acronym, so I am not \neven going to try it. Back in 1997 Congress passed the Best \nPharmaceuticals for Children Act, which acknowledged the importance of \nensuring medications were effective and safe for children by providing \nan incentive for pharmaceutical companies to invest in pediatric \nresearch. In 2003, with the passage of the Pediatric Research Equity \nAct, Congress required the pharmaceutical companies to engage in these \nstudies.\n  These bills are often referred to as the carrot-and-the-stick \napproach for pediatric drug development. I prefer carrots to sticks \naround here, especially mandates, but they have proven over time to \nwork--the carrot-and-the-stick approach. Since the enactment of these \nlaws, approximately 426 drug labels have been revised with important \npediatric information, and the number of off-label drugs used in \nchildren has declined from 80 to 50 percent. That is certainly good \nnews.\n  In 2007 a complementary initiative to promote the development of \npediatric medical devices; that is, the Pediatric Medical Device Safety \nand Improvement Act, was enacted. This law has resulted in a fivefold \nincrease in the number of small-market medical devices designated for \npediatric use.\n  The Better Pharmaceuticals and Devices for Children Act will \npermanently extend these worthwhile programs, while providing some real \npredictability and accountability for pediatric drug and medical device \ndevelopment.\n  The legislation also includes the Generating Antibiotic Incentives \nNow Act that I joined with Senators Blumenthal and Corker in supporting \nlast year. This title contains provisions that aim to boost development \nof products to treat serious and life-threatening infections--something \nthat is a growing problem in all of our hospitals. It provides \nmeaningful market incentives and reduces--get this--reduces regulatory \nburdens. Glory be. Here is a bill that actually reduces regulatory \nburdens to encourage development of new antibiotics. Why? Well, the \nantibiotic pipeline has slowed to an alarming rate. According to the \nFDA, the approval of such drugs has decreased by 70 percent since the \nmid-1980s. This is unacceptable. The development of just one new \nantibiotic can take upwards of 10 years. We must act now to avoid a \npotential health care crisis.\n  When I am back in Kansas--and I know when other Senators are back in \ntheir States--talking to folks about health care, I often hear about \nthe problem with drug shortages. When a problem exists in an urban \nsetting, simply multiply that 10 times, and that is what we have in our \nrural areas. This is never more true than on the issue of drug \nshortages. This is a crisis. As difficult as it is to hear from my \nhospital administrators and pharmacists in Kansas about the \ndifficulties they are having in getting drugs to fill prescriptions for \npatients, nothing compares to the patients and the families of patients \nwho can't get their drugs, who can't get their treatment, who are \nalready scared about their future and they can't get their lifesaving \nmedication due to shortages. This is unacceptable. That is why I joined \nwith a number of my colleagues on the HELP Committee to work together \nto see if we could come to a bipartisan consensus on a way to alleviate \nat least some of the burden drug shortages create. The legislation now \nrequires reporting on drug shortages, but it also provides some \ntransparency and accountability in the hope that we can get to the root \ncause of this problem.\n  Not everything in this legislation is what I would have done if I had \nmy choice--that is obvious and probably the case with every Senator and \nevery major bill on which we must make decisions. I am certain many of \nmy colleagues on the HELP Committee are thinking the same thing. \nHowever, I think we are all pleased we were able to come to a \nbipartisan consensus on this legislation and in addressing many of the \nissues that are affecting Kansans and the rest of Americans.\n  I talked with a fellow last night who said: Why can't you all work \ntogether? Why can't you pass something in a bipartisan way?\n  This legislation is a good example of exactly what that gentleman was \ntalking about and what a lot of Americans are concerned about. In that \nregard, I thank Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Enzi for all of \ntheir work and for all of the work by their staff and our staff over \nthe past years and months in putting together this important piece of \nlegislation. This took a long time. It took a lot of effort. It took a \nlot of hard work. Their commitment to a bipartisan process and their \nwillingness to communicate with all\n\n[[Page S3478]]\n\nthe members of the HELP Committee has led us through a relatively \nnoncontentious markup, and I hope the same will happen as we consider \nthis legislation on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                        Campaign Finance Reform\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Kansas for \nfinishing his speech in a timely manner.\n  I come to the floor to talk a little bit about the DISCLOSE Act and \nCitizens United. For the last 2\\1/2\\ years, Americans have heard us \ntalk about the need for full disclosure of money donated to campaigns. \nIt is time for Congress to stop stalling and let the American voters \nfind out where the money being spent on elections is coming from once \nand for all.\n  All of our predictions in the aftermath of the flawed Citizens United \ndecision unfortunately are coming true. This decision handed a \nmegaphone to the wealthiest voices among us and strapped a muzzle on \nevery other American. Sure, average Americans can talk to one another, \nbut they are not spending $10 million on TV ads, and we know what kind \nof an effect that has. If anything, the situation is even worse than we \ncould have possibly anticipated because unlimited spending by just a \nhandful of the wealthiest Americans has put true democracy in danger--a \ntrue democracy of one person, one vote, of true equality. This is \nworrisome when we have such huge amounts of money being spent by so few \npeople who seem to speak with one voice and one conservative point of \nview.\n  The list of the top donors to super PACs reads like a who's who of \nthe richest people in America. The contributions to super PACs that \nwere released in the most recent disclosure reports are truly \nastonishing. Six-figure sums seem like pocket change now compared with \ntoday's trend of seven- and eight-figure donations.\n  Let's take Bob Perry, for instance, top donor to Mitt Romney's super \nPAC, Restore Our Future. People may know him as the former top donor to \nSwift Vets and POWs for Truth, the group that ran smear ads questioning \nJohn Kerry's military service in 2004. When we add up his donations to \nsuper PACs this cycle, we have almost $14 million of political \ninfluence from just one man. Another example is Harold Simmons. When we \ncombine his personal donations with the corporation he owns with his \nwife, we get contributions of over $17 million to six different super \nPACs.\n  Because disclosures to the FEC are only made publicly available once \na month, this paints a mere fraction of the picture of total super PAC \nspending. The reports don't even address spending through so-called \nnonprofit organizations. As we all know, 501(c)(4) organizations are \nable to serve as conduits for huge sums of anonymous funding that are \nnever publicly disclosed. I call them ``so-called'' because they \nfunction the same as the super PACs, except they can't say ``vote for'' \nor ``vote against,'' but their effect on campaigns, obviously intended, \nis just as real.\n  It doesn't stop at the Federal level. We are also seeing the concern \nover corporate spending at the State level through the Montana case, \nAmerican Tradition Partnership v. Attorney General Bullock. This case \nhinges on a challenge to Montana's century-old campaign finance law by \nspecial interest groups that want to take advantage of the anonymous \npolitical spending made possible by Citizens United. In fact, the \nfundraisers in this case, a group called American Tradition \nPartnership, solicits contributors by actually bragging about their \nsecrecy. In their promotional literature, they promise potential \ndonors:\n\n       We're not required to report the name or the amount of any \n     contribution that we receive. So, if you decide to support \n     this program, no politician, no bureaucrat, no radical \n     environmentalist, will ever know you helped make this program \n     possible.\n\n  It is no surprise, given mounting concerns about the corruptive \neffects of unlimited and often anonymous campaign spending on our \ndemocracy, that so many individuals and groups have filed amicus briefs \nto this case--including Senators Whitehouse and McCain, several House \nDemocrats, and dozens of others--urging the court to uphold Montana's \n100-year-old law.\n  We cannot sit idly by and watch our democracy put up for sale to the \nhighest bidders. Full disclosure--the kind the DISCLOSE Act of 2012 \nrequires--is still necessary to shed light on which groups and \nindividuals are funding our elections, to keep some modicum of faith \nthat the voters at least know what is going on.\n  In 2010 the original DISCLOSE Act passed the House and had widespread \nsupport in the Senate and from the President but failed to gain cloture \nby one vote because not one Republican was willing to step across the \naisle and do what the American people clearly regard as the right \nthing. Well, now there is no excuse. We have removed the original \nprovisions my Republican colleagues most objected to. All that remains \nis disclosure and disclaimer, plain and simple.\n  The time to act on campaign finance reform is now. While America's \nrichest billionaires can afford to keep contributing millions of \ndollars to super PACs and 501(c)s, America cannot afford to be kept in \nthe dark any longer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                            Flood Insurance\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the first thing we are going to talk about--\nI have had conversations in the last few days--in fact, a longer period \nof time than that--with Senator Vitter, Senator Coburn, Senator \nJohnson, Senator Shelby, and others on flood insurance.\n  Like a lot of things that happen, it has become critical that we do \nsomething on flood insurance. It affects almost 6 million people. We \nneed to get something done on a more permanent basis.\n  There has been a general agreement--we do not have it in writing yet, \nbut I want to make sure the record on the floor is clear what my \nintention is--that we would have a 60-day short-term extension. In that \nextension there would be language for the duration of 60 days that \nwould include in that the second-home subject that is part of the \nunderlying bill on which Senator Coburn is focused. That would be for \n60 days. Then I would be happy to make a statement here on the floor \ntoday that during the next work period we will move to that bill, the \nflood insurance bill, so we would have the opportunity to make it \npermanent. It is very important we do that. With the economy being such \nas it is, we cannot, in this area--and probably others but in this \none--we cannot have these short-term extensions. It does not allow \npeople to do what they need to do. Mr. President, 40,000 homes a day go \nthrough a process where they have to have flood insurance. If there is \nno flood insurance, that is 40,000 loans every day that will not be \napproved.\n  Senators Johnson and Shelby have done good work to narrow down the \nlist of amendments we would have to consider when the Senate takes up \nthis long-term flood insurance bill. It is my understanding there are a \ndozen or so amendments--six, eight on each side. But I hope we can do \nthat. If we cannot do that, we are going to have to go to the bill \nanyway.\n  I wanted to make sure Senator Vitter, who is on the floor today, \nunderstands that is my understanding of things he and I have talked \nabout in the last couple weeks.\n  I appreciate the work that Senators Johnson, Tester, Shelby, Coburn, \nand Vitter have put into working out an agreement on flood insurance.\n  As Senators have noted, this program that provides insurance coverage \nto 5.5 million people is set to expire next week.\n  If the program were to expire, new housing construction would stall, \nreal estate transactions would come to a halt, and taxpayers would be \non the hook for future disasters. So this is something that we have to \ndo.\n  I understand that Senators Johnson and Shelby have done good work to \nnarrow down the list of amendments that we would consider when the \nSenate takes up a long-term flood insurance bill. I believe that they \nhave made\n\n[[Page S3479]]\n\ngood progress. And we could consider eight or even fewer relevant \namendments per side on a long-term bill.\n  And thus I believe that the Senate can consider a long-term bill in \nthe next work period. And I am committed to turning to a long-term bill \nin June.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader \nvery much for this important announcement and this plan. It certainly \nmeets two--\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding he was going to ask \nme a question, because I do not want to lose the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. VITTER. Yes. I have no intention of his losing the floor. I just \nwant to thank him for the announcement. From my perspective, it meets \nthe two main goals we have been in search of: first of all, making sure \nin the short term there is not a lapse of the program; that would be \ndisastrous; that would cancel, as the majority leader suggested, \nthousands of good closings, really put a hiccup in the economy for no \ngood reason--and, in addition, getting to a permanent bill in the next \nwork period. So I appreciate the leader's announcement.\n  I would also note, as he did, that there has been great work and \ngreat progress in narrowing the field of relevant amendments. I \ncertainly hope that leads to a limited and reasonable number of \namendment votes, as he does, on the floor. I understand what he said \nabout, if that becomes unwieldy, we will just proceed with the bill as \nis. But that certainly it is my expectation. I will continue to work on \nthat amendment list so we can have a reasonable opportunity for \nrelevant amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am glad the Republican leader is on the \nfloor. We have worked very hard to arrive at this point where I am \ngoing to ask for this consent agreement. I appreciate everyone's help, \nand it takes everyone's help to get to where we are. That is why we \ncall them unanimous consent agreements.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the only first-degree amendments in \norder to the bill that is now pending before the Senate be the \nfollowing: Bingaman No. 2111; McCain No. 2107----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the majority leader suspend for one \nmoment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/23/senate-section/article/S3479-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3479-S3509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION SAFETY AND INNOVATION ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. So, Mr. President, we are going to have votes on these \namendments. It is my understanding that there is time, 30 minutes per \namendment. We need to get as much of that done today as possible. We \nhave an event for spouses tonight, so we are not going to be working \nlate into the night. We have tomorrow to finish this. We should be able \nto do that. I hope we can. I hope it does not spill and there is no \nreason it should spill over until the next day. We are going to also \nhave votes on the Republican student loan legislation and ours. That is \nwhat we are doing in the next 36 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me just add that I think this is a \ngood agreement that allows us to go forward on the FDA bill with \nappropriate amendments and also allows an opportunity for the Senate to \nexpress itself on the issue of the student loans.\n  I would join the majority leader in encouraging people to do their \ndebate today or in the morning because once we get into the votes \ntomorrow afternoon, they will be dealt with in rapid succession.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to discuss my amendment that would \nrepeal the costly and counterproductive medical device tax in President \nObama's health care law. In the mad scramble to find money to pay for \nhis $2.6 trillion health spending law, the President and his Democratic \nallies created a number of new taxes that serve no purpose other than \nto fuel this new spending. Economically, these taxes are a disaster. \nThey will undercut job creation, and they will increase costs for \npatients.\n  The new 2.3-percent tax on medical device manufacturers, which kicks \nin at the beginning of next year, is particularly onerous. For that \nreason, last year I introduced legislation to repeal it. That bill, the \nMedical Device Access and Innovation Protection Act, S. 17, has been \ncosponsored by 25 of my colleagues.\n  They understand that all of ObamaCare needs to go. The President's \nhealth care law is now over 2 years old. It is not aging well. Even \nbefore ObamaCare became law, the American people made themselves \nabsolutely clear they wanted nothing to do with this Washington \ntakeover of the Nation's health care system. The President and his \nadvisers refused to face reality, telling reluctant Democrats all\n\n[[Page S3480]]\n\nwas well in spite of the tea party townhalls.\n  According to the President and his congressional Democratic \nleadership, as soon as the legislation became law, Americans would come \nto embrace the wonderful benefits bestowed on them by the Department of \nHealth and Human Services. It has not quite turned out that way.\n  Poll after poll shows that substantial majorities of Americans \ncontinue to oppose the law and favor its full repeal. A majority of \nDemocrats think the law is unconstitutional. In a matter of weeks, the \nSupreme Court might issue a coup de grace to President Obama's \nmisguided adventure in big government.\n  Whatever the Supreme Court does, I want to be clear about something. \nAll of ObamaCare needs to go. It needs to be pulled out root and \nbranch. The entire thing needs to be repealed. That said, some part of \nthe law stand out for their wrongheadedness. The individual mandate and \nMedicaid expansions are flat out unconstitutional.\n  The IPAB, the CLASS Act, the Medicare cuts, and the employer mandate \nall deserve honorable mention for being bad public policy. Among the \nmost counterproductive parts of the law are its over $500 billion in \nnew taxes and penalties.\n  The medical device tax sits at the top of the list of foolish new \nObamaCare taxes, and my colleagues who have supported S. 17 and this \namendment understand the critical importance of eliminating it. I thank \nin particular my colleagues, Senator Brown from Massachusetts, and \nSenator Toomey from Pennsylvania, who have spoken on this issue and \nunderstand completely the devastation this tax will create for patients \nand for employers who provide good jobs for communities in their \nStates.\n  Thanks to ObamaCare, medical devices will get hit with a $28 billion \ntax. So we are clear about what these medical devices are, they include \nsurgical tools, bed pans, wheelchairs, stethoscopes, and countless \nother products that patients and doctors rely on every day. Surgical \nmasks, gloves, blood pressure monitors, scissors, needles, cribs, \ntrays, lights, stents, pacemakers, scales, scalpels, inhalers, and \nankle, knee, and hip braces, and a lot more.\n  The cost of all of those products is going up thanks to this tax. \nSomebody is going to have to pay for it, and that someone is the \nalready overburdened American taxpayer and middle-class breadwinner.\n  The President and his supporters seem to think we can simply tax \ncorporations and individuals with impunity and face no adverse economic \nconsequences. Yet economists understand when we tax these companies, \nemployees will pay for it in lower wages, the unemployed will pay for \nit with a job that was never created, and patients will pay for it with \nhigher health care costs.\n  Whatever our economic circumstances, this tax is bad news. But it is \nparticularly foolish given the precarious state of our economic \nrecovery. The President once liked to tout all of the jobs created or \nsaved by his over $800 billion stimulus bill. Yet by supporting the \nmedical device tax, the President and his allies have shown a real \ndisregard for good high-paying American jobs.\n  Medical device companies employ nearly half a million people. They \npay a salary that is nearly 40 percent higher than the national \naverage. These manufacturers are small businesses we must be \ncultivating if our economy is going to recover and we are going to be \nsuccessful in bringing down unemployment.\n  Roughly 80 percent of medical device companies have fewer than 50 \nemployees; 98 percent have fewer than 500 employees. ObamaCare's $28 \nbillion tax hike on these manufacturers will do nothing to improve \nhealth care, but it will do plenty to undercut the viability of these \ncompanies that provide good wages and good opportunities for American \nfamilies.\n  According to one recent analysis, the medical device industry \nprovided jobs to 409,000 employees in 2009. Yet this tax could result \nin job losses in excess of 43,000. It will hit certain States harder \nthan others: California, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, \nNew Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and my State of \nUtah. The presence of medical device manufacturers is significant in \nall of these States.\n  This new tax will roughly double the device industry's total tax bill \nand raise the average effective corporate income tax to one of the \nhighest effective tax rates faced by any industry in the world. The \nPresident and his allies frequently attack industries that choose to \nmove their operations overseas. But they do not seem to grasp that \ntheir policies are driving these industries to do just that. With the \nonset of this new tax, U.S. device manufacturers are increasingly \nlikely to close plants in the United States and replace them with \nplants in foreign countries.\n  According to another report by the Lewin Group, the medical \ntechnology industry contributes nearly $382 billion in economic output \nto the U.S. economy every year. President Obama, in the middle of a \nweak economy, facing high rates of joblessness, has decided to attack \nthat industry. It is bewildering to me. An industry that pays workers \non average $84,156 has become a victim of the President's desire to pay \nfor his new health spending law or, better put, those workers and the \nfamilies they support become the victims of the President's health \nspending law.\n  In my own State of Utah, the device tax is an issue of great \nimportance. There are over 120 medical device companies in Utah. As the \nUtah Technology Council wrote in a letter to me, these companies ``are \na vibrant part of the Utah economy providing high-paying, high-tech \njobs for citizens of our great state.''\n  They certainly are all of that, and they are under assault as a \nresult of this tax, targeted for nothing other than their success and \nthe fact that they were a so-called stakeholder that could pay a so-\ncalled fair share to subsidize the President's health spending bonanza.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 January 25, 2011.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Hart Office Building,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: As you are aware, the Utah Technology \n     Council represents the life science community in Utah. There \n     are over 120 medical device companies in Utah that are part \n     of that community. They are a vibrant part of the Utah \n     economy providing high-paying, high tech jobs for citizens of \n     our great state. Many of these companies you would recognize \n     immediately including Merit Medical, Dynatronics, WorldHeart, \n     Aribex, Utah Medical, Edwards Life Science, Becton Dickinson, \n     Watson Laboratories and Fresenius Medical Care.\n       The Governor of the State of Utah as part of his long-range \n     economic plan has identified the life sciences, including \n     medical device companies, as a targeted area of growth for \n     the state of Utah. The state's economic growth initiatives \n     recognize the importance of these industries to our future \n     and the rich resources our state offers to companies \n     operating in this market. The industry-specific taxes imposed \n     by the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act are of \n     great concern to us as an industry association because of the \n     impact these taxes could have in slowing economic growth in \n     this targeted area.\n       Therefore, we strongly support the Medical Device Access \n     and Innovation Protection Act that you are introducing. The \n     removal of this unfair and onerous tax will assure the \n     continued growth of jobs and innovation in this important \n     market sector. We appreciate the fact that you have \n     recognized the need for this statutory change. The imposition \n     of an excise tax is particularly burdensome for our small \n     companies here in Utah that operate on less than average \n     profit margins. To take 2.3 percent of sales as an excise tax \n     would render some companies unprofitable and significantly \n     reduce the profitability of most--not to mention the \n     catastrophic effect this tax would have on companies that are \n     already not profitable. If a medical device company is \n     operating on a 5 percent net profit margin, the excise tax \n     represents the equivalent of a 50 percent income tax. Such a \n     tax takes money that would otherwise be deployed in new jobs, \n     R, capital equipment and reinvestment in product lines and \n     redirects it to an entitlement program. It may seem a small \n     percentage of sales, but as a percentage of pre-tax profits, \n     this could range from 25 percent to well over 100 percent. \n     That is simply unacceptable and unwise tax policy--especially \n     in the current environment that is already struggling to \n     produce jobs and economic vitality.\n       Just as important as the effect on current companies is the \n     impact on investment capital. This new tax will have a \n     chilling effect on investors who will likely redirect their \n     capital to other industries not so burdened with industry-\n     specific taxes. Few investors\n\n[[Page S3481]]\n\n     will appreciate the fact that the government gets paid tax \n     dollars from sales before investors can be paid from profits. \n     It is a paradigm that creates significant disincentives for \n     investment. Without capital investment, job creation and \n     innovation suffer.\n       We not only support this legislation to repeal the medical \n     device tax imposed by the 2010 Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act, we feel it is essential to protecting an \n     industry vital to Utah's present and future economic growth. \n     We lend our full support to your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Richard R. Nelson,\n\n                                                    Founder & CEO,\n                                          Utah Technology Council.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Just yesterday, the Governor of Utah, the Honorable Gary \nHerbert, sent a letter to Congress addressing the negative impact this \ntax will have on our State. He wrote:\n\n       As a Governor of a state with a significant concentration \n     of medical technology manufacturers, I believe this tax could \n     harm U.S. global competitiveness, stunt medical innovation \n     and result in the loss of tens of thousands of good paying \n     jobs.\n\n  Now, there is little doubt the President's medical device tax, one \nthat unfortunately received the vote of every Democrat in the Senate, \nwill do just that--kill jobs and undercut our economy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Governor Herbert's letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    State of Utah,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                 Salt Lake City, UT, May 22, 2012.\n     Speaker John Boehner,\n     U.S. Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi,\n     U.S. Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Majority Leader Reid,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Minority Leader McConnell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Boehner, Leader Reid, Leader Pelosi, and \n     Leader McConnell: On behalf of the State of Utah, I am \n     writing to express my concern over the impact of the 2.3% \n     excise tax on medical devices set to begin in 2013. As a \n     Governor of a state with a significant concentration of \n     medical technology manufacturers, I believe this tax could \n     harm U.S. global competitiveness, stunt medical innovation \n     and result in the loss of tens of thousands of good paying \n     jobs.\n       As you know, America is the global leader in medical \n     technology, one of our only manufacturing sectors in which \n     the U.S. is a net exporter. The United States annually \n     exports $5.4 billion more medical technology than we import, \n     and accounts for 40 percent of the global medical technology \n     market. However, our lead has shrunk dramatically in the last \n     decade, and we stand to lose further ground.\n       One of my priorities as Governor is creating an economic \n     environment in which business can grow and thrive. As part of \n     this effort, I supported a comprehensive tax reform strategy \n     that reduced sales, income, and corporate taxes in the State \n     of Utah by nearly $400 million. In order for our nation to \n     remain economically competitive, it is time to also reform \n     our country's tax system.\n       The United States has not undertaken major business tax \n     reform since 1986. While the world's economy has changed, our \n     tax system has not. The medical device tax is an example of a \n     policy that runs counter to efforts to make American \n     manufacturing industries more competitive. In fact, the \n     medical device tax will make our tax system even less \n     competitive. Worse still, it is already causing layoffs as \n     companies prepare to absorb its impact.\n       At a critical time for both the U.S. economy and state \n     economies, the new tax will undoubtedly stifle economic \n     growth and job creation. We must have a national tax strategy \n     that encourages growth, investment, and export industries, to \n     help create jobs and expand the economy. Therefore, I \n     strongly urge you to consider legislation that would repeal \n     the medical device excise tax before it takes effect.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Gary R. Herbert,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. The President's health care law is a travesty. The \nAmerican people know it. They think it is fundamentally illegitimate, \nunconstitutional to its core, and enacted over the deep and loud \nobjections of citizens and taxpayers.\n  All 2,700 pages of that law must be stricken from the U.S. Code one \nway or another. Eliminating its medical device tax is absolutely \nessential. It is critical for our States, for our economy, and for \nAmerica's families and workers. I ask my colleagues join the repeal \neffort, and I thank my colleagues who have already joined as \ncosponsors.\n  I would like to briefly touch on one other issue that is of great \nimportance to me and to the people of Utah and others all over the \ncountry. Over 150 million Americans regularly consume dietary \nsupplements as a means of improving and maintaining their health.\n  The passage of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, or \nDSHEA, in 1994 brought clarity, predictability, and a better \nunderstanding of what the FDA expected from industry and vice-versa. \nDSHEA provides an appropriate structure that balances the risks and \nbenefits to consumers, with continued access and affordability.\n  Unfortunately, my colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, has filed \nan amendment to the current bill that would undo that well-balanced \napproach. As the author of DSHEA, along with my dear friend and \ncolleague, Senator Harkin in the Senate, I strongly oppose his \namendment. It would require facilities engaged in the manufacturing, \nprocessing, packing, or holding of dietary supplements to register with \nthe FDA, provide a description with a list of all ingredients, as well \nas a copy of the labeling for each dietary supplement product. \nAdditionally, the facilities must also register with respect to new, \nreformulated, and discontinued dietary supplement products.\n  While I appreciate my colleague's commitment, his amendment is based \non the misguided presumption that the current regulatory framework for \ndietary supplements is flawed and that the FDA lacks authority to \nregulate these products. This is simply not the case. Previously FDA \nCommissioners, including Drs. Jane Henney, Mark McClellan, Les \nCrawford, and Andy von Eschenbach, as well as the former Deputy \nCommissioner, Dr. Josh Sharfstein, have all agreed DSHEA provides an \nappropriate and sufficient level of oversight of this industry.\n  Under DSHEA, Congress set out a legal definition of what could be \nmarketed as a dietary supplement and safety standards that products \nhave to meet. It allowed the FDA to develop good manufacturing practice \nstandards and clarified what types of claims could be made. It provided \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services with the authority to impose \nan immediate ban on any dietary supplement that poses an imminent risk \nto public health.\n  DSHEA already provides the Secretary with enforcement tools of \nseizure, injunction, or criminal prosecution for ingredients that pose \nan unreasonable risk of illness or injury, are poisonous or \ndeleterious, contain unapproved drugs or food additives, or fail to \nmeet good manufacturing practice standards.\n  Furthermore, under the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug \nConsumer Protection Act, a manufacturer, packer, or distributor whose \nname appears on the label is required to report a serious adverse event \nrelated to the use of a supplement within 15 business days to HHS; \nsubmit any related medical information received within 1 year of the \ninitial report within 15 business days; maintain records related to \neach report for 6 years; and permit inspection of such records.\n  To me, that sounds like a whole lot of regulation. The FDA already \nhas a tremendous amount of regulatory oversight and enforcement tools \nwhen it comes to dietary supplements. Yet instead of urging FDA to use \nits current enforcement authority to find and punish those companies \nthat are not following the law, Senator Durbin's amendment serves to \npunish all responsible companies with its overreaching mandates.\n  Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention another obvious \npoint. Senator Durbin's amendment would have the devastating effect of \npiling on more work for an underfunded agency already struggling to \nkeep above water with its current core responsibilities.\n  Now, let me just say this: Before we passed DSHEA, there basically \nwas no regulation over this industry. We brought together, Senator \nHarkin and I, the whole dietary supplement industry to get behind \nDSHEA. They are behind it. It took over 10 years to get the good \nmanufacturing practices completed by FDA--more than 10 years, as a \nmatter of fact. But we provided for them in that agreement. We provided \nall the tools that are necessary to supervise and regulate dietary \nsupplements. To now add other obligations\n\n[[Page S3482]]\n\nonto this industry is just plain not right, and I hope my colleagues in \nthe Senate and the House of Representatives will recognize this is an \noverreach and not put up with it. We are not going to put up with it. I \nwill be voting against Senator Durbin's amendment, and I urge all of \nour colleagues to do the same.\n  At this point, I pay tribute to my colleague, Senator Harkin from \nIowa. Senator Harkin worked tirelessly on this bill along with me. We \nworked all the way through the Senate on a number of occasions on \nvarious things. We have improved the bill from time to time. We have \ngone along with the improvements. We have done everything we can to \nprotect the American citizens with everything that should be done. \nNothing further needs to be done.\n  This is an industry that deserves support, not condemnation. Senator \nHarkin has been there every step of the way. He is a champion for the \ndietary supplement industry, as am I, and a lot of others in this body. \nI think it is time to quit trying to overregulate everything to death \nand cause costs to go up by leaps and bounds. Dietary supplements are \nnot inexpensive today, although they are a lot less expensive than they \nwould be if we keep piling on these regulations.\n  Frankly, we believe we have all of the necessary language in the law \ntoday to protect the American public regarding dietary supplements. We \nhave given the Food and Drug Administration all the authority they \nneed, and every FDA Commissioner has met with me, as I recall, since \nDSHEA was passed in 1994, and has said they have enough tools to be \nable to supervise this industry properly and they don't need anything \nmore.\n  To make a long story short, again, this is an overreach by a \ncolleague, sincere though he may be, and as important as he believes it \nto be. I hope he will withdraw his amendment so we don't have to go \nthrough this again. If he won't, I hope our colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle--and this is a bipartisan effort--will rise and say we have \nhad enough of this and let's vote these kinds of amendments down.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his \nconcluding remarks regarding the amendment that I assume will be \noffered by the Senator from Illinois, as it is cleared to be offered.\n  I thank Senator Hatch for his great leadership on the issue of making \nsure the American people can have access to healthy, life-supporting \nvitamins, minerals and supplements, without having it go through untold \nprocesses and reviews and approvals by the FDA, and all that kind of \nregulation.\n  Senator Hatch was the leader on the DSHEA bill when we passed it in \n1994. I was happy to work in tandem with him on that. It has proven, \nthrough the years, to be a great success for the American people. The \nAmerican people all over this country take vitamins and other \nsupplements, and they are living healthier because of this.\n  I say to my friend that I heard the Senator from Illinois on the \nfloor yesterday give an impassioned speech about a very sad case about \na young woman who evidently consumed some energy drinks with a lot of \ncaffeine in them and had heart arrest and died. It is a very sad story. \nBut as sad as that is, you can't keep people from abusing things. \nPeople also die every year from aspirin poisoning, where they took too \nmany aspirin.\n  Reasonableness has to enter into this. We have worked together to \nmake sure the labels are good on all of these things, so that people \nknow what is in them. The FDA has the authority--as the Senator said, \nevery Commissioner has said they have the authority to keep dangerous \nproducts off the shelf and to remove them from the shelf. They have all \nthat authority. These cases, as I said, that Senator Durbin brought up \nare very sad, and you wish it were not so. I don't think it lends \nitself, though, to overturning what has been working now for 17, going \non 18, years and working well for the American people.\n  I join the Senator from Utah, and I hope the amendment might not come \nup. But if it does, it does. I am sure there will be some debate on it. \nI join with the Senator from Utah in urging all Members of the Senate \nto vote that amendment down. If it comes up, I will move to table that \namendment. Hopefully, we can approach this in a much more judicious, \nresponsible, thinking manner.\n  I say to my friend from Utah--and I know he agrees--we are not taking \nthe position that nothing has ever been changed. We have changed DSHEA \nin the past to make it work better. We did it after due deliberation, \ncommittee hearings, and going through the process to see what it means \nin terms of access to these products by the American people, to make \nsure we keep the intent of DSHEA there.\n  Again, I am more than willing, as chairman of the committee--and the \nSenator used to be chairman of the committee at one time, and then \nranking member--we are always willing to look at these things and have \na hearing on them and get more information. Again, I thank the Senator \nfrom Utah, who has been a great leader on this issue.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator from Iowa. I know Senator Durbin is \nsincere, but, my gosh, there is enough regulation and regulatory \nauthority in this bill, including the amendments we have added \nvoluntarily, to resolve any problem that exists. Frankly, I hope \neverybody will vote against the Durbin amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time does this side have on the \nbill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. For general debate, 24\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I reserve the remainder of my time on the bill. If the \nSenator from Illinois wishes to bring up his amendment, we can bring it \nup.\n  Mr. President, again, I understand I have 24 minutes left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will make a short general statement about the bill. I \ntalked about it in the past. I want every Senator to know that we are \nnow on the FDA reauthorization bill. This is reauthorizing the \nprescription drug user fee, the medical device user fees, and then we \nare authorizing a new program, the generic drug user fee, biosimilar \nuser fee, and so we are on the bill now. There is 30 minutes for debate \non each amendment that has been listed. Senators know who they are and \nwhat the amendments are.\n  I want to make it clear that the unanimous consent we just adopted \nsays that all debate time will expire at 2 p.m. tomorrow. So I say to \nSenators, if you want to take your 30 minutes and debate your \namendment, now is the time to do it. If you wait too long, 2 o'clock \nwill come tomorrow, you won't have the time, and you will be limited to \n1 minute. There will be 2 minutes on each amendment after that. Those \nwho have amendments and wish to discuss them, you are guaranteed at \nleast 30 minutes, but all time runs out at 2 p.m. tomorrow. If you want \nto talk on your amendment and make your point, now is the time to do it \nthis afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2127\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2127.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself and Mr. \n     Blumenthal, proposes an amendment numbered 2127.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require manufacturers of dietary supplements to register \n   dietary supplement products with the Food and Drug Administration)\n\n       At the end of title XI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 11__. REGISTRATION OF FACILITIES WITH RESPECT TO DIETARY \n                   SUPPLEMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 415(a) (21 U.S.C. 350d(a)) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(6) Requirements with respect to dietary supplements.--\n       ``(A) In general.--A facility engaged in the manufacturing \n     processing, packing, or holding of dietary supplements that \n     is required to register under this section shall comply with \n     the requirements of this paragraph, in addition to the other \n     requirements of this section.\n       ``(B) Additional information.--A facility described in \n     subparagraph (A) shall submit a registration under paragraph \n     (1) that includes, in addition to the information required \n     under paragraph (2)--\n\n[[Page S3483]]\n\n       ``(i) a description of each dietary supplement product \n     manufactured by such facility;\n       ``(ii) a list of all ingredients in each such dietary \n     supplement product; and\n       ``(iii) a copy of the label and labeling for each such \n     product.\n       ``(C) Registration with respect to new, reformulated, and \n     discontinued dietary supplement products.--\n       ``(i) In general.--Not later than the date described in \n     clause (ii), if a facility described in subparagraph (A)--\n\n       ``(I) manufactures a dietary supplement product that the \n     facility previously did not manufacture and for which the \n     facility did not submit the information required under \n     clauses (i) through (iii) of subparagraph (B);\n       ``(II) reformulates a dietary supplement product for which \n     the facility previously submitted the information required \n     under clauses (i) through (iii) of subparagraph (B); or\n       ``(III) no longer manufactures a dietary supplement for \n     which the facility previously submitted the information \n     required under clauses (i) through (iii) of subparagraph (B),\n\n     such facility shall submit to the Secretary an updated \n     registration describing the change described in subclause \n     (I), (II), or (III) and, in the case of a facility described \n     in subclause (I) or (II), containing the information required \n     under clauses (i) through (iii) of subparagraph (B).\n       ``(ii) Date described.--The date described in this clause \n     is--\n\n       ``(I) in the case of a facility described in subclause (I) \n     of clause (i), 30 days after the date on which such facility \n     first markets the dietary supplement product described in \n     such subclause;\n       ``(II) in the case of a facility described in subclause \n     (II) of clause (i), 30 days after the date on which such \n     facility first markets the reformulated dietary supplement \n     product described in such subclause; or\n       ``(III) in the case of a facility described in subclause \n     (III) of clause (i), 30 days after the date on which such \n     facility removes the dietary supplement product described in \n     such subclause from the market.''.\n\n       (b) Enforcement.--Section 403 (21 U.S.C. 343) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(z) If it is a dietary supplement for which a facility is \n     required to submit the registration information required \n     under section 415(a)(6) and such facility has not complied \n     with the requirements of such section 415(a)(6) with respect \n     to such dietary supplement.''.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this amendment is very straightforward. I \nwill not ask for a show of hands among Senators, staff, or those who \nare following this debate, about how many of them got up this morning \nand took a vitamin pill. I did, and I didn't have a prescription. I \nbought it voluntarily. I don't know if it does any good, but it was my \ndecision, right? I voluntarily made that decision. I think that is a \ngood thing.\n  The FDA is an agency that looks at what we buy and consume. It has an \nimportant responsibility. When it comes to certain things, such as \nprescription drugs, they test them--maybe the pharmaceutical companies \ndo the testing, but the FDA monitors it to make sure what is given to \nyou by your doctor is safe, won't kill you, and is effective. The same \nthing is true for over-the-counter drugs. The FDA has that \nresponsibility.\n  When it comes to the ingredients and the dosage, those things are \nestablished through the FDA based on disclosures by the companies, \ntesting, experience--it is all there. But there is another world out \nthere, a completely different world called dietary supplements, which \nincludes the vitamin I took this morning. That is a much different \nworld, a world with less disclosure, less transparency, and far less \nregulation. In fact, there is no requirement in the law today--none--\nthat the people who sell us dietary supplements have to register with \nthe FDA the name of their product, the ingredients it contains, and a \ncopy of the label.\n  That is what my amendment says. We don't require any testing by a \ndietary supplement company. We don't require any assertions of safety. \nIt would require simply that they register with the FDA that they are \nselling it in America. That, to me, seems pretty basic. It is not my \noriginal idea. It comes from a report of the General Accountability \nOffice in 2009. They recommended this after they made a review of the \nsafety issues with the FDA:\n\n       To improve the information available to FDA for identifying \n     safety concerns and better enable FDA to meet its \n     responsibility to protect the public health, we [the GAO] \n     recommend that the Secretary of the Department of Health and \n     Human Services direct the Commissioner of FDA to request \n     authority to require dietary supplement companies to identify \n     themselves as a dietary supplement company as part of the \n     existing registration requirements and update this \n     information annually; provide a list of all dietary \n     supplement products they sell and a copy of the labels and \n     update this information annually, and report all adverse \n     events related to dietary supplements.\n\n  In other words, did you take the pill and get sick? Does that seem \nlike an onerous, heavyhanded, big government overregulation of an \nindustry? Remember, the dietary supplement companies are not all based \nin the United States. Products are sitting on the shelf which you may \nnot know come from other countries, including China. Do we want to know \nthat? Would you want to know the company that is selling you whatever \nit is is at least registered in the United States? Is that too much to \nask if you are going to sell the product in the United States, that \nthey have to register with the FDA and tell us what the ingredients \nare? That seems pretty basic to me. I bet that 99 percent of the \nAmerican people thought they already had to do that. No. Let me tell \nyou that dietary supplements go beyond vitamin pills.\n  Yesterday I told the story on the floor about a 16-year-old girl in \nHagerstown, MD, who drank two Monster Energy Drinks. When you go to the \nstore, you see Coke and other things there. There are all kinds of them \nout there. She drank two of those Monster Energy Drinks and died of \ncardiac arrest. I met with her mom yesterday. She stopped breathing \nwhile watching TV. She was dead on the floor. They took her to the \nhospital and barely got her back to life for a little while, and then \nshe died a few days later.\n  Is it too much to ask of a dietary supplement company that is making \nthat to tell us what ingredients are in that drink? Is that the heavy \nhand of government? I don't think so.\n  Here is what we have found. Sometimes ingredients that may appear to \nbe benign and OK today turn out to be dangerous when you look at them \nmore closely, and maybe more dangerous for people who are younger, \npregnant, or in a compromised immune situation.\n  This amendment basically says that American consumers have the right \nto know the dietary supplements sitting on the shelf have at least been \nregistered with the FDA. I heard Senators Hatch and Harkin say this \ngoes too far, it is too much to ask. I think they are wrong.\n  Manufacturers, some say, voluntarily provide product labels to the \nNational Institutes of Health. That is true, and it is a voluntary \nsystem. Good actors share their labels with the FDA, but the bad actors \ndon't do that. The NIH is in the process of developing a label database \nthat currently has 7,500 dietary supplement labels. Do you know how \nmany products are on the market? They have 7,500 labels, with 75,000 \nproducts--75,000. So 10 percent are volunteering this information. So \nto say the NIH already has the information is 90 percent wrong.\n\n  Requiring registration, they say, of these labels is just too much \nwork for the FDA. No, as a matter of fact, the FDA responded to the GAO \nrecommendation and said: We agree the agency's ability to ensure the \nsafety of dietary supplements used by consumers would be improved if \nFDA had more information on the identity of firms marketing dietary \nsupplements as well as the identity and compositions of the products \nthey market. The FDA responded by saying: We want this information to \nkeep Americans safe.\n  So to argue this is a burden we shouldn't put on the FDA, well, they \nasked for it. The other thing is about how many supplements are being \nsold in the United States. I said 75,000. That was the estimate in \n2008. The number, I am afraid, is much larger. In terms of how many \ncome on the market each year, it is just a wild guess because it is the \nWild West. It is an open market. Any country that wants to export their \ndietary supplement to the United States--whether it is from China or \nIndia or Africa or Europe or Mexico--be my guest. They don't even have \nto show up and register with the FDA.\n  This is a simple amendment. It just says any company wishing to do \nbusiness in the United States, to sell their dietary supplement, must \ntell us who they are and what they are selling and what their label \nlooks like. That is not too much to ask to protect families from some \nharmful consequences.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time Senator Hatch \nused\n\n[[Page S3484]]\n\nbe counted retroactively against the time in opposition to my \namendment, No. 2127.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. On this amendment, I appreciate the concern, the interest, \nand the effort the Senator from Illinois has gone to on this bill. But \nin looking at it, there is still a couple of steps missing if this were \nto become law. Yes, it would provide a lot of information to the FDA. \nIt would, in fact, flood them with information, and I think we would \nflood them with more information than they could possibly process.\n  But that part doesn't even bother me. What bothers me is how we get \nthat information to the consumer. It is the consumer that needs to know \nwhat they are drinking, eating, and everything else. That is why we \nprovide labeling on a lot of things. But even the things we already \nprovide labeling on, the consumer doesn't necessarily pay attention to \nit. Probably the people who need to pay the most attention to it don't \npay any attention to it. So just making this information available to \nthe FDA doesn't get it to the point where the consumer can know. Of \ncourse, anytime we start talking in this area, people get worried about \nthe amount of regulation we put on things they consider to be very \nimportant to them and can do no harm.\n  The right way to address this important issue is for the HELP \nCommittee to have hearings and work together, as we have done on this \nbill, to find common ground on the policy. When we find common ground, \nas we have on this FDA bill, then we can get something done. But I \nthink this is a little premature. So I hope people will not support \nthis amendment at this time.\n  I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes in favor of the amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I just want to say, first of all, that I \nhave the greatest respect, as he knows, for the Senator from Illinois. \nHe is one of the true consumer champions in the entire Congress and has \nbeen for all of his time here. So it is kind of hard to argue against \nthe Senator when he is such a champion of consumers. But on this issue \nI think we part a little company.\n  I want to make it very clear that under DSHEA, supplement labels must \nalready disclose their ingredients--must disclose their ingredients. \nEven when a product is reformulated, if the supplement contains new \ningredients, then the label must reflect that change. These were all \nadded to the bill. We added that for consumer protection.\n  Now, again, it is not as though FDA doesn't know what is out there. \nUnder current law, supplement manufacturers have to biannually register \ntheir products. There is a biannual registration requirement right now. \nSo the concern is that FDA just doesn't have the resources to do \nanything. I have tried--and the Senator knows because he is on the \nAppropriations Committee--to get more funds for the FDA to do this, but \nwe haven't been able to get the funds necessary for the FDA to even do \nwhat jobs they are supposed to do now.\n  I repeat for emphasis sake that every FDA Commissioner--those \nappointed both by Democratic or Republican Presidents--have said the \nDSHEA gives them adequate authority to keep dangerous products off the \nshelves. So the authority is already there. What the FDA needs is the \nresources. That is money. That means appropriations. Quite frankly, I \ndon't see that happening this year--that we are going to give them any \nmore. We are just going to give them more of a burden, and I think it \nwill give a false sense of security to people because FDA simply won't \nbe able to do that.\n  Lastly, as the Senator did say, we do have a voluntary program for \ningredients and things with the dietary supplements with the National \nInstitutes of Health that is already in place. That is coupled with the \nbiannual reporting requirements plus the fact every dietary supplement \nhas to have the ingredients listed on the label. So there is plenty of \nconsumer protections out there. It is just that we can't protect a \nconsumer who doesn't want to follow directions, who doesn't want to \nfollow the guidelines listed on the labels themselves. I don't know how \nto protect people from that. Sometimes we just have to continually tell \npeople to follow the directions. If they follow the directions, they \nwill be fine.\n  That is why I think this amendment is ill-timed. I said to the \nSenator, and I mean this, that the Senator from Utah and our committee \nwould be more than happy to have hearings again to flesh it out a \nlittle more and to see just what might be possible. But I come down to \nthis as the bottom line: The FDA needs more money and they need more \npersonnel to do this job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on my amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. On my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the Senator's side.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Any time remaining on the opposite side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I respect the Senator from Iowa and the \nSenator from Wyoming as well. They are two excellent colleagues, good \npeople, and this is a tough bill. The underlying bill is a masterpiece \nof bipartisan accomplishment they can both be proud of.\n  What I am saying about dietary supplements is no reflection on \nSenators Harkin or Enzi. This is an industry I have been watching for a \nlong time for a variety of reasons.\n  I would say the argument Senator Enzi made--that merely disclosing \nthe label ingredients and name of the product to the FDA doesn't get to \nthe consumer--argues for a bigger amendment than I am offering. It \nargues for a Web site and access and so forth. I understood that going \nin, and I agree with Senator Harkin that is an overreach in this time \nof budgetary problems. I wish we could do it. I think we should. I \nthink we have an obligation to. But I didn't put it in here because I \nknew the first thing that would be said is we can't afford it.\n  So we went to the FDA and said: Do you want this information?\n  They said: Not only do we want it, we have already publicly stated we \nwant it in reply to the GAO report.\n  We said: Can you handle it if we send you the basic information of \nthe products presently being sold?\n  They said: Yes.\n  I could go further and say more can be done, but that calls for a \nbigger role of government than even this amendment suggests. But when \nthe Institute of Medicine tells us that each year there are 1,000 new \nproducts--dietary supplements--being placed on shelves all across \nAmerica in stores and drugstores, where families and children are \nwalking in and buying them, how does anyone argue we shouldn't know \nthey are here; that we don't want that Chinese product that just made \nit to the shelf in Springfield, IL, to register with the FDA before \nthey do business here? How do you make that argument?\n  Shouldn't we assume, as a consumer, a family member, that when we \nwalk in the store that somebody somewhere knows this company exists, \nthat this product exists? Right now, they do not. The only disclosure \nto the government is voluntary. As I said, about 1 out of 10 companies \nvolunteers the information. That, to me, is not the way to protect \nconsumers.\n  Why do we need this information? Simply put, when an ingredient turns \nout to be dangerous, we want to know if that ingredient is in more than \none product and then go after it to protect American consumers. If we \ndon't know the product is in the United States, and we don't know what \nthe ingredients are, how are we going to find that out? Wouldn't we \nwant that basic information?\n  God forbid something happens with one of these products and someone \nloses their life, like this poor young girl in Hagerstown, MD, who \ndrank that Monster Energy Drink. She had two of them, and it killed \nher, put her in cardiac arrest. God forbid that happens again and we \nsay: You know, we didn't even know that product was in America because \nthey don't have to tell anybody anything.\n  The argument made by Senator Harkin is they have to put a label on \nthe product. That is a good thing. We also\n\n[[Page S3485]]\n\nfound out that sometimes the ingredients listed aren't the actual \ningredients. I will not get into that because that is another whole \nissue the FDA is working on. But that isn't enough. My colleagues \nshould see some of the claims being made on the labels of these dietary \nsupplements. They are preposterous. Not for all of them, some are basic \nand good, but some go way overboard.\n  Don't we owe it to consumers across America to give them the basic \ninformation, to at least let them know we know the name of the company \nand the ingredients in the product sold? Some people say they ought to \nbe able to sell whatever they want in America and never tell a soul. I \ndon't believe that. I think we have a responsibility in Congress to \nprotect these families.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Just one minor correction I would make, and that is under \nthe DSHEA law, the FDA must approve any health claims made by any \ndietary supplement or vitamin. The only health claims they can make are \nstructure function claims, but they have to be approved by the FDA. I \njust wanted to clear up that point.\n  I would also say further that I honestly don't know of any vitamin or \nsupplement that is out there in the market that is dangerous if taken \nas directed--if taken as directed. As I said, anybody can abuse things. \nBut if taken as directed, I, quite frankly, don't know of any \nsupplement out there that is dangerous. Quite frankly, if taken as \ndirected, they help maintain people's health and keep them healthy \nrather than being injurious to their health.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will just close.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa. He will acknowledge, I hope, that no \none tests dietary supplements. No one tests them. Companies that make \nthese products may test them if they wish, but there is no requirement \nunder the law that they test them. There is certainly no agency of \ngovernment that tests the dietary supplements. So to say they are \nperfectly safe as they instruct people to take them on the label, how \nwould we know that? How could we possibly know that? There is no \ntesting involved.\n  When it comes to prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs, there \nis testing involved. At least we can point to the test to say whether \nit is safe and effective. Dietary supplements is a whole different \nworld. I will just say that we are conscientious enough on behalf of \nconsumers to limit the amount of caffeine that can be put in a cola, \nbut then a company such as this Monster drink company decides to call \ntheirs a dietary supplement rather than a beverage or a food, and it is \nno holds barred. They can put in as much as they want. That is why that \npoor girl died. Two Monster Energy Drinks--480 milligrams, I believe, \nof caffeine--and she died from cardiac arrest. Is it too much to ask \nthat we know the ingredients and know the company?\n  The next time there is another tragedy, I would like to be sure we \ncan say we at least took this modest, tiny, small step forward to say \nto the industry: If you are a good actor, don't be threatened. But when \nit comes to bad actors and things coming in from overseas, we are going \nto make you show up and identify who you are and what you are selling, \nperiod. That is it.\n  So at this point, I yield the floor and yield back the remainder of \nmy time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, Mr. President, I have to ask, how much time \nremains on the bill for both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 19 minutes and the minority \nhas 29 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2109\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his hard work on \nthis legislation and for the opportunity to talk about what I consider \nto be a very important amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to call up my amendment No. 2109.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2109.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To revoke the exclusivity of certain entities that are \nresponsible for violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, \n             the False Claims Act, and other certain laws)\n\n       At the end of title XI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 11__. CONDITIONS ON AWARD OF DRUG EXCLUSIVITY.\n\n       Subchapter E of chapter V (21 U.S.C. 360bbb et seq.) is \n     amended by inserting after section 569C, as added by this \n     Act, the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 569D.

Mr. President, this amendment, to my mind, is an \nextremely important amendment and it has the support of some of the \nmajor consumer organizations in our country, including Public Citizen, \nU.S. PIRG, the Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, the \nNational Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, and the \nNational Women's Health Network. These are some of the large consumer \norganizations in America representing tens of millions of our people.\n  When we talk about prescription drugs, it is important to understand \nthat in our country we pay by far the highest prices in the world for \nprescription drugs. That is simply the reality. That causes enormous \nproblems because millions of our people go to the doctor, the doctor \nwrites a prescription, and then the person can't afford to fill that \nprescription. That is pretty crazy, because doctors are doing the \ndiagnosis, telling the patients what they need; patients can't afford \nto pay for the drugs because they are the highest prices in the world \nin this country. This is an issue we have to deal with.\n  There are a number of reasons why prices in this country are higher \nthan in Canada, Europe, and Scandinavia. Certainly one of them is that \nwe are the only major country on Earth that doesn't have a national \nhealth care program so that the government can negotiate prices with \nthe drug companies. So what happens in this country is the drug \ncompanies simply charge us what the market will bear--any price they \ncan come up with by which they can make money. The end result is that \nin 2009, prices in this country were 85 percent higher than Canada, 150 \npercent higher than France, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, and so forth \nand so on.\n  But the reason drug prices are high in this country is not just that \nwe don't have a national health care program, it is because of the \nenormous amount of fraud that takes place within the pharmaceutical \nindustry. In fact, every single year the major drug companies are \nripping off the American people to the tune of billions of dollars a \nyear because of fraudulent practices.\n  While I do not have enough time here today to recite every example of \nfraud that has been caught and prosecuted in the last 10 years. But \nhere is the bottom line--and I am going to list some of the cases of \nfraud. Virtually every major pharmaceutical company in this country has \neither been convicted of fraud--i.e., ripping off the Federal \nGovernment, State government, or individuals--or else has reached a \nsettlement. We have got to get a handle on this crisis. I am going to \nbore some people because it is a long list. Sadly, it is a long list. \nBut it is a list that has to get out, and it is an issue we have got to \ndeal with.\n  Abbott Labs is one of the top 10 pharmaceutical companies in the \nworld. It had $38.8 billion in revenues and $4.7 billion in profits in \n2011. Last month, Abbott reached an agreement with the U.S. Department \nof Justice to pay $1.6 billion for illegally marketing the antiseizure \ndrug Depakote. According to the New York Times:\n\n       As part of the agreement, Abbott said that it would pay \n     $800 million to resolve civil cases brought by federal and \n     state authorities, $700 million in criminal penalties and \n     $100 million to states in connection with consumer protection \n     matters.\n\n  That was just last month, they are going to pay $1.6 billion.\n  In 2010, 2 years ago, Abbott and two smaller companies collectively \nagreed to pay $429 million to settle charges that they deliberately \nmisreported drug pricing in order to hike reimbursements from Medicare \nand Medicaid. That is Abbott in recent years.\n  Pfizer is the largest pharmaceutical company in the world, $67.9 \nbillion in revenues and $10 billion in profits in 2011. Pfizer in 2012, \nthis year, allegedly avoided paying hundreds of millions in rebates due \nto State Medicaid Programs for Prontonix. Pfizer holds four different \nexclusives for Prontonix. Talks are under way with the U.S. Department \nof Justice to settle the charges for up to $2 billion for ripping off \nMedicaid.\n  In 2009, Pfizer agreed to plead guilty to a felony of ``misbranding \nBextra with the intent to defraud or mislead'' and to pay $1 billion to \nresolve allegations under the civil False Claims Act.\n  In 2004, a division of Pfizer pled guilty to two felonies and agreed \nto pay $430 million to settle charges that it fraudulently promoted the \ndrug Neurontin for a string of unapproved uses.\n  Johnson & Johnson is the second largest pharmaceutical company in the \nworld, which had $65 billion in revenues and almost $10 billion in \nprofits in 2011.\n  In 2012, this year, Johnson & Johnson illegally marketed Risperdal, \nan antipsychotic medication, to nursing home patients, and paid over $2 \nbillion in fines, which constituted a mere 6.3 percent of sales revenue \nfrom the drugs.\n  In 2010, two subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson illegally marketed the \nepilepsy drug Topamax for off-label psychiatric uses.\n  Now we go to Merck. Merck is the third largest pharmaceutical company \nin the world. In 2011, last year, Merck pleaded guilty to a criminal \nmisdemeanor charge for violation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, \nand paid a $950 million settlement for illegally promoting Vioxx for \nrheumatoid arthritis before that use was approved.\n  In 2011, Merck will pay the State of Massachusetts $24 million to \nsettle claims that former subsidiary Warrick Pharmaceuticals reported \ninflated and false prices for asthma medications, causing the State's \nMedicaid Program to overpay.\n  In 2008, Merck reached a $670 million settlement for fraud on \npatients and Medicare/Medicaid, involving a conspiracy with hospitals \nto give the elderly cheaper drugs but charging them for the more \nexpensive product.\n  Now we go to GlaxoSmithKline. GlaxoSmithKline is, again, one of the \nlargest pharmaceutical companies in the world. It made profits of \nalmost $44 billion in 2011.\n  GlaxoSmithKline in 2011 announced that it had reached an ``agreement \nin principle'' with the U.S. government to pay $3 billion to conclude \nthe company's most significant ongoing Federal Government \ninvestigations, specifically illegal sales and marketing practices in \nColorado and Massachusetts; overcharging the Medicaid rebate program; \nand illegal development and marketing of Avandia, a diabetes drug.\n  In 2006, GlaxoSmithKline agreed to pay $14 million to settle \nallegations that it engaged in patient fraud.\n  In 2005, GlaxoSmithKline paid $150 million to settle claims it \novercharged the government for two antinausea drugs.\n  In 2003, GlaxoSmithKline signed a corporate integrity agreement and \npaid $88 million in a civil fine for overcharging Medicaid.\n  And on and on and on it goes.\n  When we talk about the high cost of health care, when we talk about \nthe fact that the United States has the highest prices in the world for \nprescription drugs, it is important for us to address the crisis in \nterms of fraud within the pharmaceutical industry and the fact that \nvirtually every major drug company has been found guilty of fraud or \nreached a settlement in terms of fraud charges.\n  In 2010, the pharmaceutical industry achieved a dubious distinction. \nIt surpassed the notoriously corrupt defense contracting industry in \ndefrauding the government. The pharmaceutical industry accounted for \nnearly half--$1.8 billion of a total of $4.1 billion--of the penalties \ncollected in 2011 by the Department of Justice/Health and Human \nServices Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program.\n  In 2012--and this is quite amazing--the pharmaceutical industry is \nexpected to pay out up to four times the amount of last year's penalty, \nbetween $8 billion to $9 billion in penalties due to pending fraud \nsettlements with the Department of Justice. And those are the penalties \nfor fraud that has been discovered. Who knows what type of fraud is \ntaking place on behalf of the drug companies that has not been \ndiscovered.\n  Let me recapitulate. Virtually every major drug company has either \nbeen found guilty of, or settled charges of, significant fraud over the \nlast 10 years.\n  The question arises--and this is an important question--is fraud \nwithin\n\n[[Page S3487]]\n\nthe pharmaceutical industry the exception or, is it, simply put, their \nbusiness model? Is fraud the business model of the pharmaceutical \nindustry, which thinks that in most cases they can get away with the \nfraud, make huge profits and, in some cases when they get caught, they \nwill in fact pay a penalty but the penalty will in no way match the \nkinds of huge profits they are making from their fraudulent activity?\n  The question the Senate has got to address is, Do we look away from \nthis issue, do we ignore this issue, or do we finally address the very \nimportant issue of fraud within the pharmaceutical industry, fraud \nbeing practiced by virtually every drug company in our country?\n  It is obvious to anyone paying attention to the prevalence of \npharmaceutical industry fraud that our punishments are not enough to \naddress this problem, because apparently the drug companies are not too \nintimidated by the laws on the books. They think it makes business \nsense for them to continue going forward on their fraudulent \nactivities.\n  The amendment I am offering would send a strong and clear message to \nthe drug industry: Illegal behavior will not be rewarded with continued \ngovernment-granted monopolies. There are some things--patients' safety, \nthe devotion of scarce public resources to provide health care to needy \npatients--that are more important than drug company profits.\n  This amendment is designed to effectively deter pharmaceutical fraud \nby making government-granted monopolies contingent on good corporate \nbehavior. I think that is the least we can do.\n  This amendment would penalize any instance of pharmaceutical fraud \nresulting in a civil or criminal judgment or a settlement with an \nacknowledgement of fault by revoking any applicable data or marketing \nexclusivity for the particular drug or product involved in the \nfraud. giving pharmaceutical companies another factor to consider, when \nweighing whether to violate the law in their sales or billing \npractices.\n\n  If a company violated Federal or State law by inflating the price of \na drug in Medicare or Medicaid billing or illegally marketing a \nmedication, under my amendment that company would lose the remainder of \nany exclusivity period for that medication. Companies would be required \nto self-report qualifying violations to the FDA within 30 days.\n  Let me conclude by saying this: Our people are paying the highest \nprices----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Our people are paying the highest prices in the world \nfor prescription drugs. One of the reasons is widespread fraudulent \nactivity on the part of virtually every major drug company in our \ncountry. It is no longer acceptable to turn a blind eye to that crisis. \nThe time to act is now. This amendment would go a long way forward to \nending that outrageous fraud. I ask the support of my colleagues for \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate the concern by the Senator from \nVermont, but I have to oppose the amendment, No. 2109, because of some \nof the unintended consequences it will have.\n  This amendment would require drug companies to forfeit exclusivity \nfor certain violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and \nother laws.\n  ``Exclusivity'' means exclusive market rights granted by the Food and \nDrug Administration upon approval of a drug. It may or may not run \nconcurrently with a patent. Exclusivity is a very important type of \nintellectual property protection. Without it, innovators cannot \npredictably obtain returns on their drug development investments.\n  The stated purpose of the amendment is to combat healthcare related \nfraud. The premise is, if companies know their profits are at risk, \nthey will be strongly discouraged from engaging in fraudulent activity. \nBut this amendment is counterproductive: It will make it more costly \nfor law enforcement to fight fraud and could hurt patients.\n  Congress is also thinking of ways to improve healthcare antifraud \nprograms. For example, in a recent open letter to the health care \ncommunity, six members of the Senate Finance Committee, led by Chairman \nBaucus and Ranking Member Hatch, announced a bipartisan effort to \nsolicit ideas from the healthcare community on ways to reduce \nhealthcare waste, fraud and abuse.\n  Estimates of the amount of fraud and misspending in Medicare and \nMedicaid vary widely, from $20 billion to as much as $100 billion. To \naddress this problem, the six Senators solicited ideas on program \nintegrity and fraud and abuse enforcement reforms.\n  This sort of constructive search for real solutions is long overdue. \nHealthcare fraud is a serious problem, and I strongly agree that the \nCongress should develop substantive solutions to it.\n  The problem here is, the pending amendment does not really tackle the \nproblem of fraud.\n  Instead, the amendment uses a blunt instrument--revocation of \nexclusivity--to punish an incredibly broad range of legal violations.\n  This amendment would discourage settlements in fraud cases. A \nsettlement agreement concerning a listed violation would trigger \nforfeiture.\n  If a company knows that settlement would trigger a result that could \ncost it hundreds of millions of dollars, it will be less likely to \nsettle. This will make it harder for the government to settle cases, \nand increase the backlog of cases waiting for trial. It also creates \nthe risk that a fraudster could prevail or appeal, and prevent the \nprosecutor from pursuing other cases.\n  Settlement is an important tool in a prosecutor's toolkit. It enables \nthem to pursue a higher volume of cases, while still obtaining sizable \njudgments to deter future fraud.\n  In fiscal year 2011, the Departments of Justice and Health and Human \nServices together recovered nearly $4.1 billion in taxpayer dollars \nthrough healthcare anti-fraud prevention and enforcement efforts. The \nability to settle claims contributed substantially to this achievement \nby allowing the government to pursue a higher volume of cases.\n  Within the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act itself, there are \nalready robust standards and enforcement tools concerning industry \nmarketing and communications, and interactions with healthcare \nproviders and professionals.\n  The False Claims Act and strong anti-kickback laws are also on the \nbooks already.\n  This amendment will also discourage manufacturers from developing new \ncures. It creates tremendous uncertainty about whether investors can \nobtain returns on their drug development investments. If a trivial \nviolation of FDA's detailed, elaborate regulations could put the entire \ninvestment in a drug at risk, it will discourage investment in new \ntreatments.\n  This would severely threaten biomedical investment and jobs. More \nimportantly, it would lead to fewer life-saving therapies for patients.\n  This amendment could produce absurd results. For example, the \namendment would revoke exclusivity for a civil judgment concerning \nadulteration of a drug. A drug is considered adulterated if a \nmanufacturer violates FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices, known \nas cGMPs. There is no intent requirement, and no minimum number of \ninspection requirements to trigger liability. Some examples of cGMP \nviolations include: Washing and toilet facilities are not easily \naccessible to working areas; adequate lighting is not provided in all \nareas; laboratory records do not include complete records of the \nperiodic calibration of laboratory instruments.\n\n  It obviously does not make sense to strip drug companies of \nexclusivity for violations like this, which do not reflect fraudulent \nintent. It is disproportionate and counterproductive.\n  Again, I strongly agree that healthcare fraud is a significant \nproblem. The best way to solve it is through robust enforcement of the \nmany current laws on point, and continuing to work with the health care \ncommunity to find effective solutions.\n\n[[Page S3488]]\n\nThat would be going through committee hearings as well. The pending \namendment would not reduce fraud. On the contrary, it would frustrate \nthe government's current anti-fraud efforts, and ultimately harm \npatients and taxpayers alike.\n  I encourage a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside and that Coburn amendment No. 2131 be called up.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I object. How much time is left on the \nSanders amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has no time left. The \nSenator from Wyoming controls 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator from Oklahoma withhold? We have some \npeople who want to speak. Once the time has run, then we automatically \nmove on to another amendment and could bring up the Senator's amendment \nat that point.\n  Mr. COBURN. It is my understanding that the time is under our \ncontrol. At present, there is 10 minutes left.\n  Mr. HARKIN. There is 10 minutes in opposition to the amendment.\n  Mr. COBURN. I will be happy to yield to the ranking member. If he has \npeople who wish to speak in opposition, that is fine.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Senator Mikulski was here earlier. She wants to speak on \nthis amendment. If we just wait 5 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, first I thank my colleague from \nOklahoma. I just want to take a few minutes, if I could, to talk about \nan important issue.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am sorry, I was wrong. I thought the Senator wanted to \nspeak on the Sanders amendment. She wanted to speak on the underlying \nbill itself?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator just seeks 5 minutes?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Or less.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Since it is my time, I yield the Senator from Maryland 5 \nminutes on the underlying bill.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I will be very brief.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I say to our colleague from Oklahoma, \nhimself a physician, that he will be very keenly interested in this \nissue of prescription drug shortages. This is a problem that has been \nbrought to my attention by Marylanders, leaders of great institutions \nsuch as the University of Maryland and Hopkins, as well as family \nmembers who care for someone and find that, although there has been the \nright diagnosis and there is even the right drug to care for that \nproblem--like the dread ``cancer'' word--the drug is not available. So \nyou can imagine the last thing you want to hear is that your child has \ncancer, and then the worst thing you want to hear is that there is a \nshortage of that drug to take care of that child. That is not because \nit has not been developed, not because there has not been a scientific \nbreakthrough, but because there has been a manufacturing problem or \nbecause the company stopped making the drug when it was no longer \nprofitable. That is inexcusable. The bill before us does something \nabout it.\n  In 2011 we had more than 250 drug shortages. That is not incidents, \nthat is 250 drugs that were in shortage. Half of the drugs that \nexperience a shortage go into shortage multiple times.\n  This drug shortage threatens public health by preventing patients and \nphysicians from accessing needed medications. It forces doctors to \noften delay medical procedures, use alternative products that may carry \nunwanted side effects or to rely on foreign versions of drugs that \nmight not have been reviewed by FDA or it sends their very able \npharmacists in their institutions to spend endless hours on the phone \nto be able to come up with the needed drug.\n  As I said, this was brought to my attention by letters from some \nfamous constituents--meaning well-known in our community--with great \nhealth insurance who had a child who had leukemia and then found the \ndrug was in short supply. We heard from doctors who were forced to \ndelay or turn to alternative treatments, hospitals scrambling to manage \nthese shortages, and pharmacists trying to track down needed \ntreatments. Even then, we heard about gouging and we heard about a gray \nmarket. The gouging was pumping up the price when there was a shortage, \nand then there is a gray market where you can go to buy these drugs, \nbut they might not be the drug you wanted or they might have been on \nsomebody's shelf a long time and were flawed and even dangerous or they \nhad not been refrigerated.\n  I could go through one horror story after another. I wanted to bring \nthis to the attention of the full Senate because as we work on this \nexcellent, bipartisan bill on user fees, what we also have is a very \ncommonsense way of dealing with the drug shortage issue.\n  It has the support of the private sector and certainly those who care \nfor patients, as well as patients themselves. I hope we pass this \nunderlying bill, and I hope we do not tie up this legislation with \namendments that could either derail or deter it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the Sanders \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 7 minutes in opposition that remains \non the Sanders amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will yield myself a couple of minutes.\n  I join with my colleague Senator Enzi in opposition to the Sanders \namendment. We are all disturbed by a lot of what we are reading and \nthese big settlements. I know the recent one a couple of weeks ago on \nAbbott Labs where part of the prosecution case was actually that this \nwas part of their business model. Then they had to settle it. So this \nis all very disturbing.\n  However, that cries out more for, perhaps, looking at the criminal \ncharges and perhaps strengthening some of those things but not taking \naway exclusivity. If you do that, a lot of times you could take away \nexclusivity from someone who just committed a misdemeanor. A lot of \nthese settlements were misdemeanor charges where no intent was shown.\n  A lot of times, if you did this, you might penalize someone who maybe \nhad done something wrong in the past, and now maybe they have new \nleadership, a new company, and reformed themselves, and now they have \nto lose their exclusivity? You would not want to do that.\n  Third, if you do this--I think Senator Enzi pointed this out \ncorrectly--if there is no reason to settle, then people are going to go \nto the wall in terms of defending themselves, and DOJ doesn't have all \nthat kind of personnel and the time to do that. I think we would then \nhave an even worse situation of people committing fraud because then \nthey would know they would not have any reason to settle it whatsoever. \nSettlement is a good tool to be used by prosecutors to get cases to \njustice, to make sure consumers are made whole, and to let people know \nthey are being watched. That is what they do.\n  I think the Sanders amendment, while maybe well-intentioned--I know \nit is well-intentioned. I know the Senator has all good intentions of \nwhat he wants to do. But I think it goes too far and is not the right \nsolution to that problem. So I would oppose Senator Sanders amendment \nalso.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2131\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside, and I call up amendment No. 2131, which is at the desk, and ask \nthat it be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn], for himself, and \n     Mr. Burr, proposes an amendment numbered 2131.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require an independent assessment of the Food and Drug \n             Administration's review of drug applications)\n\n       At the end of title VII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 7__. INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall contract with a \n     private, independent consulting\n\n[[Page S3489]]\n\n     firm capable of performing the technical analysis, management \n     assessment, and program evaluation tasks required to conduct \n     a comprehensive assessment of the process for the review of \n     drug applications under subsections (b) and (j) of section \n     505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \n     355(b), (j)) and subsections (a) and (k) of section 351 of \n     the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(a), (k)). The \n     assessment shall address the premarket review process of \n     drugs by the Food and Drug Administration, using an \n     assessment framework that draws from appropriate quality \n     system standards, including management responsibility, \n     documents controls and records management, and corrective and \n     preventive action.\n       (b) Participation.--Representatives of the Food and Drug \n     Administration and manufacturers of drugs subject to user \n     fees under part 2 of subchapter C of chapter VII of the \n     Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 379g et seq.) \n     shall participate in a comprehensive assessment of the \n     process for the review of drug applications under section 505 \n     of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and section 351 \n     of the Public Health Service Act. The assessment shall be \n     conducted in phases.\n       (c) First Contract.--The Secretary shall award the contract \n     for the first assessment under this section not later than \n     March 31, 2013. Such contractor shall evaluate the \n     implementation of recommendations and publish a written \n     assessment not later than February 1, 2016.\n       (d) Findings and Recommendations.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall publish the findings \n     and recommendations under this section that are likely to \n     have a significant impact on review times not later than 6 \n     months after the contract is awarded. Final comprehensive \n     findings and recommendations shall be published not later \n     than 1 year after the contract is awarded.\n       (2) Implementation plan.--The Food and Drug Administration \n     shall publish an implementation plan not later than 6 months \n     after the date of receipt of each set of recommendation.\n       (e) Scope of Assessment.--The assessment under this section \n     shall include the following:\n       (1) Identification of process improvements and best \n     practices for conducting predictable, efficient, and \n     consistent premarket reviews that meet regulatory review \n     standards.\n       (2) Analysis of elements of the review process that consume \n     or save time to facilitate a more efficient process. Such \n     analysis shall include--\n       (A) consideration of root causes for inefficiencies that \n     may affect review performance and total time to decision;\n       (B) recommended actions to correct any failures to meet \n     user fee program goals; and\n       (C) consideration of the impact of combination products on \n     the review process.\n       (3) Assessment of methods and controls of the Food and Drug \n     Administration for collecting and reporting information on \n     premarket review process resource use and performance.\n       (4) Assessment of effectiveness of the reviewer training \n     program of the Food and Drug Administration.\n       (5) Recommendations for ongoing periodic assessments and \n     any additional, more detailed or focused assessments.\n       (f) Requirements.--The Secretary shall--\n       (1) analyze the recommendations for improvement \n     opportunities identified in the assessment, develop and \n     implement a corrective action plan, and ensure it \n     effectiveness;\n       (2) incorporate the findings and recommendations of the \n     contractors, as appropriate, into the management of the \n     premarket review program of the Food and Drug Administration; \n     and\n       (3) incorporate the results of the assessment in a Good \n     Review Management Practices guidance document, which shall \n     include initial and ongoing training of Food and Drug \n     Administration staff, and periodic audits of compliance with \n     the guidance.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, let me say how proud I am of all of the \nmembers of the HELP Committee on this difficult and complicated issue \nthey are bringing before us. Having been in business and under the \ncontrol of the FDA as a medical device manufacturer, this is a very \ncomplicated area of law that, if done right, will have tremendous \npositive effects, and I think the Senators have put out a very good \nbill. I congratulate my colleagues and all the members on doing that.\n  I have two amendments, and I am going to speak for a very short \nperiod of time on both of them. I will work with the ranking member and \nthe chairman to see if we can't get to where we don't have to vote on \nthem.\n  I would like to give just a little history on PDUFA and MDUFA. The \nreason they were set up in the first place was to help fund the FDA, \nand the reason the manufacturers agreed to do that was to get more \ntimeliness in terms of response to their applications. That was the \nwhole basis for it. And what we have before us today is some \nimprovement in terms of the FDA's response but really not everything we \nshould have gotten.\n  I, along with Senator Burr, asked for a GAO study to the FDA in terms \nof meeting stated performance goals, and we found out a whole lot about \nthat, and that is my next amendment, but I say that to preface why I \nhave this amendment.\n  In this bill is a wonderful requirement that causes the FDA to \ncontract with an independent management company to assess the \nmanagement of the missions and resources of the device regulation \ncomponent of the FDA. What is missing is that same independent review \nin terms of drugs. It is one of those situations where we invest in \nsomething that would pay us additional big dividends. I know it will \npay big dividends in the device area. It will also pay big dividends in \nthe drug area. I don't know what the workings of the committee are and \nwhy they decided not to put this in as far as the drug review process, \nbut having a second look at a very complicated regulatory and approval \nstructure could be very beneficial in terms of improving both the \nquality of the outcome as well as the timeliness.\n  So this amendment simply says that what we are going to do for the \ndevice, which is in the bill already, we are also going to do for the \ndrug side of the FDA. It is about gathering knowledge for both the FDA \nand for us as we help this agency perform very needed things.\n  As a physician, I read a lot about new science on new drugs. The \nthings that are coming in this country are going to be phenomenal in \nterms of new treatments and new drugs and new capabilities. In terms of \nour competitiveness worldwide but also in terms of how we address these \ndiseases, we need to have the most efficient regulatory agency we can.\n  All I am asking is that we treat all of the FDA the same in terms of \ntaking a look at how well they are doing, what could they do better, \nand how they could do it better. That report comes to us and the FDA, \nand so we can see the weaknesses. We have not been through every area \nof the FDA as Members of the Senate, and to have an independent \nassessment of the drug side as well as the device side will pay huge \nbenefits to the FDA, but mostly it will pay huge benefits to people of \nthis country in terms of the timeliness of drug presentation.\n  I won't speak any more to that. It is a commonsense, good-government \namendment. Part of it is in the bill, and part of it is not in the \nbill. It is something that will pay us big dividends not only in terms \nof health care and improving the operation of the FDA but also in terms \nof improving our competitiveness worldwide.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2132\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask that that amendment be set aside, \nand I call up amendment No. 2132, which is at the desk, and ask that it \nbe reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn], for himself, and \n     Mr. Burr, proposes an amendment numbered 2132.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide that a portion of the performance awards of each \nemployee of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, the Center for \n     Devices and Radiological Health, and the Center for Biologics \nEvaluation and Research be connected to an evaluation of the employee's \n          contribution to goals under the user fee agreements)\n\n       At the end of title XI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 11__. PERFORMANCE AWARDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services (referred to in this section as the ``Secretary'') \n     shall establish a system by which a portion of the \n     performance awards of each employee described in subsection \n     (b) shall be connected to the evaluation of the employee's \n     contribution, in the discretion of the Secretary, to the \n     goals under the user fee agreements described in section \n     101(b), 201(b), 301(b), or 401(b), as appropriate.\n       (b) Employees Described.--\n       (1) In general.--Subsection (a) shall apply only to \n     employees who--\n       (A) are employed by the Center for Drug Evaluation and \n     Research, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, or \n     the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research; and\n\n[[Page S3490]]\n\n       (B) are involved in the review of drugs, devices, or \n     biological products.\n       (2) Commissioned corps.--For purposes of this section, the \n     term ``employee'' includes members of the Public Health \n     Service Commissioned Corps.\n       (c) Effect on Award.--The degree to which the performance \n     award of an employee is affected by the evaluation of the \n     employee's contribution to the goals under the user fee \n     agreements, as described in subsection (a), shall be \n     proportional to the extent to which the employee is involved \n     in the review of drugs, devices, or biological products.\n       (d) Report.--The Secretary shall issue an annual report \n     detailing how many employees were involved in meeting the \n     goals under the user fee agreements described in section \n     101(b), 201(b), 301(b), and 401(b), and the manner of the \n     involvement of such employees.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is an amendment that comes out of a \nstudy of GAO's findings, and GAO did a wonderful job looking at the \nFDA. What we found out--part of it will be covered if, in fact, we do \nthis other study on the management, but what GAO is telling us is that \nthere is an irregular pattern of performance review at the FDA. Part of \nthe evaluation of about 40 percent of the people who are involved in \nthe drug and device approval process, in terms of their performance \nreview, has to do with the timeliness of their work product. And it is \nonly a small component, but it is still a component of it.\n  What this amendment does is it says: FDA, make this part of your \ncomponent on the people who are actually reviewed in the review \nprocess--not to try to push them to do it better but to have a \nmanagement tool with which to evaluate individual employees doing this.\n  The fact that they are already doing this on some--and what GAO \nreally said is that it is just a lack of management effectiveness that \nthey have not installed it everywhere else. All this amendment says is \nthat this should be one component as they evaluate their employees on \ntheir performance reviews and ask: How did you do on timeliness? Was \nyour work product timely?\n  The idea behind this is not to push drugs out that should not be \napproved. It is not to push out devices that should not be approved. \nBut remember that the purpose for PDUFA and MDUFA in the first place \nwas to fund FDA with additional money so they would be more timely.\n  The opposition I hear to this amendment that we are afraid that if \nthis is a component of review, they might review a product and let it \ngo when they shouldn't does not make sense since already 40 percent of \nthe employees doing this are being evaluated on this performance \nstandard anyway. So I would raise the question: If we are in opposition \nto this amendment, why in the world haven't we eliminated this as a \npart of all the review process already if, in fact, there is a concern? \nThere is not a concern with it. It is a good management tool. It is \nused in all sorts of government agencies. And I commend to the \nattention of my colleagues the GAO report that backs up exactly what I \nam saying and their recommendation. These are not Tom Coburn's \nrecommendations, these are the GAO recommendations for FDA. They \naddress the concerns of inappropriate pressure for early approval or \ninappropriate approval for drugs or devices.\n  Again, it is good government and common sense. It is how one would \nmanage a private organization. You would put every component that the \nemployee is involved with as a component as part of the review process.\n  My hope is that we do not have to vote on this. When my colleagues \nactually thoroughly study the GAO report, they will embrace what they \nare saying. It is common sense with sound judgment that deals with the \nFDA.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think the Senator is making a lot of common sense. The \nonly question I would ask is--and I don't know a lot about this. I \nhaven't read the GAO report. But if, in fact, every employee says, I \nknow they are going to get me on this timeliness. So it is the balance \nof safety and quickness, safety and expediency. In other words, we try \nto get a balance. We want devices and drugs approved as quickly as \npossible, but we don't want to jeopardize safety. Those are the two \nthings we always try to balance here, safety being the foremost. We \nwant things to be safe.\n  My question is, by enshrining this into law rather than in the \nadministration, would this somehow put more undue pressure on reviewers \nand others to do something quickly and jeopardize the safety aspect?\n  Mr. COBURN. My answer to the chairman through the Chair is that the \nFDA does nothing quickly now, and he knows that because he has been \nsitting in oversight over them for years. That is No. 1. The answer to \nNo. 2 is, if the Senator reads the GAO report, they have no explanation \non why they do it on some employees and not others. The fact is, if \nthis is a bad thing, why are they doing it on 40 percent of the \nemployees now? The No. 1 and No. 2 things the FDA is charged with are \nsafety and efficacy. Safety comes first. They get graded on how well \nthey do on that. So we have this counterbalance.\n  Well, what we have is a lack of responsiveness even though billions \nof dollars are going to the FDA from the device companies and the drug \ncompanies. Part of the deal was to make them more timely. That means in \nno way do you ignore safety and in no way do you ignore efficacy. The \nfact is they do deserve answers, and what is happening a lot of times \nis they are not.\n  I fully support the bureaucracy of the FDA in terms of them doing \ntheir job. I think they do an awfully good job. They are just awfully \nslow at it, and when you ask why, there is not a good answer.\n  The point is, if there are a large number of employees who are \nalready reviewed as a small component, it doesn't have to be a major \none, but it ought to be something you think about. Do I push this off \nmy desk because I am bored with it? Does the timeframe mean anything?\n  We are not going after eliminating safety and efficacy, we are going \nafter smart management, and those two things, safety and efficacy, \nreign supreme at the FDA. That is why we spend so much in this country. \nThat is why most of the drugs are approved outside of this country way \nahead of when they get approved here, because our drugs and devices are \nsafer and we are slow to approve, and rightly so, but we should not be \nlike frozen ice slowly slipping down a hill. All this says is, let's \nmake it one component of many in terms of review. Again, I tell the \nchairman, this is not my recommendation, this is the GAO's \nrecommendation.\n  So I would appreciate consideration by the chairman and ranking \nmember for these amendments. I think they are common sense. We could \nlook at them again. If the Senator thinks there is a problem, we can \nput in a caveat. Let's look at it in a year and say: Have there been \nproblems because we have done this? But it is good management, it does \nmake sense, and they are already doing it on 40 percent of their \nemployees who are involved in the approval of both drugs and devices.\n  I thank the chair for his question.\n  I yield the floor, and I will be back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, first of all, I congratulate my \ncolleague from Iowa and my colleague from Wyoming for the \nbipartisanship of this legislation.\n  The FDA amendments of 2007 mandated basic public results reporting \nfor all clinical trials supporting FDA-approved drugs and devices. \nClinical trials results help both patients and doctors understand the \nbenefits and efficacy of a particular medical product.\n  Moreover, a July 2011 FDA report stated:\n\n       Understanding variable characteristics in clinical trial \n     sites is becoming increasingly important because of the \n     international nature of current clinical trials. The sources \n     of differences in efficacy results between the U.S. and \n     foreign clinical trials sites have yet to be determined, but \n     differences rooted in the conduct of the clinical trial \n     should be evaluated.\n\n  It has been 5 years since the passage of the FDA Amendments Act, and \nthe National Institutes of Health is still in the process of writing \nproposed regulations. The clinicaltrials.gov program and title VIII of \nthe FDA Amendments Act were considered major reforms and helped science \ninformation advances. If they are not being implemented well or \nadequately enforced, society will fail to reap the full benefits of the \nbillions of dollars in good medical science research.\n  This amendment before the Senate will impose a deadline by which the \nNIH will finalize both the proposed and final regulations. Further, 2 \nyears after the regulation has been in place, the Government \nAccountability Office will conduct a study on compliance with \nregulations and will look at, among other things, whether the \napplicable clinical trial is conducted domestically, in foreign sites, \nor in a combination of sites. The rapid increase in trials being run \noverseas makes it imperative that the Government Accountability Office \ninvestigate this matter.\n\n  Currently, ``80 percent of approved marketing applications for drugs \nand biologics contained data from foreign clinical trials.'' The ``FDA \ninspected 1.9 percent of domestic clinical trial sites and 0.7 percent \nof foreign clinical trial sites.'' We need stronger reporting \nrequirements to ensure we understand what the implications are of this \nmove to having so many trials conducted overseas. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support this important amendment.\n  Before I move on, I wish to talk about another amendment I am a \ncosponsor of, which is an amendment offered by Senator Portman that \nwill make dangerous synthetic drugs such as K2 and bath salts schedule \nI narcotics. I have worked for over a year now to get this legislation \npassed through the Senate after a constituent of mine named David Rozga \ncommitted suicide shortly after smoking K2 with some friends nearly 2 \nyears ago.\n  I introduced the David Mitchell Rozga Act in March of 2011, and the \nSenate Judiciary Committee unanimously passed it out of committee along \nwith two other related bills sponsored by Senator Schumer and Senator \nKlobuchar last July. Since that time, the use of synthetic drugs has \ngrown very rapidly, with the number of calls into poison control \ncenters going from as few as 19 in the year 2009 to over 6,000 in the \nyear 2011.\n  The House passed their version of this bill last December on a strong \nbipartisan vote, but one Senator has blocked consideration of this \nlegislation in this Chamber up to now.\n  So I am grateful we are finally able to have a vote on this issue, \nand I urge passage of the Portman amendment as well.\n  Madam President, I wish to go to another amendment, if that would be \nappropriate at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2121\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I call up amendment No. 2121.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2121.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide employee protections for the Commissioned Corps of \n                     the Public Health Service Act)\n\n       At the end of title XI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 11__. PROTECTIONS FOR THE COMMISSIONED CORPS OF THE \n                   PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 221(a) of the Public Health \n     Service Act (42 U.S.C. 213a(a)) is amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n       ``(18) Section 1034, Protected Communications; Prohibition \n     of Retaliatory Personnel Actions.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 221(b) of the Public \n     Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 213a(b)) is amended by adding \n     at the end the following: ``For purposes of paragraph (18) of \n     subsection (a), the term `Inspector General' in section 1034 \n     of such title 10 shall mean the Inspector General of the \n     Department of Health and Human Services.''.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, the bill before us, S. 3187, did not \naddress a top priority of mine, and that is ensuring whistleblowers \nhave adequate protections.\n  Four months ago my office learned of a very abusive treatment by the \nFDA on certain whistleblowers due to those whistleblowers' protected \ncommunications with Congress and, more specifically, with this \nSenator's office. Once the agency learned of the communication, even \nthough they were on personal e-mail, it began actively monitoring and \nobserving employees' personal e-mail, as one might expect, and they \nobserved those e-mail accounts for 2 years--for a whole 2 years--until \nthe agency was able to have the employee fired.\n  Whistleblowers shouldn't be fired for doing what is patriotic; that \nis, reporting wrongdoing to Congress. Regrettably, I was not shocked to \nlearn that the FDA was mistreating whistleblowers within its agency, as \nit has done on more than one occasion, and as I have pointed out to my \ncolleagues. I have been reporting those things ever since the Vioxx \nsituation of 2004, I believe.\n\n[[Page S3492]]\n\n  What makes this example different, though--and even worse--is the FDA \nintentionally went after an employee because it knew this employee was \nnot covered by the Whistleblower Protection Act. Now, it might surprise \nsome of my colleagues that all employees aren't covered by the \nWhistleblower Protection Act. This employee in question was a member of \nthe Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, and because of a decision \nfrom the Court of Federal Claims these employees--meaning the Public \nHealth Service along with other members of the uniformed services--are \nnot covered by the Federal employee whistleblower protections.\n  I think the court case was wrong, but anyway, that is the way the \nCourt of Federal Claims ruled. That ruling came as a result of the \nVerbeck v. United States case, and the Court of Federal Claims held \nthat an officer in the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps is a \nmember of the uniformed service and as such is not covered by the \ncivilian Whistleblower Protection Act, nor even the Military \nWhistleblower Protection Act. This same logic extends to the \ncommissioned corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration as well. So under the precedent of this Verbeck case, \nthe officers of both the Public Health Service and NOAA currently have \nno whistleblower protection under Federal law.\n  This is particularly problematic when we consider that the Public \nHealth Service and NOAA officers can be detailed to agencies such as \nthe FDC or the Centers for Disease Control. There, these officers, \nworking in another agency, happen to work side-by-side with civilian \nemployees of that agency doing very critical work to review and approve \ndrugs, oversee medical devices, and even work on infectious diseases. \nHowever, unlike their civilian colleagues who are employees of that \nagency and who are sitting right next to them, if these employees \nuncover wrongdoing, waste, fraud, and abuse, they can be retaliated \nagainst by the agency and have no recourse for it. That is exactly what \nhappened to this Public Health Service employee working in the Food and \nDrug Administration when they reported wrongdoing at that agency to \nCongress. They did it by personal e-mail, and the FDA got on to it and \nthen fired the one employee who was reporting to Congress but did not \nfire the employees who were protected by the Whistleblower Protection \nAct. So that is why I say this is wrong, and it needs to be fixed. This \namendment will fix it.\n  Whistleblowers point out fraud, waste, and abuse when no one else \nwill, and they do so while risking their professional careers. \nWhistleblowers have played a critical role in exposing government \nfailures, and retaliation against whistleblowers should never be \ntolerated.\n  For this reason, I offered an amendment that expands whistleblower \nprotection for uniformed employees of the Public Health Service. It \ncorrects the anomaly pointed out by the Court of Federal Claims and \nensures that officers in the Public Health Service have some baseline \nwhistleblower protection. It expressly includes the commissioned corps \nof the Public Health Service within the protections of the Military \nWhistleblower Protection Act. This is consistent with the structure of \nthe commissioned corps functioning like a military organization and \nmatches the fact that these officers receive military-like benefits in \nretirement.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment, which I was able to get into this \nlegislation, only covers employees of the Public Health Service. It \ndoes not address the commissioned corps of NOAA because of other \nSenators' concern that is not related to the underlying bill. So I hope \nto be able to address that remaining gap in whistleblower protections \nin the near future so that all employees of the Federal Government are \ncovered.\n  All Federal employees should feel comfortable expressing their \nopinions both inside the agency they work for as well as to Congress. \nThe inclusion of this language will ensure those opinions receive \nappropriate protections.\n  I wish to take this opportunity, as I did in my opening comments on \nthese two amendments, to express my appreciation to Senators Harkin and \nEnzi and their commitment and efforts over the years to reform and \nimprove the FDA.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Any staff \n     designated under the preceding sentence may be required to \n     comply with applicable confidentiality agreements.''.\n\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, let me reiterate what my colleague just \nsaid, which is that Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Enzi have done a \nwonderful job with a very complicated bill in navigating what was a \nnegotiation that Members of Congress never played a part in--\nnegotiations that happened between the Food and Drug Administration and \nthe pharmaceutical industry for one piece, the device industry for \nanother piece, and the generic drug industry for a third piece; and, I \nmight say, the third piece is the first time Congress will consider \nthis.\n  I think it is important that Members of the Senate, Members of \nCongress, and the American people understand that, typically, all \nlegislation is crafted in the Congress of the United States. It is not \nnegotiated in the back room of the Food and Drug Administration or in \nthe back rooms of the device, pharmaceutical, and generic drug\n\n[[Page S3493]]\n\nmanufacturers--except for this. In fact, my amendment gets at the heart \nof that issue. It is called the amendment ``to ensure transparency in \nthe Food and Drug Administration user fee agreement negotiations.''\n  The amendment is straightforward. It would ensure transparency in \nFDA's drug and device user agreement negotiations by allowing Members \nof Congress or their designated staff to attend the negotiations \nbetween the FDA and the industry. What a novel thing to say, that those \nwho are responsible to actually implement the policy could sit in the \nroom and listen. I am not talking about playing a role in negotiating.\n  Why is this amendment necessary? The bottom line is while the FDA may \nconsult with many of the stakeholders at various points in the process, \nthe drug and device user fee agreements are not negotiated so Members \nof Congress and the general public know exactly what is in them. \nCongress is effectively shut out of the process until the negotiated \ndeal behind closed doors is announced. In other words, we are presented \nwith what they have negotiated, and we are basically told: Here is what \nwe want you to pass. At no other point in the legislative process does \nit happen like this in the Congress of the United States.\n  The drug and device user fee agreements have significant implications \nfor the American people as well as Congress's ability to do oversight. \nThe No. 1 role of the Congress of the United States is to serve on \nbehalf of the American people as an oversight tool over Federal \nagencies. Congress should not have to read between the lines of the \nminutes of a negotiation to try to figure out, in fact, the spirit of \nthose negotiations. The ability for Congress and the American people to \nfully understand and weigh the negotiated agreements and the \nimplications they present for patients, taxpayers, the FDA, and for \nCongress would greatly be improved by ensuring that Congress might \nattend the negotiations.\n\n  Some of my colleagues will probably come down and suggest this \namendment would put Congress at the negotiating table and potentially \nwould jeopardize negotiations. It is not true. It is not what I am \nattempting to do with this amendment. The amendment merely states if a \nMember of Congress wants to attend or if they want to have their \ndesignated to attend in their place, they may. This amendment does not \ncall for Members of Congress to participate in the negotiation, or \ncertainly staff. The negotiations would still be between the FDA and \nthe industry, but it does ensure that Members of Congress or their \nstaff may be in the room and be informed of the negotiations in real \ntime. Congressional staff may be required to comply with all applicable \nconfidentiality agreements. The FDA's negotiations with the industry \nwould not be jeopardized. Let me say that again to my colleagues: would \nnot be jeopardized because the Members of Congress or the staff would \nbe there just for observation purposes.\n  Let me suggest that if our being in the room jeopardizes the outcome, \nthen we would not be allowed to attend the Supreme Court when some of \nthe most important cases are tried across the street. But Members of \nCongress and their staff regularly sit in and listen to the arguments \nthat are made.\n  The fact is, Congress should not have to wait to be informed of how \nFDA's public health mission could be strengthened and improved on \nbehalf of patients. By having the option to attend the negotiations, \nCongress and its staff would gain invaluable insight into how Congress \ncan work with the FDA to ensure the agency is fulfilling its public \nhealth mission on behalf of patients.\n  Congress has a critical role to play in the process. When the \nnegotiated user fee agreements arrive on our doorstep, we are expected \nto take them up, and we are expected to pass them quickly without \nchange. Let me say that again. We are expected to take them up, we are \nexpected to take them up quickly because we do not want to break the \ncontinuity of the user fee agreements, and we are expected to do it \nwithout change, because to change those agreements would be to break \nwhat was negotiated.\n  Let me suggest to my colleagues: This is the only time in the \nlegislative process where Congress is asked to take somebody else's \nnegotiated product and not to provide the input of two Senators from \nevery State or every Member of the House of Representatives. It \ncompletely goes around the structure, the legislative structure, of the \nCongress of the United States--something that has been tested and \ntested for hundreds of years.\n  So Congress is told to tiptoe around the agreements, and we focus our \nefforts on belt-and-suspender policies to complement the agreements. \nThis does not make for the most deliberative process in considering how \nCongress can work with the FDA and industry to strengthen and improve \nFDA's drug and device work.\n  As a matter of fact, I would say to my colleagues, as we talk about \nhealth care policy in this institution, where our goal today is how we \nreduce the overall cost of health care, remember, as we sign off on \nthis user fee agreement, every dime that is transferred from the \nindustry to an agency means industry is going to have to raise the \nprice of its products to accommodate what they are paying.\n  What are we here doing? We are raising the cost of pharmaceutical \nproducts, devices, and for the first time we are raising the cost of \ngenerics because an industry has negotiated something outside of the \nwalls of the Congress of the United States.\n  FDA faces unprecedented challenges today--challenges we could not \nhave envisioned a generation ago. The agreements and many of the \nprovisions in the Senate bill are intended to help address these real \nchallenges the agency is facing.\n  But I ask my colleagues this, in closing: What if they do not? What \nif they do not address the challenges? What if now generic drugs become \nmore expensive than some people can pay because of this agreement? That \nis why it is absolutely crucial that Congress play a part in this role \nto balance this policy.\n  Where will we be in 5 years when it is time to renegotiate this \nagreement? Well, I hope we are in a much better situation than we are \ntoday, that we actually have the right matrix in place through this \nlegislation--not something that was negotiated between the FDA and the \nindustry but something that the Senate of the United States put into \nthis language that gives people on both sides of the aisle the ability \nto have a yardstick of measurement of success. Did the agency live up \nto what they promised the industry and, more importantly, does that \ncompute to a beneficial product for patients across this country? I \nhope that is what we will find 5 years from now. It is what we have \ntried to construct in a very difficult and challenging piece of \nlegislation.\n  I will tell my colleagues, this is not an amendment I will ask for a \nvote on. At the end of the day, the reality is this probably upsets the \napple cart a little too much. But I think it is absolutely crucial that \nsomebody ask the questions of how can Congress legitimately stand here \nand allow something this complex and this important to be negotiated \nwithout the input, the full input of the Congress of the United States.\n  Again, I conclude the same way I started: I think Chairman Harkin and \nRanking Member Enzi have done a magnificent job of navigating a very \ndifficult issue, and they deserve a tremendous amount of credit for \ntaking a negotiated product and incorporating what I think are some \nvery positive changes that make this a better product than was \nnegotiated by the private sector and the agency.\n  My only wish is that the next time we do this, we will not have to \ntry to figure out why certain things happened in the negotiations, we \nwill be privy to those negotiations, and we will better understand \ncollectively how we can take an agency and an industry and public \npolicy and move it in a situation where the American patients are the \nbeneficiaries of it in a much more effective way than I think we have \ntoday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I thank the Senator for his comments and \nhis insight and his idea. I appreciate that we are not going to be \nvoting on this one right away because I think this needs a little time \nto germinate. I\n\n[[Page S3494]]\n\nthink it is something that, as people look at it and think about it, \nthey will recognize the value there would be if we had more insight \ninto what the negotiations were--not just on this but perhaps on \nregulations that are being done as well.\n  I want to thank the Senator, though, for the way he has dug into the \nentire user fee bill and made some very substantial changes in a number \nof other places. I do not know of anybody who works as hard on the \nmedical issues as does Senator Burr, and understands it, and gets into \nsome of the details. And, of course, he worked all of these when he was \nin the House and now works them in the Senate, and is our foremost \nexpert on any of the pandemic issues and was very successful earlier in \nthe year in getting that bill through the Senate. He has been very \ncooperative on the other amendments which are now a part of the bill \nthat we will not be voting on because they are already in there. I \nappreciate this one more suggestion and suggest that is something we \nshould take a look at.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I join Senator Enzi in thanking Senator \nBurr for being not only a very valuable member of our committee but I \nwould say the Senator's fingerprints are a lot on this bill we have \nbefore us. He has worked very hard on this bill and I think helped to \nimprove it every step of the way over the last year.\n  I was looking through the list of different things here. Senator Burr \nwas one of the leaders in our working group on the supply chain, which \nwe have in this bill to make sure those things coming from other \ncountries have good manufacturing practices on them and we can keep \ntrack of them.\n  The provision of clarifying the ``least burdensome'' standard on \nclinical data for device approval was also the result of the Senator's \nhard work. The Senator was also in the working group on the GAIN bill \nregarding antibiotic incentives for getting more incentives for new \nantibiotics. And there was a Burr-Coburn bill regarding enhanced \nreporting requirements for FDA, and that basically is also included in \nthe bill we have in front of us.\n  So in every respect, the Senator from North Carolina is a great \nmember of our committee, a very valuable member of our committee. As I \nsaid, we are looking at the amendment he has now brought up, and I am \nsure, as Senator Enzi said, we will be talking about this in the next \nfew hours and going into tomorrow. But I again want to pay my respect \nto the Senator from North Carolina and thank him for all the hard work \nhe has done on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Madam President, I wish to thank my friends on both sides of----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, an inquiry: Is the Senator bringing up--\n--no, the Senator does not have an amendment pending.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I wish to speak on the FDA bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator wishes to speak on which amendment?\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Not on an amendment, just on the bill overall.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, how much time is remaining on the \nGrassley amendments, the amendments offered by the Senator from Iowa?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 9 minutes and the \ntime in opposition is 15 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time does the Senator wish to take?\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Well, about 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would ask that 10 minutes of the time in opposition to \nthe Grassley amendment be allocated to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I object to the Grassley amendment.\n  I am joking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Thank you. I thank the Senator from Iowa for the time.\n  Madam President, I thank my friends on both sides of the aisle for \ntheir work on the legislation we are considering today. The Food and \nDrug Administration Safety and Improvement Act is not only among the \nmost important piece of legislation we will consider this year, it is \nalso the product of more than a year's hard work and negotiation.\n  This legislation will help support a culture of innovation in this \ncountry. It will help millions of Americans access the lifesaving \nmedications and devices they need, when they need them. As a member of \nthe HELP Committee, I am proud of the bipartisan bill before us today \nand look forward to passing it into law.\n  Let me tell you why. Of course, the Presiding Officer spoke so \neloquently about this bill earlier. The Presiding Officer does not have \nto know why, but let me tell you a story about a little girl in \nMinnesota--from our State--named Josie.\n  Josie seemed perfectly healthy when she was born, but at 9 months of \nage Josie's parents found out she had a rare congenital heart disorder, \na condition with the scary name of ``atrial septal defect,'' which \nmeans she had a hole in the wall between the upper two chambers of her \nheart.\n  When the doctors tested her, they found Josie had not one, not two, \nbut three holes in her heart. It became clear that what was originally \na fairly simple surgery to repair the hole was actually a lot more \ncomplicated.\n  But Josie was lucky. Josie's parents live in Minnesota, and Josie's \ndoctor, Dr. Daniel Gruenstein, works at the University of Minnesota. \nDr. Gruenstein was able to operate on Josie's heart because he had a \nbrandnew device the FDA had approved only months before. The device, \nwhich was also developed in Minnesota, saved Josie's life. Because of \nthis procedure, Josie was acting like her same old silly self the very \nnight of her operation, and she walked out of the hospital the next \nday.\n  A few years later when Josie's little sister Jenna was born with the \nsame congenital heart defect, Dr. Gruenstein repaired her heart using \nthe very same device. But too many children like Josie and Jenna are \nnot so lucky. Too many children do not have access to the medical \ntechnology they needed to save their lives or to prevent their illness \nor to help them recover from their rare condition. That is because too \nmany medical devices get stuck or delayed in the agency that regulates \nour medical technologies. It is because we do not do enough to support \na culture of innovation in this country.\n  The Food and Drug Administration has a tough job. The technologies \nthey regulate are moving at the speed of light, and they do not have \nthe workforce or the expertise to know everything about every new \ntreatment.\n  In fact, the number of annual 510(k) submissions--that is the most \ncommon kind of new device application the FDA receives--has quadrupled \nsince 1976. That is why when the HELP Committee sat down to develop \nthis legislation, we agreed we had to streamline the FDA's processes \nand make them more efficient. We agreed we had to do more to support a \nculture of innovation which will help manufacturers get safe \ntechnologies and treatments to patients. That is exactly what the bill \ndoes. I thank both the chairman and the ranking member.\n  It requires the FDA to stop using ``FDA days'' and start using \nregular calendar days like everyone else. It lifts restrictive \nconstraints on the FDA's consultation with outside experts, something \nthe Presiding Officer knows well--outside experts such as are at the \nUniversity of Minnesota. It creates new incentives for manufacturers \nthat develop treatments for people with rare diseases and conditions \nlike Josie's and Jenna's. These provisions will support innovation and \nwill remove redtape from the process.\n  The three provisions I championed are included in this legislation in \naddition to the base bill which we negotiated as a committee. The first \nprovision will strengthen the Food and Drug Administration's workforce \nby removing overly restrictive requirements that keep the FDA from \nconsulting with outside experts, again something the Presiding Officer \nhas been a leader\n\n[[Page S3495]]\n\non as well. This provision will change the rules that keep the FDA from \ntalking with many outside experts. It will make these rules consistent \nwith those of all other agencies, including the National Institutes of \nHealth, so as the FDA's experienced workforce retires, the FDA will be \nable to consult with leading experts when they are reviewing a new \ntechnology or a new treatment for a rare disease.\n  This provision will give the FDA the flexibility it needs to consult \nwith experts and keep patients safe, and at the end of the day that \nmeans more patients will get the health care they need.\n  The second provision will require the FDA to remove new and \nburdensome guidance on the industry that could triple the number of \nrequired new submissions for existing devices. This provision, which \nSenator Burr from North Carolina also championed, will prevent this \nguidance from overburdening both the industry and the FDA, which could \nhave caused innovation to come to a screeching halt.\n  My third provision will help companies develop innovative new \nproducts for patients across the country with rare conditions. \nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, 25 million Americans \nstruggle with a rare disease, and these patients have to jump hurdle \nafter hurdle to get the care they need. Many of them will go from \ndoctor to doctor for years before they find a specialist who \nunderstands their condition.\n  If you live in rural Minnesota, you may have to drive hundreds of \nmiles to find a doctor who can help you. Even for patients who find the \nright doctor, too often the treatment for their condition does not \nexist, or has not been approved. So my provision will reward companies \nthat choose to develop treatments for patients with rare diseases.\n  We did this in 2007 to help companies develop devices for children \nwith rare conditions, and we saw the number of devices that companies \ndeveloped quadruple in a few years. This provision will help get \ntreatments to adult patients with rare conditions in Minnesota and \naround the country and around the world.\n  Minnesotans know what it means to foster a culture of innovation. Our \nmanufacturers have developed new treatments for everything from skin \nlacerations to brain aneurysms. This bill will go farther to support \nthis kind of innovation by streamlining the processes that are \ncurrently impeding investment in new technologies and making the FDA \nmore efficient and predictable.\n  This legislation will help patients in Minnesota access the medical \ntechnologies they need, just like Josie and Jenna. And in a time of \neconomic hardship, it is an investment in one of our country's \nstrongest industries, one of our State's strongest industries. This \nbill is a step toward a healthier future for our country. I look \nforward to making sure it becomes part of our law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2108\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 2108.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Ms. Murkowski], for herself, Mr. \n     Begich, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Leahy, and Ms. \n     Cantwell, proposes an amendment numbered 2108.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit approval by the Food and Drug Administration of \ngenetically engineered fish unless the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n               Administration concurs with such approval)\n\n       At the end of title XI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 11__. ANALYSES OF APPLICATION FOR APPROVAL OF \n                   GENETICALLY-ENGINEERED FISH.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, approval by the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services of an application \n     submitted under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 301 et seq.) for approval of any genetically modified \n     marine or anadromous organism shall not take effect until the \n     date that the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Under \n     Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere, approves such \n     application using standards applied by the Under Secretary \n     under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 \n     U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), which shall include a Regulatory Impact \n     Review required by Executive Order 12866 (58 Fed. Reg. 51735) \n     and Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analyses required under \n     chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code (commonly referred \n     to as the ``Regulatory Flexibility Act'').\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I rise today to speak to an amendment \nwe will have on the floor tomorrow afternoon. This is an amendment that \ncertainly has generated a fair amount of interest within my State, in \nfact, most of our coastal States, anywhere where we have an interest in \nseafood and the seafood industry. It has been kind of unceremoniously \ndubbed the frankenfish amendment, so my apologies to my colleague who \njust yielded the floor to me. Certainly no affront to him.\n  But what we are speaking about today is genetically engineered \nsalmon. It has been somewhat affectionately dubbed frankenfish because \nof the images this genetically engineered fish conjures up, a fish that \nwould literally be growing in size, doubling in size, unlike the fish \nwe see in our streams and in our waters.\n  What is happening today is the FDA is on a path to approve an \napplication for this genetically engineered fish. I want to discuss the \namendment I have filed which would require NOAA to conduct a full \nenvironmental assessment and analysis of economic impact to affected \nfisheries before the FDA approves any of these genetically engineered \nfish.\n  I start my comments by saying I am not looking to pull the plug on \nthe FDA. I am not looking to insert Congress's judgment into the FDA \nprocess. I am asking that when we are talking about basically a new \nfishery for a modified salmon, I am asking the agency that is tasked \nwith our fisheries have some role in what is moving forward. So let me \ngive you a little background in terms of what we are talking about with \nthis genetically engineered fish, this frankenfish. This would be a \nfish, an Atlantic salmon, that has DNA spliced from a Chinook salmon \nwith that of what they call an ocean pout, which is some kind of an eel \ntype of a fish that apparently is in colder waters. But the technology \nthe FDA is looking at that would allow for this genetic engineering \nwould essentially provide for a fish that would grow to market size in \nabout half the time of a conventional salmon. In other words, a salmon \nout in the wild takes about 30 months to gain full maturity. With this \nfrankenfish, this genetically modified salmon, they could be of good \nmarket size, basically good eating size, within about 15 to 18 months.\n  You are thinking, okay, well, how can this be bad? We get a salmon \nthat looks like a salmon, and it comes to us in half the time. So how \ncan this be a bad thing? I wish to share with you why I feel this is a \nbad thing. When I am talking, you will hear me talking about salmon, \nbecause that is what the FDA process is engaged with right now. But I \nwill tell you we understand that similar efforts are underway to \ndevelop a genetically modified trout, as well as a genetically modified \ntilapia, again, designed to grow faster than occurs in nature and out \nin the wild.\n  The pending application for the salmon would be the very first food \nfrom a transgenic animal that has been approved by the FDA, so this is \nprecedent setting. People have suggested that, well, we see this in \nother forms of agriculture. But the fact is this would be the first \nfood from a transgenic animal application that has been approved by the \nFDA, so this is quite precedent setting.\n  What is happening is this approval process for the genetically \nengineered fish continues to move forward as a new animal drug, rather \nthan what it is, what I mentioned before, which is a new fishery for \nthis modified salmon, this salmon that has been tinkered with, \nbasically a test-tube salmon.\n  Here are the reasons why I think this is a bad thing, to be messing \nwith Mother Nature, to encourage this unnatural growth. We heard on the \nfloor this morning--the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from \nNew York both stood and talked about a measure\n\n[[Page S3496]]\n\nthat is out there, the march that was out on the Capitol yesterday, \nmothers concerned about toxins in the food supply, toxins in the world \naround us, and knowing what is out there, knowing what we are exposed \nto.\n  Well, I, along with many consumers out there, am concerned about \ngenetically engineered animal products that are intended for human \nconsumption, including those that are in our marine resources. I am not \nthe best cook in the family; my husband is. But I want to know, he \nwants to know, our kids want to know, that what we are eating is good \nand safe and sound.\n  At home, we eat a lot of salmon. I can stand there and tell my kids: \nEat this. This is brain food. This is good for you. It is loaded with \nomega-3 fatty acids. It is as good as you can possibly get. I can say \nthat with certainty.\n  We cannot say that, we will not be able to say that with this \ngenetically engineered fish. As a mom, I am not going to say to my \nkids: Eat this frankenfish. Not quite sure what an eel pout is or an \nocean pout; not quite sure how they splice this DNA together; not quite \nsure whether they have made it sterile.\n  We are not quite sure what it is, but it came to market quickly, and \nwe are going to be able to get a cheaper price on it. I think we want \nto know.\n  The scary thing with the FDA right now is that they are reluctant to \nlabel genetically engineered products, even though it allows the public \nto know what they are eating. The data out there is pretty clear that \nthere are higher human allergen effects with genetically engineered \nfish. If you are a mom and your kids have allergies, are you going to \nlook at this fish and say: I wonder if this is going to set allergies \noff. No. You are going to stay away from it. You will not serve that to \nyour kids or your family even though you know the wild stuff is good \nand healthy. But how do you know which is which if the FDA isn't moving \nforward to label and you are not quite sure that what you are buying in \nthe grocery store is as advertised? How are we helping the consumer \nhere?\n  The first problem I have is that this is, again, a product that is \nintended for human consumption, and we have some real concerns about \nthe safety of the food in the first place. Second--and this is one \nthat, as an Alaskan, where we have very strong fisheries, very healthy \nfisheries, I worry about what will happen if, in fact, there was \nescapement into the wild by these genetically engineered fish. You have \na frankenfish that gets loose. They will tell you: They are going to be \nin pens, and we will make sure there is no escape. How can they make \nsure we are not going to see escapement? We have seen that, clearly, \nfrom the farm fish that mingle with the wild stock. We see the disease \nthat can be transmitted. How is any of this good? Even though the \ngenetically engineered fish supposedly is going to be kept in onshore \npens, the possibility of escape is recognized, it is out there, and it \nexists.\n  Then you are going to have these genetically engineered fish that \nwill breed year-round. They are also going to be eating year-round. \nThey are going to be feeding year-round. What you can very possibly see \nis this competition with the wild stock. They will compete with one \nanother for the food the species feeds on, and they will wreak havoc \nwith the ecosystem. So you can introduce--granted, not intentionally--\ninto the ecosystem that fish that just doesn't work with our wild \nstock. Unlike hatchery produced fish, genetically produced fish would \nreportedly be sterilized and their hormones altered. But many \nscientists believe that the FDA testing to confirm the agricultural \nsafety and sterilization of these fish is deficient. We see this in the \nCRS report that has looked specifically to this issue.\n  Unlike other agricultural products, if you have an escape of \nfrankenfish, it would be to an uncontrolled marine environment, \nexposing valued ecosystems to associated risks. If you have a cow that \nhas been genetically modified and that cow is on land and gets out of \nthe pen, you have more ability to control that. You don't have the \nability to control in a marine environment. It is just not possible. So \nwhat is happening is that we are putting at risk the health and safety \nof our wild stock. Unacceptable.\n  Third, many find the FDA process for approving an animal product \nintended for human consumption as it would a veterinary drug to be \ninsufficient. It lacks the robustness and transparency one would expect \nfor a product that would be treated as a substitute for fish that is \ncurrently on our dinner plates in this country today.\n  The CRS report which I just mentioned will be introduced for the \nRecord. It is a report by CRS, dated June 7 of last year, titled \n``Genetically Engineered Fish and Seafood: Environmental Concerns.''\n  One of the concerns raised in this report is this:\n\n       A National Research Council report stated that transgenic \n     fish pose the ``greatest science-based concerns associated \n     with animal biotechnology, in large part due to the \n     uncertainty inherent in identifying environmental problems \n     early on and the difficulty of remediation once a problem has \n     been identified.\n\n  Our fishermen are very highly regulated, and any change to a Federal \nfishery, including a new GE fishery, should be analyzed for \nenvironmental effects and economic impacts to affected businesses and \nfishing communities. We are bringing NOAA in to be part of this process \nin this amendment.\n  The last point I will make on this is that there could be very \nsignificant economic consequences of approving genetically engineered \nfish. Historically, the entrance and growth of farmed salmon in the \nmarketplace has had negative impacts on our salmon industry. We have an \nincredible abundance in the wild stocks, and we are very proud of it. \nThe seafood industry in Alaska is our second largest employer, valued \nat $500 million with salmon alone. But the concern is that, although we \nhave very strong wild stocks, we could see the market respond with \nunreasonable fear and confusion to the introduction and growth of \nengineered fish, particularly if it is not labeled. This, in my \nopinion, could have a devastating economic impact on our fish industry \nand the jobs it supports, clearly at a time that our Nation can't \nafford it.\n  Some will come back and say: Hey, this is a new industry, it is going \nto create new jobs.\n  I will take you back to that CRS report. One of the things I find \ninteresting is that it says:\n\n       To address these concerns, AquaBounty has proposed \n     producing salmon eggs in Canada, shipping these eggs to \n     Panama, growing and processing fish in Panama, and shipping \n     table-ready, processed fish to the United States for retail \n     sale.\n\n  They would ship these frankenfish to the United States for resale. So \nbasically we get all the harm, but we don't get any jobs. But what we \nare doing is putting at risk the existing jobs within the seafood \nindustry in this country--priority No. 1.\n  I see that my time has expired.\n  I commend to my colleagues this CRS Report dated June 7, 2011.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two letters of support for my amendment \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              Consumers Union,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 23, 2012.\n     Hon. Lisa A. Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: Consumers Union, (CU) the advocacy \n     and public policy arm of Consumer Reports', urges \n     you to support Senator Murkowski's amendment to the Food and \n     Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (S. 3187), \n     which would require additional approval by the Secretary of \n     Commerce of GE fish applications using standards applied by \n     the Under Secretary under the National Environmental Policy \n     Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).\n       Consumers Union has frequently spoken out on the issues and \n     concerns surrounding the approval of genetically-engineered \n     salmon for human consumption. Among our many concerns is that \n     not enough research has been carried out to determine the \n     increased potential of Aquabounty GE salmon to cause allergic \n     reactions in humans. CU's Dr. Michael Hansen, a Ph.D. \n     biologist, testified at the FDA hearing on this matter that \n     Aquabounty's assessment of the potential for allergic \n     reactions was based on just six (6) engineered fish. We \n     believe that a much larger assessment involving hundreds to \n     thousands of fish should be conducted. FDA has also indicated \n     that once GE salmon are approved for human consumption, it \n     does not intend to require labeling--a position CU strongly \n     opposes.\n       We are also concerned about the potential environmental \n     impacts of genetically-engineered fish, and particularly in \n     regards to the impact that GE salmon would have on\n\n[[Page S3497]]\n\n     the wild Alaska salmon population. Alaska wild salmon is a \n     tasty, healthful, low-cost, and low mercury canned fish \n     alternative. Consumers Union recommends it for pregnant women \n     and young children who should limit mercury intake. However, \n     some studies have shown that if GE salmon were to escape into \n     the wild, they could potentially have serious effects upon \n     the wild salmon population.\n       Consumers Union urges you to support the Murkowski \n     amendment, in order to ensure that GE fish applications \n     undergo an additional environmental impact review. Should you \n     have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at \n     (202) 462 6262.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Ioana Rusu,\n     Regulatory Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Trout Unlimited,\n\n                                      Arlington, VA, May 22, 2012.\n     Re Support for Murkowski genetically engineered fish \n         amendment to S. 3187\n\n     To: U.S. Senate\n       On behalf of Trout Unlimited and its 140,000 members \n     nationwide I write to urge you to support the Murkowski \n     amendment to ensure adequate study of genetically engineered \n     fish prior to FDA approval. The amendment to S. 3187 \n     prohibits approval by the FDA of genetically engineered fish \n     unless NOAA concurs with such approval.\n       The acute need for this amendment is illustrated by the \n     flawed process currently being used to review an application \n     for commercial production of genetically modified salmon. \n     AquaBounty Technologies has requested FDA approval for the \n     production and marketing of genetically modified Atlantic \n     salmon as a new animal drug. Asking the FDA to consider \n     impacts to wild salmon is like going to a chiropractor to get \n     your eyes checked. The FDA's pending decision has \n     extraordinary implications for wild salmon, yet the agency \n     with a mission to conserve and manage wild salmon--NOAA--has \n     not been asked to analyze potential impacts, and does not \n     have a say in the final decision. The Murkowski amendment \n     simply states that the agency with expertise in the affected \n     resource, NOAA, must be involved in a decision that could \n     profoundly impact anadromous fish.\n       Trout Unlimited's mission is to conserve, protect and \n     restore North America's trout and salmon fisheries and their \n     watersheds. We work to protect healthy runs of wild salmon in \n     places like Alaska's Bristol Bay, and restore depleted runs \n     through habitat restoration projects on the Atlantic and \n     Pacific coasts. Wild salmon and other anadromous fish are too \n     important commercially, recreationally, and culturally to be \n     put at risk by decisions that failed to adequately consider \n     the potential impacts.\n       Trout Unlimited strongly supports the Murkowski amendment, \n     and encourages you to vote Yes when the amendment is offered.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Keith Curley,\n                                   Director of Government Affairs.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2125\n\n  Mr. CARDIN.

Madam President, I rise to discuss the FDA Safety and \nInnovation Act, the bill now under consideration here in the Senate.\n  I applaud Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Enzi for their \nleadership in moving this critical legislation through the HELP \ncommittee, and now to the Senate floor.\n  As an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services, the FDA \nhas as part of its broad mission to protect Americans' health by \nassuring the safety of drugs, biologics, medical devices, our Nation's \nfood supply, vaccines, tobacco, cosmetics, and animal food and drugs. \nEvery single day, every single American depends on the vital work of \nFDA's employees.\n  There is a second key element to the FDA's work--helping to speed \ninnovations to the marketplace through the drug, biologic, and medical \ndevice approval process. It's that component of the FDA's mission that \nwe are addressing this week--reauthorizing the user fees that help fund \nthe approval process.\n  I'm proud of the FDA's workers--the majority of the agency's more \nthan 11,000 employees are based at its headquarters in Silver Spring, \nMD. It's\n\n[[Page S3498]]\n\nthere that the process of medical innovation, which begins at NIH with \nbasic research, is completed as lifesaving drugs and medical devices \nare approved for use.\n  A recent report from the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics \nfound that in 2011 ``medicines with new mechanisms of action were \nlaunched in greater numbers than in prior years, with many representing \nsignificant breakthroughs and first-time therapies became available to \ntreat several types of cancer, multiple sclerosis, hepatitis C, and \ncardiovascular conditions.''\n  At the same time, we know that greater resources are needed for the \nagency to be able to fulfill its mission in a timely and effective \nmanner. For all of our Nation's investment in health care research, \nadditional new medicines will not reach patients promptly unless the \nFDA has the necessary funds to perform its regulatory duties.\n  That's why the user fee amendments are so important. This 5-year \nreauthorization bill is Congress' opportunity to improve and update the \nregulatory process, and augment appropriations so that the agency can \nachieve its goals.\n  The purpose of the user fee program is to reduce the time in which \nFDA can review and make decisions on marketing applications. Lengthy \nreview times affect drug and medical device manufacturers, who face \ndelays in bringing their products to market, and more importantly they \naffect patients, who face delays in receiving needed treatments and \ncures.\n  The bill reported out of committee will move us forward. It will \nreauthorize the prescription drug user fee program, PDUFA, through \nOctober 1, 2017.\n  This is necessary so that the Federal Goverment can continue to \ncollect application, establishment, and product fees from drug \ncompanies to support the review process for the next five years.\n  It will also reauthorize the medical device user fee program, MDUFA, \nthrough 2017 as well, and in an effort to ensure that the FDA's \npersonnel needs are met, it would authorize a streamlined hiring of \nemployees. Additionally, the Critical Path Public-Private partnerships, \nwhich are so important in encouraging medical product innovation, are \nreauthorized through 2017.\n  Two new user fee programs are established in the bill for generics \nand one for biosimilars. It's estimated that the monies generated from \nthe generic user fee program will enable the FDA approval time for \ngenerics to be shortened from the current time frame of 30 months to \n10, speeding savings to patients and to all taxpayers, as Medicare, \nMedicaid, and CHIP programs will reap considerable cost savings.\n  The base bill takes key first steps toward resolving the vexing issue \nof drug shortages. I want to acknowledge Senator Klobuchar's work in \nthis area.\n  All of us have heard from our community hospitals and physicians \nabout the anguish they feel when they cannot secure medicines necessary \nto treat the patients in their care. I certainly have, and I have also \nheard from patients themselves who cannot fathom how such shortages \ncould occur.\n  Carey Fitzmaurice of Bethesda, who is undergoing treatment for \novarian cancer, wrote to me:\n\n       My doctor put me on Doxil and carboplatin to try to get rid \n     of some tumors. Doxil was chosen because of recent research \n     showing that it works especially well in those patients with \n     the BRCA gene, like me.\n       I had four treatments with both drugs and was responding \n     very, very well. I have now missed three doses of Doxil due \n     to the shortage. I am ``treading water'' with the Carbo but \n     am frustrated that I am no longer making progress towards \n     remission. Then there is all of the stress involved with the \n     shortage--not knowing if there is anything I can do, or what \n     will happen next or how long I will be in treatment.\n       I am trying to continue to be a wife and mother and to hold \n     down a job. This shortage is adding insult to injury. I \n     wonder why we are being asked to raise money to find cures \n     when we can't even get access to the cures that exist now.\n\n  Carey is one reason why I am a cosponsor of Senator Klobuchar's \nbipartisan bill, the Preserving Access to Life Saving Medications Act, \nand I am pleased that the bill's early notification requirement \nprovisions are included in the PDUFA bill we are considering today. It \nalso requires the Secretary to establish a task force and create a \nstrategic plan to address shortages.\n  This is also an urgent matter because shortages affect the ability to \nconduct clinical trials. Senator Rockefeller and I worked together some \nyears ago to get Medicare beneficiaries coverage for the routine costs \nassociated with clinical trials.\n  As a result of Senator Brown's work on the Affordable Care Act, \ninsurance companies now must also cover the routine costs of trials. \nAccess to trials often means the difference between life and death for \ncancer patients, and the availability of trials has enormous \nimplications for the effectiveness of treatments for all patients going \nforward. There are more than 150 cancer clinical trials being conducted \nnow at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda.\n  But the impact of shortages on clinical trials has not received a \ngreat deal of attention outside the research world. It is an extremely \nimportant issue for Medicare beneficiaries, who have the highest rates \nof cancer incidence. Cancer trials do not usually use placebos.\n  Rather, they compare standard of care drugs, versus, or in \ncombination with, the experimental drug.\n  Doctors face difficult choices when the standard of care drug is in \nshort supply. They must decide whether to use the limited supply of an \nexisting drug to treat new patients, or use it in clinical trials to \nhelp find a cure for those who are seeking new therapies. Cancer trials \nhave been delayed, limited the number of patients enrolled in the trial \nor stopped the trial entirely because there is simply not enough of the \nstandard of care drug.\n  So I am pleased that the bill contains language requiring the \nSecretary's strategic plan to considering the impact of drug shortages \non research and clinical trials.\n  The Finance Committee held hearings on drug shortages earlier this \nyear as well, and we learned that the majority of shortages are found \nin the generic drug market. Some are due to a lack of raw materials, \nwhile others occur because the drugs yield lower profits than newer \ngenerics, and the interest in continuing to market those drugs is no \nlonger there.\n  The notification language in this bill is a good start, but I believe \nit should be strengthened to better ensure compliance, and so I have \ncosponsored Senator Blumenthal's amendment establishing civil monetary \npenalties for manufacturers who knowingly fail to notify the FDA of \nshortages for essential medicines.\n  I express my appreciation to Senator Pryor for his leadership on \nnanotechnology. I am pleased to join him in this effort and am hopeful \nthat the language we have sponsored can be included in this bill.\n  Nanotechnology has become increasingly indispensible in our daily \nlives--everything from cellphones and MP3 players, to packaging of our \nsnack foods, to cancer treatments in development employ the use of \nnanotechnology.\n  As this burgeoning technology continues to power more of our consumer \nproducts and drive job creation in America, it is essential that we \nfully assess, understand, and address any risks that it may pose to \nsafety, public health and our environment.\n  By soundly assessing the safety of nanotechnology and developing best \npractices, the Nanotechnology Regulatory Science Act of 2011 will \nfurther job creation, public safety and growth in the industry.\n  Our bill would establish a program within the FDA to assess the \nhealth and safety implications of using nanotechnology in everyday \nproducts, and develop best practices for companies using \nnanotechnology. This new program would bring more highly-skilled \nresearch jobs to Maryland.\n  FDA's laboratories and research facilities at its consolidated \nheadquarters are ideally suited to conduct the scientific studies \nrequired under the bill.\n  The USDA's Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, BARC, is \nsimilarly equipped to provide innovative scientific technology, \ntraining, methods development, and technical expertise to improve \npublic health.\n  Lastly, I urge my colleagues to support language addressing the lack \nof available information on the benefits and adverse effects of drugs \nand medical devices for minority populations.\n  Today, warnings and safety precautions are included as part of the \ninitial approval by the FDA. The Agency\n\n[[Page S3499]]\n\nmay also require them post approval--after the drug has been approved \nand sold for months or years. We know that additional side effects or \nrisks may become known once a product is in the market and a much \nlarger, diverse patient population is using it.\n  Ideally, a detailed conversation between physician and patient about \nthe risks versus the potential benefit of taking a drug would always \ntake place in a timely and informed manner. However, this is not always \nthe case and is especially true if the warning is added after drug is \ninitially prescribed and been on the market for an appreciable time \nperiod.\n  The randomized controlled trials used by the FDA when reviewing new \ndrug applications, while the gold standard for examining efficacy, do \nnot necessarily reflect the overall population for a variety of \nreasons.\n  For example, members of minority groups are generally \nunderrepresented in clinical drug trials even though they are \ndisproportionately affected by diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, \ncolorectal, prostate and cervical cancer, stroke, congestive heart \nfailure, acute coronary disease, and asthma.\n  We know that there are racial and ethnic differences in responses to \npharmaceuticals, and they may not become known until the drug is in \nwide use, certainly beyond the constraints of a controlled clinical \ntrial.\n  In today's world, post-approval surveys and studies are becoming more \nprevalent, and our ability to discern the effect of a drug over time on \na variety of patient types is significantly improving. This information \nshould be made available in a variety of ways to ensure that it reaches \nphysicians, payors and patients, and I have filed an amendment that \nwould greatly improve access to this information.\n  It would build on the current HHS ``Strategic Action Plan to Reduce \nRacial and Ethnic Health Disparities'' by directing the Secretary to \ndevelop a communications plan to ``address the best strategy for \ncommunicating safety alerts, changes to the label or labeling of drugs, \nincluding black box warnings, biological products or devices, health \nadvisories, any information identifying particular subpopulations, and \nany other relevant information as determined appropriate to enhance \ncommunication, including varied means of electronic communication.''\n  This amendment has the support of the chairman and the ranking \nmember, as well as the FDA and BIO, and I urge the Senate to adopt it.\n  Mr. President, PDUFA reauthorization is essential to furthering the \nNation's health, bringing the medical innovations conceived by \nresearchers and entrepreneurs into practice, and creating jobs. I look \nforward to working through the process to improve this bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  Again, I thank and congratulate Senator Harkin and Senator Enzi for \ntheir incredible work in bringing forward this bill that is so \nimportant to the public health of our Nation. We are dealing with the \nsafety of drugs, biologics, medical devices, our Nation's food supply, \nvaccines, cosmetics, and the list goes on and on. It is critically \nimportant that we have the proper authorization so that the FDA has the \nresources it needs to advance innovation into the marketplace, products \nthat fall within the jurisdiction of the FDA.\n  We know that the basic research has gone on at NIH. To get products \nto market, it is important that the FDA have the resources in order to \nmove the process forward. I am proud of the 11,000-member workforce \nheadquartered in Silver Spring, MD, for the FDA. They work very hard. \nThis reauthorization legislation of the user fees will give them the \ntools in order to get the job done. I am particularly impressed that \nthis is a 5-year reauthorization bill that will give them \npredictability, which is needed in order to get the job done.\n  I applaud Senator Harkin and Senator Enzi. We don't see enough of \nthese bills moving forward with the type of process our leaders have \nbrought forward. They have resolved a lot of the issues, and we thank \nthem for that. They have brought us a bill that enjoys broad bipartisan \nsupport and is in the best interest of our Nation. I am proud to \nsupport this legislation, and I thank them for the manner in which they \nhave proceeded in committee and now on the floor.\n  Also, I point out that this bill deals with the drug shortage issues. \nI applaud the occupant of the chair, Senator Klobuchar, and her efforts \nin dealing with those issues. We need more effective notification of \npotential shortages so that we can take appropriate action to make sure \nthe people of this Nation have an adequate supply of medicines.\n  Let me share with my colleagues a letter I received from Carey \nFitzmaurice of Bethesda, MD, who is undergoing treatment for ovarian \ncancer. She wrote:\n\n       My doctor put me on Doxil and carboplatin to try to get rid \n     of some tumors. Doxil was chosen because of recent research \n     showing that it works especially well in those patients with \n     the BRCA gene, like me.\n       I had four treatments with both drugs and was responding \n     very, very well. I have now missed three doses of Doxil due \n     to the shortage. I am ``treading water'' with the Carbo but \n     am frustrated that I am no longer making progress towards \n     remission. Then there is all of the stress involved with the \n     shortage--not knowing if there is anything I can do, or what \n     will happen next, or how long I will be in treatment.\n       I am trying to continue to be a wife and mother and to hold \n     down a job. This shortage is adding insult to injury. I \n     wonder why we are being asked to raise money to find cures \n     when we can't even get access to the cures that exist now.\n\n  That is a frustration that is out there on drug shortages. I am very \npleased that this legislation will move us in the right direction in \nanswering that question.\n  It doesn't only affect those under active treatment, it also affects \na number of clinical trials. There are currently about 150 clinical \ntrials at NIH involving cancer and trying to find answers and cures for \ncancer. The problem is that on these clinical trials they don't use \nplacebos, they use the current drug therapy that is known for the \ntreatment against an experimental process. If there are not enough \ndrugs available to treat people for the current protocols, how can \nthose drugs be used in a clinical trial. As a result, we are finding it \nvery challenging to move forward with the clinical trials that are \nneeded. This legislation recognizes that concern and specifically deals \nwith it. I congratulate the committee leadership for addressing that \nissue.\n  I also will mention one other issue: nanotechnology. I congratulate \nSenator Pryor for his leadership in this area. Programs at FDA to \naccess health safety facts and using nanotechnology in everyday \nproducts is something we need to do. This legislation advances that. I \npoint out that I am proud that the lab facilities at the FDA are fully \ncapable of dealing with the challenges presented by nanotechnology. \nThis legislation acknowledges that.\n  We also, in Maryland, are proud of the Beltsville Agricultural \nResearch Center, which will advance nanotechnology and the impact it \nhas on everyday products and safety. Those issues will be addressed \nalso by the underlying bill. We very much appreciate the leadership of \nthe committee.\n  Let me talk for a moment about the two amendments I have brought \nforward. Amendment No. 2125 deals with safety warnings, particularly as \nthey affect the minority community. Clinical trials don't always \nrepresent the diversity of our community. We know there is \nunderrepresentation of minorities within clinical trials. Quite \nfrankly, when the FDA gives approval, they give approval to the known \nrisks, as I am sure you are all aware, but it doesn't always represent \nthe impact on all communities. We also know there are racial and ethnic \ndifferences in response to pharmaceuticals, and they may not become \nknown until the drug is in wide use, certainly beyond the constraints \nof a controlled clinical trial. So we do have the initial approval of \nFDA that includes the known risks, but we also have the capacity under \nFDA to do postapproval warnings. My amendment deals with that aspect.\n\n  Health and Human Services has a strategy to deal with minority health \nand health disparities. It is called the Strategic Action Plan to \nReduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities. We also now have an \ninstitute at the National Institutes of Health that deals solely with \nminority health and health disparities. We have a commitment to do a \nbetter job as a nation in dealing with minority health disparities. \nThis amendment would help us move forward in that regard.\n\n[[Page S3500]]\n\n  One particular drug that is used to treat an inflammatory disorder \nhas been determined by several studies to have a mortality risk that is \nthree times higher for African-Americans than the general public. \nHowever, it is still widely prescribed, and ads for the product on the \nInternet and on television prominently feature African-American actors.\n  This is an area in which the National Medical Association and many \nother groups concerned about the quality of minority health have \nfocused on for years. Beyond the black box warning, which is the most \nserious warning that can be issued about the side effects of approved \ndrugs, there are other concerns about products that are marketed for \nthe overall population that may have side effects, but the specific \ndata has not been developed yet to warrant a black box warning.\n  The amendment I have offered directs the FDA to develop communication \nplans to address the best strategy for communicating benefits and \nrisks, safety alerts, changes to the label or labeling of drugs, \nincluding black box warnings, biological products or devices, health \nadvisories, any information identifying particular subpopulations, and \nany other relevant information as determined appropriate to enhance \ncommunication, including a variety of means of electronic \ncommunication.\n  I might point out this amendment has the support of the FDA and BIO, \nand it is budget neutral. So I would urge my colleagues to support this \namendment to advance the commitment we all have made to deal with \nreducing and hopefully one day eliminating minority health disparities \nin our health care system. It is totally consistent with the Strategic \nAction Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services.\n  The second amendment I have brought forward, amendment No. 2141, \ndeals with small businesses. This is a very appropriate amendment, as \nit is being considered during Small Business Week. We all acknowledge \nthe importance of small business in the growth of our economy. Two out \nof every three new jobs are created through small business. We get more \ninnovation through our small businesses on a per-employee basis than we \ndo through larger companies. It is critically important small \nbusinesses be energized if our economy is going to rebound, as we know \nit needs to.\n  This is particularly true as we deal with innovation in drug \ndevelopment or medical devices. My amendment deals with the issues of \ncoordinating the work between the FDA and small business. It provides a \nlisting of the staffing levels at the small business offices of the FDA \nso that we know the capacity we have and we can evaluate that. It is \nour responsibility to do that. It provides an overview of the status of \npartnership efforts between the FDA and the SBA. We want the two \nagencies, the Food and Drug Administration and the Small Business \nAdministration, to be working in concert to advance the cause for small \nbusinesses as well as the mission of the FDA.\n  My amendment provides a summary of all outreach efforts to small \nbusinesses and small business associations. It details the number of \nsmall businesses receiving protocol assistance. It shows the number of \nunsolicited and solicited grant applications to small businesses, \nagain, so we can evaluate that. Most importantly, it calls for the \nexamination of existing barriers, particularly as it relates to the \ngeneric drug shortages.\n  It is interesting that with regard to the fee schedule, the FDA has \nthe authority to do waivers as it relates to brand names. We know a lot \nof the generics are where we have our shortages because of the \neconomics of the circumstances. But the SBA has limited ability to \nwaive the fee structure as it relates to the general development of \ngeneric drugs. My amendment would ask the SBA to report back to \nCongress on what impact that has on small businesses being innovative \nin developing generic drugs to help us generally with less costly drugs \nthat are available for treatment, but also to make sure we deal with \nthe drug shortage issue, which I alluded to earlier.\n  This amendment is also supported by Senator Landrieu, the chairman of \nthe Small Business Committee, on which I have the pleasure of serving. \nI urge my colleagues to support both amendments I have brought forward. \nI believe they only enhance the strength of the bill before us and are \ntotally consistent with the work of the chairman and the ranking member \nof the committee.\n  With that, Madam President, I would again urge my colleagues to \nsupport both amendments and to support the underlying bill.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on the two \namendments offered by the Senator from Maryland?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes for the majority on amendment No. \n2125, and 15 minutes in opposition. For amendment No. 2141, 11 minutes \nin favor and 15 minutes in opposition.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will speak on the time available for the \namendments.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2125\n\n  First of all, amendment No. 2125 will help ensure that health care \nproviders, patients, and payers better understand the benefits and \nrisks associated with drugs, especially with respect to those drugs by \nunderrepresented subpopulations.\n  I believe this is an important and noncontroversial amendment. I hope \nwe can support this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2141\n\n  On the other amendment, No. 2141, which is the small business report, \nI think it is important FDA give small businesses a helping hand. I \nunderstand each FDA center has a small business office and that each of \nFDA's five regional offices has a small business representative. This \nreport the FDA would have to submit on the basis of the amendment \noffered by Senator Cardin would provide Congress with more information \nabout how FDA uses its resources for small businesses to help encourage \nsmall companies.\n\n  Again, I think this is another valuable addition to our bill and, \nhopefully, we can support that amendment also. So I thank the Senator \nfrom Maryland for his offering these two amendments and for what I \nconsider to be improvements to the underlying bill.\n  I thank him very much for that.\n  Mr. President, again, I would say to the Members who may be in their \noffices that we still have some extra time before we will be adjourning \nthis evening. Again, I would advise Senators that by at least 2 p.m. \ntomorrow, when the bell rings, we will be moving to voting, if not \nbefore then. So any Senator who has an amendment to bring up and who \nwishes to talk about it, I wish they would come to the floor and do \nthat now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would echo the comments of the chairman, \nand I, too, thank the Senator from Maryland for his amendments. I think \neverybody appreciates both those amendments and, hopefully, they will \nbecome a part of this bill.\n  I also appreciate all those who have come to speak this afternoon. I \nknow there are still probably a couple of controversial amendments on \nwhich Senators should come and speak, and then we might have the \npossibility of moving some things up a little bit tomorrow so we can \nget this bill finished expediently.\n  So I hope if anyone has an amendment, they will come and use their \ntime. I think we have a few minutes in opposition perhaps to two of the \namendments that have been debated so far. But that is it, and then I \nthink there are three controversial ones that are left to be debated. \nOne of those has a significant amount of time allocated to it, but the \nothers are limited to 30 minutes equally divided.\n  So I hope we can take care of some more of those this evening and get \nstarted on votes as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S3501]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring the quorum call be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PAUL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up my \namendment No. 2143.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Paul] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2143.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask that the reading of the amendment be \nwaived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Tuesday, May 22, 2012, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment to the FDA.\n  I am troubled by images of armed FDA agents raiding Amish farms and \npreventing them from selling milk directly from the cow. I think we \nhave bigger problems in our country without sending armed FDA agents \nonto peaceful farmers' land and telling them they can't sell milk \ndirectly from the cow.\n  My amendment has three parts.\n  First, it attempts to stop the FDA's overzealous regulation of \nvitamins, food, and supplements by codifying the first amendment \nprohibition on prior restraint.\n  What do I mean by that? The first amendment says we can't prevent \nspeech--even commercial speech--in advance of the speech. We can't tell \nCheerios they can't say that there is a health benefit to their \nCheerios.\n  Under our current FDA laws, the FDA says that if someone wants to \nmarket prune juice, they can't say it cures constipation. They can't \nmake a health claim about a food supplement or about a vitamin. They \ncan do it about a pharmaceutical, but they are not allowed to do it \nabout a health supplement. I think this should change. There have been \nseveral court cases that show this goes against not only the spirit but \nthe letter of the law of the first amendment. So this amendment would \nchange that.\n  This amendment would stop the FDA from censoring claims about \ncurative, mitigative, or preventive effects of dietary supplements. It \nwould also stop the FDA from prohibiting distribution of scientific \narticles and publications regarding the role of nutrients in protecting \nagainst disease.\n  Despite four court orders condemning the practice as a violation of \nthe first amendment, the FDA continues to suppress consumers' rights to \nbe informed and to make informed choices by denying them this \nparticular information. It is time for Congress to put an end to FDA \ncensorship.\n  Second, my amendment would disarm the FDA. Now, some of you might be \nsurprised the FDA is armed. Well, you shouldn't be. We have nearly 40 \nFederal agencies that are armed.\n  I am not against having police. I am not against the Army, the \nmilitary, or the FBI. But I think bureaucrats don't need to be carrying \nweapons, and I think what we ought to do is if there is a need for an \narmed policeman to be there, the FBI--who are trained to do this--\nshould do it. But I don't think it is a good idea to be arming \nbureaucrats to go on the farms, with arms, to stop people from selling \nmilk from a cow.\n  I think we have too many armed Federal agencies and that we need to \nput an end to this. Criminal law is increasingly used as a tool of our \ngovernment bureaucracy to punish and control honest businessmen who are \nsimply attempting to make a living. Historically, the criminal law was \nintended to punish only the most horrible offenses that everyone agreed \nwere inherently wrong or evil--offenses like murder, rape, theft, \narson. But now we have basically federalized thousands of activities \nand called them crimes.\n  If bureaucrats need to involve the police, let's have them use the \nFBI. But I see no reason to have the FDA carrying weapons.\n  Today, the criminal law is used to punish behavior such as even \nfishing without a permit, packaging a product incorrectly, or shipping \nsomething with an improper label. Simply said, the Federal Government \nhas gone too far.\n  The plain language of our Constitution specifies a very few Federal \ncrimes. In fact, the Constitution originally only had four Federal \ncrimes, and now we have thousands of Federal crimes. We have moved \nbeyond the original intent of the Constitution. We don't even know or \nhave a complete list of all the Federal crimes. It is estimated there \nare over 4,000, but no one has an exact number.\n  Finally, my amendment will require adequate mens rea protection. In \nother words, when there is a crime, we are supposed to prove the \nintent. People have to have intended to harm someone. It can't be an \nhonest mistake, where a business man or woman has broken a regulation \nand didn't intend to harm anyone. If we want to convict someone of a \ncrime and put them in a jail, it should have a mens rea requirement. \nThis is something we have had for hundreds of years that comes out of \nour common law tradition.\n  This amendment would fix this problem by strengthening the mens rea \ncomponent of each of the prohibited acts in the FDA Act by including \nthe words ``knowing'' and ``willful'' before we address and accuse \nsomeone of a crime. I think this would give protection to folks who are \nguilty of inadvertently breaking a regulation and would keep from \noverflowing our jails. We have plenty of violent criminals without \nputting people in for honest breaches of regulations.\n  If Congress is going to criminalize conduct at the Federal level, as \nit does with the FDA Act, then the least it can do is have an adequate \nmens rea requirement. My amendment will attempt to do this. It is not \nthat we will not have rules at the Federal level, but the rules ought \nto be reasonable. We ought to allow people to market vitamins. There is \nno earthly reason why someone who markets prune juice can't advertise \nthat it helps with constipation. We have gone too far. We have \nabrogated the first amendment. What we need to do is tell the FDA the \ncourts have ruled that the first amendment does apply to commercial \nspeech, and the FDA has been overstepping their bounds.\n  I hope this amendment will pass. I will ask for the yeas and nays at \nthe appropriate time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Kentucky, and I oppose it for several \nreasons.\n  I believe I am in the court of equity now: I come with clean hands \nbecause I am one of the authors of the Dietary Supplement and Health \nEducation Act, along with Senator Hatch, in 1994. We worked in tandem \nover a period of a couple of years to get the legislation through. A \nlot of compromises were made at that time, not only here in the Senate \nbut also with the House when we went to conference. I believe the right \nbalance was struck, and I think it has proven its worth over the years.\n  We have done some minor modifications to it over the years. As I have \noften said, when we write laws around here they are not chiseled in \nstone for all eternity. These aren't the Ten Commandments, they are \nlaws, and sometimes they need to be modified and changed a little bit, \nusually tweaking. But this amendment basically turns the whole law that \nwe had since 1994 on its head.\n  We have a process now where the FDA regulates the supplements as \nfoods. These are foods, not drugs. So as\n\n[[Page S3502]]\n\nwe hammered out this agreement, supplements can make nutrient, \nstructure, function claims without any FDA preapproval. If they want to \nmake a health claim, then it has to be approved by FDA, and FDA has to \nfind that it is supported by appropriate scientific evidence. Under \nthis amendment, substances that today are considered drugs and used to \ntreat diseases as serious as cancer or HIV could be marketed without \nany rigorous FDA review that we have heard from many speakers here \ntoday is the gold standard of drug regulation throughout the world. It \nwould turn our current system of drug regulation on its head. It would \nbe a huge setback for health. It would foster a system rife with \npotential for health fraud. The big losers would be patients.\n\n  Frankly, as someone who is a strong supporter of the Dietary \nSupplement Health and Education Act, and I would say along with Senator \nHatch one of its protectors for all these years, I daresay the \namendment offered by the Senator from Kentucky would destroy DSHEA. It \nwould destroy it and I don't want to see it destroyed because I think \nit is doing a lot of good for a lot of people in this country. It is \nworking well. Consumers have access to a wide range of safe products. \nThere is no reason to upset its success, because this amendment would \ndo that.\n  To think that somehow you could go out and make any health claim you \nwant? Back to the days of snake oil salesmen: ``This elixir will do \neverything, it will cure every ailment you have and turn the clock back \n20 years on your age.'' People would buy it, and what was it? It was \n80-percent alcohol and 20-percent water or something like that. They \nmade all these crazy claims. We are going to move to that kind of \nsystem now? And the only recourse would be to take them to Federal \ncourt and then have a trial and go through all that and then, OK, then \nthey appeal it and finally you find out, OK, the court says no, there \nis not enough scientific evidence to warrant it so you have to take \nthat product off the market.\n  We are going to do that for every one of the thousands and thousands \nof different products that are out there? What a mess this would be. \nFirst of all, the Federal courts would not have the wherewithal to do \nevery one of those. Second, who has the money to take all that to \ncourt? And it would literally destroy--bring down an industry that has \ndone well in this country. The dietary supplement industry, the \nvitamins and minerals industry in this country, has done a great job \nand I do not want to see it ruined. This would ruin it.\n  Last, the Senator from Kentucky talked about increasing the mens rea, \nthe mind; you know, in law school, what your mental condition, what \nyour thought processes were--what was your intent. It would increase \nit. It would need to be shown to enjoin or prosecute serious violations \nof the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. I find this amazing. This idea \nthat we need to make it harder to enforce a public health protection \nstatute, not easier, is deeply troubling. I see no legitimate reason to \ndo this.\n  The goal of this amendment is clearly to render the FDA virtually \nincapable of addressing industry abuses. I think this amendment would \nhave deleterious effects on the Dietary and Supplement Education Act, \nand the industry, and also on the FDA's ability to regulate \nprescription drugs. You can say just about anything about what your \nhealth claims would be on any kind of product and the only recourse, as \nI said, would be to go to Federal court.\n  Again, this is a consensus measure. We have built a very broad \nbipartisan support for this FDA user fee bill. It is must-pass \nlegislation. We cannot jeopardize that consensus.\n  For those reasons, I oppose the amendment offered by the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on the amendments \noffered by the Senator from Maryland, Senator Cardin?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On amendment No. 2141, there is 11 minutes \nremaining in support and 15 minutes in opposition.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Colorado, how much \ntime does the Senator seek?\n  Mr. BENNET. I would like to try for 10 minutes but if I can do it \nshorter----\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask 10 minutes of the time from amendment No. 2141 be \nyielded to the Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. I thank the Senator from Iowa, the chairman of the HELP \nCommittee, for his indulgence.\n  Yesterday I spoke about some of the process on the important issues \nof drug safety and making sure there is a good system for safer drugs, \nboth in preparation and distribution. I know we seem to get close to \nreaching a resolution, which is tremendous. I have heard many of my \ncolleagues praise different parts of the bill, which I will do as well \nin a minute. But I want to take 1 more minute again, while the chairman \nand the ranking member are on the floor, to recognize what an enormous \naccomplishment their leadership has resulted in, getting this bill to a \nclose.\n  As I said yesterday, I think the work of the HELP Committee, both \nDemocrats and Republicans, with the leadership of the chairman and the \nranking member, is a model for this Congress. It is the reason why the \nquality of this bill is so high. We still have a few votes to go \ntomorrow, but people forget that it is rare to be working on a full \nextension of anything here. This has become the land of flickering \nlights, where we keep things on for 1 more month or 2 more months. Here \nwe actually have a 5-year extension of this legislation. It is \nwonderful to be working in such a bipartisan and businesslike fashion. \nIt is not lost on me how much work has been put into the bill by my \ncolleagues on the HELP Committee, including the Presiding Officer, or \nthe HELP Committee staff. I want to reiterate my thanks and gratitude \nfor the work on the bill that will truly help patients and American \nfamilies get the medical products they need when they need them.\n  That brings me to the subject of medical devices. Colorado is the \nsixth largest medical device sector in the country, with over 600 \nbioscience companies overall. We obviously need to strike a balance, as \nwe think about this legislation, because as we speed the FDA approvals, \nwe have to ensure that devices are safe. This year has represented a \ngood-faith bipartisan effort among members on and off the HELP \nCommittee to find policies that will empower the FDA to ensure safer \ndevices and also ensure that our companies on the ground have more \nregulatory certainty and predictability.\n  The FDA has been upfront about the challenges the device center \nfaces--reviewer turnover, young, less experienced reviewers, and \nmanagement challenges. At the same time we have heard from venture \ncapital investors who say that regulatory uncertainty at the FDA is a \nreason they have been hesitant about continued investments in the \nUnited States and thought about the future investment in Asia and \nEurope. The new medical device user fee will go a long way toward \nensuring the FDA has the resources to provide safer, more effective \nmedical devices in less time and with more predictability.\n  Over the course of a year we were also able to craft a balance of \npolicies on both the innovation and safety side. This includes \nreinforcing regulations in place since 1997 that require the FDA to \ntake the least burdensome approach to approving medical devices by not \nasking companies for unnecessary or unrelated information.\n  I see the Senator from Minnesota on the floor, and I thank her for \nher leadership on this piece of legislation. It also includes important \nsafety provisions such as ensuring the medical devices have a tracking \nnumber so if there is any problem, doctors and patients can quickly \nknow if their product is one that works.\n  I would like to say a word about drug shortage, which is a discussion \nissue every Member is hearing about in their States. In just the last \nyear, the FDA was notified of about 220 drug shortages. We know that \nthe amount of patients this affects is monumental. For\n\n[[Page S3503]]\n\ncancer alone, over 550,000 patients have been currently affected by our \nnational drug shortage crisis.\n  In Colorado, our patients and providers are extremely frustrated. A \npharmacist at St. Mary's Hospital in Grand Junction said that he keeps \na 2-page list of 50 drugs that he cannot get or can barely get a hold \nof, including 12 chemotherapy drugs.\n  I want to share a couple of constituent stories from my home State.\n  Dawn Gibbs from Long Mount, CO, wrote:\n\n       Dear Senator Bennet: I am contacting you to inform you of \n     my grave concern of the national shortage of the preservative \n     free cancer drug Methotrexate. My 2-year-old cousin receives \n     this drug for her newly diagnosed leukemia of October 2011. \n     Her doctors told her that they only have a 2 week supply left \n     at their clinic. This drug keeps her leukemia from traveling \n     to her brain. This shortage is life threatening to her and \n     3,000+ like her with this cancer.\n       I thank you for your assistance in this matter. I know that \n     my little 2-year-old cousin cannot speak out on her own \n     behalf, so I am honored to be her voice. I feel my voice will \n     not be enough alone to make a difference, and I hope that you \n     will be our voice.\n\n  Dawn Gibbs' voice is being heard on behalf of her cousin, just as \npatients all across the country are lending their voices to this \nimportant debate.\n  Carol Gill from Morrison, CO, wrote:\n\n       Dear Senator Bennet: I have stage 4 cancer. My current \n     treatment regimen is doing a fine job of keeping the disease \n     stable. This regimen includes a biweekly infusion of two \n     generic drugs--5FU and leucovorin--and two other drugs still \n     on patent. I receive treatment at the University of Colorado \n     Hospital. My oncologist just called me to say that the \n     University of Colorado Hospital is out of 5FU.\n       Today oncologists at the University of Colorado Hospital \n     are calling their patients to tell them some or all of their \n     cancer treatment must be suspended.\n       Thank you for taking this seriously and taking immediate \n     steps to correct it.\n                                                       Carol Gill.\n\n  My hope is that this Senate bill can give some reprieve to these \nColoradans in desperate need of their lifesaving drugs.\n  The Senate bill would give the Food and Drug Administration the much \nneeded authority to require drug manufacturers to report any \ndiscontinuance or interruption or other adjustment that would likely \nresult in a shortage, especially those drugs needed to provide \nemergency care. It would also immediately create a task force that \nwould create a strategic plan to address drug shortages and submit \nrecommendations to Congress as well as study the effect on drug pricing \nas it relates to shortages.\n  The people in my home State and every one of our home States need us \nto provide solutions to this problem yesterday. They cannot wait any \nlonger, nor should they.\n  I will say again that it is because of the leadership of the two \npeople sitting here, the ranking member of our committee and the \nchairman of our committee, that we have been able to get this bill to \nthe floor for a vote. I think we should take that vote tomorrow and \nmove forward on behalf of patients all across this country and the \nbioscience community.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Bennet, for his \ncomments, but he sold himself pretty short on the influence on this \nbill. He has worked dramatically on every portion of this bill and made \nsome significant contributions that are now a part of the bill. He \ndidn't have to do amendments at this point because he got them all in. \nThat was very important across-the-aisle work that the Senator did by \nworking with a number of people on both sides of the aisle and being \nfaithful and helping committee and staff members, not to mention all \nthe committee meetings held on Fridays throughout the year. This bill \nwouldn't have been possible without the Senator's efforts.\n  Mr. BENNET. I thank the ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I join Senator Enzi in thanking Senator \nBennet for being a very valuable member of our committee and for all of \nthe great work the Senator did on this bill. His fingerprints are all \nover this bill, and, as he pointed out, it is a great bill. There was \ngreat bipartisan support.\n  I thank the Senator for all of his work in our working groups, \nespecially the drug supply chain. This is a key part of this bill. The \nFDA will have the authority and the wherewithal to go back up the chain \nto where these drugs come from. The Senator was the first one to point \nout to me at the committee hearing that I think about 80 percent of all \nof the ingredients that go into our drugs in this country come from \noutside this country, but we had no real idea on where and how, and now \nwe can insist on good manufacturing practices. So I would say this \nsingular addition to this bill can be traced right back to the Senator \nfrom Colorado, and I thank him very much for his leadership on this \nissue and in helping us to get this bill to where we are today. I thank \nthe Senator.\n  I would like to yield 10 minutes off of the opposition of the \nGrassley amendment 2121 to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, this bill means so much to my State. I \nspoke earlier today about the need to improve the approval process at \nthe FDA, and this bill will speed that up with the agreement reached \nbetween industry and the FDA on the fees. I thank the Senator for his \nleadership on that issue.\n  We have literally tens of thousands of employees in our State who \nhave incredibly good jobs in the high-tech industry. This is a huge \npotential export. It is already an export, but even more could come if \nwe do this right as we look at the growing middle class in countries \nsuch as China and India who are going to the hospital and using medical \ndevices. So this bill is speeding up that process but still keeping the \nvery important safety standards in place, which couldn't be more \nimportant--as well as for patients who have been waiting for lifesaving \ntreatment. So I thank the Senator for that.\n  I also thank the Senator for including, as Senator Bennet referenced, \nmy drug shortage provision. We worked on that for 2 years. We gathered \nsupport as the years went on.\n  I thank Senator Harkin for the hearing we had on that bill and for \nthe work of his staff in bringing people together. We got Senator \nCasey's and Senator Collins' provisions in this bill.\n  We all know what has been going on. As several Senators have \nmentioned, we are talking about 4-year-old boys with leukemia whose \nparents find out they have no cancer treatment drug and literally are \nput into a panic, so they book flights to Canada so this little child \ncan complete his treatment, or the woman with breast cancer who has to \ncall around for Prudoxin and is then faced with the ethical dilemma \nthat she explained to us that she knew she was taking it away from \nanother patient. That should not happen in the United States of \nAmerica, and this early notification of the FDA, as we have seen, has \nbeen very positive.\n  Over 200 drug shortages have been averted because of the early \nnotification with orphan drugs in the last few years, so this provision \nwill truly make a difference. I thank the Senator for including that.\n  I am here to talk about another matter the two Senators have been \ninvolved in negotiating. These are bills that Senator Schumer, Senator \nGrassley, and I have been working on. We each had one of the three \nbills that covered different synthetic drugs.\n  My drug bill covered 2C-E, which is a synthetic hallucinogen, which, \nsadly, is something a young man died from taking in Minnesota. There \nwas actually a murder prosecution because of it, and, again, we have \nseen it go like wildfire through our State with these synthetic drugs. \nSenator Portman and myself and Senator Grassley will be offering this \namendment, and I thank the Senator for his work on it. I also encourage \nmy colleagues to support this amendment, and I hope it will pass \noverwhelmingly.\n  As members of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Grassley, Senator \nSchumer, and I have been working on this, as I mentioned, for years. \nThere have been reports from every State in the country of people \nacting violently while under the influence of these drugs, which leads \nto death or injuries to themselves and others. While taking these \ndrugs, people can experience elevated heart rates and blood pressure,\n\n[[Page S3504]]\n\nhallucinations, seizures, and extreme agitation, which is dangerous, \nbut they are also dangerous to themselves.\n  Up in Moorhead, MN, with the Fargo sheriff, we did a forum. A group \nof people were sitting in the front row. I actually thought they were \nthere to object to our provisions. They were there to support them \nbecause they had lost a loved one who thought he was taking what he \nconsidered to be synthetic marijuana, and it turned out to be very \ndifferent from any marijuana. It turned out to be much stronger, and he \nended up hitting a tree and killing himself. They were sobbing while \ntelling their story.\n  Until 2006, I was a Hennepin County attorney. During my time there we \njust didn't have this as an issue. We can see how quickly it has \nchanged. Listen to these numbers. In 2011 poison control centers across \nAmerica received more than 13,000 calls about synthetic drugs. How many \ncalls did they get in 2010? They only got 3,200. Look at that--3,200 to \n13,000 in just 1 year. In Minnesota there were a total of 392 calls to \npoison control relating to synthetic drugs in 2011 compared to 107 in \n2010--a tripling of calls about this problem in just 1 year.\n  This all hit home, as I mentioned in my State, with the tragic death \nof a 19-year-old man, Trevor Robinson, in Blaine, MN, when he overdosed \non 2C-E. It is a synthetic hallucinogen. Another young man was thought \nto have shot himself in Minnesota while under the influence of \nsynthetic drugs. We can imagine the pain of these families, and that is \nwhy I introduced a bill to add 2C-E and similar drugs to the substance \nlist so they will be treated in the same manner as other banned drugs \nthey claim to represent.\n  I am also a cosponsor of the two bills authored by Senators Grassley \nand Schumer. All three of these bills are contained in the amendment we \nare offering with Senator Portman. These drugs can kill, and if we \ndon't take action, they are going to become more and more prevalent. \nThey are available on the Internet. The Federal Government has to make \nclear that they are illegal. That is what is going on today because \npeople literally buy these drugs that have numbers like 2C-E. They \ndon't really know what they are. They get them, and they turn out to be \ndeadly. That is what happened in Blaine, MN.\n  I am hopeful that we vote to ban these drugs as part of the debate on \nthis bill. We have seen what happened in Minnesota. We know the DEA has \nbeen taking action on its own, and they temporarily banned some of \nthese drugs, but most of the substances covered in our three bills have \nnot been banned, including all of the substances in my bill. That is \nwhy, in fact, we are offering this amendment.\n  On the State level, roughly 40 States have banned some synthetic \ndrugs, including my State, where a major law regarding synthetic drugs \ntook effect in July. We need a Federal law. This crosses State lines. A \nlot of it is done on the Internet. We cannot simply have this State by \nState, and passing a Federal law will help create the partnership we \nneed to send a strong message that we need to eradicate these \nsubstances.\n  I am pleased this amendment is being offered. We need to get it done \nnow, ban these drugs, and make a clear statement that these drugs are \nillegal.\n  I again thank Senator Harkin and Senator Enzi for working it out so \nwe can offer this amendment, and also my colleagues, Senators Portman, \nSchumer, and Grassley, for their hard work. I know we are committed to \ngetting this done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes in morning business and not to take time away from the debate \non the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it was my understanding that because of the \nspecial event tonight, we were going to be out of here at 6 pm. I am \nnot sure what leadership has in mind at this point.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have had a conversation with them----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator's request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Veterans Employment\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, next week Americans are going to spend \ntime honoring and commemorating the men and women who died fighting for \nour great country. Memorial Day is a day to reflect on and give thanks \nto the sacrifices made by those who made the ultimate sacrifice. It is \nalso a day to look forward and to think about what we all can do to \nhelp our veterans who sacrificed so much and who deserve our support \nwhen they come home.\n  So I come to the floor today to discuss an issue that, quite frankly, \ndefies common sense. The high rate of unemployment among recently \nseparated veterans is an issue that continues to make the transition \nhome for veterans harder than ever. Despite the fact that our veterans \nhave the leadership ability and the discipline and technical skills to \nnot only find work but to excel in the workforce of the 21st century, \nour veterans continue to struggle.\n  Despite the skill and talent and training of our veterans, statistics \ncontinue to paint a grim picture.\n  According to the Department of Labor, young veterans between the ages \nof 18 and 24 have an unemployment rate that is nearly 20 percent. One \nin five of our Nation's heroes can't find a job to support their \nfamily, doesn't have an income that provides stability, and doesn't \nhave work that provides them with the self-esteem and pride that is so \ncritical to their transition home.\n\n  We know this should not be the case. We shouldn't let the skills and \ntraining our Nation's veterans have attained go to waste. That is why \nall of us joined together to overwhelmingly pass my VOW to Hire Heroes \nAct here in the Senate late last year. Among many other things, that \nlaw would provide tax incentives to encourage businesses to hire \nveterans; it makes participation in the transition assistance program \nmandatory for most separating servicemembers, and expands the education \nand training we provide to transitioning servicemembers.\n  Thanks to that legislation, we have been able to take real concrete \nsteps toward putting our veterans to work. The tax credit is working, \nand VA is set to begin accepting applications for a retraining program \nthat will benefit unemployed veterans ages 35 to 60 and help them get \nback to work.\n  But that bill is only that, a first step. Today I am here to talk \nabout the next step, and that step is to build partnerships with \nprivate businesses, large and small, all across our country, to hire \nour Nation's heroes. Recently I was up in New York where I participated \nin a lively roundtable discussion hosted by the Robin Hood Foundation. \nThis discussion on veterans employment was moderated by Tom Brokaw on \nthe USS Intrepid and brought together people of various backgrounds, \nincluding former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs ADM Mike Mullen, and \nHousing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan, to talk about \nthis important issue.\n  What is very apparent is that there is momentum to build public-\nprivate partnerships. What is also apparent is there is a lot of room \nfor improvement in this area.\n  I want to first make clear that a lot of companies across the country \nare far ahead of the curve. In fact, many private sector companies have \nalready joined our efforts in addressing this critical issue. J.C. \nPenney, one of America's largest retailers, and Joseph Abboud, a men's \nclothing company, partnered with Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of \nAmerica to launch the Welcome Home Joe--Thanks A Million Program.\n  To prepare veterans for job interviews, this program has provided \n5,000 veterans with certificates to purchase business attire. For the \nlast decade, we have expected our brave men and women in uniform to \nprepare for the battlefield. In the process, they have become \naccustomed to wearing combat boots and battle dress uniforms. Now they \nare expected to wear a suit and tie for job interviews--something that \nsometimes seems pretty foreign to them. But thanks to this program, \nthousands of transitioning veterans can now hang up their battle dress \nuniforms and dress for their next challenge.\n  Other companies such as Schneider National, one of America's largest\n\n[[Page S3505]]\n\ntrucking companies, are realizing the skills our veterans have gained \nover the last decade of work are directly applicable to their business. \nSchneider National recognizes that a veteran who has driven a 7-ton \ntruck across Afghanistan's dangerous and rugged terrain is more than \nqualified to drive a freight truck across our Nation's roads. In \naddition to providing many veterans with new jobs, Schneider National \nalso provides newly separated veterans with on-the-job training through \ntheir military apprenticeship program. As part of that program, veteran \nemployees are eligible to earn a monthly educational benefit check from \nthe VA in addition to a paycheck. Schneider National serves as a great \nexample of how companies can hire veterans who have proven they can \nperform on the job but lack proper certifications for civilian \nemployment.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also should be commended for launching \nits Hiring Our Heroes initiative which has sponsored 150 hiring fairs \nin 48 of our States. At one of these recent hiring fairs, General \nElectric, the employer of 10,000 veterans, launched its veterans \nnetwork transition assistance program. As part of that program, General \nElectric has vowed to hire 1,000 additional veterans every year for the \nnext 5 years and provides job-seeking veterans with one-on-one \nmentoring sessions. Those sessions help transitioning veterans improve \nresume writing and interviewing techniques so they can capitalize on \nthe skills they have developed during their military service.\n  That is just a fraction of the work being done by our Nation's \nemployers. There are many success stories at big companies such as Home \nDepot and small companies such as General Plastics in my home State \nwhich has created a pipeline to hire veterans at its aerospace \ncomposite factory. All of these companies are not only examples of \nsuccess stories but they have also created a roadmap about how best to \nfind, hire, and train veterans. It is our job to make sure those \nlessons are being heard.\n  Today I am here on the floor to lay out a few things that all \nbusinesses, large and small, can do to bring our Nation's heroes into \ntheir companies. First, get the word out to companies to educate their \nhuman resources teams about the benefits of hiring veterans and how \nskills they learned in the military translate to the work a company \ndoes. I can't tell my colleagues how often I hear from veterans who \ntell me the terms they use in interviews and on resumes fail to get \nthrough to the interviewer.\n  Second, help our companies provide job training and resources for \ntransitioning servicemembers. This is something I have seen done at \nlarge organizations such as Amazon and Microsoft, but also at smaller \ncompanies in conjunction with local colleges. In fact, the most \nsuccessful of these programs capitalizes on skills developed during \nmilitary service but also utilizes on-the-job training.\n  Third, let business leaders know how important it is to publicize job \nopenings with our Veterans Service Organizations at local military \nbases so we can help connect veterans with jobs, and to work with local \none-stop career centers.\n  Fourth, develop an internal veterans group within our companies to \nmentor recently discharged veterans.\n  Finally, if possible, please reach out to local community colleges \nand universities to help develop a pipeline of the many veterans who \nare using GI bill benefits to gain employment in a particular area.\n  If we can spread the message on just a few of these steps, I am \nconfident we will be able to continue to build on the success we have \nhad in hiring veterans.\n  There is one other even more important step we have to take to ensure \nthat businesses are taking, and it has to do with the difficult issue \nthat some potential employees face. I have heard repeatedly from \nveterans that they do not put their military service on their resume \nbecause they fear it stigmatizes them. They fear that those who have \nnot served see them all as damaged or unstable. We have to understand \nwhat mental health challenges are and what they are not.\n\n  As we seek to employ more veterans, we need future bosses and \ncoworkers to understand that issues such as posttraumatic stress or \ndepression are natural responses to some of the most stressful events a \nperson can experience. We need them to understand that these illnesses \ndo not afflict every veteran and, most importantly, we need to \nunderstand that for those who are affected by these illnesses, they can \nget help, they can get better, and they can get back to their lives. We \nneed to let businesses know if they have a veteran who is facing some \nchallenges, we should do the right thing and encourage him or her to \nget help. They need to know it is OK to reach out. Help them take \nadvantage of the excellent mental health care the VA is capable of \nproviding. The veteran will be better and they will be an even stronger \nmember of a company's team.\n  Those are some steps our employers can take, but we also need to make \nsure our veterans are taking steps to stand out as candidates. \nUnfortunately, too often our veterans don't see how the skills they \nlearned in the military translate from the battlefield to the working \nworld. One of the biggest reasons for that is often our veterans don't \nunderstand the vernacular of the working world.\n  A few weeks ago I was home in Washington State talking about this \nissue when I met a woman named Anne Spurte. Anne is a veteran. She \nhelps other local veterans find work through an organization called The \nUnfinished Mission. Anne told me how often she has heard from veterans \nwho told her they were not qualified for the jobs they had seen on line \nor in the paper. Repeatedly they told her they didn't see how their \nexperiences mattered to employers in the area. So one day in front of a \nwhole group of veterans, Anne pulled out this job advertisement from \nBoeing for a position as a fabrication specialist. Anne could once \nagain sense that the veterans who sat there and read this ad thought \nthey weren't qualified for this manufacturing job that is listed in \nBoeing's space exploration division. But then Anne concentrated all the \nattention of the veterans in the room on the competency and \nqualifications section that was listed on that job advertisement and \nshe asked all of them: Did you spend time in the service working \ntogether to remove obstacles to help a team accomplish its goals? Did \nyou work to fully involve others on the team in decisions and actions? \nWere you held responsible? Did you demonstrate your commitment to the \nteam? Around the room, all of these veterans' heads were nodding as she \nread verbatim from the Boeing job announcement. Every veteran \nunderstood they had the core skills employers at Boeing were looking \nfor, but they just didn't realize it.\n  What Anne made those veterans come to understand was that their \nskills were being lost in translation, and what many of them needed to \ndo was simply articulate their experiences in a way that employers \ncould understand.\n  So today I want to reiterate to all of our veterans that no matter \nwhat branch you served in or when you served or how long you served, \nthe skills you learned are valuable and it is up to you to make sure \nemployers see that.\n  Our veterans don't ask for a lot. Oftentimes they come home and don't \neven acknowledge their own sacrifice. My own father never talked about \nhis time fighting in World War II. In fact, I never saw his Purple \nHeart or knew that he had a wallet with shrapnel in it from when he was \nhit or a diary that detailed his time in combat, until after he died \nand my family gathered to start sorting through his belongings. But our \nveterans shouldn't have to ask. We should know to provide for them.\n  When my father's generation came home from the war, they came home to \nopportunity. My father came home to a community that supported him. He \ncame home to college and a job--a job that gave him pride and helped \nhim start a family and one that ultimately led to me starting my own.\n  That is the legacy of opportunity we have to live up to for today's \nveterans. Together, working with the private sector, we can ensure that \nthe brave men and women who have worn our uniform have that real \nopportunity. We can make sure they get a fair shot from America's \nemployers, that they are not measured by fear or stigma but by what \nthey can do, what they have done, and what they will do.\n\n[[Page S3506]]\n\n  I thank those companies that are leading the way as our veterans \ntransition from military service to the civilian workforce. The \nVeterans Affairs' Committee, which I chair, has a Web site with a list \nof some of those companies that are contributing to this effort. I \nwould encourage all of our colleagues to visit that Web site and \nsuggest companies that can be added to our list. I look forward to \nworking with all of them, and many more of our Nation's businesses, on \nthis important next step in bringing our veterans home to opportunity.\n  As we celebrate our fallen heroes on Memorial Day next week, let's \nall keep thinking about how we can make sure our veterans are getting \neverything they need after they have given so much.\n  Before I yield the floor, I wish to take a moment to acknowledge a \nyoung Marine reservist, an Afghanistan combat veteran, who has been \nworking part time on my Veterans' Affairs Committee staff for the last \nyear. Carlos Fuentes is a hard-working, well-liked young man who \ngraduated from American University earlier this month. He has helped \nour committee get a better understanding of what our veterans are \nfacing when they are looking for work, and I want to thank him for his \ncontinued service to our Nation. I need my colleagues to know that \nCarlos is going to be getting married this weekend and I wish him and \nhis bride many happy years to come.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2151, as Modified\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendments, so I may call up my amendment No. 2151, as \nmodified, with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Manchin], for himself, \n     Mr. Kirk, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Rockefeller, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2151, as modified.\n\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Controlled Substances Act to make any substance \n               containing hydrocodone a schedule II drug)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title XI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1133. HYDROCODONE AMENDMENT.\n\n       The Controlled Substances Act is amended--\n       (1) in schedule III(d) in section 202(c) (21 U.S.C. \n     812(c)), by--\n       (A) striking paragraphs (3) and (4); and\n       (B) redesignating paragraphs (5), (6), (7), and (8) as \n     paragraphs (3), (4), (5), and (6), respectively; and\n       (2) in section 401(b)(1) (21 U.S.C. 841(b)(1)), by adding \n     at the end the following:\n       ``(F) In the case of any material, compound, mixture, or \n     preparation containing--\n       ``(i) not more than 300 milligrams of dihydrocodeinone per \n     100 milliliters or not more than 15 milligrams per dosage \n     unit, with a fourfold or greater quantity of an isoquinoline \n     alkaloid of opium; or\n       ``(ii) not more than 300 milligrams of dihydrocodeinone per \n     100 milliliters or not more than 15 milligrams per dosage \n     unit, with one or more active, nonnarcotic ingredients in \n     recognized therapeutic amounts,\n     subparagraph (C) shall not apply and such case shall be \n     subject to subparagraph (E).''.\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I wish to give a brief explanation of the \namendment and hope it will be accepted. Basically, what we are doing is \nchanging the hydrocodone combination drugs to be schedule II drugs \nrather than schedule III drugs. That makes it much harder for people to \nhave access to this drug that has been wreaking havoc throughout our \nStates and throughout the country.\n  I would appreciate adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as the Senator said, his amendment would \namend the Controlled Substances Act to make any substance containing \nhydrocodone--Vicodin--a schedule II drug. As he said, this is presently \na schedule III drug. The most significant difference is, for patients, \nschedule II drugs are not allowed to be refilled. That is the key to \nthe amendment.\n  I applaud the Senator. I have great concerns regarding the increased \nabuse of prescription drugs. According to the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention:\n\n       Overdoses involving prescription painkillers are at \n     epidemic levels--\n\n  Epidemic levels--\n\n     and now kill more Americans than heroin and cocaine combined.\n\n  That is a quote from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n  According to CDC, more than 40 people die in America every day from \noverdoses involving narcotic pain relievers such as hydrocodone.\n  For this reason, I applaud Senator Manchin for his amendment and the \nefforts he has undertaken to reschedule this drug. It is the most \nfrequently abused narcotic and that is a strong reason to reschedule it \ninto section II.\n  Again, I thank the Senator for this amendment. At the appropriate \ntime I will ask for its adoption. Again, I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia. This is a great amendment. It improves the bill. It is widely \naccepted, and the Senator has been on the right track on this issue for \na long time. I applaud him for doing this and, believe me, a lot of \npeople in America are going to thank the Senator for getting this drug \nrescheduled to cut down on the terrible overuse of this drug in \nAmerica. I thank the Senator very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, if I may say this: Senator Kirk, as you \nknow, has worked very closely with me on this matter, and we have many \nother Senators--Gillibrand, Schumer, Rockefeller--so many people who \nare having this problem in their States. This is one way for us to \nfight this abuse.\n  I have said this: If we do nothing else--if we go to some of these \ncommunities that have been ravaged, and we speak to these young \nchildren, they will come up to us and say: Please help me to help my \ndaddy or my mommy get off of this addiction. It will tear your heart \nout.\n  This gives us a chance--one more tool with which we can fight the \ndrug abuse that is going on with prescription drugs. I appreciate its \nconsideration and would ask unanimous consent that it be adopted, if we \ncan do that.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator would withhold the unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. OK.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We have a number of amendments we are putting together, \nand at the appropriate time I will make sure that happens.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2126\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside all \npending amendments in order to call up Reed amendment No. 2126, and I \nask that the clerk report the amendment by number.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for Mr. Reed, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 2126.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To make effective the proposed rule of the Food and Drug \n          Administration relating to sunscreen drug products)\n\n       At the end of title XI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 11__. COMPLIANCE DATE FOR RULE RELATING TO SUNSCREEN \n                   DRUG PRODUCTS FOR OVER-THE-COUNTER HUMAN USE.\n\n       In accordance with the final rule issued by the \n     Commissioner of Food and Drug entitled ``Labeling and \n     Effectiveness Testing; Sunscreen Drug Products for Over-the- \n     Counter Human Use; Delay of Compliance Dates'' (77 Fed. Reg. \n     27591 (May 11, 2012)), a product subject to the final rule \n     issued by the Commissioner entitled ``Labeling and \n     Effectiveness Testing; Sunscreen Drug Products for Over-\n\n[[Page S3507]]\n\n     the-Counter Human Use'' (76 Fed. Reg. 35620 (June 17, 2011)), \n     shall comply with such rule not later than--\n       (1) December 17, 2013, for products subject to such rule \n     with annual sales of less than $25,000 and\n       (2) December 17, 2012, for all other products subject to \n     such rule.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing amendments be agreed to en bloc: Cardin No. 2125; Cardin No. \n2141; Grassley No. 2121; Grassley No. 2129; Manchin No. 2151, as \nmodified; and Reed No. 2126.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2125; 2141; 2121; 2129; 2151, as modified; and \n2126) were agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Harkin and ranking member \nEnzi for including the Counterfeit Drug Penalty Enhancement Act in \ntheir substitute amendment to S. 3187. I introduced the Counterfeit \nDrug Penalty Act, S. 1886, last year along with Senator Grassley and \nothers, and the Senate passed it by unanimous consent in March. \nUnfortunately, the House of Representatives has yet to take action on \nit.\n  The Counterfeit Drug Penalty Enhancement Act has the support of \nindustry and consumer groups and bipartisan backing in the House of \nRepresentatives. It will strengthen the provisions already included in \nS. 3187 that are intended to improve the safety of our supply chain and \nincrease penalties for adulterated drugs.\n  This provision increases penalties for trafficking counterfeit drugs \nto a level commensurate with counterfeit cases in which the offender \nknowingly or recklessly causes or attempts to cause serious bodily \ninjury. By strengthening the penalties appropriately, it will deter the \nsale of dangerous counterfeit drugs.\n  Few things are more important to consumer well-being than ensuring \nthe safety of our pharmaceutical supply chain. Law enforcement is \nfinding counterfeit versions of drugs that patients rely on to treat \nblood clots, cholesterol, prostate cancer, influenza, Alzheimer's, and \nother serious conditions. Counterfeit drugs reportedly result in \n100,000 deaths globally each year and account for an estimated $75 \nbillion in annual revenue for criminal enterprises. We must do more to \nprevent and deter this conduct.\n  In addition to protecting consumers, deterring the manufacture and \nsale of counterfeit drugs also protects American intellectual property, \nhelping American workers and manufacturers. That is why this \nlegislation has the broad support of not only the pharmaceutical \nindustry and consumer groups such as the Alliance for Safe Online \nPharmacies and Easter Seals but also the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  I appreciate the work of Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Enzi to \nprotect American consumers from adulterated and counterfeit drugs, and \nI thank them for including the Counterfeit Drug Penalty Enhancement Act \nas part of that effort in this legislation.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of \nthe Food and Drug Safety and Innovation Act. This measure includes a \nnumber of important reforms to promote the development of new \ntreatments for patients in need and to ensure that drugs and other \nmedical products are safe and effective for American families. I \ncommend Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Enzi for their hard work and \nleadership on this bill.\n  As a participant in the drug supply chain integrity working group, \nalong with the chairman and ranking member and Senators Bennet, Burr, \nand Grassley, I am especially proud of the strong, bipartisan measures \nto protect patients that have been included in this bill. The not-too-\ndistant incidents concerning adulterated Heparin and counterfeit \nAvastin demonstrate the critical importance of protecting Americans \nfrom unsafe medical products manufactured overseas. The new tools and \nauthorities in this law should help safeguard Rhode Island families \nfrom dangerous drugs, while leveling the playing field for U.S. \nmanufacturers and providing more transparency and accountability across \nour drug supply chain.\n  I particularly want to thank the chairman and ranking member for \nworking with me to include the Expanding and Promoting Expertise in \nRare Treatments Act of 2012, or EXPERT Act, which I introduced earlier \nthis year, in the bill on the floor.\n  During my time in office, I have been moved by the personal stories \nof dozens of Rhode Islanders with rare conditions. In the last year, I \nhave met with Rhode Island advocates who have or whose family member \nhas a rare disease, like Fragile X, spinal muscular atrophy, and CLOVES \nsyndrome, among many others. Treatments for these rare conditions often \ndo not exist or are so early in the development pipeline that it will \ntake years for patients to benefit. Rather than simply waiting for the \nproducts to come to market, these families want to play a role in \neducating others about the rare disease that affects their loved one \nand working toward a successful treatment.\n  The EXPERT Act is intended to give patients and experts a role in \nstrengthening and expediting the FDA's review of new treatments for \nrare diseases. The measure encourages the agency to take advantage of \nthe wisdom and insights of rare disease experts in order to speed the \ndevelopment of therapies for patients suffering from rare diseases. The \nbill also gives rare disease patients and their advocates a role in \nconsulting with the FDA on topics like the severity of the disease, \nunmet medical needs, and the benefits and risks of therapies to treat \nthe disease.\n  We have seen that when the FDA gets the technical and scientific \nassistance it needs from rare disease experts, incredible progress can \nbe made. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's recent work with Vertex \nPharmaceuticals on a treatment named Kalydeco, which specifically \ntargets the underlying causes of the disease in some patients, is a \ngood example. As a result of close consultation with the CF Foundation \nand renowned experts, FDA approval for this treatment was one of the \nfastest in the agency's history.\n  Rhode Islanders are already benefiting from Kalydeco. Sheri, a former \nresident of Narragansett, was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis when she \nwas 16 years old. This past year, Sheri was surprised with the news \nthat she is one of the 4 percent of cystic fibrosis patients who can be \ntreated by the newly approved Kalydeco. For the past months Sheri has \nbeen on Kalydeco and says that she already feels the difference in her \nhealth, and, most importantly, it has given her hope to start thinking \nabout her future. Recently engaged in February, Sheri shared, ``I can \nthink about having children and seeing them grow up . . . even living \nto see my grandchildren!''\n  I hope the EXPERT Act will lead to more good stories for other Rhode \nIsland patients and families afflicted with rare diseases. I have great \nadmiration for the determination and optimism of the Rhode Islanders \nwith rare disease I have met over the years, and I wanted to share a \nfew more of those stories here today.\n  I heard from Susan, a Providence resident and mother of 3\\1/2\\-year-\nold Phoebe. Susan describes her daughter as a ``bright, happy, and \nbeautiful'' child. When Phoebe was 5 months old, Susan and her husband \nnoticed that their daughter did not reach for or look at objects placed \non the left side of her body. After numerous tests and doctor's visits, \nPhoebe was finally diagnosed with developmental dyspraxia, a motor-\nprocessing disorder. Because of the rarity of their daughter's \ncondition, Susan and her husband found that specialists ``looked at us \nlike we had two heads when we told them what her diagnosis was.'' \nPhoebe is reaching milestones in her development and is continuing to \nimprove, but because so little is known about dyspraxia, Susan and her \nhusband have encountered several hurdles to getting Phoebe the \ntreatment and therapy she needs. Susan said, ``It breaks our hearts to \nthink that Phoebe is being held back from reaching her full potential \nbecause of lack of awareness and education about her disease.''\n  Dorrie, from Warwick, wrote to share her family's story with me. Her \nyoungest son was diagnosed with an extremely rare disorder called \natypical non-ketotic hyperglycinemia, or NKH, when he was 4 years old. \nHe is the only child living in Rhode Island with this disorder, which \nhas no known cure or treatment. However, doctors have\n\n[[Page S3508]]\n\nfound several products can be used off label to improve their son's \nspeech and alertness. Dorrie notes that ``he has progressed farther \nthan we could ever have hoped possible. He is not only walking, but \nriding a two-wheel bicycle and playing kickball with his peers.'' \nBecause they are using products off label, their private insurance will \nnot cover their costs, and so they are forced to shoulder the burden of \npaying for their son's treatments out-of-pocket. This has caused \nanxiety and extreme stress on their family. As her son grows older, \nDorrie is faced with more uncertainty about his future and says they \nare ``living on eggshells'' as he experiences increased and more severe \nsymptoms.\n  For these Rhode Islanders and others like them, the challenge of \nhaving a rare disease or having a family member with a rare disease \ncomes not just from the symptoms of the disease but the loneliness of \nhaving something that so few people understand, let alone have. The \nEXPERT Act is one step toward empowering patients and their families \nwith an opportunity to participate in a process that is critically \nimportant for their future. I am pleased that the act is supported by \n64 national organizations, including the Rhode Island Rare Disease \nFoundation. I again thank the chairman and ranking member for including \nthis measure in this legislation so that more families in Rhode Island \nand around the country can receive the same kind of good news that \nSheri and many other cystic fibrosis patients received earlier this \nyear.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to the \nbipartisan support for the Food and Drug Administration Safety and \nInnovation Act, S. 3187.\n  In addition to continuing the fee-based funding system for timely FDA \nreviews, S. 3187 also calls for strengthening early scientific dialogue \nand transparency, promotion of innovation through enhanced \ncommunications, and modernization of regulatory science.\n  These provisions, including enhancing dialog between the FDA and \nmedical device, pharmaceutical, generic and biotechnology companies \nearly in their new product development cycle, will facilitate a clearer \nunderstanding of the specific criteria the FDA will require in its \nreview process and provide a succinct roadmap for successful product \napproval.\n  The ultimate goal is to reduce misunderstandings and expensive \nsuperfluous testing, with the hope of reducing the time and costs to \nbring new medical technologies safely to patients in need.\n  I want to commend the chairman of the HELP committee, my friend \nSenator Harkin, and the ranking member, Senator Enzi, who worked to \nfind bipartisan consensus on these provisions.\n  By creating a more user friendly and accessible FDA, innovative U.S. \ncompanies built on the principle of American ingenuity, will be \nattracted and encouraged to develop new medical devices, technologies \nand pharmaceuticals.\n  With this new cooperation, together we will extend the quality of \nlife for our citizens, reduce healthcare complexities and costs, create \nnew U.S.-based jobs, and move this current national crisis to a \nfinancially manageable level for individuals, employers and tax payers.\n  For example, in my State of Virginia, medical and bioscience research \nand development is vibrant in our academic institutions and among our \ncompanies, both large and small. The biopharmaceutical companies employ \nnearly 77,000 workers in Virginia, both directly and indirectly. In the \nbioscience field alone employment has grown by 23 percent, compared to \n6 percent total growth statewide and 3.5 percent across all sectors in \nthe U.S.\n  We have a number of companies rushing to develop and market new \nproducts and technologies that are focused on improving healthcare \ndelivery at a lower cost premium--companies like Engineered \nBioPharmaceuticals in Danville, VA, who is focused on repositioning \ncurrent and future pharmaceutical therapeutics to be more effective at \nlower doses, with longer shelf-lives and better consumer compliance.\n  To help these companies, and encourage more innovation, I am glad to \nsee that the FDA has committed to being more open with applicants about \nusing more appropriate data, but also communicating why certain data is \nnot able to be used. I look forward to working with stakeholders and \nthe FDA in monitoring this issue.\n  One of the most exciting innovations in health care is related to \nmobile and health IT markets. Estimates indicate that the number of \nsmartphone consumers using medical apps will grow to 500 million by \n2015.\n  How these innovations are regulated matters a great deal. It is \nimportant to balance market creativity, with patient safety issues and \nthe intended use of the medical software.\n  A number of agencies have jurisdiction over pieces of mobile medical \napplications, including FDA, Office of National Coordinator, ONC, and \nthe Federal Communications Commission, FCC,--to properly regulate \nhealth information technology as well as address proper regulations of \nmobile medical applications.\n  I am pleased that language has been included in this bill which asks \nfor the Secretary to work across the different agencies--the FDA, ONC, \nand FCC--to come up with guidance that makes sense. It also encourages \nan outside stakeholder group to be consulted.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues Senator Bennet, Senator Burr, \nHatch and Coburn for their leadership on this as well.\n  I would also like to briefly acknowledge language in the FDA bill \nregarding the use of data from clinical trials conducted outside the \nUnited States. As many in industry will tell you, there are a number of \ncountries around the world that have comparable safety standards as the \nU.S.\n  I have been interested in learning more about the application of \nappropriate clinical data across borders. I believe that if the FDA can \ndo more to establish comparability between its guidelines for clinical \ntrials and those set by countries in the European Union, for instance, \nwe may be able to reduce the need for duplicative work and we may be \nable to get safe products to market sooner.\n  The FDA has committed to being more open with applicants about using \nthis type of data. They have agreed to provide applicants with more \ninformation about why certain data is not appropriate for use in the \nU.S. The FDA will also report on regulatory science, which will \nspecifically indicate which specific metrics can be used to determine \ncomparability.\n  I am hopeful that there will soon be measurable improvement on this \nissue, and I look forward to working with interested stakeholders and \nthe FDA to do more in this area in the future.\n  One final point I would like to make is about something that is not \ndirectly included in this bill, a new innovation--biomarkers.\n  Preeclampsia is a disorder that affects hundreds of thousands of \npregnant women every year which undiagnosed can put a woman at risk for \ndeath and the fetus at risk of still-birth.\n  Doctors currently use a mix of imprecise signs and symptoms to \ndiagnose it but oftentimes such signs and symptoms are wrong. However, \nresearchers have found a biomarker--a particular biological process or \nsign--that can accurately identify women with preeclampsia that are at \nrisk for pregnancy complications.\n  Unfortunately, tests for novel biomarkers are taking 5 or more years \nto get approved by the FDA, delaying patients from receiving the \nbenefits of more accurate diagnoses and treatments.\n  I was pleased that a recent commitment letter between FDA and \nindustry specifically mentions the FDA's commitment to work together \nwith industry to create a transitional IVD, or ``T IVD'' process for \nthe development of tests for novel biomarkers.\n  I look forward to seeing how this T IVD process develops in \ndiscussions between FDA and industry and am interested in progress \ntowards its implementation which supports advances in the sciences and \npromotes access to these emerging diagnostics.\n  If reducing healthcare costs is a national priority, we need to act \ntoday. I encourage my colleagues to pass S. 3187 and allow the FDA to \nwork more closely with the medical industry to safely bring new \ntechnologies to the marketplace.\n  Let's increase the quality of life of our citizens, structurally \nreduce\n\n[[Page S3509]]\n\nhealthcare costs without increasing risks to patients and stimulate the \ngrowth of American ingenuity and U.S.-based jobs.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are finished with business for today. \nWe do have some more amendments to be called up and voted on tomorrow. \nI understand we are coming in--I do not know exactly what time has been \nset for the morning, but after the leaders' time has been used, we will \nbe back on this bill.\n  Again, I remind Senators and their staffs that we have until 2 p.m. \nfor their amendments to be brought up and to be debated. The sooner we \nget to those in the morning, the better off we will be.\n  So as soon as the leader time is exhausted tomorrow morning, we will \nbe back on our bill.\n  So, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time in the quorum call not be taken off our \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week we celebrated the 150th \nanniversary of the United States Department of Agriculture, also known \nas the USDA. On May 15, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed \nlegislation to create the USDA. Since this day, the USDA has made major \ncontributions to agriculture that have benefited the people of the \nUnited States.\n  Hawaii has a historic relationship with the USDA that began during \nHawaii's territorial days. Our very own University of Hawaii at Manoa \ncampus began as a land-grant college of agriculture and mechanic arts \nin 1907. John Washington Gilmore, the first president of the College of \nHawaii, the predecessor of the University of Hawaii, was the son of a \nfarmer who was tasked to build Hawaii's first agricultural school. \nDuring the past 100 years, the University helped Hawaii diversify its \neconomy, sustain its environment, and build stronger families and \ncommunities.\n  Hawaii faces unique challenges when it comes to food security. Hawaii \ndepends on imported food for approximately 85 percent of its food \nsupply. For the United States as a whole, imports make up about 15 \npercent of total food consumption. In addition, higher energy-related \ntransportation costs, and rapidly escalating commodity prices translate \ninto very high food costs for Hawaii consumers. Further, if there is a \nshipping disruption of any kind, it is estimated that Hawaii has a 4 to \n7 day food supply.\n  The magnitude for Hawaii of this potential and unprecedented food \nsecurity crisis has prompted a restructuring of Hawaii's agriculture, \nwith a move from large-scale plantation agriculture to smaller scale, \nmore diversified agriculture, with an initial emphasis on import \nsubstitution. This process has been occurring over the past 20 years \nwith many large scale plantations either closing or shifting to \noverseas locations. Our situation remains a struggle. There is only one \nsugarcane and one pineapple operation remaining in the State. There are \nno dairies on the Island of Oahu and the only two remaining in the \nState are on the Big Island. There are no slaughter or meat processing \nfacilities on Oahu. A major employer on the Island of Molokai is gone \nand, with it, agricultural production and water supplies for residents. \nFinally, the only poultry operations remaining are four egg producers \non Oahu.\n  The rapid closures of these farming and farm-related operations \ncontinues to pose a serious challenge for our agriculture industry in \nHawaii as these operations were attempting a transition to agriculture \nsupportive of local consumption through import substitution. \nAccordingly, efforts to support those remaining in agriculture to make \nthe transition to an agriculture supportive of Hawaii food security is \nalso critical to the continued sustainability and viability of our \nagriculture industry in the State of Hawaii.\n  The USDA plays a major role in preservation. The U.S. Forest Service, \npart of the USDA, protects and manages our Nation's forests and \ngrasslands. Hawaii's rainforests contain numerous plant species that \nare not found anywhere else in the world, and they are part of a \nunique, delicate ecosystem consisting of countless native Hawaiian \nanimal species. The Forest Service has helped protect the beauty of \nHawaii's rainforests by fighting invasive species and destructive human \npractices.\n  The USDA hopes to protect the environments of Hawaii and the rest of \nthe United States with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, \nalso known as APHIS. The mission of APHIS is to protect our Nation's \nagriculture and animal and plant resources from diseases and pests. \nAPHIS plays a major role in the protection of Hawaii's environment. \nInvasive species such as fruit flies, coffee berry borers, and Varroa \nmites have been devastating to Hawaii's agriculture and fragile \necosystem. If Hawaii fails to stop potential invasive species including \nthe Brown Tree Snake, the results will be catastrophic. Even though \nHawaii may be small compared to the continental United States, our \nislands contain one the most diverse ecosystems in the world. It is in \nour country's interest to keep these protective programs. APHIS also \nprotects the continental United States from potential destructive \ninvasive species that can wreak havoc on our Nation's agriculture. \nPrograms such as APHIS protect both Hawaii and the continental United \nStates and are vital for economic and environmental security for \neveryone.\n  In addition to preservation, the USDA helps with innovation. The \nAgricultural Research Service is responsible for conducting basic, \napplied and developmental research on: soil, water, and air sciences; \nplant and animal productivity; commodity conversion and delivery; human \nnutrition; and the integration of agriculture systems. Through \nresearch, development, and other federal programs, the USDA has helped \nfarmers produce food efficiently and sustainably. The United States is \na world leader in agricultural production, and our agriculture research \ninfrastructure continues to give our country a competitive edge.\n  Agriculture has been, and remains, an important pillar of the \nAmerican economy. The USDA touches all Americans and will continue to \ncontribute to our society far into the future. I wish nothing but the \nbest for the USDA in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/23/senate-section/article/S3509-3", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3509-S3511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HUMAN RIGHTS IN U.S. PRISONS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the human rights \nissue of sexual assault in U.S. prisons, jails, and detention centers--\nand the historic release of our country's first-ever national standards \nto eliminate prison rape.\n  When the government takes people into custody, and puts them behind \nbars, their human rights become our responsibility. And we are \naccountable for the results. In studying this issue for nearly a \ndecade, we learned that sexual assault in detention has become an \nepidemic. It is occurring at the hands of other inmates, and it is \noccurring at the hands of prison officials whose job it is to protect.\n  We learned that hundreds of thousands of inmates are victims of \nsexual assault every year. According to a Bureau of Justice Statistics \nreport released this month, approximately one out of ten former state \nprisoners reported incidents of sexual victimization during their most \nrecent stay behind bars. Approximately a third of former inmates \nreported other types of sexual harassment or victimization. Many say \nthese are conservative estimates of those brave enough to report.\n  It is also disturbing that ``prison rape'' has become an accepted \npart of our culture. We hear people make light\n\n[[Page S3510]]\n\nof it in jokes, in movies, in television shows. It is a common pop \nculture reference. This is unacceptable, and it sends the message that \nthis brutal, terrorizing conduct is actually part of a United States \nprison sentence. As our Supreme Court has said, it is not. The Court \nstated, in the 1994 case of Farmer v. Brennan, that being violently \nassaulted in prison is not part of the penalty offenders should pay for \ntheir offenses against society.\n  Winston Churchill declared in 1910:\n\n       The mood and temper of the public in regard to the \n     treatment of crime and criminals is one of the most unfailing \n     tests of the civilisation of any country.\n\n  We are utterly failing the test when it comes to prison rape. Our \nstatus quo is intolerable for a country that prides itself on its \ncommitment to civil liberties, to civil rights, and to human rights.\n  And this issue affects so many individuals and their families so \ndeeply. We have more than two million people incarcerated in America \ntoday. We incarcerate more individuals, and at a higher per capita \nrate, than any other country on earth.\n  Congress passed the Prison Rape Elimination Act, ``PREA,'' in 2003. \nThis was a bipartisan effort so important that its champions included \nunlikely bedfellows like Senators Jeff Sessions and Edward M. Kennedy. \nI was an original cosponsor of this legislation. Just last week, the \nDepartment of Justice finally issued the first-ever national standards \nto prevent, detect, and respond to prison rape, which are required \nunder PREA.\n  These are historic regulations that aim to eliminate sexual assault \nin all federal, state, and local facilities. I applaud President Obama \nand Attorney General Eric Holder on their achievement. This nearly 300-\npage document represents one of the most comprehensive and challenging \nrulemaking processes the Department of Justice has undertaken in \ndecades.\n  In particular, I want to thank the Attorney General for incorporating \nmy concerns and suggestions into the Justice Department's final \nstandards. As an original cosponsor of PREA, I have been following the \nprogress of these long-delayed standards for nearly 9 years. The \nDepartment's proposed standards, released early last year, were missing \nimportant protections. I sent a letter to the Attorney General, \nemphasizing the need for stronger provisions in certain key respects. \nFor example: The sea change we need requires, above all, \naccountability. In my letter, I expressed concern that the proposed \nstandards did not require regular audits of detention facilities by \nexternal, objective auditors. The final standards require external \naudits every 3 years to ensure the regulations are being implemented.\n  One of the biggest problems with custodial sexual assault is \nunderreporting and fear of retaliation. I learned it was key that \ninmates have access to ``outside reporting''--a way to report abuse to \nsomeone entirely separate from the facility and agency holding them. \nAccording to one Illinois inmate, this ``could make all the \ndifference.'' Heeding these concerns, the final standards now require \nthis outside reporting.\n  I expressed concern about imposing short timelines for reporting \nabuse and hampering the ability of victims to seek appropriate redress. \nI also asked the Department to ensure inmates weren't chilled from \nreporting emergency situations due to fear of reprimand for false \nreporting. I am pleased that the final rule made these changes.\n  I commented on the need for increased protections related to certain \nstaff practices we know can contribute to instances of sexual abuse--\nso-called ``cross-gender pat-downs and cross-gender viewings.'' I am \npleased that many of the critical protections were added.\n  I have long been concerned about the use of solitary confinement, \nwhere some inmates spend prolonged periods in extreme isolation. I \nlearned one reason some do not report abuse is a fear of placement in \nsolitary confinement. Placing those who report abuse in extreme \nconfinement can make a ``victim'' even more of victim. I asked the \nDepartment to impose important safeguards in this regard, and I am \npleased to see these changes were included in the final standards.\n  Finally, I am concerned about younger inmates who are especially \nvulnerable and easily victimized--namely, children serving time in \nadult prisons. The final standards include important protections for \nthis population.\n  I am grateful to Attorney General Holder for considering my input and \nfor making these changes to the Justice Department's historic national \nstandards.\n  Of course, the standards are not perfect. I look forward to working \nwith the Department of Justice on remaining issues like ensuring that \ninmates have access to confidential reporting and services--and making \nsure that staff practices, like cross-gender pat-downs, with regard to \nmale inmates are appropriate.\n  But the bottom line is that the Department's strong standards make \nclear that the federal government will not tolerate this conduct, and \nthat a culture change is necessary.\n  My work on this issue has been inspired by hearing from sexual abuse \nvictims. For example, I received an account from one Illinois inmate \nwho was incarcerated for a non-violent offense. He described multiple \nthreats he received in jail, and how he tried to get help from prison \nofficials, to no avail. He explained how he was knocked to the floor, \nchoked, and raped in the shower. He now wants to spend his life putting \nan end to prison rape.\n  I received a report from another survivor in Illinois, a father of \ntwo who explained how he contracted HIV after being sexually assaulted \nin prison. He talked about the stress, hyperventilating, nightmares, \nand shame. He explained that he wakes some nights and can ``smell the \nsoap from the washcloth that had been crammed in [his] mouth to silence \n[the] screams.''\n  Criminal detainees aren't the only detainees at risk. Last week, the \nWhite House made another important announcement. It confirmed that \nPrison Rape Elimination Act standards will apply to all federal \nconfinement facilities, including immigration facilities. This is an \nimportant step that speaks to the Administration's commitment to ending \nsexual assault in all forms of detention.\n  The Department of Homeland Security will be promulgating its own \nregulations that will apply to immigration detainees. I have long been \nconcerned about the sexual assault of immigration detainees. We have \nheard about truly horrific instances of assault occurring in \nimmigration detention facilities. A troubling episode of Frontline, the \nPBS program, detailed one woman's story in great detail recently. But \nthat was hardly an isolated incident.\n  When we drafted and passed PREA, it was always our intent that it \nwould apply to all those in detention--including immigration detainees. \nI discussed this issue with Secretary Napolitano at a recent Judiciary \nCommittee hearing. And I also--working with Senator Leahy--included a \nprovision in the current Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act to \nclarify that standards to prevent rape must apply to all immigration \ndetainees.\n  I am disappointed that nearly 9 years after PREA was passed, our \nimmigration detainees still do not have the strong protections they \ndeserve. But I look forward to working with the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to ensure that its forthcoming regulations effectively address \nthis issue. It was never our intention to have those accused of \nviolating civil immigration laws left with fewer protections than those \nserving criminal sentences.\n  Again, I applaud President Obama and Attorney General Holder for \ntheir efforts to end this serious human rights abuse. I also give \nspecial recognition to the bipartisan Prison Rape Elimination \nCommission, whose impressive work, expertise, and strong proposed \nstandards were the lynchpin of this effort.\n  I want to recognize my former colleague, the late, great Senator Ted \nKennedy, for his leadership on this issue, as he led us on so many \ncivil rights issues over the years.\n  I also want to thank my colleague Senator Sessions for his leadership \nas the lead sponsor of the Prison Rape Elimination Act. Senator \nSessions and I often disagree, but we have been able to come together \nacross the political divide to work on civil rights issues like prison \nrape and the sentencing of nonviolent drug offenders. As Senator \nKennedy stated about prison rape:\n\n\n[[Page S3511]]\n\n\n       It is not a liberal issue or a conservative issue. It is an \n     issue of basic decency and human rights.\n\n  Finally, I thank the organizations that worked with me and my office \nto address this issue: Just Detention International, the ACLU, the \nNational Immigrant Justice Center, Human Rights Watch, Human Rights \nFirst, Campaign for Youth Justice, and so many others.\n  I look forward to confronting what may be the most challenging part \nof this process ahead--ensuring that these standards protect the rights \nof all detainees, and that they are adopted and enforced expeditiously. \nI look forward to working with my colleagues to put an end to one of \nthe more alarming criminal justice and human rights crises in our \ncountry today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/23/senate-section/article/S3511-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING EDDIE BLAZONCZYK, SR.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on Monday morning, Eddie Blazonczyk, Sr., \npassed away in Palos Heights, IL. He was known in the greater Chicago \narea as the Polka King. Eddie was born in Chicago in 1941 to Polish \nimmigrant parents--both musicians. It is no surprise, then, that Eddie \nstarted playing the accordion at the age of 12. Eddie's first love was \nrock and roll, but, influenced by his mother's fondness for the music \nof her homeland, he was soon playing polka music.\n  In 1962, Eddie Blazonczyk joined a local polka band called the \nVersatones, a union that would last for the rest of his life. His son, \nEddie Blazonczyk, Jr, still plays with the band. Today, the Versatones \nare the most sought after polka band in the music industry. While they \nare popular in communities all over the country, Chicago has always \nbeen home to the band, and Chicago knows polka.\n  The Chicago metropolitan area is steeped with Polish customs and \nheritage. It has the largest Polish population outside of Poland, and \nthe Polish language is the third most commonly spoken language in the \ngreater Chicago area. In Illinois, the first Monday of March is Casimir \nPulaski Day, a day when all State government buildings are closed in \nremembrance of ``the father of the American cavalry.'' The \nInternational Polka Association moved to Chicago in 1968. We even have \na Chicago style of polka music, distinguished by heavier clarinet and \ntrumpet and, of course, the button-box accordion. Eddie Blazonczyk \nhelped define Chicago style polka, even as he grew into his unofficial \nrole as polka royalty.\n  In 1967, a congressional committee awarded 26-year-old Eddie \nBlazonczyk and the Versatones the title of ``The Nation's #1 Polka \nBand.'' In 1970, Eddie was elected into the International Polka \nAssociation Polka Music Hall of Fame. The Versatones also have 16 \nGrammy nominations and a Grammy award in 1986 for their ``Another Polka \nCelebration'' album. First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton presented him \nwith the National Endowment for the Arts 1998 National Heritage \nFellowship for preserving Polish Heritage Music.\n  I extend my sympathies to Eddie's wife Christine--Tish, as many know \nher; his daughter Kathy; his sons Eddie and Tony; his grandchildren \nCayle, Anya, and Anthony; and his many nieces and nephews. Eddie took a \ntraditional sound and infused it with rock and roll, Cajun, zydeco, and \ncountry, creating something both familiar and entirely different. The \nPolish American community lost a music hero this week, but his legacy \nwill live on at weddings, celebrations, and parties for generations to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/23/senate-section/article/S3511-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RYAN CROCKER DEPARTURE\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a statement released yesterday by Senators Graham, \nLieberman, and myself on the decision of Ambassador Ryan Crocker to \ndepart his post in Kabul, Afghanistan.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The recent announcement by Ambassador Ryan Crocker that he \n     will be departing his post in Kabul is a great loss to the \n     United States and Afghanistan, but we fully understand his \n     decision. We are grateful beyond words to Ryan for his \n     decision to come out of retirement at the President's request \n     to serve our country one last time in one of the most \n     challenging jobs in the world. When the history of the past \n     decade is written, Ryan Crocker will rightly be recognized as \n     one of the genuine American heroes of this era. We have never \n     met a finer, more capable, or more dedicated diplomat than \n     Ryan Crocker.\n       Ambassador Crocker arrived in Afghanistan at a critical \n     moment in the relations between our two countries. Thanks to \n     his efforts, we believe that the Afghan-U.S. relationship is \n     now on a much better path. In the last year, Ambassador \n     Crocker and General Allen, working with our Afghan and NATO \n     partners, successfully negotiated a Strategic Partnership \n     Agreement. If properly implemented, this Agreement could be \n     the ultimate guarantee that Al-Qaeda and the Taliban will \n     never again control Afghanistan. For this, and for so much \n     else in his long and distinguished career, Ryan Crocker \n     deserves the respect, gratitude, and admiration of all \n     Americans. We will miss him greatly, and look forward to \n     welcoming him back home to the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/23/senate-section/article/S3511-3", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING STEPHEN DAGGETT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I was deeply saddened to learn of the \nsudden death on April 17 of Stephen Daggett, a highly respected defense \nexpert at the Congressional Research Service and an authority on the \nU.S. defense budget.\n  Mr. Daggett provided Congress with authoritative analysis on many \naspects of defense spending in the overall context of defense policy \nand U.S. national security strategy. His briefs to Members of Congress \nand his written reports captured the complexity of issues ranging from \nthe Department of Defense's Quadrennial Defense Review to the budget \npriorities of the Armed Services.\n  Very few ``defense experts'' could do what he could do. Mr. Daggett \nwas admired by his professional colleagues in CRS and earned many \nawards for his dedication and outstanding performance. His appraisals \nwere sought-after by Members of Congress and their staffs, by others in \nthe Department of Defense, and by industry. Mr. Daggett's particular \ninterest in providing an unbiased, unvarnished assessment to diverse \nconstituencies, especially outside Congress, was laudable.\n  In an era of wide political gulfs, he supplied irrefutable ground \ntruths--which often became the basis for common understanding and \nproblem solving. His accounts of the interrelated nature of defense \npolicy, strategy, and budgets continue to be the standards of the \ndiscipline. Thought leaders on and off the Hill, in industry, \nassociations and think tanks, on the right and the left, will feel his \nabsence.\n  Mr. Daggett was a national asset who provided the Congress with \ninvaluable expertise on defense issues for over 20 years and during \nthree U.S. wars. He will be sorely missed by his professional \ncolleagues and friends, by his wife, Diana, his sons Thomas and Sam, \nand by the many in Congress who depended on him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/23/senate-section/article/S3511-4", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3511-S3512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JAMES HANLON\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize Mr. James A. \nHanlon, who is retiring this month after nearly 40 years of Federal \nservice at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n  Jim has spent his long and distinguished career at EPA focusing on \nwater quality issues and helping States and communities comply with \nFederal clean water requirements. He began his career at EPA as a staff \nengineer in September 1972, 1 month prior to the passage of the Clean \nWater Act, and has served in a number of senior positions within the \nOffice of Water and Office of Research and Development.\n  Although he has many accomplishments, I want to particularly \nacknowledge Jim's role in managing the Clean Water State Revolving Fund \nProgram, a program that has been so important to my home State of Rhode \nIsland.\n  Jim was there at the program's inception, working for several years \nto design and lead the implementation of the program after it was first \ncreated by Congress in 1987. A decade ago, he was appointed Director of \nthe Office of Wastewater Management, where he has continued to manage \nthe Clean Water State Revolving Fund Program and to oversee EPA's \nbroader wastewater regulatory portfolio. Thanks in large part to his \nleadership, the Clean Water State Revolving Fund Program has \nsuccessfully provided more than $90 billion nationwide to date to fund \ncritical\n\n[[Page S3512]]\n\nwater infrastructure improvements through Federal grants and \ncontributions from State matching funds and leveraging.\n  For the past several years, Jim has also served as an important \nresource to the Senate Committee on Appropriations on wastewater policy \nissues. I am particularly grateful for the assistance he provided to \nimplement the critical $4 billion investment in wastewater projects \nincluded in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. With Jim's \nguidance, EPA and the States worked to get an unprecedented 1,870 clean \nwater projects under contract within a year of the law's passage, \nincluding ten in my home State. His experience and guidance will be \nmissed.\n  I congratulate Jim on a job well done. He leaves a proud and enduring \nlegacy of public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/23/senate-section/article/S3512-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             TRIBUTE TO REAR ADMIRAL CHRISTOPHER C. COLVIN\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a friend \nof Alaska for his extraordinary 34 years of service to the U.S. Coast \nGuard and our Nation. In Alaska, we know him best for his service as \nthe commander of the Coast Guard 17th District, but he has served \nvaliantly across our Nation throughout his long and distinguished \ncareer. On June 1, he will retire as the deputy commander of the Coast \nGuard's Pacific Area Command in Alameda, CA.\n  Rear Admiral Colvin is a native of Erie, PA. He graduated from the \nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1976 with a bachelor of \narts degree in political science and entered Coast Guard Officer \nCandidate School in November 1978, earning his commission in March \n1979. His 34-year Coast Guard career has included a variety of \noperational and staff assignments on both coasts. He served aboard \neight Coast Guard cutters and commanded three. In 2003 he commanded \nCoast Guard Cutter DALLAS, WHEC 716, while attached to the USS Truman/\nUSS Roosevelt battle force conducting combat operations during the \nfirst 6 months of Operation Iraqi Freedom. In 2004, Rear Admiral Colvin \nserved as commander of Coast Guard forces off Haiti and as the maritime \ncomponent commander to Joint Task Force Haiti, helping prevent a mass \nmigration and preserving order in Port au Prince Harbor following the \nunexpected departure of former Haitian President Aristide. He is a 1999 \ngraduate of the Naval War College in Newport, RI, earning a master of \narts degree in national security and strategic studies. His staff \nexpertise is in cutter management, operations, strategy, and readiness. \nHe has enforced U.S. sovereignty in the maritime arena by interdicting \nillegal drugs, detaining illegal migrants, seizing foreign fishing \nvessels, and saving lives.\n  Rear Admiral Colvin's first flag assignment was as the deputy \ndirector of operations for U.S. Northern Command in Colorado Springs, \nCO. From there he was assigned as the commander of the 17th Coast Guard \nDistrict in Juneau, AK, from 2009 to 2011, when he was responsible for \nCoast Guard operations throughout Alaska and the U.S. Arctic. He \ncurrently serves as the deputy commander of the Coast Guard's Pacific \nArea Command in Alameda, CA. His many notable accomplishments from his \ncurrent assignment include coordinating USCGC HEALY's historic 2011 to \n2012 icebreaking mission to mitigate a critical fuel shortage in the \ncity of Nome, AK.\n  Rear Admiral Colvin married his wife Kristin in 1985, and they have \ntwo children. Their son Mark is a high school freshman and their \ndaughter Meagan is a student at the University of Central Florida. Rear \nAdmiral Colvin's parents are Dr. Charles and Evelyn Colvin of Erie, PA.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the State of Alaska, I ask my \ndistinguished colleagues to join me in recognizing Rear Admiral \nColvin's exceptional career. We owe him a debt of gratitude for his \ncommitment to the Coast Guard and to our Nation. We wish him well in \nhis retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/23/senate-section/article/S3512-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMMENDING MISSISSIPPI LEVEE BOARDS\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, a year ago my State of Mississippi \nsuffered one of the worst disasters in our history when the Mississippi \nRiver and its tributaries were confronted with record flood levels that \nthreatened the well-being of residents and property over much of our \nState. The 2011 flood put our people and flood control structures to \nthe test. Federal, State, and local entities worked heroically to \nprevent this disaster from becoming an outright catastrophe. I would \nlike to especially commend the Mississippi Levee Board and the Yazoo-\nMississippi Delta Levee Board for their impressive leadership during \nthe flood and for taking the necessary actions to protect our \npopulation and to limit flood damage.\n  The Mississippi Levee Board is responsible for operating and \nmaintaining a roughly 212-mile levee system along the river, as well as \n360 miles of interior drainage streams. The Yazoo-Mississippi Delta \nLevee Board maintains 98 miles of mainline levees and 18 miles of \nbackwater levees. Each board has worked efficiently and effectively \nwith the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to reduce the threat of high \nwater and flood damage.\n  The great flood of 2011 reminded us of the importance of diligence, \npreparation, and cooperation to ensure that our levees remain strong \nand that the lives and property in our State are protected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/23/senate-section/article/S3512-3", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EDGELEY, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to honor a thriving \ncommunity in North Dakota that will soon be celebrating its 125th \nanniversary. On June 15 through June 17 of this year, the residents of \nEdgeley will be celebrating their community's history and founding.\n  Replacing the pioneer settlement of Saint George, the city of Edgeley \nhas had a rich history. Edgeley is named after the birthplace of \nEnglishman Richard Sykes, who was a significant developer and true \nbeliever in the potential of Edgeley and the surrounding area. In 1881, \nMr. Sykes traveled from England to explore increasing his land holdings \nin America. Not surprisingly, he settled on the rich soil and beautiful \ncountry of Wells, Stutsman, LaMoure, and Morton counties in North \nDakota.\n  Edgeley is home to many bustling small businesses and farmers who \ngrow wheat, corn, soybeans, sunflowers, barley, oats, potatoes, and all \nmanner of small grains, in addition to raising cattle and other types \nof livestock. North Dakota's first wind farm was built 8 miles west of \nEdgeley, providing 1.5 megawatts of sustainable electricity to many \nresidents of the State.\n  Sponsored by the Edgeley Lions Club, the city is celebrating its \n125th anniversary this summer. Among the events planned are a pageant, \nkids games on Main Street, a 5k run-walk, a golf tournament, two \nparades, and a commemorative gun raffle. Residents are also eagerly \nawaiting the grand opening of the new swimming pool.\n  I ask the United States Senate to join me in congratulating Edgeley, \nND, and its residents on their 125th anniversary and in wishing them a \nwarm future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/23/senate-section/article/S3512-4", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3512-S3513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BALTA, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to honor a vibrant \ncommunity in North Dakota that will soon celebrate its 100th \nanniversary. From June 15 through June 17 of this year, the residents \nof Balta will commemorate their community's history and founding.\n  Originally named Egan when the town was founded in 1912, its rail \nstation was an important spot on the Soo Line Railroad. However, when \nit was discovered that a rail station in South Dakota had already \nclaimed the name of Egan, the small village changed its name to Balta \nwhen the post office opened on February 6, 1913. This new name was \ntaken from a town in southern Russia, which is not surprising \nconsidering the heritage of the settlers, who were mostly Germans from \nRussia. Balta enjoys a reputation for some of the best duck and deer \nhunting in the State, and the community especially enjoys boating, \nswimming, and fishing at the Balta Dam Recreation Area.\n  The citizens of Balta are proud of their accomplishments and will \ncelebrate the town's centennial with a\n\n[[Page S3513]]\n\nnumber of activities and hold an all-school reunion. Among the planned \nfestivities are a ``Dam Fun Run'' at Balta Dam, an alumni basketball \ngame, a parade, car show, street fair, pedal tractor pull, beer garden, \nand street dance. The activities should prove to be entertaining for \nall and a celebration of both the past and future of the town.\n  I ask the United States Senate to join me in congratulating the \nresidents of Balta, ND, on their 100th anniversary and in wishing them \na bright future. Growing up in Balta has shaped many generations of \nNorth Dakotans and instilled in them the ``North Dakota Way,'' bringing \npride not only to North Dakota, but to our great Nation. This fine \ncommunity is deserving of our recognition.\n  Balta has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/23/senate-section/article/S3513-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECOGNIZING NEXSTRAPS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, each year on the last Monday in May \nwe, as a nation, remember those who gave their lives while serving in \nthe U.S. Armed Forces. Memorial Day is a chance to honor those who \nprotect our freedom, giving others the opportunity to pursue the \nAmerican dream. And it is our veteran entrepreneurs who know the \nsacrifices and struggles both of military service and of pursuing that \ndream firsthand. Today I rise to recognize and commend a family and \nveteran-owned small business that embodies the American entrepreneurial \nspirit, Nexstraps located in Blue Hill, ME.\n  For those who have had the pleasure to visit my home State, they know \nthat it is blessed with an abundance of natural beauty. From the rugged \nwilderness of Mount Katahdin at the northern terminus of the \nAppalachian Trail, to the picturesque rivers and expansive forests, to \nthe shores of Acadia National Park, Maine's beauty is derived from the \nphysical splendor of the land. Moreover, Maine's great outdoors \ndelivers a wealth of activities throughout every season. That is why \nJeff and Kate Wright, who share a love of nature and believe life \nshould be lived actively, outdoors, founded Nexstraps in 2007 based on \nthose principles. Together with their family, they pursued a business \nplan and way of life that harmoniously marries their love of nature \nwith creative and practical problem-solving products designed with an \nactive lifestyle in mind.\n  In starting Nexstraps, necessity truly was the mother of creation. \nJeff, a former Reconnaissance Marine and Navy Seal with tours of duty \nin Iraq and Afghanistan, was confronted with the simple challenge of \nholding on to his glasses during daily operations. With the goal of \nremedying this problem, Jeff and Kate endeavored to design and \nmanufacture a solution. Unlike a conventional sports glasses strap that \nmerely connects the two eyewear legs with a band behind the head, the \nNexstrap secures the glasses with a single band which serves as a \ntether looping from the legs of the frame, around the front of the \nneck, and meeting at a point behind the head. This unique design \nensures that should the glasses become displaced over the head, they \nwill remain leashed around the wearer's neck. The strap can further be \nlooped through a baseball cap, securing the hat as well. Handmade from \nneoprene, the Nexstrap is designed to withstand whatever challenge the \nextreme sportsman can throw at it, whether that is rock climbing, \nsnowboarding, or base-jumping. They even float! This problem solving \ninnovation is a perfect example of the ingenuity that is characteristic \nof Maine entrepreneurs.\n  I applaud Nexstraps for demonstrating the epitome of Maine innovation \nand entrepreneurship. The Wrights' creativity and can-do attitude is \ntruly a reflection of the talent and entrepreneurial spirit found in my \nhome State of Maine. As we pay tribute to our servicemembers this \ncoming Memorial Day, I offer my gratitude and congratulations to our \nNation's veteran-owned small business and extend my best wishes to Jeff \nand Kate Wright at Nexstraps for their continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/23/senate-section/article/S3513-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bills were read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 3220.

A bill to require the United States Trade Representative to \nprovide documents relating to trade negotiations to Members of Congress \nand their staff upon request, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, right now, the Obama Administration is in \nthe process of negotiating what might prove to be the most far-reaching \neconomic agreement since the World Trade Organization was established \nnearly twenty years ago.\n  The goal of this agreement--known as the Trans Pacific Partnership, \nTPP--is to economically bind together the economies of the Asia \nPacific. It involves countries ranging from Australia, Singapore, \nVietnam, Peru, Chile and the United States and holds the potential to \ninclude many more countries, like Japan, Korea, Canada, and Mexico. If \nsuccessful, the agreement will set norms for the trade of goods and \nservices and includes disciplines related to intellectual property, \naccess to medicines, Internet governance, investment, government \nprocurement, worker rights and environmental standards.\n  If agreed to, TPP will set the tone for our nation's economic future \nfor years to come, impacting the way Congress intervenes and acts on \nbehalf of the American people it represents.\n  It may be the U.S. Trade Representative's, USTR, current job to \nnegotiate trade agreements on behalf of the United States, but Article \n1 Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress--not the USTR or \nany other member of the Executive Branch--the responsibility of \nregulating foreign commerce. It was our Founding Fathers' intention to \nensure that the laws and policies that govern the American people take \ninto account the interests of all the American people, not just a \nprivileged few.\n  Yet, the majority of Congress is being kept in the dark as to the \nsubstance of the TPP negotiations, while representatives of U.S. \ncorporations--like Halliburton, Chevron, PHRMA, Comcast, and the Motion \nPicture Association of America--are being consulted and made privy to \ndetails of the agreement. As the Office of the USTR will tell you, the \nPresident gives it broad power to keep information about the trade \npolicies it advances and negotiates, secret. Let me tell you, the USTR \nis making full use of this authority.\n  As the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee's Subcommittee on \nInternational Trade, Customs, and Global Competitiveness, my office is \nresponsible for conducting oversight over the USTR and trade \nnegotiations. To do that, I asked that my staff obtain the proper \nsecurity credentials to view the information that USTR keeps \nconfidential and secret. This is material that fully describes what the\n\n[[Page S3518]]\n\nUSTR is seeking in the TPP talks on behalf of the American people and \non behalf of Congress. More than two months after receiving the proper \nsecurity credentials, my staff is still barred from viewing the details \nof the proposals that USTR is advancing.\n  We hear that the process by which TPP is being negotiated has been a \nmodel of transparency. I disagree with that statement. And not just \nbecause the Staff Director of the Senate subcommittee responsible for \noversight of international trade continues to be denied access to \nsubstantive and detailed information that pertains to the TPP talks.\n  Congress passed legislation in 2002 to form the Congressional \nOversight Group, or COG, to foster more USTR consultation with \nCongress. I was a senator in 2002. I voted for that law and I can tell \nyou the intention of that law was to ensure that USTR consulted with \nmore Members of Congress not less.\n  In trying to get to the bottom of why my staff is being denied \ninformation, it seems that some in the Executive Branch may be \ninterpreting the law that established the COG to mean that only the few \nMembers of Congress who belong to the COG can be given access to trade \nnegotiation information, while every other Member of Congress, and \ntheir staff, must be denied such access. So, this is not just a \nquestion of whether or not cleared staff should have access to \ninformation about the TPP talks, this is a question of whether or not \nthe administration believes that most Members of Congress can or should \nhave a say in trade negotiations.\n  Again, having voted for that law, I strongly disagree with such an \ninterpretation and find it offensive that some would suggest that a law \nmeant to foster more consultation with Congress is intended to limit \nit. But given that the TPP negotiations are currently underway and I--\nand the vast majority of my colleagues and their staff--continue to be \ndenied a full understanding of what the USTR is seeking in the \nagreement, we do not have time to waste on a protracted legal battle \nover this issue. Therefore, I am introducing legislation to clarify the \nintent of the COG statute.\n  The legislation, I propose, is straightforward. It gives all Members \nof Congress and staff with appropriate clearance access to the \nsubstance of trade negotiations. Finally, Members of Congress who are \nresponsible for conducting oversight over the enforcement of trade \nagreements will be provided information by the Executive Branch \nindicating whether our trading partners are living up to their trade \nobligations. Put simply, this legislation would ensure that the \nrepresentatives elected by the American people are afforded the same \nlevel of influence over our nation's policies as the paid \nrepresentatives of PHRMA, Halliburton and the Motion Picture \nAssociation.\n  My intent is to do everything I can to see that this legislation is \nadvanced quickly and becomes law, so that elected Members of Congress \ncan do what the Constitution requires and what their constituents \nexpect.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \n        Cardin, Mr. Wyden, and Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 3231. A bill to provide for the issuance and sale of a semipostal \nby the United States Postal Service to support effective programs \ntargeted at improving permanency outcomes for youth in foster care; to \nthe Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as we recognize May as National Foster Care \nMonth, we should take a minute to think about what foster care means \nfor children in America. We currently have over 408,000 children in our \nfoster care system due to abuse or neglect by their biological \nfamilies, with 107,000 as eligible for adoption. Every year nearly \n28,000 of these children age out of our foster care system with no \nplace to call home. On average, foster children spend over 3 years in \nthe system and around 16 percent languish in the foster care system for \nover 5 years. These numbers are a stark reminder that we must do more \nto connect children in our foster care system with a safe, loving, and \npermanent home.\n  I have worked with my colleague Senator Grassley on a bipartisan bill \nthat will provide supplemental funds to programs that directly impact \nchildren in our foster care system. The Families for Foster Youth Stamp \nAct will provide additional funding for the Court Improvement Program \nand the Adoption Opportunities Program by giving an easy option for \nindividuals to pay a few cents more for their postage stamps if they \nchoose to.\n  By providing a boost in resources to the Court Improvement Program, \nstates can enhance their capacity to serve children in the system, \nbuild upon best practices, and improve the quality of representation \nour children receive. Funds going to the Adoption Opportunities Program \nwill support programs that target improvement in permanency outcomes \nfor youth in foster care through adoption, guardianship, or kinship \ncare. We know that youth who are served by effective programs targeting \npermanent placement options have shown to be more likely to find a \nforever family than the national average. No teenager should exit our \nfoster care system alone, facing possible homelessness and without the \ntype of support system that only a family can provide. The Families for \nFoster Youth Stamp Act provides a unique funding option to supplement \nprograms that make a real and tangible difference in the lives of our \nmost at-risk children.\n  A number of organizations are supportive of this bill, including the \nAmerican Professional Society on the Abuse of Children, Children's \nAction Network, Children's Advocacy Institute, Child Welfare League of \nAmerica, First Focus Campaign for Children, Foster Club, National \nAssociation of Council for Children, National Children's Alliance, \nNational Council for Adoption, Northwest Adoption Exchange, The \nAdoption Exchange, and Voice for Adoption.\n  I would like to recognize Senators Grassley, Landrieu, Cardin, Wyden, \nand Cochran as original cosponsors of this bill. I look forward to \ncontinued progress in developing a more effective child welfare system \nand ask all of my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CASEY (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 3233. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the \nenforcement of employment and reemployment rights of members of the \nuniformed services, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n\n\n              Servicemembers Access to Justice Act of 2012\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, the brave men and women serving our country \nin the military, the National Guard and the Reserves have sacrificed \ntime away from their families, jobs and lives throughout Operation \nEnduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Even upon their safe \nreturn, many of these men and women suffer physical, personal, and \nfinancial effects from their deployment and time in combat. This is \ncompounded when our servicemembers return home from their deployment or \nservice to find that their employers will not promptly reinstate them \nin their civilian jobs, as required by the Uniformed Services \nEmployment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, USERRA. Although USERRA \nshould protect servicemembers against this type of discrimination, the \nprocess for filing a complaint can be unwieldy and expensive. No single \nFederal agency has oversight over this process, and investigations can \ndrag on for months, including while servicemembers are deployed \noverseas. Our military personnel and their families should not be \nburdened by this additional stress and financial strain.\n  Pennsylvania has the nation's largest Army National Guard and fourth-\nlargest Air National Guard. We owe it to these brave men and women to \nrenew America's social commitment to the National Guard and Reserve, \nand to update National Guard and Reserve programs and benefits to \nreflect the operation tempo of their service. This is why I am today \nreintroducing the Servicemembers Access to Justice Act, which would \neliminate loopholes and strengthen protections in the current law. \nFurthermore, this bill would bring a newfound clarity and understanding \nof the law for courts and employers.\n\n[[Page S3519]]\n\n  The Servicemembers Access to Justice Act makes it easier for our \nservicemembers to fight for their USERRA rights in court if their \nemployer requires them to relinquish them in order to be hired for or \nkeep their job.

Mr. President, I am proud to submit a resolution today to \ndesignate Saturday, July 28, 2012 as National Day of the American \nCowboy. My late colleague, Senator Craig Thomas, began the tradition of \nhonoring the men and women known as ``cowboys'' seven years ago when he \nintroduced the first resolution to designate the fourth Saturday of \nJuly as National Day of the American Cowboy. I am proud to carry on \nSenator Thomas's tradition.\n  The resolution celebrates the history of cowboys in America and \nrecognizes the important work today's cowboys are doing in the United \nStates. The cowboy Spirit is about honesty, integrity, courage, and \npatriotism, and cowboys are models of strong character, sound family \nvalues, and good common sense. The first cowboys relied on hard work \nand persistence to make their living in a tough country. Today's \ncowboys haven't changed all that much from the first wranglers and \nranch hands who started herding cattle on the Great Plains.\n  Cowboys continue to make important contributions to our economy, \nWestern culture and my home State of Wyoming today. They live and work \nin every State to manage nearly 100 million cattle. Cowboys work hard, \nbut they also play hard. Rodeo is a sport that tests skill with a rope \nor challenges a cowboy's ability to stay on the back of bucking rough \nstock for 8 long seconds. Rodeos across the nation draw millions of \nfans every year.\n  This year's resolution designates July 28, 2012, as the National Day \nof the American Cowboy. I look forward to celebrating this day, and I \nhope my colleagues will join me in recognizing the important role \ncowboys play in our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/23/senate-section/article/S3519-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 471--COMMENDING THE EFFORTS OF THE WOMEN OF THE \nAMERICAN RED CROSS CLUBMOBILES FOR EXEMPLARY SERVICE DURING THE SECOND \n                               WORLD WAR\n\n  Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Nelson of \nFlorida, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Pryor, Mrs. Hutchison, \nMs. Landrieu, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Boxer, and Mrs. Feinstein) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) Americans unjustly pay up to 5 times more to fill their \n     prescriptions than consumers in other countries;\n       (2) the United States is the largest market for \n     pharmaceuticals in the world, yet American consumers pay the \n     highest prices for brand pharmaceuticals in the world;\n       (3) a prescription drug is neither safe nor effective to an \n     individual who cannot afford it;\n       (4) allowing and structuring the importation of \n     prescription drugs to ensure access to safe and affordable \n     drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration will \n     provide a level of safety to American consumers that they do \n     not currently enjoy;\n       (5) Americans spend more than $200,000,000,000 on \n     prescription drugs every year;\n       (6) the Congressional Budget Office has found that the cost \n     of prescription drugs are between 35 to 55 percent less in \n     other highly-developed countries than in the United States; \n     and\n       (7) promoting competitive market pricing would both \n     contribute to health care savings and allow greater access to \n     therapy, improving health and saving lives.\n\n     SEC. 1203.
