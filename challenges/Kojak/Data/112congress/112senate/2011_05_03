Madam President, following any leader remarks, the Senate \nwill be in a period of morning business until 5 p.m. this evening. The \nRepublicans will control the first 30 minutes, the majority will \ncontrol the next 30 minutes.\n  The Senate will recess from 12:30 to 2:15 to allow for our weekly \ncaucus meetings. We expect to have a rollcall vote this afternoon on \nthe adoption of the resolution commending our Armed Forces and the \nintelligence community regarding the death of bin Laden. Senators will \nbe notified when that vote is scheduled.\n  Additionally, there is a Senators-only briefing today--it is \nclassified--on the U.S. operation that killed Osama bin Laden. That \nwill be at 5 p.m. today in the Visitor Center.\n  CIA Director Leon Panetta will be there; Vice Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff James Cartwright will be there; National Counter \nTerrorism Center Director Michael Leiter will be there; and Deputy \nSecretary of State James Steinberg.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Last night I filed cloture on the small business jobs bill, S. 493. \nSenators should expect a cloture vote to occur tomorrow morning. I ask \nunanimous consent that the filing deadline for all first-degree \namendments be at 2:30 p.m. today for S. 493.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Additionally, I also filed cloture on the nomination of \nJohn McConnell of Rhode Island to be a district judge for the District \nof Rhode Island. This vote may also occur tomorrow morning.\n\n\n                               SBIR/STTR\n\n  The bill before this body today, the small business innovation bill, \nis the latest in a series of bills we have written to help small \nbusinesses grow. It supports a research and development program--the \nSmall Business Innovation Research Program--that has helped tens of \nthousands of small businesses create jobs and shape the future.\n  This bill is an adaptation of the bill that President Reagan created \n30 years ago. It is a continuation of that program. It has been proven \nthat these investments work. It helped get great new ideas off the \nground. For example, the electric toothbrush was invented with a small \nbusiness grant, the satellite antenna that helped our first responders \nin Haiti, to technologies that keep our food safe and our military \ntanks from overheating in the desert. These are all the result of what \nthis legislation has done over the years. There are success stories in \nvirtually every State and nearly every industry.\n  Before the recess, we spent days working on an agreement to have \nvotes on three amendments on this bill so we could move forward and \nfinally pass it. We have voted on many amendments. This legislation \nstarted on March 10. It is now the first part of May. We have had some \nbreaks in time because of our going back to our States, but there is no \nexcuse for not completing this important legislation.\n  Every time we get one problem taken care of another Republican raises \ntheir head. The latest is Senator Snowe. Of all people who should \nunderstand the importance of small business, it is the Senator from \nMaine, who was at one\n\n[[Page S2590]]\n\ntime chairman of the Small Business Committee. Yet she has been \nunmoving in wanting a vote on a piece of legislation that has not even \nhad a hearing.\n  The chairman of the Small Business Committee said she is happy to \nwork with Senator Snowe. Senator Landrieu said she will work with her \nto hold hearings, whatever is appropriate. But it is unfair that we \nhave not been able to move forward on this bill.\n  As I indicated, we spent days before the recess working on an \nagreement to have votes on amendments to move this bill forward. \nIncluded in this agreement were Senator Cornyn's amendment, which would \nestablish a commission on government waste, and Senator Hutchison's \namendment, which related to health care reform litigation. This \nagreement was objected to by Senator Snowe while everyone else in the \nSenate has signed off on it.\n  During the course of many weeks debating this bill, we have made \nsignificant efforts to accommodate Senator Snowe and the rest of the \nRepublican caucus on amendments. She has had one. We voted on it \nalready. We even had a vote, as indicated, on an amendment offered by \nSenator Snowe, as well as many other Republican amendments, nearly \nevery one of which had nothing to do with the underlying legislation. \nThey were not relevant. They were not germane.\n  In light of our accommodation of extraneous amendments, it is \ndifficult for me to understand why we cannot finish debate on this \nbill. We have been more than fair. We should be able to reach agreement \non considering the remaining amendments and voting on final passage. I \nhope that my friends on the other side of the aisle would recognize how \nunfair it is that one Senator would hold up this legislation.\n  There are amendments pending, I repeat, that are not germane or \nrelevant to this piece of legislation. We are willing to take votes on \nthose. It would seem to me that Senators such as Cornyn and Hutchison, \nwho have worked hard to get votes, should vote with us on our ability \nto move forward on this legislation. We should be able to get this \ndone. It is the right thing for the country. It appears that we are not \ngoing to be able to do that. So I had no choice but to file cloture in \norder to bring this debate to a close. That is what I did last night.\n  If this job-producing legislation is not passed, there is only one \nproblem with it: the Republicans on the other side of the aisle. It is \nunfair that we have worked so hard to get this important piece of \nlegislation done, and because of one Senator it is not going to happen. \nI hope that is wrong. I hope my prediction is wrong. This has been on \nthe Senate floor for far too long. We need to resolve it so we can move \nto other matters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/03/senate-section/article/S2590-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise today to talk about a piece of \nlegislation which will be both a bill that Senator Graham and Senator \nDeMint and I will introduce tomorrow and an amendment that I have filed \nto the small business bill on behalf of the three of us.\n  We are calling it the Right to Work Protection Act, and it is our \nintent to preserve the right of each State to make a decision for \nitself about whether it will have a right-to-work law and have an \nability to enforce it. This is in direct response to an action that the \nNational Labor Relations Board has taken against the Boeing Company and \nthe plant they are building in South Carolina.\n  The National Labor Relations Board has moved to stop Boeing from \nbuilding airplanes at a nonunion plant in South Carolina, suggesting \nthat a unionized American company cannot expand its operations into one \nof 22 States with right-to-work laws. These laws protect a worker's \nright to join or not to join a union. In fact, the New Hampshire \nLegislature has just approved its becoming the 23rd such State.\n  This reminds me, this action by the National Labor Relations Board \nreminds me of a White House dinner in February 1979 when I was Governor \nof Tennessee. The occupant of the chair has been to those dinners. The \nPresident has them every year. The only ones invited are the Governors \nthemselves and spouses. For me, it was always one of the highlights of \nthe year.\n  So my first such dinner was with President Carter in 1979. As a new \nGovernor, I was paying close attention to what the President of the \nUnited States had to say. This is what he said:\n\n       Governors, go to Japan. Persuade them to make here what \n     they sell here.\n\n  I walked 1,000 miles across Tennessee to be Governor the year before, \nand I don't remember one single Tennessean who said to me: Lamar, the \nfirst thing you do when you get in office is go to Japan. That was not \non our minds. But it was tough economic times. Not many people were \ninvesting anywhere in the United States at that time. I thought, Well, \nif the President of the United States says, Governors, go to Japan and \npersuade them to make here what they sell here, I should do that.\n  ``Make here what they sell here'' was then the union battle cry. It \nwas part of an effort to slow the tide of Japanese cars and trucks \nentering the U.S. market. At that time, Americans were very worried \nabout Japan. There were books about Japan being No. 1, and the fear was \nthat Japan would overwhelm us economically. Cars and trucks from Japan \nwere fuel efficient, they were attractive, they were selling, and \nmanufacturers and the United Auto Workers here were concerned that we \nwould lose a lot of jobs. So the cry was to the Japanese: If you are \ngoing to sell it in the United States, you need to make it in the \nUnited States.\n  So off I went to Tokyo to meet with the Nissan executives who were \nthen deciding where to put their first U.S. manufacturing plant. At \nthat time, Japan had very few manufacturing plants in the United \nStates. They made there what they sold here. I carried with me on that \ntrip a photograph taken at night from a satellite showing the country \nwith all of its lights on. Try to visualize that. Because what you see \nif you look at a photograph of the United States at night are a lot of \nlights east of the Mississippi River, but it is pretty dark almost \nuntil you get to California, and there are a lot of lights down around \nTexas. I was trying to make a point. The Japanese executives, who \ndidn't know very much about Tennessee and I didn't know very much about \nJapan, would say to me, Where is Tennessee? I would point to our State \nand say, We are right in the middle of the lights.\n  My argument, of course, was that locating a plant in the population \ncenter of the United States would reduce the cost of transporting cars \nto customers. That population center 70 or 80 years ago was in the \nMidwest where the American automobile was literally invented, and it \nmade a lot of sense to build almost all the plants there, because \ntransportation costs were less when you send these heavy cars and \ntrucks to the customers. So you locate your plant near the population \ncenter. Gradually, that population center migrated south from the \nMidwest, where most U.S. plants have been, to Kentucky and Tennessee.\n  Then the Japanese to whom I was talking examined a second \nconsideration: Tennessee has a right-to-work law and Kentucky does not. \nThat meant that in Kentucky, workers would have to join the United Auto \nWorkers Union. Workers in Tennessee had a choice. In 1980, Nissan chose \nTennessee, then a State with almost no auto jobs. Today, auto assembly \nplants and suppliers provide one-third of our State's manufacturing \njobs. Tennessee\n\n[[Page S2591]]\n\nis home for the production of the Leaf, Nissan's all-electric vehicle, \nand the batteries that power them. I am happy to report it works well. \nI have bought one, parked in the garage of the apartment where I live \nhere. Recently Nissan announced that 85 percent of the cars and trucks \nit sells in the United States will be made in the United States, making \nit one of the largest so-called ``American'' auto companies and nearly \nfulfilling Mr. Carter's request of 30 years ago.\n  But now unions want to make it illegal for a company that has \nexperienced repeated strikes to move production to a State with a \nright-to-work law. What would this mean for the future of American auto \njobs? Jobs would flee overseas as manufacturers look for a competitive \nenvironment in which to make and sell cars around the world.\n  It has happened before. David Halberstam's 1986 book ``The \nReckoning''--about the decline of the domestic American auto industry--\ntells the story. Halberstam quotes American Motors president George \nRomney who criticized the ``shared monopoly'' consisting of the Big \nThree Detroit auto manufacturers and the United Auto Workers. Romney \nwarned, ``There is nothing more vulnerable than entrenched success.'' \nDetroit ignored upstarts such as Nissan which in the 1960s began \nselling funny little cars to American customers. We all know what \nhappened to employment in the Big Three companies.\n  Even when Detroit sought greener pastures in a right-to-work State, \nits partnership with the United Auto Workers could not compete. In 1985 \nGeneral Motors located its $5 billion Saturn plant in Spring Hill, TN, \n40 miles from the Nissan plant, hoping side-by-side competition would \nhelp the Americans beat the Japanese. After 25 years, nonunion Nissan \noperated the most efficient plant in North America. The Saturn/UAW \npartnership never made a profit. Last year, GM closed Saturn.\n  Nissan's success is one reason why Volkswagen recently located in \nChattanooga and why Honda, Toyota, BMW, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, \nand thousands of suppliers have chosen southeastern right-to-work \nStates for their plants. Under right-to-work laws, employees may join \nunions, but mostly they have declined. Three times workers at the \nNissan plant in Smyrna, TN, rejected organizing themselves like Saturn \nemployees a few miles away.\n  Our goal should be to make it easier and cheaper to create private-\nsector jobs in this country. Giving workers the right to join or not to \njoin a union helps to create a competitive environment in which more \nmanufacturers such as Nissan can make here 85 percent of what they sell \nhere.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the amendment and bill that I and Senator Graham and Senator \nDeMint will be introducing tomorrow and which we filed as an amendment \ntoday.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. PROTECTION OF RIGHT TO WORK.\n\n       (a) Applicability of NLRA to State Right to Work Laws.--\n     Section 14 of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. \n     164) is amended by striking subsection (b) and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(b) Nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit the \n     application of any State law that prohibits, or otherwise \n     places restraints upon, agreements between labor \n     organizations and employers that make membership in the labor \n     organization, or that require the payment of dues or fees to \n     such organization, a condition of employment either before or \n     after hiring.''.\n       (b) Applicability of Railway Labor Act to State Right to \n     Work Laws.--Title II of the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. 181 \n     et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 209. EFFECT ON STATE RIGHT TO WORK LAWS.\n\n       ``Nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit the \n     application of any State law that prohibits, or otherwise \n     places restraints upon, agreements between labor \n     organizations and carriers that make membership in the labor \n     organization, or that require the payment of dues or fees to \n     such organization, a condition of employment either before or \n     after hiring.''.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair. I wish to add that I saw today a \nrepresentative of the Whirlpool Company which has 2,500 employees in \nTennessee. He said Whirlpool makes 82 percent of what they sell in the \nUnited States here in the United States, but that they have a choice. \nThey have plants in Mexico as well. It is one more example of why \nallowing States to have a right-to-work law keeps jobs in our country.\n  I see on the floor Senator DeMint, whose State is directly affected \nby this NLRB decision. He and I are working together on this \nlegislation. I am sure he has comments on the legislation and on the \ndecision of the NLRB.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Thank you, Madam President. I wish to associate myself \nwith the remarks of the Senator from Tennessee. I appreciate him \nbringing this up. It is important for us here in the Senate as well as \neveryone around the country to understand what this administration is \ndoing to hurt jobs in America.\n  This has been a good week for America. We have worked together \nbuilding on a lot of the common principles of our country of a strong \ndefense and a robust intelligence system to track down an enemy of \nfreedom and to render justice as we had promised. This was done over \ntwo administrations and many Congressmen and Senators. So this is a \ngood day for America. I think we need to take this time to maybe think \nabout how we can apply the principles that work in America to our \nchallenges back home with our economy and our jobs and our culture, \nbecause it is a bigger issue we are dealing with in the context of this \ndecision by the National Labor Relations Board. We need to use the \nprinciples that work, but it appears this administration and my \ncolleagues on the other side are afraid to let these principles work. \nThey seem to be afraid of freedom itself.\n  We see in their record over the last 2 years being afraid for \nAmericans to make their own decisions about their children's education \nand about their health care. They are afraid to death of letting senior \ncitizens manage their own retirement funds and health care plans. They \nare certainly afraid to let States manage their own energy resources or \ndecide what roads and bridges to build and where to build them. They \nclearly don't want businesses to make their own decisions about hiring \nand firing. They won't let even community banks make their own \ndecisions about who to lend money to, even though these small banks \nhave nothing to do with the financial collapse. Clearly, from this \ndecision, this administration and the Democratic Party is afraid to \ngive employees--workers--the freedom not to join a union.\n  It is amazing what this National Labor Relations Board, which has \nbeen stacked with union folks by the administration, is doing to jobs \nin our States and all across the country. Twenty-two States have right-\nto-work laws. In the last few months, my State, along with several \nothers, has passed a constitutional amendment that would protect the \nfreedom of workers to have a secret ballot when union bosses are trying \nto organize their workplace. A secret ballot is so fundamental to \nAmerican principles and the principles of freedom, but the AFL-CIO is \nsuing our State and others to stop us from protecting that freedom of \nworkers.\n  In the last few weeks, a truly extraordinary thing has happened, as \nthis National Labor Relations Board has actually filed suit against \nBoeing, which has located a new facility in South Carolina, claiming it \nwas retribution for a strike in Washington. People need to understand \nthat Boeing has added 2,000 jobs in Washington since they decided to \nbuild this new production line in South Carolina. But this \nadministration--and I am afraid the majority here in the Senate--is so \nafraid companies will have the freedom to locate new facilities, new \nbusinesses, in States where their workers are not required to join a \nunion.\n  Let's put this in a different context. A few weeks ago, a delegation \nfrom California went to Texas to try to figure out why hundreds of \nbusinesses are moving from California, taking tax revenue and jobs with \nthem to Texas and other States. They didn't need to make the trip. It \nwas pretty obvious that the business environment that has been created \nin California by the unions and the politicians has made it very \ndifficult for world-class companies\n\n[[Page S2592]]\n\nto be competitive. What takes a few weeks in Texas could take 2 years \nas far as getting a permit to open a new business.\n  This is a small look at what is happening to our country, because we \nneed to look at why so many companies are moving from our country to \nother countries to do business. It is because of decisions such as this \nand decisions by this administration over the last couple of years that \nhave made America a place that is very difficult to do business in.\n  I appreciate what the Senator from Tennessee is doing, because this \nis not just about one employer or one State. Twenty-two States are \nright-to-work States. Twenty-two States have decided they are going to \nprovide the freedom to their workers not to have to join a union. So \nmuch of this is political and retribution, not just against Boeing for \nputting a site in a right-to-work State, but it is political \nretribution. The administration, I believe, is acting like thugs that \none might see in a Third World country, trying to bully and intimidate \nemployers who are trying to get out from under this cloud of union \ncontrol. It is a political deal of this administration trying to expand \nunionization and union benefits because the unions give the \ncontributions to the Democratic Party and get out the vote for the \nDemocrats.\n  This is crazy. In an environment where this administration and all of \nus here are saying we are trying to create jobs, there is no question \nwhat they are doing in South Carolina and around this country by trying \nto force unionization is hurting our business climate in America, it is \nhurting employment, it is diminishing our future as a country, and it \nis all for political purposes.\n  It is amazing to see that the unions have such a control over this \nadministration, even in passing the stimulus bill. With it went \nrequirements that a lot of the contractors who use this money had to \nfollow union rules or be unionized. We saw in the health plan that the \nunions were the big proponent of it, but as soon as it passed, they are \nthe ones asking for waivers so they don't have to live by it.\n  What this administration is doing to one company is a threat to every \ncompany, every employer, and every worker in this country. It goes back \nto their fear of freedom. The command-and-control paranoia we see in \nthis administration is antithetical to everything we understand about \nfreedom in our country--of individual responsibility and individual \nfreedom--and free markets and free enterprise. They are attacking it on \nevery front.\n  This decision by the National Labor Relations Board cannot stand. We \nmust challenge it here in the Congress; employers need to challenge it; \nstates are already challenging it, because it is clearly outside of the \nauthority of this Federal Government to be threatening and bullying and \ntrying to intimidate companies such as Boeing, which should have the \nfreedom to locate their plants anywhere they want. This is \nintimidation. Many of Boeing's contracts are military contracts, and we \nknow that is being held over their head.\n  This is not the way we should do business in America. This is not the \nway our government should operate. We need to get back to those first \nprinciples that made us great. Clearly, what this administration is \ndoing in this case and many others is way outside the realm of what we \nshould expect of a good and decent government, and we are not getting \nit here.\n  With that, Madam President, I see the other Senator from South \nCarolina is here, and I will yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I thank my colleague from South \nCarolina, who has been terrific in trying to bring reason to this \nissue. Senator DeMint has been a very strong voice for free enterprise, \nand that is really what this is all about.\n  To Senator Alexander from Tennessee, thank you for listening to what \nis going on in South Carolina and understanding this is not just about \nour State, it is about the Nation as a whole.\n  The Right to Work Protection Act is a very solid piece of legislation \nthat is going to serve the country as a whole. When a State chooses to \nbe a right-to-work State, what does that mean? That means no one can be \nforced to join a union. The union can ask for your vote. If you say no, \nthat is your decision to make, and if the group says yes, you do not \nhave to join. In a lot of States, that is not true. If 51 percent of \nthe workforce or 60 percent of the workforce says: We are going to go \nunion, everybody else is drafted whether they want to be or not.\n  So the concept of right to work is really at stake here, and I do \nappreciate this legislation because it would preserve the ability of \nthe State to go down that road without suffering at the Federal level. \nIt would prohibit Federal Government contracts, Federal Government \naction from punishing a State that chose to adopt right-to-work laws. \nThat is why Senator Alexander's legislation is so important. We are not \nmaking anyone become a right-to-work State. We are saying: If you \nchoose to do that, your Federal Government in the NLRB and other \norganizations of the Federal Government cannot use that against you. We \nare protecting that status. I think that is the balanced approach to \nthis dilemma we face.\n  Now, what is this dilemma?\n  Boeing is one of the great companies in the world. They have a \nhistory of producing terrific airplanes. They have been located in \nWashington for decades. As a South Carolinian who is very happy Boeing \nhas come to South Carolina, I want to acknowledge the Washington \nworkforce as one of the best in the world. We hope to build great \nairplanes in South Carolina, but the first thing I want to do is \nacknowledge that my complaint or concern is not with the people of \nWashington, not with the workforce in Washington, it is with the \nactions of the NLRB and this complaint filed by the machinists union. \nSo I hope to be in partnership with my colleagues from the State of \nWashington in the Senate and on the House side to pursue good policies \nthat not only will be good for Boeing but for the country as a whole.\n  South Carolina is going to enjoy the status of being a teammate with \nthe people of Washington when it comes to trying to help Boeing and \nmanufacturing in general. But what happened is that in October of 2009, \nBoeing decided to create a second assembly plant in South Carolina. \nThis is a new assembly plant because the orders for the 787 were so \nlarge, it necessitated building a second line. Boeing, under the \ncontract with the machinists union, reserved in that contract the right \nto locate new business wherever they thought it would be best for \nBoeing. They negotiated with the people in Seattle about producing the \nsecond line in Seattle, and they went all over the country looking for \nother locations to create a second line.\n  They came to South Carolina, and I can assure you, after a lot of \nnegotiations, the reason they chose South Carolina was because it was \nthe best business deal for Boeing. They negotiated in Washington. They \nnegotiated everywhere in the country, really, where they thought they \ncould do good business, and South Carolina won out. And there is \ncriticism back home that the package we gave Boeing was too generous. \nSo I can assure you this was a legitimate business deal, and the idea \nthat moving to South Carolina somehow was retaliation that violated the \nNational Labor Relations Act section 883 is legally absurd. Under that \nact, a company cannot retaliate against a group of employees or a \nlocation that decides to unionize.\n  You would have to prove in a retaliation complaint that the people \nsuffered. Well, in this case, not one person in Pugent Sound or in the \nState of Washington lost their job. Because of the additional business \nbeing generated in South Carolina, 2,000 people have been hired in the \nState of Washington. Not one benefit was cut from the workforce in \nWashington. Nobody's pay was cut. Nobody's benefits were reduced \nbecause they moved to South Carolina. So this complaint is just \nfrivolous. It is motivated by all the wrong reasons.\n  Let's just for a moment assume that it is granted and this is the new \nbusiness model. It would mean basically that if you decide to do work \nin a union plant, you are locked into that location forever; you could \nnever move. That is crazy. That is not what the law is all about. The \nlaw prevents retaliation, and that is a specific concept in the law, \nand none of the factors that\n\n[[Page S2593]]\n\nwould lead to that conclusion exist in this case. There is new work. No \none lost a job. This is a new line of business. And we are arguing \nabout the right of a company to be able to make a business decision \nwhen it comes to new production. That is why this complaint, if it ever \ngets to Federal court, will fail. It is sad that Boeing may have to \nspend millions of dollars defending itself against what I think is a \nvery frivolous complaint.\n  But let me tell my colleagues a little bit about this if they are \nwondering about it. Here is something I want to put on the table for \nyou to consider. One of the members of the Boeing board at the time \nthey chose to come to South Carolina--after a lot of negotiations in \ndifferent places, including Washington and South Carolina--one of the \nboard members who approved the second assembly line in South Carolina \nwas Bill Daley, the Chief of Staff of the President of the United \nStates. At the time, he was not Chief of Staff, he was a member of the \nBoeing board, and they voted unanimously to create a second assembly \nplant in the State of South Carolina. I would argue that Mr. Daley, \nwhen he cast that vote, understood it was best for Boeing to make this \ndecision to locate new business, and he did not believe he was \nviolating the law or retaliating against unions. One thing you can say \nabout the Daley family, it is not in their DNA to retaliate against \nunions. This was in 2009.\n  In March 2010, the machinists union filed its complaint with the \nNLRB. Now, the general counsel, the person holding that title a few \nweeks ago, submitted the complaint to the board. But the story is even \nmore interesting. In March of 2010, the complaint was filed by the \nmachinists union. The vote to come to South Carolina was in October \n2009. In January of 2011, Mr. Daley was chosen to be President Obama's \nChief of Staff--a decision I supported and thought was a good decision \nfor the administration and the country as a whole because Mr. Daley is \na Democrat, but he is a very well respected member of the business \ncommunity, someone who has a lot of skill and talent, and the President \nchose wisely. I would assume that in the vetting process they looked at \nMr. Daley's record of involvement in business and other matters. I am \nassuming the vetting team knew the complaint had been filed by the \nmachinists union in March of 2010 and that Mr. Daley voted along with \nthe rest of the members of the board to come to South Carolina. And \nthey must have concluded that this complaint was frivolous. I assume \nthat because if they did not know about the complaint, that was one of \nthe worst vetting jobs in the history of the world. And if they thought \nhe did engage in illegal activity, it made no sense to hire him.\n  So, to my colleagues, I want you to consider the fact that Mr. Daley, \nthe current Chief of Staff, voted to come to South Carolina. After he \nvoted--a year and a half later--he was chosen to be the Chief of Staff \nof the President of the United States. The Boeing CEO, Jim McNerney, \nwas chosen by President Obama to lead his Export Council to create jobs \nfor Americans by looking at export opportunities. I would argue that \nPresident Obama would not have chosen Mr. McNerney if he thought he led \nan effort to retaliate against Washington unions.\n\n  All I can say is this complaint is frivolous. It is taking time and \nmoney away from creating jobs in South Carolina and Washington. And it \nhas national implications. To Senator Alexander, you have found the \nright way for the Congress to address this issue. We are not forcing \nanybody to be a member of a union. We are just saying, if a State such \nas South Carolina or Tennessee chooses to be a right-to-work State, \nthat cannot be held against them. This legislation would say to the \ncountry and the business community as a whole: When you look at where \nto locate, you can consider a right-to-work State without violating the \nlaw. That is an important concept.\n  I can assure you, Boeing came to South Carolina because it was the \nbest business deal. They had a lot of choices. They chose South \nCarolina not to retaliate but to create a second line. And here is the \nlogic of it: Would you put everything you own in one location in \ntoday's world? So the idea that they expanded into the second plant in \na different State, in a different location, makes perfect sense. The \nfact that South Carolina is a low-cost right-to-work State I am sure \nthey considered. But under the law, no one in Washington lost one \nbenefit they had. No one in Washington lost a job they already had with \nBoeing. The goal of this decision by Boeing is to grow their company. \nIf we do well in South Carolina, Boeing does well in Washington.\n  This complaint is dangerous. This complaint is a dangerous road to go \ndown. This complaint is politics at its worst. The law is designed to \nprotect us, and it is being abused, in my view. Politics is about 50 \nplus 1. The law is something that should protect us all.\n  This complaint filed by the general counsel at the NLRB sets a \ndangerous precedent, and the Congress should speak. The administration \nshould speak out and say this is frivolous; they are an independent \nagency; nobody can tell them what to do. But we have an independent \nduty to speak out in a constructive way.\n  Senator Alexander's legislation is the appropriate way to address \nthis issue, and I wish to thank him on behalf of the people of South \nCarolina and the country as a whole, and I look forward to working with \nhim to have this passed.\n  To my colleagues on the other side, what is going on in this \ncomplaint is dangerous for us all and not just South Carolina.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/03/senate-section/article/S2593-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2593-S2595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WORKERS MEMORIAL DAY\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I rise and will be joined in a \nfew moments by Senator Harkin, who is the chair of the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee; Senator Murray, the chair of \nthe Veterans' Committee; and Senator Blumenthal, a new Member of the \nSenate from Connecticut. Each of them, especially Senator Harkin, has \ndevoted their careers to worker rights, worker safety, decent benefits, \npensions--in short, creating the middle class--and their efforts have \nbeen legion, all three of them, in doing that.\n  I rise today to commemorate Workers Memorial Day. Last Thursday, \nApril 28, our Nation observed Workers Memorial Day. It is an occasion \nfor us to pause and remember those Americans who have lost their lives \nwhile on the job.\n  I wear on my lapel a pin given to me at a Workers Memorial Day rally \nin Lorain, OH, a city west of Cleveland on Lake Erie--steel town, \npeople like to call us--and this lapel pin I wear is a picture of a \ncanary in a birdcage. We know that mine workers 100 years ago took a \ncanary down in the mines. If the canary died from lack of oxygen or \ntoxic gas, the mine worker knew he had to get out of the mine. He had \nto depend on himself. He had no union strong enough nor a government \nwhich cared enough to protect him in those days.\n  As we celebrate Workers Memorial Day, we look back at the progress we \nhave made as a country.\n  This year is the 100th anniversary of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory \nfire in New York. That tragedy claimed the lives of 146 workers--123 \nwomen and 23 men--while they labored in sweatshop conditions in this \ntextile plant in New York City. They were mostly young immigrants who \ncame to this country in pursuit of a better life. Instead, they were \nkilled because of the workplace, the incredibly unsafe conditions in \nthat workplace. That tragedy marked a significant turning point in the \nstruggle to advance worker rights and safety in our country. The day \nafter the fire, 15,000 shirtwaist workers walked off the job demanding \na 20-percent pay raise and a 52-hour week--a 52-hour week they were \ndemanding.\n  Nearly 20 years later, in 1930, Ohio experienced its deadliest mining \nexplosion in our history, the Millified mine disaster in Athens County.\n\n  Methane gases were ignited by a short circuit between a trolley wire \nand rail, killing more than 80 men.\n  Four years later, in 1934, thousands of workers stood up to the \nElectric Auto-Lite company in Toledo, OH. Workers recognized they were \nunderpaid and undervalued. They went on strike and clashed with members \nof the\n\n[[Page S2594]]\n\nOhio National Guard. The so-called ``Battle of Toledo,'' unfortunately, \nresulted in over 200 injuries. The strike brought together union \nbrothers and sisters across the city in solidarity, fighting for \nmiddle-class rights.\n  Similar strikes in Minneapolis and San Francisco followed the one in \nToledo that year, generating a new momentum across our country toward \ntreating U.S. workers with respect and dignity. Ultimately, we know \nwhat happened. President Roosevelt's New Deal established critical \nrights and benefits for working Americans. It is why we have a 40-hour \nwork week, why we have a minimum wage, and why we have collective \nbargaining rights.\n  Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act, the Wagner Act, in \n1935, which guaranteed workers the right to form a union and bargain \ncollectively.\n  The Labor Standards Act passed in 1938, which established a minimum \nwage, guaranteed overtime pay in certain jobs, established \nrecordkeeping standards, and created child labor protections.\n  We now have OSHA, which was created by the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Act of 1970, to ensure safe working conditions. It was signed by \na Republican President. In those days, Republicans worked with \nDemocrats to increase worker safety standards and actually help workers \njoin the middle class.\n  When OSHA was established 41 years ago, in 1970, an average of 38 \nworkers died on the job in this country every day. We have cut that by \ntwo-thirds, not just because of OSHA but certainly in large part \nbecause of OSHA. Deaths in the workplace continue but not with the \nfrequency of 100 years ago, or even 50 years ago, prior to OSHA, but \nthey continue.\n  Last week, another mine accident claimed the life of an Ohioan. Jason \nGudat was killed while working at an underground limestone mine in \neastern Ohio, in Salem.\n  This past year, I received a letter from Crystal of Adams County, who \nlost her husband Terry in a construction accident. Terry was the father \nof five. He was killed at his construction job last year due to a lack \nof safety lighting during his nighttime shift. Crystal, his widow, \nexplained that ``the circumstances of his death were completely \npreventable if there had been better safety laws regarding his line of \nwork. There was no lighting where my husband lost his life. . . . You \nnever realize how important these things are until it happens to you.''\n  In the case of garment workers, it was fire safety. In the case of \nmine workers, like Jason, it was unsafe conditions that are too often \nfound in mines. In the case of Terry and other construction workers, it \nwas basic safety lighting.\n  We ask our workers to build our roads, make our cars, produce our \nenergy, and to serve as the backbone of our Nation's economic \ncompetitiveness. We should do more to protect them while they do so.\n  Last month, I had a roundtable meeting with a group of workers in \nColumbus, near State House Square, in an Episcopal church. We were \ntalking about worker rights. We had a police officer, a firefighter, a \nnurse, a teacher, and several other workers there. These are public \nemployees. But they have seen the same assault on their rights as we \nare seeing all too often in this body--an assault on union rights and \nnonunion worker rights--far too many times.\n  We must stop these blatant efforts to strip teachers, sanitation \nworkers, police officers, firefighters, and others from collectively \nbargaining for fair pay and safety equipment. That has been a right in \nthis country for 75 years, since the Wagner Act, the 1938 labor act. It \nhas been a right for workers that has created a middle class, and it \nbrought up the living standards not just for union workers who organize \nand bargain collectively, but it brought up the living standards for \nboth white-collar and blue-collar workers, management and labor, \nthroughout our society. It has created a much more prosperous society.\n  The New York Times had an article written last week by someone who \nsaid that when we fail at war in a battle, we don't turn around and \nblame the soldiers; we give them better equipment with which to do \ntheir job. So why, when our public education system sometimes fails, do \nwe blame teachers? Why don't we give those teachers better tools to do \ntheir jobs? Why don't we do the same with firefighters, police \nofficers, nurses, and others, instead of blaming these workers and \npublic employees?\n  In my State, the Governor signed legislation a month or so ago that \nstripped these public workers of their collective bargaining rights. I \nthink in this society, with this kind of pressure on the middle class, \nthe last thing we should do is strip anybody of their rights that \nenable them to make a decent living, put food on their table, have a \ndecent pension, and have decent health care--especially in retirement. \nIt makes no sense to me, as we honor workers and Workers Memorial Day, \nwhich was commemorated last week, that we would ever move in the wrong \ndirection when it comes to workers' rights and building a more \nprosperous middle class.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I join with my good friend, the Senator \nfrom Ohio, Senator Brown, in commemorating Workers Memorial Day, which \nactually was last week. Since we weren't in session then, we wanted to \ntake the time today to commemorate Workers Memorial Day. I am always \ngreatly appreciative of my friend wearing the canary pin on his lapel \nbecause, as the Senator from Ohio knows, my father was a coal miner for \nover 20 years. A lot of people still don't know we had coal mines in \nIowa. At one time, back in those days, Iowa was the third largest coal-\nproducing State in the Nation. He worked there a long time ago, before \nthere were safety laws or anything. In fact, most of the time he worked \nthere was before I was born. I can remember him, later on, telling \nstories about the mines and how many people would be injured or \nkilled--it was sort of an accepted thing--every day, week, or month. \nPeople would die and cave-ins would happen. Of course, almost everybody \nof his generation who worked in those coal mines eventually got miners' \ncough, as they called it back then--miners' lung or black lung disease, \nas we know it now. They all virtually had that later on in their lives.\n  I appreciate my friend from Ohio commemorating Workers Memorial Day.\n  More than 20 years ago, family members of workers killed on the job \njoined with safety advocates to launch Workers Memorial Day--a day of \nremembrance and advocacy. To honor the creation of the Occupational \nSafety and Health Administration--OSHA, as it is called--April 28 was \nchosen as Workers Memorial Day. This year, that day takes on special \nsignificance because it marks the 40th anniversary of the creation of \nOSHA.\n  The passage of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which created \nOSHA, was one of the monumental legislative achievements of the 20th \ncentury. This landmark legislation reflects the values that all \nAmericans share, which is that workers should not have to risk their \nlives to earn their livelihood, and that workers, employers, and the \ngovernment must all work together to keep people safe and healthy on \nthe job. Signed into law by President Nixon, this bipartisan \nlegislation has been a tremendous success, saving the lives and the \nhealth of hundreds of thousands of American workers.\n  Here are the facts. Immediately prior to the creation of OSHA in \n1970, an average of 14,000 workers died annually from occupational \ninjuries. In 2009, despite a workforce that is twice as large as the \nworkforce of 1970, 4,340 workers were killed on the job. Before OSHA, \nabout 11 workers were killed for every 100,000 people working. Now \nroughly 3.3 workers are killed per 100,000 people working. Again, these \nfigures are still too large. We can and must do better. We should also \ntake a moment to reflect on how many tragedies have been prevented and \nlives saved because of the Occupational Safety and Health Act.\n  I fear that this simple truth--that workplace safety has been a \nphenomenal success--is being ignored in Washington these days. Nowadays \nsome people would have us believe that workplace safety regulations are \nsomething bad. They claim that OSHA\n\n[[Page S2595]]\n\nstandards are ``job killers.'' But just because some special interest \ngroups with highly paid lobbyists keep repeating this absurd mantra, \nthat doesn't mean it is true. In fact, the opposite is true. Smart \nsafety regulations administered by active, unbiased regulators improve \nand stabilize our economy. They save workers' lives, prevent \ncatastrophic accidents, reduce health care costs, and ensure that \nindustries are responsible for their actions instead of dumping the \ncost of their mistakes on workers and taxpayers.\n  In addition to the more than 4,000 workers killed on the job every \nyear, which I mentioned, almost 50,000 Americans die every year from \noccupational illnesses. Let me repeat that. Almost 50,000 Americans die \nevery year from occupational illnesses. More than 4.1 million workers \nare injured every year. The cost of these injuries and illnesses is \nenormous. It is estimated at somewhere between $160 billion to $318 \nbillion a year for the direct and indirect costs of these injuries. \nAdditional safeguards to prevent these injuries and illnesses, along \nwith strong enforcement of existing laws, would save thousands of lives \nand thousands of injuries from happening and would save the taxpayers \nbillions of dollars.\n  To accomplish this, it is clear that our safety laws need to be \nupdated. We have learned much in the 40 years since the Occupational \nSafety and Health Act was passed, and it is past time to use this \nknowledge for meaningful reform. For example, we know that \nwhistleblowers are critical to bringing safety problems to light. But \nthese whistleblowers won't come forward unless the law contains \nstronger protections against retaliation. Right now, we have stronger \nprotections for financial whistleblowers under the Sarbanes-Oxley law \nthan we do for workers blowing the whistle and trying to save lives. \nRepeating that, we have stronger whistleblower protections for \nfinancial whistleblowers under the existing Sarbanes-Oxley financial \nreform law than we do for workers who are trying to save lives by \nblowing the whistle. That is not right. That should be corrected.\n  We also know that while most responsible companies make worker safety \na top priority, there are some unscrupulous employers who cut corners \non safety to save costs. Unfortunately, as a past Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee report demonstrated, when the negligence \nof these companies results in workers being killed on the job, these \nirresponsible companies walk away with a slap on the wrist. OSHA \npenalties are pitifully low. The average fine for a worker being killed \non the job is $5,000. The average fine for an irresponsible company--\nand they have to be found as not acting prudently and that they were \nskimping on safety regulations and not adhering to well-defined safety \nregulations. But when somebody gets killed, the average fine is $5,000. \nWhat we need is real penalties to ensure that all employers have real \nincentives to comply with safety and health laws.\n  These and other changes in the law are desperately overdue, which is \nwhy I have consistently sponsored and supported the Protecting \nAmerica's Workers Act. This bill makes commonsense reforms to bring \nworker laws into the 21st century, with minimal burden on the vast \nmajority of employers that comply with the law. In this Congress, once \nagain, I plan to do everything possible to fight for this important \nlegislation.\n  In addition to these much-needed updates to the Occupational Safety \nand Health Act, we also must recognize the key role that vigilant \nenforcement plays in keeping workers safe. Safety laws don't work \nunless there is a legitimate expectation that they will actually be \nenforced. In recent years, we made real progress in ensuring adequate \nfunding for our workplace safety agencies.\n  For example, increases in funding for the Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration in recent years have enabled us to meet health \ninspections for 3 years in a row. MSHA and the Department of Labor have \nfunds to attack a backlog of appeals filed by mine operators. These \nappeals have helped some operators avoid heightened enforcement \nactions. OSHA has received funds to restore the number of inspectors \nthat it had over a decade ago.\n  However, we in the Senate have recently had to fend off efforts to \nroll back this progress. H.R. 1, the Republican fiscal year 2011 \nappropriations bill, cut the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration by 18 percent--18 percent. This would have paralyzed the \nagency and allowed unscrupulous employers to ignore worker safety and \nhealth protections.\n  This bill would have allowed the backlog of mine safety and health \ncitations to increase. It would have prevented MSHA from moving forward \non improvements it has initiated in mine emergency response and other \nareas. Thankfully, Senate Democrats and the President are standing firm \nand refusing to cut workplace safety funding to finance tax breaks for \nmillionaires and billionaires.\n  As we continue the budget debates, we should keep in mind the budget \nreflects moral choices about the kind of country and society we want to \nbe. Personally, I am committed to upholding the bipartisan values \nreflected in the passage of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. All \nAmericans have the right to a safe workplace.\n  While we have made tremendous progress, as I pointed out, in the last \n40 years under OSHA, there is much more work to be done. Over 4,000 \nlives lost each year is still unacceptably high. We owe the 4,340 \nworkers we lost just last year our best efforts to ensure that such \ntragic losses are dramatically reduced. We should not rest until all of \nour fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, families can go to work each \nday knowing they can come home safely each night.\n  Once again, on April 28, we commemorate Workers Memorial Day, and we \nrenew our commitment to making sure workers all across America have the \nprotections of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, that we provide \nthe funding for these agencies to make sure the law is enforced, and to \nmake sure we reassure every working American that they have a right--\nthey have a right--to a safe workplace.\n  I yield the floor.

Madam President, I have had the privilege over most of \nmy tenure in the Senate of serving on the Finance Committee and working \nwith a good Senate leader such as Senator Baucus. I now have the \nprivilege of serving on the committee but not as ranking member or \nchairman, just as a member. I compliment Senator Baucus for his \nleadership on this whole business of tax reform and for holding the \nhearings he is holding.\n  Today, a very important hearing is being held on the question of is \nthe distribution of tax burdens and benefits equitable. The topic of \ntoday's hearing--whether the distribution of tax benefits and burdens \nis equitable--is very appropriate and is a very important \ntopic. However, I would argue there is a more important question we \nshould be debating, and we should be answering this question: What is \nthe purpose of the Federal income tax? We can't talk about whether \ntaxpayers are paying their fair share if we don't know why we want them \npaying taxes in the first place.\n\n  We are in a situation now where people are talking about increasing \ntaxes on higher income people because, supposedly, they can afford it. \nProbably they can afford it, but I get sick and tired of the \ndemagoguery that goes on in Washington not just by Members of Congress \nbut by too many people who think higher income people ought to be \npaying more taxes. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation's \nlatest analysis, 49 percent of households are paying 100 percent of the \ntaxes coming in to the Federal Government, while 51 percent are not \npaying any income tax whatsoever.\n  How high do taxes have to go to satisfy the appetite of people in \nthis Congress to spend money? In particular, how high do marginal tax \nrates have to go to satisfy those clamoring for higher taxes from the \nwealthiest; how high\n\n[[Page S2596]]\n\nto satisfy you? And you know who you are.\n  There is an article by Investors Business Daily to which I want to \nrefer. According to this article--not talking about the taxation of a \ncertain amount of income--if the government confiscated all the income \nof the people earning $250,000 a year or more, that money would fund \nthe Federal Government today for a mere 140 days. Do you know what you \nwould have? You wouldn't have those people trying to maximize their \nincome because why would they maximize it if the government was going \nto confiscate it.\n  So that is a very basic question: How high do taxes have to go to \nsatisfy the appetite of people in this Congress to spend money?\n  Funding the government should be one of if not the primary goal of \nour income tax laws. Of course, that leaves out this whole business of \nwhether the Federal Government's purpose is the purpose of \nredistributing income.\n  Note here that I am specifically focusing on the income tax. This is \nbecause payroll taxes are not used to fund the government. Social \nSecurity and Medicare taxes are, in fact, insurance programs. Because \nthey are insurance programs, the taxes they pay are insurance premiums \nbecause individuals who pay them expect to benefit when they reach a \ncertain age.\n  It is clear some believe the Tax Code should be used to reduce the \ngrowing income disparity between the lowest and highest income \nquintiles. This assumes a key objective of the Federal Government, \nthrough the Federal income tax laws, should be to ensure that income is \ndistributed equally throughout our citizenry. In other words, these \nfolks actually believe the Federal Government is the best judge of how \nincome should be spent. That is not what our Founding Fathers or \noriginal authors of the tax laws intended.\n  In addition to considering the purpose of tax revenue, we ought to, \nin fact, have some principles of taxation by which we abide. These \nprinciples of taxation would be a much stronger foundation than the \nday-to-day decisions about whether we ought to raise taxes on a certain \nnumber of people. So I abide by the principle that has been a fact of \nour tax laws for 50 years--that an average of 18.2 percent of the GDP \nof this country is good enough for what the government needs to spend.\n  Now, I say that because with a 50-year average it hasn't been harmful \nto the economy, as we have seen this country expand and expand and \nexpand economically over that period of time.\n  Quite frankly, it ought to be clear that 18.2 percent of the GDP of \nthis country coming in for us to spend is not a level of expenditures \nthat taxpayers have revolted against. So we take in that 18.2 percent \nfor 535 of us to decide how to spend, and the other 82 percent is in \nthe pockets of the taxpayers to decide how to spend or to save. If 535 \nMembers of Congress were to decide how to divide up the resources of \nthis country, we would not have the economic growth that we have had in \nour economy. With 137 million taxpayers deciding how to spend or how to \nsave, and how much of each, the economic growth of this country is \nenhanced tremendously because of the dynamics of the free-market \nsystem. If we were going to go the greater route of increasing that 18 \npercent very dramatically, we would be moving increasingly toward the \nEuropeanizing of our economy, and I think that would be very bad.\n  In evaluating whether people are paying their fair share, experts \nfrequently look at whether a proposal improves the progressivity of our \ntax system. Critics of lower tax rates continue to attempt to use \ndistribution tables to show that tax relief proposals \ndisproportionately benefit the upper income. We keep hearing that the \nrich are getting richer while the poor are getting poorer. This is not \nan intellectually honest statement because it implies that those who \nare poor stay poor throughout their lifetimes, and those who are rich \nstay rich throughout their lifetimes. And that is just not the case.\n  To illustrate this point, I quote from a 2007 report from the \nDepartment of the Treasury titled, ``Income Mobility in the U.S. from \n1996 to 2005.'' I quote the key findings:\n\n       There was considerable income mobility of individuals in \n     the U.S. economy during 1996 through 2005 period as over half \n     of the taxpayers moved to a different income quintile over \n     this period.\n       Roughly half of taxpayers who began in the bottom income \n     quintile in 1996 moved up to a higher income group by 2005.\n       Among those with the very highest incomes in 1996--the top \n     1/100 of 1 percent--only 25 percent remained in this group in \n     2005. Moreover, the median real income of these taxpayers \n     declined over this period.\n       The degree of mobility among income groups is unchanged \n     from the prior decade.\n\n  The prior decade meaning the prior study by the Treasury Department \nfrom 1987 through 1996.\n\n       Economic growth resulted in rising incomes for most \n     taxpayers for the period of 1996 to 2005. Median income of \n     all taxpayers increased by 24 percent after adjusting for \n     inflation. The real incomes of two-thirds of all taxpayers \n     increased over this period. In addition, the median incomes \n     of those initially in the lower income groups increased more \n     than the median incomes of those initially in the higher \n     income groups.\n\n  Therefore, whoever is saying--and we hear it every day on the floor \nof the Senate--that once rich, Americans stay rich; and once poor, they \nstay poor, is purely mistaken. The Internal Revenue Service data \nsupports this analysis. A report on the 400 tax returns with the \nhighest income reported over 14 years shows that in any given year, on \naverage, about 40 percent of the returns were filed by taxpayers who \nare not in any of the other 14 years.\n  In other words, 40 percent of those people who are in the highest \nbrackets are not in the highest brackets ever in that 14-year period of \ntime. So once rich, not always rich.\n  I welcome this data on this important matter for one simple reason: \nIt sheds light on what America is all about: vast opportunities and \nincome mobility. Built by immigrants from all over the world, our \ncountry truly provides unique opportunities for everyone. These \nopportunities include better education, health care services, and \nfinancial security. But, most importantly, our country provides people \nwith the freedom to obtain the necessary skills to climb the economic \nladder and live better lives.\n  We are a free nation. We are a mobile nation. We are a nation of \nhard-working, innovative, skilled, and resilient people who like to \ntake risks when necessary in order to succeed. Bottom line, we have an \nobligation as lawmakers to incorporate these fundamental principles \ninto our tax system instead of just asking: Are the rich paying enough?\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 20 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise to speak on a nomination that is \npending before the Senate, and I do so with some degree of trepidation \nbecause, as someone who has been a member of the legal profession for \nabout 30-plus years, I believe it is imperative that I voice my strong \nconcerns and, indeed, my objections to the nomination of Jack McConnell \nto become a U.S. district judge prior to the vote we will have tomorrow \nmorning on a cloture vote.\n  The reason I was attracted, like so many others, I think, to law \nschool and the legal profession was because of the majesty of the \nnotion of the rule of law, its importance to our democracy, the \nresponsibilities that lawyers owe not just to themselves, to enrich \nthemselves, but to their clients--the fiduciary duty that a lawyer has \nto represent a client. Then, of course, the ethical standards, which \nsome might scoff at but which actually work pretty well. They keep \nlawyers, for the most part, accountable to the high ethical standards \nimposed by the legal profession.\n  Unfortunately, and I am sorry to have to say this, but the hard truth \nis Mr. McConnell's record--which I will describe in a moment--is one of \nnot upholding the rule of law but perverting the rule of law, ignoring \nthe responsibilities he had to his client, and manipulating those \nethical standards in order to enrich himself and his law partners.\n  First, let me just say that Mr. McConnell, when he came before the\n\n[[Page S2597]]\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee, intentionally misled the committee during \nthe confirmation process. I don't know how I can say it any more \ngently. The fact is, he lied to the Senate Judiciary Committee during \nhis confirmation process: Regardless of who nominates an individual, \nparty affiliation aside, I don't think the Senate, as an institution, \nshould tolerate a nominee who essentially misrepresents the facts in \nthe context of a confirmation process. This involved his participation \nin or involvement with a set of stolen confidential documents his law \nfirm obtained in a lawsuit against the Sherman-Williams Company.\n\n  In 2010, in his answers to written questions to the committee, Mr. \nMcConnell told members of the committee: ``I would not say I was \nfamiliar with the documents in any fashion.'' Only a few months later, \nin September 2010, this same nominee gave a deposition in an Ohio \ncourt, where he testified he was the first attorney at his firm to \nreview the documents in question, that he had drafted a newspaper \neditorial citing information that had come from those documents, and \nthat portions of those documents were incorporated in a brief filed \nunder his signature. Despite this obvious contradiction and given an \nopportunity to correct his misleading statement, Mr. McConnell has \nunequivocally stood by his original statement to committee members.\n  I reiterate, this body should not approve or confirm, for a lifetime \nappointment, someone who wants to serve as a judge, in particular, but \nanyone who would lie to or, at best, intentionally mislead the Senate \nby downplaying his role in a serious controversy involving, in this \ncase, stolen confidential documents.\n  During the time I practiced law and served on the State court bench \nin my State of Texas, I have come to respect lawyers who handle all \nsorts of cases--lawyers who prosecute criminal cases, lawyers who \ndefend criminal cases, lawyers who defend citizens, including \ncompanies, sued for money damages, and those who bring those lawsuits--\nconstrained, again, by the rule of law, duty to the client, and high \nethical standards. But based on his long career as a lawyer, Mr. \nMcConnell has advocated--it is clear from the evidence--a results-\noriented view of the law and manipulated it for his personal gain. \nThese theories he has advanced, ostensibly on behalf of his client, \nhave been rejected, not just by people like me but by a very broad \nrange of people in the legal community.\n  For example, Mr. McConnell and his firm sued paint manufacturers \nbased on an unprecedented theory of public nuisance that allowed them \nto circumvent longstanding legal doctrine and receive a huge jury award \nin a sympathetic judge's courtroom.\n  Ultimately, the Rhode Island Supreme Court rejected unanimously this \ntheory, declaring it ``at odds with centuries of American law and \nantithetical to the common law,'' to quote the court. As one Iowa \nattorney general who happens to be a Democrat said: ``Mr. McConnell's \nlead paint litigation was a lawsuit in search of a legal theory.''\n  Mr. McConnell's lead paint litigation scheme required the complicity, \nunfortunately, of State and local officials, a practice I will speak \nmore on in just a moment. But Mr. McConnell's reaction to the decision \nof the Rhode Island Supreme Court also demonstrates his lack of \njudicial temperament, something very important, particularly for a \njudge. It showed that not only does he still adamantly believe in these \nradical, unprecedented legal theories, rejected by the highest court in \nRhode Island, but he also lacks the temperament to serve on the Federal \nbench. Instead of respecting the decision made by the highest court in \nthe State, Mr. McConnell wrote a strident op-ed piece condemning the \ncourt and stating he believed their decisions ``let the wrongdoers off \nthe hook.'' In other words, Mr. McConnell made clear he believes the \nlaw should be manipulated to serve his agenda, not to uphold the rule \nof law, nor to respect the very bodies that are responsible under our \nsystem for interpreting law and rendering judgment.\n  Mr. McConnell's outburst was not particularly surprising, given his \npublic admission previously that he is ``an emotional personal about \ninjustice at any level, personal, societal, or global,'' as he put it. \nThis lack of temperament and novel view of the law is indicative of the \ntype of judge Jack McConnell would be, I am sorry to say: biased \nagainst a certain class of people and untethered to the rule of law.\n  Mr. McConnell's practices also existed under an ethical cloud \nthroughout his career. He and his law firm made billions of dollars and \na name for themselves through their pioneering practice of soliciting \nno-bid, contingent-fee contracts from State officials. For example, Mr. \nMcConnell and his firm played a central role in litigating lawsuits \nbrought by State attorneys general, first against tobacco companies and \nthen lead-based paint manufacturers. Of course, I am not saying tobacco \ncompanies and other companies should not be held accountable for \nharmful products, but the purpose of the law should be to compensate \nthose people who have been aggrieved and to deter others from acting in \nthe same fashion in the future. The litigation he constructed and \ndevised, the scheme he literally created, did none of that. The \nquestion is, ultimately, where did the money go?\n  Under these contracts, Mr. McConnell and his partners have repeatedly \nsued American businesses, pocketing billions of dollars for themselves \nin attorney's fees, while leaving taxpayers on the hook for the \nresulting costs. In the word of one respected legal commentator, Mr. \nMcConnell and lawyers like him have ``perverted the legal system for \npersonal and political gain at the expense of everyone else.''\n  In several lawsuits, Mr. McConnell and his partners received \ncontingent-fee contracts from State officials, to whom they later \ncontributed tens of thousands of dollars. I think there are a lot of \nvery important public policy reasons why State officials should not be \nable to outsource their responsibilities to private lawyers based on a \ncontingency fee, where their only incentive is one of a profit motive, \nuntethered by the sorts of checks and balances that elected or other \nappointed government officials would ordinarily have.\n  Our system of justice relies on financially disinterested officials \nwho take an oath to uphold the law and not those whose sole motive is \nnot to uphold the law but to twist it and manipulate it in order to \nmaximize their economic gain.\n  Some of these lawyers, including Mr. McConnell's firm, have pocketed \nwhat amounts to hundreds of thousands of dollars per hour for their \nwork in lawsuits against tobacco companies. Mr. McConnell and lawyers \nlike him are the big winners in these lawsuits, taking home large sums \nof money that rightfully belong to the taxpayer, the client I mentioned \nat the outset. Imagine if these billions of dollars were spent on \ncancer research or improving public health, instead of lining the \npockets of a few politically well-connected lawyers. More important, \nhowever, the outsourcing of suits to private trial lawyers on a \ncontingent-fee basis creates both the opportunity and appearance for \ncorruption by allowing State officials to reward their friends and \ncampaign contributors.\n  One reason I have taken such a strong personal interest in this issue \nis because of my service as attorney general of Texas, following that \nof Dan Morales, my predecessor. Mr. Morales served over 3 years in the \nFederal penitentiary for attempting to illegally channel millions of \ndollars in a tobacco settlement, money that was due to the State of \nTexas, but he steered it to a lawyer friend of his by trying to \nbackdate a contract, to make it appear to be something it was not. The \nactions of Mr. McConnell and his partners, by funneling tens of \nthousands of dollars into campaign accounts of State officials who \nhired them, raise concerns about pay-to-play dealings.\n  In the State of Washington, for example, Mr. McConnell and members of \nhis small South Carolina-based law firm contributed $23,200 to the \nreelection of the attorney general in the State of Washington. By the \nway, that was the very same lawyer who hired them on a contingency \nbasis to represent the State.\n  In North Dakota, Mr. McConnell and his wife contributed $30,000 to \nthe gubernatorial campaign of the attorney general who appointed him as \nspecial\n\n[[Page S2598]]\n\nassistant attorney general, for purposes of representing that State in \ntobacco litigation. Mr. McConnell and his law firm contributed an \nadditional $73,000 to that same attorney general's State political \nparty during the campaign cycle, making them the No. 4 campaign \ncontributor to that organization.\n\n  There is nothing wrong with people contributing money to political \ncandidates or parties or causes they believe in. But it is another \nmatter when these contributions are made in connection with no-bid \ncontracts or apparent political favors. It is no small matter that Mr. \nMcConnell has a lucrative, ongoing financial arrangement as a product \nof his previous work as a trial lawyer. In fact, he will receive $2.5 \nto $3.1 million a year through 2024 as part of his payout for his work \nin the tobacco litigation I mentioned a moment ago--$2.5 to $3.1 \nmillion a year through 2024. For anyone who would praise Mr. McConnell \nfor giving up a successful legal career in order to serve as a Federal \njudge, remember he would be reaping huge windfalls at the expense of \ntaxpayers long into his tenure as a Federal judge.\n  Some Senators will say that whatever his past, Mr. McConnell deserves \nthe benefit of the doubt and that he would be an impartial judge if \nconfirmed by the Senate to this lifetime appointment. I cannot agree \nand neither does, by the way, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. They have \ntaken an unprecedented step of opposing this nomination.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. The Chamber has taken this unprecedented step of opposing \nhis nomination and declaring him ``unfit to serve.'' In fact, this is \nthe first time in its 99-year history they have opposed a district \ncourt nominee.\n  My colleagues have asked me whether I believe that Texas businesses \nand businesspeople would get a fair shake in Jack McConnell's \ncourtroom, and I absolutely do not believe they could.\n  To my colleagues who may doubt what I am saying or look for some \nproof, I would just say: Read the record. I am convinced you would have \ntrouble looking your constituents in the eye and telling them you \nbelieve Mr. McConnell would be fair to all litigants in his courtroom \nand, in this case, especially businesses that may be sued for money \ndamages, as he did throughout his legal career. In fact, Mr. McConnell, \nduring the Judiciary Committee deliberations, described his legal \nphilosophy by saying: ``There are wrongs that need to be righted and \nthat is how I see the law.'' That doesn't cite any applicable legal \nstandard. It doesn't actually take into account law as we know it, just \nwrongs he believes need to be righted.\n  Similarly, Mr. McConnell has said that based upon his experience he \nhas ``absolutely no confidence'' that certain industries will ever do \nthe right thing and that they will only do the right thing ``when \nthey're sued and forced to by a jury.''\n  Given his tendency to view lawsuits against businesses as a movement \nagainst societal injustice, it is difficult to see how Mr. McConnell \ncould put those personal views aside and give all litigants in his \ncourtroom a fair trial, a right which they are guaranteed under our \nConstitution and laws. I believe a vote to support Mr. McConnell's \nnomination is a vote to create yet another court where trial lawyers \nwill repeatedly prevail in frivolous litigation against American \nbusinesses. That is something we ought not allow.\n  Mr. McConnell's behavior during his career and confirmation \nprocession demonstrates a lack of ethics and temperament necessary to \nserve as a Federal judge. I hope a President would never appoint \nsomeone such as Jack McConnell, but apparently everyone makes mistakes, \nincluding this nomination by this President. Instead of stubbornly \ndigging in his heels, usually the President has agreed to withdraw \nnominees whose confirmation process produces extraordinary controversy, \nbut since he has failed to do so here, the President has forced me and \nothers to stand our ground and to fight Mr. McConnell's appointment to \nthe Federal bench.\n  Based on his deeply troubling ethical record and poor judicial \ntemperament and the fact he intentionally misled, if not lied to, the \nJudiciary Committee during his confirmation process, I believe we must \nfight this nomination with every tool at our disposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 30, 2011.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: The U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation \n     representing the interests of more than three million \n     businesses and organizations of every size, sector, and \n     region, strongly opposes the nomination of John ``Jack'' \n     McConnell to serve on the United States District Court for \n     the District of Rhode Island.\n       Mr. McConnell's past statements, conduct as a personal \n     injury plaintiffs' lawyer, and lackluster ABA rating raise \n     serious concerns about his fitness to be confirmed to a \n     lifetime appointment to the federal bench. Although the \n     Chamber has historically stayed away from debates surrounding \n     federal district court nominees, we believe that a response \n     is warranted in this circumstance given Mr. McConnell's \n     record.\n       Our opposition begins with Mr. McConnell's mediocre \n     ``substantial majority qualified, minority unqualified'' \n     rating from the American Bar Association. For a practicing \n     lawyer with 25 years of experience to obtain such a low \n     rating speaks poorly of his legal abilities. It is likely \n     that he generated negative comments from judges before whom \n     he appeared and/or from lawyers who know him.\n       Mr. McConnell's ABA rating should come as no surprise given \n     his past statements, which raise serious questions about \n     whether he will follow precedent and the rule of law. For \n     example, in 1999, Mr. McConnell was hired on a contingency \n     fee basis by the State of Rhode Island to sue paint companies \n     under theories of liability that exceeded the bounds of well-\n     settled law. After nine years of protracted litigation, and \n     after millions of dollars spent by defendants, the Rhode \n     Island Supreme Court unanimously (4-0) rejected Mr. \n     McConnell's misguided interpretation of public nuisance law. \n     Mr. McConnell demonstrated little respect for the Supreme \n     Court's ruling and publicly attacked the decision in an op-ed \n     that he penned for The Providence Journal, claiming that the \n     justices ``got [the decision] terribly wrong'' by letting \n     ``wrongdoers off the hook.''\n       Mr. McConnell's public criticism of the Rhode Island \n     Supreme Court's lead paint ruling should also give the \n     Committee pause because it casts light on a judicial \n     philosophy that appears to be outcome-driven rather than \n     based on interpreting and applying the law. Indeed, Mr. \n     McConnell has publicly affirmed his support for ``an active \n     government'' that should not ``stand on the sidelines'' and \n     that ``[he] see[s] the law'' as a mechanism to redress \n     ``wrongs that need to be righted.'' Considering these \n     statements together, a picture of a judicial nominee who will \n     legislate from the bench begins to emerge.\n       The Chamber is equally concerned that Mr. McConnell lacks \n     the capacity to be an impartial jurist, especially against \n     business defendants who may appear before him. Mr. McConnell \n     has defined his career by suing business defendants. As his \n     own Committee questionnaire indicates, of the top ten cases \n     he views as the ``most significant'' litigations of his legal \n     career, all but two involve actions against businesses, and \n     none involved him representing or defending a business. Worse \n     still, when asked by the Columbus Post Dispatch in 2006 about \n     the possibility of future lead paint litigation, he said \n     that, based on history, he had ``absolutely no confidence'' \n     that defendant paint companies would do the right thing. He \n     added ``[t]he only time is when they're sued and forced to by \n     a jury.'' How could a business hope to receive an impartial \n     hearing in Mr. McConnell's courtroom when these statements \n     show that the deck is already stacked so heavily against \n     them?\n       Moreover, Mr. McConnell's ability to render fair and \n     impartial rulings from the bench should be seriously \n     questioned in light of the potentially significant financial \n     windfalls that he stands to recover for the next 15 years. \n     According to Mr. McConnell's questionnaire, he is scheduled \n     to receive millions of dollars annually through 2024 from an \n     organization closely tied with his current employer, the \n     Motley Rice plaintiffs' firm. This has all the appearance of \n     a conflict of interest and it is difficult to see how Mr. \n     McConnell could render impartial judgments in matters \n     involving plaintiffs' law firms while simultaneously \n     receiving millions of dollars in compensation from another \n     plaintiffs' firm.\n       Ultimately, we are concerned that Mr. McConnell's apparent \n     bias against business defendants, underlying judicial \n     philosophy, and questionable respect for the rule of law, \n     will lead to the multiplication of baseless lawsuits in his \n     courtroom with untold consequences to businesses large and \n     small\n\n[[Page S2599]]\n\n     across the country. Given the limited number of judges who \n     currently serve in the District of Rhode Island, it is not \n     hard to imagine a generation of enterprising personal injury \n     lawyers flocking to a new ``magnet jurisdiction'' at the \n     federal level with a chance to draw such a plaintiff-lawyer \n     friendly judge. State courts like those in Madison County, \n     Illinois have amply demonstrated the problems that can arise \n     from courts that accept plaintiffs' claims no matter their \n     merits. Finally, as most litigators understand, federal \n     judges exercise virtually unreviewable discretionary \n     authority in many circumstances, and the chance of the \n     appellate courts correcting every misstep is unrealistic. As \n     such, the Chamber must urge the Committee to resist the \n     confirmation of a lawyer with an animus against one type of \n     defendant.\n       As Mr. McConnell has not demonstrated that he would provide \n     the kind of fair and impartial judicial temperament needed to \n     be a federal judge, as well as his demonstrated bias against \n     a clear class of litigants, the Chamber urges you to oppose \n     this nomination. Should Mr. McConnell's nomination be \n     considered on the Senate floor, the Chamber may consider \n     votes on, or in relation to, his nomination in our annual How \n     They Voted scorecard.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R. Bruce Josten.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last night, Majority Leader Reid was forced \nto file another cloture petition on a Federal judicial nominee, the \nfifth required to be filed during President Obama's term. Among the \nhighly qualified nominees being stalled is Jack McConnell, who is \nnominated to a vacancy on the United States District Court for the \nDistrict of Rhode Island.\n  I am concerned that we have to file cloture on nominations that \nshould simply have an up-or-down vote. I hope we are not returning to \nthe situation we had during the Clinton administration when my friends \non the Republican side of the aisle pocket filibustered 61 of his \nnominees.\n  We tried to change that in the 17 months I was chairman during the \nfirst 2 years of President Bush's first term when I moved 100 of \nPresident Bush's nominees through the Senate. In the remaining 2\\1/2\\ \nyears, the Republicans were in charge, and the Senate confirmed another \n105. We tried to change what had been an unfortunate procedure. I hope \nwe are not going back to that.\n  Jack McConnell has the strong support of his home State Senators, \nbipartisan support from those in his home State, and his nomination has \nbeen reported favorably by a bipartisan majority of the Judiciary \nCommittee multiple times. This nomination is one of many that have been \nstranded on the Senate's Executive Calendar for many months stalled by \nRepublican objection to proceeding to debate and vote.\n  Just a few years ago, Republican Senators argued that filibusters of \njudicial nominees were unconstitutional, and that every nominee was \nentitled to an up-or-down vote. They unsuccessfully filibustered \nPresident Obama's first judicial nominee, and have stalled many others. \nCloture is now being required to overcome another in a series of \nRepublican filibusters in order to vote up or down on a judicial \nnominee at a time when extensive, and extended, judicial vacancies are \ncreating a crisis for the Federal justice system and all Americans.\n  With these filibusters, the Senate's Republican leadership seems \ndetermined to set a new standard for obstruction of judicial \nnominations. I cannot recall a single instance in which a President's \njudicial nomination to a Federal trial court, a Federal district court, \nwas blocked by a filibuster.\n  When I came to the Senate, the President of the United States was \nGerald Ford, whose statue we just unveiled in the Rotunda. We did not \nfilibuster any of his Federal district court nominees. We did not \nfilibuster any of President Jimmy Carter's district court nominees. We \ndid not filibuster any of President George H. W. Bush's district court \nnominees.\n  We did not filibuster on the floor any of President Clinton's or any \nof President George W. Bush's nominees. Somehow the rules have changed \nfor President Obama.\n  This is troubling as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, but also \ntroubling to the Federal judiciary nationwide. So I did a little \nresearch. Looking back over the last six decades, I found only three \ndistrict court nominations--three in over 60 years--on which cloture \nwas even filed. For two of those, the cloture petitions were withdrawn \nafter procedural issues were resolved. For a single one, the Senate \nvoted on cloture and it was invoked. All three of those nominations \nwere confirmed. I trust that the nomination of Jack McConnell will also \nbe confirmed.\n  From the start of President Obama's term, Republican Senators have \napplied a heightened and unfair standard to President Obama's district \ncourt nominees. Senate Republicans have chosen to depart dramatically \nfrom the long tradition of deference on district court nominees to the \nhome State Senators who know the needs of their States best. Instead, \nan unprecedented number of President Obama's highly qualified district \ncourt nominees have been targeted for opposition and obstruction.\n  That approach is a serious break from the Senate's practice of advice \nand consent. Since 1945, the Judiciary Committee has reported more than \n2,100 district court nominees to the Senate. Out of these 2,100 \nnominees, only five have been reported by party-line votes. Only five \ntotal in the last 65 years. Four of these five party-line votes have \nbeen against President Obama's highly qualified district court \nnominees. Indeed, only 19 of those 2,100 district court nominees were \nreported by any kind of split rollcall vote at all, and five of those, \nmore than a quarter, have been President Obama's nominees, including \nMr. McConnell.\n  Democrats never applied this standard to President Bush's district \ncourt nominees, whether in the majority or the minority. And certainly, \nthere were nominees to the district court put forth by that \nadministration that were considered ideologues. All told, in 8 years, \nthe Judiciary Committee reported only a single Bush district court \nnomination by a party line vote. Somehow President Obama is being \ntreated differently than any President, Democratic or Republican, \nbefore him.\n  That was the controversial nomination of Leon Holmes, which Senators \nopposed because of the nominee's strident, intemperate, and insensitive \npublic statements over the years. Judge Holmes argued that ``concern \nfor rape victims is a red herring because conceptions from rape occur \nwith the same frequency as snow in Miami,'' and called concerns about \npregnant rape victims ``trivialities.'' He suggested that it was \ncorrect to say that slavery was just God's way of teaching White people \nthe value of servitude. He wrote that he did not believe the \nConstitution ``is made for people of fundamentally differing views.'' \nWe opposed Judge Holmes nomination, strongly, but we did not block it \nfrom consideration by the Senate. He was not filibustered. His \nnomination was confirmed without the need for a cloture vote.\n  With judicial vacancies at crisis levels, affecting the ability of \ncourts to provide justice to Americans around the country, we should be \ndebating and voting on each of the 13 judicial nominations reported \nfavorably by the Judiciary Committee and pending on the Senate's \nExecutive Calendar. No one should be playing partisan games and \nobstructing while vacancies remain above 90 in the Federal courts \naround the country. With one out of every nine Federal judgeships still \nvacant, and judicial vacancies around the country at 93, there is \nserious work to be done.\n  Regrettably, Senate Republicans seem intent on continuing with the \npractices they began when President Obama first took office, engaging \nin narrow, partisan attacks on his judicial nominations.\n  These unfair attacks started with President Obama's very first \njudicial nomination, David Hamilton of Indiana, a 15-year veteran of \nthe Federal bench. President Obama nominated Judge Hamilton in March \n2009, after consultation with the most senior and longest-serving \nRepublican in the Senate, Senator Dick Lugar of Indiana, who then \nstrongly supported the nomination. Rather than welcome the nomination \nas an attempt by President\n\n[[Page S2600]]\n\nObama to step away from the ideological battles of the past, Senate \nRepublicans ignored Senator Lugar's support, caricaturing Judge \nHamilton's record and filibustering his nomination. The Senate was not \nable to have an up-or-down vote on his nomination until we overcame a \nRepublican filibuster 8 months after he was nominated. After rejecting \nthe filibuster with an overwhelming vote of 70 to 29, Judge Hamilton \nwas confirmed.\n  Republican Senators who just a few years ago protested that such \nfilibusters were unconstitutional, Republican Senators who joined in a \nbipartisan memorandum of understanding to head off the ``nuclear \noption'' and agreed that nominees should only be filibustered under \n``extraordinary circumstances,'' abandoned all that they said they \nstood for and joined together in an attempt to prevent an up-or-down \nvote on President Obama's very first judicial nominee.\n  In other words, the standard they said should be applied to every \nsingle President in the history of this country suddenly was changed \nwhen this President came in. They chose to ignore their own standards \noutlined in a letter sent to President Obama not long after he took \noffice, and before he had made a single judicial nomination, in which \nSenate Republicans threatened to filibuster any nomination made without \nconsultation. Of course, President Obama did consult with the senior-\nmost Republican Senator on a nomination to fill a vacancy in his home \nState, but still they filibustered. In fact, he has consistently \nconsulted with home State Senators, both Republicans and Democrats. It \nmakes you wonder what it is about President Obama which makes \nRepublicans want to change the rules for him, rules that existed for \nevery President prior to him.\n  Since the filibuster of Judge Hamilton, Senate Republicans have \nrequired the majority leader to file cloture on three more highly \nqualified circuit court nominees. This is a far cry from Republican \ninsistence that every nominee is required by the Constitution to have \nan up-or-down vote, or even from the ``extraordinary circumstances'' \nRepublican Senators now claim to be the basis for a filibuster.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes more. \nI know there are other Senators waiting to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. No Senator could claim the circumstances surrounding the \nfilibusters of President Obama's circuit court nominations to be \nextraordinary. Republicans filibustered the nomination of Judge Barbara \nKeenan, a nominee with nearly 30 years of judicial experience, and who \nhad the distinction of being the first woman to hold a number of \nimportant judicial roles in Virginia. She was ultimately confirmed 99-0 \nas the first woman from Virginia to serve on the Fourth Circuit. Senate \nRepublicans filibustered the nomination of Judge Thomas Vanaskie, whose \n16 years of experience as a Federal district court judge in \nPennsylvania are now being used in service to the Third Circuit Court \nof Appeals, after his overwhelming confirmation. Senate Republicans \nfilibustered Judge Denny Chin of the Second Circuit, another nominee \nwith 16 years of experience as a Federal district court judge. He is \nnow the only active Asian Pacific American judge to serve on a Federal \nappellate court, after being confirmed unanimously.\n  In addition, the Republicans' across-the-board practice of refusing \nconsent and delaying consideration of even nominations with unanimous \nsupport has led to a steady backlog of pending nominations. The refusal \nof Republicans to give consent to consideration meant that 19 judicial \nnominations were stranded on the Senate's Executive Calendar at the end \nof last Congress. There are 13 judicial nominations now on the calendar \nthat Democrats are prepared to consider.\n  Each of these nominations should be considered without unnecessary \ndelay. If we do that, we can reduce the judicial vacancies to 80 for \nthe first time since July 2009. Yet we are forced to overcome \nfilibusters even to have a debate and vote on district court \nnominations.\n  These filibusters stand in stark contrast to the views of Republican \nSenators about the role of the Senate in considering judicial nominees \nwhen the President was from their own party. In 2005, when the \nRepublican majority threatened to blow up the Senate to ensure up-or-\ndown votes for each of President Bush's judicial nominations, Senator \nMcConnell, then the Republican whip, said:\n\n       Any President's judicial nominees should receive careful \n     consideration. But after that debate, they deserve a simple \n     up-or-down vote. . . . It's time to move away from advise and \n     obstruct and get back to advise and consent. The stakes are \n     high . . . . The Constitution of the United States is at \n     stake.\n\n  Other Republican Senators made similar statements back then. Many \ndeclared that they would never support the filibuster of a judicial \nnomination. Others subscribed to the standard that the so-called gang \nof 14 formulated that they would only filibuster in ``extraordinary \ncircumstances.'' The only extraordinary circumstance in this case is \nthe judicial vacancies crisis that has prompted the President, the \nChief Justice, the Attorney General, bar associations and many others \nto call for prompt consideration and confirmation of judicial nominees.\n  Yet rather than applying consistent standards and debating and voting \non judicial nominations favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee, \nwe see Republican Senators adopting a double standard and engaging in a \ndramatic break from the Senate's tradition by filibustering this \ndistrict court nomination.\n  Jack McConnell is an outstanding lawyer. President Obama has \nnominated him three times to serve as a Federal district court judge in \nRhode Island. With more than 25 years of experience as a lawyer in \nprivate practice, Mr. McConnell has the strong support of both Rhode \nIsland Senators, Senator Reed and Senator Whitehouse. He has been \nreported by a bipartisan majority of the Judiciary Committee three \ntimes.\n  Individuals and organizations from across the political spectrum in \nthat State have called for Mr. McConnell's confirmation. The Providence \nJournal endorsed his nomination by saying\n\n       in his legal work and community leadership [he] has shown \n     that he has the legal intelligence, character, compassion, \n     and independence to be a distinguished jurist.\n\n  Leading Republican figures in Rhode Island have endorsed his \nnomination. They include First Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Bruce \nSelya; Warick Mayor Scott Avedisian; Rhode Island Chief Justice Joseph \nWeisberger; former Rhode Island Attorney General Jeffrey Pine; former \nDirector of the Rhode Island Department of Business, Barry Hittner; \nformer Rhode Island Republican Party Vice-Chair John M. Harpootian; and \nThird Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Michael Fisher.\n  Some oppose him because he successfully represented plaintiffs, \nincluding the State of Rhode Island itself, in lawsuits against lead \npaint manufacturers. Some here in the Senate may support the lead paint \nindustry. That is their right. I support those who want to go after the \npeople who poison children. That is what Mr. McConnell did. But nobody \nshould oppose Mr. McConnell for doing what lawyers do and vigorously \nrepresenting his clients in those lawsuits.\n  The Senate has finally begun to debate this nomination, and some have \nwasted no time in coming to the Floor and distorting, I believe, Mr. \nMcConnell's testimony before the committee. I disagree with Senator \nCornyn's characterization of Mr. McConnell's testimony. As chairman, I \ntake seriously the obligation of nominees appearing before the \nJudiciary Committee to be truthful. I would be the first Senator to \nraise an issue if there were any legitimate question as to the accuracy \nof Mr. McConnell's testimony. But there is not.\n  The accusation stems from Mr. McConnell's recent testimony as a \nwitness deposed in a lawsuit brought by one of the paint companies \nengaged in litigation with Mr. McConnell's client. That lawsuit alleges \nthat Motley Rice, the law firm where Mr. McConnell is employed, \nimproperly obtained a 34-page confidential company document from one of \nthe lead paint companies. Mr. McConnell is not a party to the lawsuit, \nbut was deposed last September only as a witness. His answers at his\n\n[[Page S2601]]\n\ndeposition concerning his knowledge of the confidential document were \nthe same as his responses to written questions from Senator Kyl \nfollowing his hearing nearly a year ago, and the same as his responses \nto Senator Lee in written questions this February. At no time has there \nbeen a suggestion of wrongdoing by Mr. McConnell in this lawsuit.\n  Far from establishing that Mr. McConnell was untruthful with the \ncommittee, the deposition transcript obtained by the Committee after it \nwas unsealed by the Court only further validates Mr. McConnell's \naccount of his knowledge of this document. To believe that Mr. \nMcConnell was untruthful with the committee, some Senators would have \nto disbelieve not just his answers to written questions from committee \nmembers, but also Mr. McConnell's sworn testimony as a witness being \ndeposed in a lawsuit. Some Senators may feel strongly that Mr. \nMcConnell and his firm were wrong to sue lead paint companies, but \nthere is simply no basis believing that Mr. McConnell was untruthful \nwith the committee. I reject those conclusions.\n  These Republican filibusters of district court nominations are \nunprecedented. The consequences for the American people and their \naccess to justice in our Federal courts are real. I urge the Senate to \nreject these efforts and reject this filibuster.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of my colleagues in giving \nme the extra time, the distinguished senior Senator from Delaware and \nthe distinguished Senator from Connecticut.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I am always happy to yield a little more \ntime to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/03/senate-section/article/S2601-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COMMENDING THE NAVY SEALS\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I want to start off today--I did not plan \non saying this; I am here to talk about small businesses and how to \nincentivize job creation and job preservation--but before I do that, I \nwant to take a moment of personal privilege to talk about the Navy \nSEALs.\n  I am a retired Navy captain. I spent about 23 years of my life as a \nnaval flight officer. Before that, I was a midshipman, a Navy ROTC \nmidshipman out of Ohio State. We would do our summer tours as \nmidshipmen being trained to be junior naval officers. One of our tours \nwas down at Little Creek, where we learned a little bit about storming \nthe beaches of Virginia and we learned how to become marines, or \npretended we were. We also, later on, I guess as a lieutenant JG at \nCoronado, before we went over to Southeast Asia, had a chance to see--\nin both places, both the Little Creek Naval Station and over at the \nCoronado, North Island Naval Station--the Navy SEALs train. I remember \ntalking with some of my compadres who were going through training with \nus, saying: We would not want to mess with those guys--and for good \nreason.\n  They have made us proud. They have taken on an incredibly difficult \ntask and I think handled themselves splendidly, and I want to start off \ntoday saying how proud we are of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/03/senate-section/article/S2601-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2601-S2603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              JOB CREATION\n\n  Mr. CARPER. I am not quite as proud, however, when it comes to one of \nour responsibilities; that is, the responsibility to provide and \nnurture a climate for job creation and job preservation. I talk a lot \nwith small business folks, and I talk in my work with people who run \npretty big businesses. One of the things I have heard again and again--\nnot just this year but last year and the year before--large businesses \nare making a fair amount of money these days and a lot of them are \nsitting on a pile of cash. When you ask them, why are you sitting on a \npile of cash and not hiring people, what we hear from a lot of them--\nparticularly large businesses--is businesses like certainty and \npredictability. In too many areas--areas we actually have something to \ndo with--there is not the kind of predictability and certainty those \nbusinesses need.\n  For example, are we going to get serious about reducing our deficit? \nI hope so. I think the Deficit Commission, led by Erskine Bowles and \nAlan Simpson, gives us a pretty good roadmap to take $4 trillion out of \nthe deficit over the next 10 years. I hope in the end we will use that \nas a roadmap, not to use it with precision but to use it as a roadmap. \nBut that is a big uncertainty.\n  The Tax Code. What about our Tax Code? We are running sort of a 2-\nyear extension of the previous Tax Code, but that will end at the end \nof next year. What are we going to do about it? There is a lot of \nuncertainty there.\n  We have worked long and hard to try to pass health care legislation \nthat is designed not just to extend coverage to people who do not have \nit but also designed to get us to better health care outcomes, to \nachieve better health care outcomes for less money, or at least better \nhealth care outcomes for the same amount of money.\n  We have the prospect of the Federal courts, with a number of \nlitigations that are underway around the country, either at the circuit \ncourt of appeals level or maybe someday at the Supreme Court level, \ntaking apart pieces of the health care bill. We need some certainty \nthere, and we need the courts to act on it. I am not a lawyer, but some \nof my friends are, and some of them, who are a lot smarter than I am on \nthese things, suggest that as far as they are concerned, this meets \nconstitutional muster. We need an answer and we need to get on with it. \nTo the extent we need to change the health care legislation to fix it \nand make it better, let's do that. But there is a lot in the \nlegislation that enables us to get better health care results for less \nmoney. We need to do more of what works.\n  There is a lot of uncertainty with respect to transportation policy, \non the series of extensions of the transportation programs for this \ncountry.\n  The way it works, if you will, Mr. President: Looking at my podium \nhere, we will say right here is the transportation trust fund, and \nright here in the middle is the general fund for our country, our \nTreasury, and over here on the other side is sources of capital from \nthe rest of the world. We do not have enough money in our \ntransportation trust fund over here to build transportation projects. \nWe end up borrowing from the general fund right here, moving funds over \nto the transportation trust fund. Unfortunately, we do not have enough \nmoney in the trust fund to run the general government, so we go \noverseas and borrow money from everybody we can to replenish the \ngeneral fund, in order to put money in the transportation trust fund. \nIt is crazy, and it is one of the reasons why we have a big budget \ndeficit. We have uncertainty. The transportation system in this country \nhas been awarded a grade ``D'' as in ``dealt,'' actually a grade ``D'' \nas in ``decaying'' because that is what is going on in our \ntransportation system. I think things worth having are worth paying \nfor. We need to get on with it. That is a source of uncertainty.\n  The last one is energy policy. As we see runups in energy prices--the \nprice of fuel at the pump--people are wondering, What are we going to \ndo about it? Part of what we tried to do is say, we want more energy \nefficient cars, trucks, and vans to be built in this country. We \nchanged the CAFE legislation to raise the fuel efficiency standards for \ncars, trucks, and vans. So now, by 2016, the overall average has to be \n36 miles per gallon--a huge increase from where it has been since 1975.\n  That is being ramped up, and that will help. But beyond that, we do \nnot have, really, the kind of energy policy we need. That is another \nuncertainty.\n  So those are five reasons why large businesses, especially, sit on a \npile of cash and are not hiring. One of our obligations is to address \nthose uncertainties. My hope is we will do it. We actually got off to a \npretty good start this year in a couple ways. No. 1, we passed the FAA \nreauthorization, the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization. \nIn doing so, we agreed on a revenue package--agreed to by the \nindustry--to be able to modernize the air traffic control system--that \nis great--to be able to put some extra money toward airport \nconstruction--that is good as well--as part of our infrastructure \nsystem.\n  We passed in the Senate patent reform legislation. If the Presiding \nOfficer from Montana were--and he is a very clever fellow, but if he \ninvents or\n\n[[Page S2602]]\n\nthinks he has invented a product or technology, and he goes, under \ncurrent law, to the patent office and files for a patent, I can come \nalong, even if I had nothing to do with that technology or that \nproduct, and say I had that idea first and draw him into a lawsuit and \nmaybe make it difficult for him to actually get his patent.\n  We changed that in this patent reform legislation. If he is the first \none to file, then he is the first one to file, and a patent troll like \nme would not be able to get in the way and create mischief and simply \nmaybe ultimately get bought out. So the idea of changing that is very \nencouraging.\n  We have a deficit reduction agreement for this fiscal year, which \ntook about $40 billion or so out of our spending, and that is \nencouraging.\n  We have actually another piece of encouraging legislation that I \nthink passed by unanimous consent in the last Congress on small \nbusinesses and how to help small businesses do more innovative research \nand how to help them ease their ability to do technology transfer. I \nthink it passed by unanimous consent last year.\n  And now, so far this year, we have been working on this legislation \noff and on since March, since the early part of March, and we have a \nwhole lot of amendments that have been offered to the bill. One of them \nis from myself and Senator Vitter, Senator Coburn, and Senator \nMcCaskill, Senator Begich, and a bunch of other people. It is not \nrelated to small business but it is certainly related to the deficit. \nWhat it does is--as the President mentioned in his State of the Union \nAddress, we have thousands, maybe tens of thousands of pieces of \nsurplus property the Federal Government owns that we are not using. We \npay money to keep them secure. We pay money for their utilities, for \ntheir upkeep. We are not using them. We ought to sell them. We cannot \ngive them away to State and local governments, homeless groups. We \nought to sell them, at least get them off our books. That is going to \nbe offered as an amendment to this small business bill. My hope is my \ncolleagues will support it. Senator Landrieu, who chairs the Small \nBusiness Committee, and Senator Snowe, who is the ranking Republican \nmember--previously the chair--have worked on the underlying bill for \nsomething like 6 years--6 years. It passed, again I will say, I am \npretty sure, last year, by unanimous consent. We need to get it done. \nMy hope is that those of us who have amendments, especially those that \nare not controversial, will have an opportunity to offer our amendments \nto this bill, and then we need to move on.\n  It is interesting, if you look at small businesses, an inordinate \nnumber of scientists actually work for small businesses. Something \nlike, I want to say, 40 percent of America's scientists and engineers \nactually are employed by small businesses. We have some studies that \nshow the small business innovation and research programs actually are \nresponsible for something like 25 percent of our Nation's crucial \ninnovations over the past decade and account for, again, something like \n40 percent of America's patents.\n  For us to be successful in the 21st century, we need to, as the \nPresident likes to say, outeducate, outinnovate, and outcompete the \nrest of the world. Part of what we need to do is make sure we are \ncreating a world class workforce, we are producing a world class \ninfrastructure, and, finally, we are making sure we are making research \nand development investments that will lead to products that can be \ncommercialized, ideas that can be commercialized, turned into products \nwe can be making here in this country and selling around the world.\n  I think if we can somehow figure out how to resolve our differences \nso the people who want to offer amendments to this bill, especially \nnoncontroversial ones, maybe they can be successful, and let's save the \ncontroversial stuff for another day. We may disagree on 20 percent. \nThat is Senator Enzi's 80 percent/20 percent rule. Let's agree to the \n80 percent and put it in the bill. The 20 percent that we don't agree \non, let's work on that and save it and have additional hearings and \ndeal with that later.\n  In the meantime, why don't we pass this bill. Why don't we make it \neasier for small businesses to get R money, to be able to do \ntechnology transfers. In some cases where that is noncontroversial, why \ndon't we make that happen. If we do that, we can show the American \npeople we can work together and get stuff done, and we will actually \nhelp small businesses get stuff done. We will help them make money and \nhire more people and, in the end, some of those people and businesses \nwill pay more taxes, which will bring down the deficit. That is a \npretty good outcome. It is worth pursuing.\n  I commend Senator Landrieu and Senator Snowe for working on this \nlegislation for 6 years. We need to put that good work to the vote and \nmove on.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware for \nthose very important and insightful comments both on the Navy SEALS and \non the small business legislation that is pending before this body.\n  Mr. President, as my colleague, the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware, has mentioned, over the last 36 or so hours, our Nation and \nits allies around the globe have rightly celebrated an extraordinary \nmilitary triumph, a great victory in the war on terror, a turning \npoint, perhaps, toward peace: Osama bin Laden, the heinous mastermind \nof the 9/11 attacks, who murdered thousands of Americans, has been \nfinally brought to justice.\n  We are rightly celebrating the extraordinary service, bravery, and \nskill of the Navy SEALS who were the tip of the spear--an American \nmilitary that has brought to justice one of the worst war criminals of \nour time.\n  We celebrate not only, of course, the Navy SEALS, but all of the men \nand women who have given their lives and their service over the past \nyears, and their families. We celebrate also the intelligence \ncommunity's support of this effort, which was so crucial.\n  Yet even as the celebration has been conducted, on one small beach in \nConnecticut this news was greeted with solace and somber remembrance. \nIt is the beach at Sherwood Island, in Connecticut, which is home to \nthe living memorial for the Connecticut victims of 9/11, a memorial to \n152 victims of this tragedy, this murderous attack by the man who has \nnow been brought to justice. It is a beautiful place--exquisitely and \nheartbreakingly beautiful. The skyline of New York is visible from this \npoint, jutting out from Westport. The skyline of New York could be seen \nin flames on the day of 9/11. This place provided a staging area for \nmany of the relief efforts that happened on that day and succeeding \ndays. Now it is a place where the community of Westport, the State of \nConnecticut, and the world can remember that tragedy and the people who \nlost their lives. It is also the place where every year Connecticut \ngathers to honor their memories and their families.\n  Many come--as some did yesterday--with very mixed feelings. The \nrecent news, while welcome indeed, brings forth anew the agony of their \nloss. I know there are mixed feelings because I talked, a short while \nago, with Lee Hanson, who is the father of Peter Hanson. Peter, his \nwife Sue Kim and their daughter Christine Lee Hanson all lost their \nlives on that day. Christine was only two and a half years old. People \ncame to that place yesterday and on many other days to pay their \nrespects and reflect on the tragedy of 9/11. They have felt \nambivalence, mixed feelings, and their grief is renewed. For them there \nis no celebration because the legacy of their loss remains.\n  At the memorial, on a granite marker in Westport, there reads the \nfollowing:\n\n       The citizens of Connecticut dedicate this living memorial \n     to the thousands of innocent lives lost on September 11, \n     2001, and to the families that loved them.\n\n  Today, while there are many voices who celebrate this victory--and \nrightly so--there are voices that are harder to hear, perhaps unheard: \nthe victims and their families whose memory I wish to honor today. I \nwanted to take a moment of our time to recognize those that cannot \nspeak, but in whose memory justice was served.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the names of \nthose 152 men and women from Connecticut who died on September 11, \n2001, as they are recorded on the memorial that honors their legacy at \nSherwood Island.\n\n[[Page S2603]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Connecticut Victims on September 11th, 2001\n\n\n      First Row of Stones (South or Left looking toward Monument)\n\n       Richard M.

Mr. President, we should be ever mindful of the \npeople whose lives have been changed forever. The families of the \nvictims and survivors need our help. Their children may have grown. \nSome may have children of their own. Their lives have moved on. Some \nhave come to peace. But their lives, like the lives of the emergency \nresponders who ran into the buildings--the firefighters, the police--\nhave been changed forever. Whether by maintaining a memorial in your \ncommunity, helping to meet the needs of their children, or just \nlistening to their voices, it is an honor to help those who have \nalready given so much.\n  Many questions will arise in the days ahead over what will be the \ncourse of action for our Nation, but today let us give pause and \nreflect on how America's military has kept focused on justice for the \nvictims of terror for almost 10 years. We have lost many servicemen and \nwomen in the line of duty and many more have been injured in this war. \nThe lives of our veterans who have fought and served and sacrificed in \nthe war on terror have been changed forever. We owe it to them to never \nforget as we celebrate this victory. We owe it to our veterans who have \nserved and sacrificed to honor that service, not just in rhetoric but \nin deed. Our veterans have fought for a Nation that keeps faith with \nthem.\n  We must make sure to leave no veteran behind in education, jobs, and \nhealth care--to provide for them what we have obligated and promised to \nprovide. While we hope for peace from this day forward, we must do \neverything we can to support the brave American men and women in \nuniform and those of our allies whose relentless service and sacrifice \nhave helped us to win this victory. So too do we support the brave \nfirst responders who are always poised, always ready, to respond when \ntheir city, State or the Nation calls. They should know they each have \nthe thanks of a grateful Nation.\n  My hope is that the memory of the victims of 9/11 will bring us \ntogether in a time of unity and purpose just as that heinous act did on \nthat day almost 10 years ago. The brutal murderers of September 11, \n2001, hit the World Trade Center and hit the Pentagon, but they missed \nAmerica, as was remarked at the time. They missed what makes America \ngreat. They brought us together in a time that we can remember with \npride because it was a time of resolve and unity.\n  I hope the memory of those victims--the 152 from Connecticut and \nthousands more from around the country--as well as their families can \nbring us together now in a renewed sense of unity and purpose to face \nthe challenges that lie ahead.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, late on Sunday evening, the world was told \nof news we had been waiting to hear for almost 10 years. Osama bin \nLaden was a murderer who devoted his life to the destruction of \nfreedom, democracy, and our way of life. His death is an important \nmilestone in the fight against global extremist violence and a relief \nto the millions of Americans and others around the world who have felt \nhis murderous destruction.\n  I, first and foremost, wish to thank the military and the \nintelligence professionals who carried out this daring\n\n[[Page S2604]]\n\nmission, which was executed flawlessly and will go down in our history \nbooks as to how we should do our work.\n  I wish to take a moment to compliment all of our military and \nintelligence people who were involved in this effort. I take great \npride in representing the State of Maryland and our intelligence \nagencies that are located at Fort Meade. They do incredible work for \nour national security and for our Nation. They do a lot of work that \nkeeps us safe, but they can never issue a press release because of the \nnature of their work. Many times I believe their work goes basically \nunappreciated by the vast majority of Americans. But I wish to take a \nmoment to congratulate all the men and women in our intelligence \nagencies and in our military who have devoted their lives to keeping us \nsafe. This mission demonstrates the type of work they do in order to \nmake this a safer nation.\n  This successful interagency operation illustrates intelligence \nsharing at its best and the commitment of the men and women of our \nArmed Forces as well as our political leadership. As you know, after \nthe attack on our country on September 11, we had commissions do work, \nwe had a lot of congressional investigations, and there was one theme \nthat came out very clearly in regard to the way we collected \nintelligence information to keep this Nation safe; that is, there was \ntoo much stovepiping and not enough sharing of information. Information \nthat could have been shared, that could have been used in a way to keep \nus safe was not. This effort demonstrates the advantages of sharing \ninformation. Our intelligence agencies acted upon information that was \nmade available through various sources and using that to be able to \nconduct this mission.\n  Truly, bin Laden was brought to justice as a result of President \nObama's deliberative planning, coordination, and communication, his \nleadership, partnership, and dogged persistence. Because of that, we \nwere able to accomplish this mission.\n  I wish to congratulate President Obama. He had to make a tough call. \nThe intelligence information was not conclusive. Much of it was \ncircumstantial. Yet he evaluated the best information we had to \ndetermine that bin Laden was at this location. He then had to make \nanother tough choice, as to what type of mission to use--whether to use \na sophisticated bomb in order to destroy the property, which would have \ncaused the loss of some innocent life, or whether to use a higher risk \nmission of sending our SEALs into Pakistan. The President made the \nright call. He made the right decision, and I congratulate him on his \nleadership.\n  All Americans were affected by bin Laden's evil actions. We all \nremember that fateful day in September of 2001. I was on the other side \nof the Capitol as a Congressman in my office in the Rayburn Building. I \nremember receiving information that we thought there was a plane that \ncould be heading to our own building. The Capitol Police ushered us out \nof the building so we could try to get out of harm's way. We all began \nto understand our Nation was under attack and the world was changing.\n  While we are still living in that changed world, this event reminds \nus again the strength of America is freedom and that its persistence \ncan prevail. As a lifelong proponent of human rights, I know we do not \nrejoice in killing, but this death rids the world of a man who was \ncommitted to intolerance, destruction, hatred, and the desecration of \nhuman dignity. Bringing bin Laden to justice helps heal the wounds of \nthose who lost their loved ones and to a nation who lived through 9/11.\n  We must remain vigilant as the fight against al-Qaida and other \nextremists goes on. While al-Qaida is increasingly marginalized--\nparticularly as we see so many in the Arab world exercise their desires \nfor change--the threat posed by terrorist organizations will remain \nwith us. We must remain on our highest guard, working with our allies \naround the world, in order to fight these extremists.\n  Once again, I wish to congratulate the tremendous efforts of our \nPresident, our military, and our intelligence community, especially as \ntheir hard work continues, and may this event bring some sense of peace \nto the families affected by bin Laden's evil, as well as to all in the \nworld who love freedom and peace.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time spent in quorum \ncalls be equally charged against the majority and the minority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/03/senate-section/article/S2604-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2604-S2610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  HONORING THE MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY WHO \n          CARRIED OUT THE MISSION THAT KILLED OSAMA BIN LADEN\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 159) honoring the members of the \n     military and intelligence community who carried out the \n     mission that killed Osama bin Laden, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, at 10 o'clock Sunday night, I was at the \nterminal at the Detroit airport, and there I had gone through the usual \nairport security drill--shoes off, liquids in plastic bags, and all the \nother inconveniences designed to keep us safe. It was at that same \nairport on Christmas of 2009 that a would-be terrorist sought to bomb \nan airliner. So I was surrounded by reminders, large and small, of how \nthe threat of terrorism has affected our lives when Defense Secretary \nGates called me with the momentous news that our forces had succeeded \nin raiding a compound in Pakistan and killing Osama bin Laden.\n  A few hours later, my wife Barbara and I joined a different scene--\nthousands of cheering young people waving American flags and singing \npatriotic songs in the early morning darkness outside the White House--\npart of an outpouring of relief and emotion across the Nation. What had \nhappened is Osama bin Laden could not avoid the long memory and the \nlong arm of justice, and he could not hope to triumph against the \nindomitable spirit of the American people.\n  The news President Obama delivered to the Nation on Sunday evening \ngives us many reasons to reflect. We should first turn to those who \nstill carry the grief and loss of that September morning about 10 years \nago--to those who had lost loved ones in the fight against terror and \nthe years since and to those who carry wounds of body, mind or spirit \nfrom that war. The death of Osama bin Laden cannot bring back the lives \nlost through his monstrous acts, but it can, I hope, bring some measure \nof relief from those lost.\n  We first turn, with thanks and admiration, to the men and women of \nour Armed Forces and the intelligence community. For them and their \nfamilies, the last decade has been one of long separations, \nuncertainty, and danger. Yet time and time again they have answered \ntheir Nation's call with courage, with competence, and with skill. Once \nagain, they have earned our utmost gratitude.\n  We should also commend the President for his courage and for his care \nin ordering a military mission to capture or kill Osama bin Laden. \nThere was no direct evidence that bin Laden was in the compound that \nthe CIA had determined housed two al-Qaida couriers. Instead, the \nevidence was circumstantial, and there were differing views within the \nintelligence community as to the likelihood that bin Laden or perhaps \nsome other high-value target was there. Moreover, the mission required \nthe military helicopters to enter into Pakistani airspace, to land in \nPakistan's sovereign territory, and for Navy SEALs to use lethal force \non a compound in a city that was home to two Pakistani armed regiments. \nThe President courageously rejected the alternative options of \nlaunching a bombing mission or waiting until there was more evidence of \nbin Laden's presence. He rejected both of those alternatives.\n  With his bold decision and with the heroism and skill of our military \nand intelligence professionals, our Nation\n\n[[Page S2605]]\n\nstruck a tremendous blow not just against a single depraved individual \nbut against the hateful ideology he espoused. Let there be no mistake, \nal-Qaida is weaker today. Its leader is dead and so is the myth \nsurrounding him.\n  Osama bin Laden sent his followers to hide in dark, dank mountain \ncaves and often to their own suicides, from the comfort of his million-\ndollar villa. His death has dealt al-Qaida a major blow. The mystique \nof Osama bin Laden has been punctured.\n  The victory over hate-inspired terrorism is not yet complete. Our \nsuccessful mission against bin Laden will no doubt lead to al-Qaida's \nremaining leaders issuing calls for retaliation. It is critical our \nintelligence and military strength continue to seek out those elements \nand franchises of al-Qaida that remain in Afghanistan, Pakistan, the \nArabian Peninsula, Africa, and other places, such as al-Qaida in the \nArabian Peninsula in Yemen. The threat may be diminished, but it \nremains.\n  Further, it is critical we ensure our military and intelligence \ncommunities continue to adapt to the threat of our irregular and \nunconventional enemy. The interagency cooperation that helped make this \nmission a success is impressive, and it remains a potent weapon in our \neffort to weaken the al-Qaida network.\n  This is an effort worthy not just of this Nation but of all nations. \nThat is why it is important that we find answers to the significant \nquestions raised by the news from Sunday night. Thirty-five miles from \nthe Pakistani capital and a comfortable walk from the Pakistani \nmilitary's most important academy, in a town where the Pakistani \nmilitary and intelligence services own a large share of the property, \nal-Qaida appears to have built a massive complex, ringed by walls as \nhigh as 18 feet, protected by barbed wire, as the dedicated hiding \nplace for Osama bin Laden. It is difficult to believe all this occurred \nwithout at least arousing the suspicions of Pakistan's security forces \nor their local officials.\n  The American people, who have provided billions of dollars of aid to \nthe Pakistani Government, deserve to know whether elements of \nPakistan's military and intelligence services or local officials knew \nof bin Laden's location over the 5 years or so he was there and if they \ndid not know, how that could possibly be the case. Hopefully just as \nimportant, the Pakistani people deserve these answers, for they have \nsuffered greatly from al-Qaida's violent extremism. Assassinations, \nbombings, death of civilian and military personnel alike--all these \nlosses show that al-Qaida and its hate-filled terrorism and its \nterrorist allies threaten Pakistan's very existence. I believe some of \nPakistan's leaders know this to be true, and I was heartened by the \nreaction of Prime Minister Gilani to bin Laden's death. He said, ``I \nthink it's a great victory and I congratulate the success of this \noperation.''\n  It is urgent that the Pakistani Government get answers to the \nquestions about what its military and intelligence agencies and local \nofficials knew and share the answers to those questions with the world \nand with their own people.\n  Pakistan can be an important ally in the fight against terror. It has \nas much, if not more, at stake in that fight as anybody. All the more \nimportant, then, that we openly and honestly address the questions \nwhich have been raised by the presence of terrorist No. 1, public enemy \nNo. 1, the world's enemy No. 1--the presence of that person in Pakistan \nin such a central place for all these years. It is important that those \nquestions be honestly answered so we can continue this fight together.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time for \ndebate on the resolution that is pending be extended by 15 minutes, \nwith the additional time being equally divided between the two leaders \nor their designees, with all other provisions under the previous order \nremaining in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. With this agreement, the vote will now occur around 3:45 \np.m.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this \nresolution and offer my congratulations to the men and women \nresponsible for developing the intelligence and carrying out the \noperation that led to the death of Osama bin Laden on Sunday, May 1.\n  This is perhaps the most important, and certainly the most stunning, \nintelligence operation I have seen in my 10 years on the Intelligence \nCommittee. I wanted to congratulate, first and foremost, President \nObama. As he stated in his Sunday night address to the Nation, he \ndirected Leon Panetta shortly after taking office to ``make the killing \nor capture of bin Ladin the top priority of our war against al-Qaida.''\n  When the effort to collect and analyze intelligence on this compound \nin Abbottabad bore fruit, President Obama made a courageous and very \ngutsy decision to order the strike, even though the intelligence \ncommunity could not assure him with certainty that bin Ladin was there.\n  At the operational level, the hunt for bin Laden and the read on his \ncompound has shown the greatly improved collaboration and cooperation \nacross the intelligence community and, of course, the Department of \nDefense.\n  The CIA has received and well deserved the lion's share of the \ncredit. The agency collected the human intelligence and carried out \nother missions that found and characterized the Abbottabad compound, \nand CIA analysts took the lead in analyzing and reanalyzing that \ninformation.\n  The CIA's Counterterrorism Center has a banner on the wall that \nreads, ``Today is September 12, 2001.'' It has been nearly 10 years, \nbut their perseverance and dedication has truly paid off.\n  I also want to recognize the efforts of the National Security Agency \nwhich provided signals intelligence and the National Geospatial \nIntelligence Agency which conducted the imagery analysis on the \ncompound. It was truly a team effort.\n  I also commend and give thanks to the Joint Special Operations \nCommand, or JSOC, the team that flew to the compound under cover of \nnight and conducted the raid. It was not a picture perfect operation, \nand changes to the plan were necessary as the lead helicopter was \nforced to land unexpectedly. But the highly trained and skilled members \nof the Navy SEAL team adjusted, reached their target, and they killed \nOsama bin Laden without taking any casualties themselves.\n  I was first briefed on the compound and the possibility that it \nhoused Osama bin Laden in the beginning of last December along with \nSenator Kit Bond who was vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee at \nthat time. Since then, the current vice chairman, Senator Saxby \nChambliss, and I have been regularly briefed and updated on the \nintelligence.\n  I thank Director Panetta and his team for keeping the Intelligence \nCommittee leadership informed. As one who is regularly critical of our \ngovernment's inability to keep secrets, it is very reassuring that this \nhighly sensitive and sensational intelligence was kept under wraps for \nmonths.\n  There is no doubt that Sunday's operation gives rise to a number of \nquestions. Among the most important of them are, one, what did Pakistan \nknow about bin Laden's presence and this compound in the up to 6 years \nhe was there? It has to be pointed out that this compound was eight \ntimes bigger than any home in the vicinity. It was just a quarter of a \nmile away from another home. It was a mile away from a major military \nacademy. It had razor wire on the top of very large walls, and it was \nvery large in itself. Trash was not picked up, it was burned. No one \nreally came in and out except the two couriers who went about \ndelivering\n\n[[Page S2606]]\n\nmessages from a distance from the compound.\n  It should have been an issue of curiosity, and neighbors surely would \nhave been interested in who lived there. Why is it so big? What is \ngoing on there? But there was virtually no reaction.\n  The second point is, what does bin Laden's death mean for al-Qaida \nand for the affiliate groups and lone wolves he has inspired and led? \nAs the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, I will be looking for \nanswers to those questions and get more of the details of the operation \nitself. Tomorrow morning, in a joint classified hearing with the Armed \nServices Committee, we will be looking into these and other issues. But \nthis resolution is about commending the men and women of our \nintelligence community and the U.S. military for their dedication and \nyears of work that led to 40 minutes of incredible success. It should \nalso recognize the fact that since 9/11, intelligence has been \nstreamlined, stove pipes have been taken down, and analysts have \ngreatly improved in their trade craft.\n  As a matter of fact, the intelligence having to do with this one \nfacility was red-teamed once, red-teamed twice, and red-teamed at least \na third time. The red-teaming process gives the ability of our analysts \nto debunk the intelligence, to try to indicate what might be a lapse, \nan ``inconclusion,'' a false judgment. It is a very valuable process.\n  This resolution also recognizes the measure of justice now delivered \nto those who mourn and remember the thousands of men, women, and \nchildren claimed as victims on 9/11 and in the other attacks carried \nout by al-Qaida under Osama bin Laden both here and around the world.\n  This will not end terror as we know it today, but it surely is a \nmonumental step to be able to put an end to the man who championed the \ncause, the man who provided the inspiration, the man who raised the \nmoney, and the man who was purely and simply the major leader.\n  Osama bin Laden is no more, and the time is upon us. I hope the world \nwill be listening to try to consider a better path, to move away from \nacts of terror, move away from the killing of innocent men, women and \nchildren, and become part of the councils of government, whatever they \nmay be, across the world, to debate, to discuss, to vote, and to put \nforward principled policies.\n  I very much appreciate the efforts of the majority leader and the \nRepublican leader in bringing this resolution to the floor, and I urge \nits adoption.\n  I notice my distinguished vice chairman on the Senate floor. I \nparticularly want to thank him, Senator Chambliss, for all of the \ncooperation we have been able to effect together.\n  You truly have been wonderful. It has been a great joy for me to work \nwith you, and I only wish I could give you a glass of California wine \nto salute this very special day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, let me just say that California wine \nbeing a favorite of mine, I am available any time. Thanks for those \nkind comments.\n  Let me just say to my good friend from California what a pleasure it \nhas been to work with her. The Intelligence Committee has always been a \nvery bipartisan committee, and nobody exhibits that more so than our \ncurrent chairman, Dianne Feinstein. She is tough when she needs to be \ntough, and she is fair at all times.\n  She and I have a unique relationship in contrast to the other \ncommittees in the Senate in that we jointly hire all of our staff, and \nshe has been extremely cooperative to me in the hiring process. Again, \nshe has just been a pleasure to work with. I have to say that Dianne \nand I have been on the committee together for several years, and I am \nvery proud of the work our committee has done and our relationship with \nthe intelligence community.\n  One of the big reasons we have the successes that we had on Sunday in \nthe takedown of bin Laden is because of the oversight that Dianne and \nothers have carried out on the Intelligence Committee and because of \nour relationship with the community.\n  It is not a combative relationship. We have the Director of the CIA, \nthe heads of NSA, the DNI, and others on a regular basis both formally \nand informally. All of that is done under Dianne's leadership.\n  Those are the times when we found out the needs of the intelligence \ncommunity. Had they not exhibited that and had the Senator not provided \nthe right kind of leadership, they would not have had all of the tools \nnecessary to carry out this very important and very sophisticated \nmission. So thanks for your great work. Thanks for your friendship. I \nlook forward to that glass of California wine.\n  I rise today in support of the resolution with respect to the \ntakedown of Osama bin Laden and also to praise the men and women of our \nintelligence and our military communities with regard to Sunday's \nsuccessful operation. We have been pursuing the world's most infamous \nterrorist for over a decade, but it was ultimately the hard work and \ntireless dedication of these professional men and women that led to \nthis significant achievement.\n  I am always proud of our military and intelligence men and women, but \nmost especially today I am truly proud of their great work.\n  As we approach the 10-year anniversary of September 11, I am thankful \nthat the families and loved ones of the victims of 9/11, as well as all \nAmericans, can have some closure. The leader of al-Qaida and murderer \nof thousands of Americans and allies can never again sponsor a \nterrorist attack.\n  It is also important to point out that this operation was made \npossible by information provided by enemy combatants that had been \ndetained and interrogated by the United States. There has been a lot of \ndebate in this country about our detention and interrogation policy, \nbut this is probably one of the clearest examples of the extraordinary \nvalue of the information we have been able to gather from the CIA's \ndetention and interrogation program. If we had not had access to this \ninformation, Osama bin Laden would likely still be operating undetected \ntoday. It is because of the information gained from these detainees, \npursued and analyzed over the years by the intelligence community, that \nled us to bin Laden's compound. It is almost unimaginable that he was \nlocated not in a cave in a Pakistani no man's land, but in a city just \nmiles outside of Islamabad with a large Pakistani Government and \nmilitary presence.\n\n  This is an amazing achievement and one that will be remembered for \ndecades, but we must remember that al-Qaida is a diffuse and \ndecentralized network that continues to threaten Americans both at home \nand abroad. A number of dangerous leaders associated with al-Qaida, \nincluding Ayman al-Zawahiri and Anwar al-Aulaqi, are still out there, \nno doubt plotting their next attack as we speak.\n  We also face a growing number of threats from other radical \norganizations and individuals, including homegrown terrorists and \nextremists. Although bin Laden's death is an enormous blow to al-Qaida, \nwe must make sure we remain vigilant in all our efforts to defeat \nterrorism and never lose sight of our objectives, which is not the \ndeath of one man, but the dismantling of all terrorist networks that \nseek to do us harm.\n  In closing, I want to again thank our intelligence professionals and \nmilitary personnel for their service and dedication. I also want to \nremind everyone that while this is our greatest success to date in our \nefforts to combat al-Qaida, we still have a lot of work to do and \ncannot rest until all of that work is done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of S. Res. 159, \nhonoring the members of the military and intelligence community who \ncarried out the mission that killed Osama bin Laden. I am as happy to \nrise today as at any time in the past 10 years--and it has been for the \nlast 10 years that I have eagerly awaited the moment when my colleagues \nand I could take to this floor and celebrate the news we got this \nSunday: that we got Osama bin Laden. Justice has been done. The world \nhas become a better place now that bin Laden is no longer in it.\n  This is a time for national unity and celebration. It is a time to \nfinally close a painful chapter in the history of our Nation, even as \nour larger fight continues. And, most of all, it is a time to give \nthanks and recognition to a distinguished group of our fellow citizens\n\n[[Page S2607]]\n\nwho will forever occupy an honored place in our history.\n  I want to echo my colleagues in offering my humble thanks to the \nbrave men who carried out the daring operation, as well as to the men \nand women in uniform who enabled their success. I have been involved in \nnational security my entire life, and I am hard pressed to come up with \nanother military operation that demonstrated such sophistication, such \nprofessionalism, such precise and lethal effectiveness to accomplish \nsuch a momentous and consequential objective. I am truly in awe of what \nthese young men have accomplished, and I thank God that our Nation \ncontinues to produce heroic warriors such as them who are willing to \ngive everything, to sacrifice everything, to devote their lives not to \nthe quest for wealth or fame but to the service of a just and noble \ncause that is greater than their self-interests. We do not yet know \ntheir names, but we honor their achievements and we celebrate their \nheroism. They have made history and earned their place in it.\n  I want to offer the same praise for our intelligence professionals. \nIt is a truism that intelligence fails in public and succeeds in \nprivate. So it is a great day indeed when we can celebrate such a \npublic success of our intelligence professionals. There are men and \nwomen across our intelligence community who have devoted the past 10 \nyears, and many more before that, to finding bin Laden. Despite \nsetbacks and sacrifice, despite the loss of leads and the death of \nfriends, regardless of whether the trail was hot or cold, they woke up \nevery day and carried on the fight. And now we honor the fruits of \ntheir perseverance and sacrifice, even as they themselves remain hard \nat work--exploiting the new information we have recovered, analyzing \nthe new data, and setting up the next operation.\n  I also want to offer my deepest congratulations and appreciation to \nthe President and his national security team. I credit them with making \nthe elimination of Osama bin Laden their top priority--and for \naccomplishing it so impressively. Regardless of the myriad groups and \nparties and factions into which we Americans divide ourselves on a \ndaily basis, the killing of Osama bin Laden is a national triumph and \nall Americans should feel proud and appreciative of the leadership \nshown by President Obama and his team on this matter.\n  I specifically want to credit the President with ordering an airborne \nassault by ground forces rather than aerial bombardment. It would have \nbeen a lot easier to simply turn bin Laden's compound into a smoldering \ncrater, but it would have denied us the certainty we now have that bin \nLaden is dead. It took real courage to assume the many risks associated \nwith putting boots on the ground, and I strongly commend the President \nfor it.\n  I would be remiss if I did not also thank President Bush and the many \nofficials who labored with him for 8 years to do what has now been \ndone. I know it is one of President Bush's regrets that he could not \neliminate bin Laden on his watch, but he and his team should take \nsolace in the knowledge that they laid the foundation for Sunday's \noperation, and they deserve credit for that.\n  Finally, I want to say a word to the many American families for whom \nthis celebration is bittersweet because it recalls memories of the \nmothers and fathers, spouses and siblings, sons and daughters, who were \nstolen from them, and from us all--not just in the September 11 attacks \nbut in the many acts of mass murder for which Osama bin Laden was \nguilty. No act of man can fill the aching emptiness of a loved one \nlost. For that there is only the grace of God. But it is my sincerest \nhope that the elimination of Osama bin Laden--this act of justice \ndone--will help to ease the pain and bring closure to what has surely \nbeen a decade of torment, as we were daily reminded that the world's \nmost wanted terrorist was still free.\n  I also want to credit the families of the victims of September 11, \n2001. Had it not been for their relentless efforts and advocacy, \nCongress would not have established the 9/11 Commission and adopted \nmany of its important reforms of our national security establishment--\nreforms that no doubt were instrumental in facilitating the joint and \ncollaborative operation to find and kill Osama bin Laden. I could not \nimagine a greater contribution that the 9/11 families could have made.\n  Of course, the death of Osama bin Laden does not portend the \nelimination of al-Qaida or the end of terrorist plots and attacks \nagainst our country. We must remain vigilant in our pursuit of every \nenemy who would do harm to us and our friends and allies. And we shall \ndo so. But there is no denying that the death of Osama bin Laden will \nhave a significant impact in this long war. It will enable us to focus \nmore of our time and attention and resources on others who would do us \nharm. Perhaps more importantly, it will enable our country to look more \nfully forward--to focus more completely on supporting the peaceful \ndemocratic awakenings that are sweeping the Middle East and North \nAfrica, which are the greatest repudiation of al-Qaida that we ever \ncould have imagined or hoped for.\n  If there is any consolation in the fact that Osama bin Laden lived as \nlong as he did, it is that he got to witness Arabs and Muslims by the \ntens of millions rising up to demand justice and dignity, not through \nsuicide bombings and mass murder, but through peaceful change, \npolitical freedom, and economic opportunity--the very ideas that bin \nLaden's perverse and murderous ideology seeks to destroy. That could be \nthe truest death knell of al-Qaida, and I for one am very happy that \nOsama bin Laden got to hear it--just before a team of American heroes \nended his wretched life.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, Osama bin Laden's death is a historic and \njust victory for this Nation.\n  While this is a profound victory in the war on terror, our thoughts \nmust go to the thousands of innocent men and women who lost family \nmembers and whose lives were forever changed by the tragedy of \nSeptember 11.\n  The families of those lost and our Nation as a whole can take great \npride that our brave servicemembers and intelligence community \nsuccessfully carried out this mission. I could not be more proud of the \noutstanding men and women of our military who put their lives on the \nline daily to defend this Nation.\n  Each and every one of us has a deeply personal connection to the \ntragic events of September 11. At the time, I was West Virginia's \nsecretary of state. I remember staff coming into my office, and they \nsaid: Did you see what is going on? That is all they had to say, and \nthat is all they did say.\n  So many Americans have similar stories. We watched in horror on live \ntelevision as the second plane hit the World Trade Center and I knew \nsomething we could never anticipate and imagine had just happened to \nour great country. We didn't know how our lives would change, but we \nknew they would.\n  In West Virginia, similar to States all over the country, we are \nstill mourning those we lost: a former WVU quarterback and a WVU \neconomics graduate who were both killed in the World Trade Center's \nNorth Tower, a Parkersburg High School graduate, a young lady who \nperished in the South Tower, and a Marshall University medical school \ngraduate, a doctor who practiced, was killed when the airliner he was \non crashed into the Pentagon. Our thoughts and prayers will always be \nwith them and their families.\n  Just like our world changed that terrible day, it has changed yet \nagain with the killing of Osama bin Laden. It means something different \nto each of us. Osama bin Laden's death cannot bring back the thousands \nof lives that were lost that fateful day or the ones who have been lost \nat the hands of al-Qaida since. It cannot repair the anguish so many \nhave suffered as a result of the evil and hatred Osama bin Laden \nespoused.\n  But it is justice, and I hope this Nation and the families of those \nwho were lost on September 11 can take solace in that fact.\n  Let me also say I am so proud of the resolve, the strength, and the \nfortitude this Nation showed in pursuing the mission to its end.\n\n[[Page S2608]]\n\n  With the killing of Osama bin Laden, the United States sent a message \nloudly and clearly: acts of terrorism against this Nation will not go \nunpunished. If you seek to do harm to this country or if you plan to \nhurt the people of our great Nation, we will find you and, I assure \nyou, justice will be served.\n  While this success belongs to all of us, I especially thank the teams \nof people who united to accomplish this most important goal. President \nObama and his advisers completed the mission, and I congratulate him \nfor that. He was the one who made the difficult decision to order this \nmission, and he made the right call.\n  Immense credit must also be given to all the people in the \nintelligence community who have worked tirelessly to track down the \nworld's most wanted terrorist. I also congratulate Presidents Clinton \nand Bush and the commitment their teams showed in fighting the war on \nterror.\n  Finally, I hope we sustain the spirit of unity we all feel at this \nmoment to put politics aside and remind Americans that as a great \nnation, we become greater when we unite behind a common purpose.\n  For these reasons, I strongly support S. Res. 159. May God continue \nto bless the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I think most Americans are proud that \nthe man who orchestrated the 9/11 attacks and then reveled in the \nhorror of that day is dead.\n  Today, we recognize the dedicated work of the many intelligence \nprofessionals, law enforcement officials, and the many men and women in \nour armed services who brought us to this day.\n  The pursuit of Osama bin Laden spanned more than a decade. Following \nthe attacks of September 11, the Senate voted 98 to 0 to authorize the \nuse of force against al-Qaida--an authorization that is still in force \ntoday.\n  At the time, President Bush enjoyed the support of a nation united \nbehind the decision to pursue al-Qaida and to drive the Taliban from \npower.\n  We should be equally united today in honoring those brave Americans \nwho are committed to preventing further attacks upon our homeland.\n  While bin Laden and his followers were building their terror \nnetworks, we were patiently and diligently building our intelligence \ncapabilities.\n  Following the successful raid on Sunday, those who remain committed \nto al-Qaida and associated terrorist groups should know that one day \nthey too will share bin Laden's fate.\n  Some might think the success of this raid means the end of the war on \nterror. But as the President has said, the death of Osama bin Laden \ndoes not mean the death of al-Qaida. Our intelligence community and \narmed services must keep up the pressure on al-Qaida and associated \nterror networks.\n  Osama bin Laden launched this war on the false assumption that \nAmerica didn't have the stomach for the fight. On Sunday night, he \nlearned how wrong he was.\n  This week, America showed the world we meant it when we said we would \nnot rest until justice was done to those who carried out the 9/11 \nattacks.\n  A generation of patriots has pursued al-Qaida for more than a decade, \ndriven by the idea that every day is September 12, 2001. That spirit \nmust persist.\n  Once again, I commend the President on his decision to go through \nwith this mission. Above all, I thank the remarkable group of men who \ncarried it out.\n  Not to be forgotten are the thousands of uniformed Americans in \nAfghanistan, Iraq, and across the globe, defending America's interests \nas we consider this resolution today.\n  The resolution reaffirms the Senate's commitment to eliminating safe \nhavens for terrorists in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and we are reminded \nof the difficult work that remains. But today, those who remember the \nhorror of 9/11 take a certain satisfaction knowing that the last thing \nOsama bin Laden saw in this world was a small team of Americans who \nshot him dead. The brave team who killed bin Laden made their Nation \nproud, and they deserve the Senate's recognition and its praise.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I stand, as every Member of this Senate \ndoes today, I am sure, in support of not only this resolution but \neverything this resolution stands for.\n  The elimination of Osama bin Laden as a symbol of murder, of tyranny, \nof repression is an important moment. It is a moment that came 10 years \nafter it should have. If we could have found Osama bin Laden 10 years \nago when we were looking for him, 9/11 might not have occurred. But it \ndid occur.\n  The message for him and the message for others is you cannot hide \nfrom the forces of freedom and democracy. This was a moment when the \nforces of freedom and democracy triumphed over the forces of \nrepression. This was a moment when the symbol of one view of the future \nwas eliminated with the kind of violence he himself had perpetrated on \nso many others.\n  The President made a great decision to send this team of the best of \nthe best into this compound to find Osama bin Laden, to know for sure \nface to face that he was either going to be captured by Americans or, \nin this case, killed by Americans, to be able to take the hard drive, \nthe documents. The information he had surrounding him will tell us a \nlot about his contacts, and who knows what it might tell us about the \nnetwork of al-Qaida. The President could have made a decision to bomb \nthe compound. I guess we would be sifting through the ashes today to \nsee if Osama bin Laden was there. We might have been able to confirm \nthat, but we would not have been able to confirm all the information \nthe SEAL team was able to take with them. These are two important \ndecisions made by the President. I think the decision to bury Osama bin \nLaden in an unknown spot but with the kind of respect his own religion \nrequired was also another good decision. I want to be supportive of the \nPresident and the decisions made.\n  There are times when a Predator missile is the right thing to use and \ntimes when it is not. One of the things we see from the death of bin \nLaden is that there is value to capturing our enemies and getting \ninformation from them. That thread of information that began maybe as \nlong as 9 years ago finally was able to unravel in a way that made the \nconnection that needed to be made so that Osama bin Laden could be \nfound, so that justice could be done, so that the price would be paid \nby him, as it has been paid by so many others in defense of freedom.\n  Certainly, there are questions today about Pakistan, but there is no \nquestion that Pakistanis have died fighting alongside Americans in the \nlast decade. There is no question that Pakistanis have been the victim \nof terrorism. Hopefully, this will be a moment that brings all of those \nwho should want freedom to the same side.\n  I just returned from a quick visit to Egypt, which could very well be \non the right path in the Middle East, a path where, without violence, \npeople stand and want more freedom, they want democracy. That is not \nthe goal of the extremists of Islam, for whom Osama bin Laden became \nthe great symbol.\n  We do not believe Osama bin Laden has been in operational control of \nal-Qaida for some time. It would be wonderful if we find out in the \nnext few days that he was and the terror of al-Qaida would be \neliminated. I do not think we will find that out. But we do know he was \na symbol in a way that is unique, in the way he symbolizes this wrong \nview of the future, the way he symbolizes the wrong view of the \nrequirement that everybody living together be exactly the same. We, \nunlike any other country in the world, defy that view of the future. We \nhave proven like no other country has ever proven that people can live \ntogether in great diversity, that people can live together with \ndifferent points of view, and we can live in a society that still \nflourishes. Of course, we are the enemy of a world view that that is \nnot possible. It is not because of anything we have done to the \nextremists in the world community; it is because of who we are.\n\n[[Page S2609]]\n\n  Yesterday, the message of who we are was registered again in a \npowerful way as we all over this country and people all over the world \ntalked about what happened the evening before, certainly not only the \nSEALs who went into the compound to see that justice was done but also \nall of those who are willing to serve, those who could have been among \nthe elite who went in or all those who have served, the over 4,000 \nAmericans, including many Missourians, whose lives have been lost in \nthe last decade, in addition to the 3,000 lives that were brutally \ntaken by the operatives of al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden on September \n11, 2001.\n  This resolution that recognizes the courage to bring justice, that \nrecognizes the evil that was done by Osama bin Laden and his followers, \nthat recognizes the importance of freedom and democracy in a society is \na resolution I am proud to support. I am proud of what the men and \nwomen did for us in executing this well-planned mission, but also of \neverybody who serves every day, for all the families who have a missing \nplace in their hearts, for someone whose life was lost serving this \ncountry, for all the families who live with someone with a disability \nbecause of the kind of war we are in now.\n  I am pleased to stand here representing my State but hopefully \nrepresenting, as all of us do, the forces of freedom and democracy that \nwill ultimately triumph over the forces of repression and murder and \nchaos that one-world view would try to perpetuate. We recognize today \nanother step against that view of the world.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant Daily Digest editor proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, those watching around the world may not be \nable to see on their screens the scene in the Senate today. We have all \ncome to the floor in a way we rarely do. We have come this afternoon to \nexpress with one voice our endless respect and admiration for the men \nand women of our military and our intelligence organizations.\n  ``Resolution'' is an appropriate name for this legislation that is \nnow before this body. It honors the resolution to a problem that has \nlingered for nearly a decade, one whose weight has grown heavier each \nday on the shoulders of the families whose lives were traumatized and \nthe many more bin Laden terrorized. It honors the resolve with which \nour bravest stared down danger.\n  The world is still absorbing America's astounding accomplishment--the \nmission to bring Osama bin Laden to justice, one that began more than \n9\\1/2\\ years ago and was accomplished just a little more than a day and \na half ago. Mr. President, 9\\1/2\\ years after the worst morning in our \nmemory, we woke up yesterday morning to a world without Osama bin Laden \nand with a palpable sense of justice.\n  Our military and intelligence operatives are the best in the world at \nwhat they do. As they set out to kill or capture our most valuable \ntarget, they captivated us with their skill and expertise, their \npatriotism, and their professionalism.\n  A flood of thoughts and emotions and analyses have been shared over \nthe past 36 hours by many. As I said from this desk yesterday, the end \nof his life is not the end of this fight. It is a victory, but it is \nnot ``the victory.''\n  A lot has already been said about what bin Laden's death means. So \nbefore we vote on this resolution, let me speak briefly about the \nAmerican men and women who carried out this critical successful \nmission--a mission that was historically significant and tactically \nstunning.\n  Osama bin Laden was the most wanted and most hunted man in the entire \nworld. His was the face of our enemy and the face of evil. There were \nfew faces more recognizable to the American people and to the citizens \nof the world. Those who carried out the orders of the Commander in \nChief this weekend could not be more different. The world doesn't know \ntheir names. We wouldn't recognize them if we passed them on the street \ntoday. That is exactly how they would want it.\n  This is the newest proud page in a long story of the American hero--\nthe unknown soldiers, the unsung saviors who sacrifice for our \ncountry's flag and our country's freedom. They do not ask for \nrecognition, and they do not ask questions. They just answer the Nation \nwhen it calls.\n  Today the Senate stands in awe of the countless men and women who \nhave toiled in obscurity, in the field and in every corner of the \nworld; professionals who gather one small shred of evidence here and \nanother clue there and pursue another lead somewhere else; the men and \nwomen who, over the course of 10 long years, pieced together the most \nmeaningful of puzzles so that a few dozen of their fellow heroes could \nexecute an operation the world will never forget.\n  These heroes confronted fear with brilliance and bravery. They met \nthe worst of humanity with the best of America. The terrorists who \ncarried out the 9/11 attacks did so with cowardice. The Americans who \ncarried out this mission did so with unfailing courage.\n  No one has asked how these men and women vote or what their politics \nare. So we have come to the floor today to vote together on this \nresolution not as two parties, not even as 100 Senators, but as one \nbody representing one grateful country.\n  Mr. President, on this resolution, Senator McConnell and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the resolution.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Res. 159\n\n       Whereas, on May 1, 2011, United States personnel killed \n     terrorist leader Osama bin Laden during the course of a \n     targeted strike against his secret compound in Abbottabad, \n     Pakistan;\n       Whereas Osama bin Laden was the leader of the al Qaeda \n     terrorist organization, the most significant terrorism threat \n     to the United States and the international community;\n       Whereas Osama bin Laden was the architect of terrorist \n     attacks which killed nearly 3,000 civilians on September 11, \n     2001, the most deadly terrorist attack against our Nation, in \n     which al Qaeda terrorists hijacked four airplanes and crashed \n     them into the World Trade Center in New York City, the \n     Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and, due to heroic efforts by \n     civilian passengers to disrupt the terrorists, near \n     Shanksville, Pennsylvania;\n       Whereas Osama bin Laden planned or supported numerous other \n     deadly terrorist attacks against the United States and its \n     allies, including the 1998 bombings of United States \n     embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and the 2000 attack on the \n     U.S.S. Cole in Yemen,\n\n[[Page S2610]]\n\n     and against innocent civilians in countries around the world, \n     including the 2004 attack on commuter trains in Madrid, Spain \n     and the 2005 bombings of the mass transit system in London, \n     England;\n       Whereas, following the September 11, 2001, terrorist \n     attacks, the United States, under President George W. Bush, \n     led an international coalition into Afghanistan to dismantle \n     al Qaeda, deny them a safe haven in Afghanistan and \n     ungoverned areas along the Pakistani border, and bring Osama \n     bin Laden to justice;\n       Whereas President Barack Obama in 2009 committed additional \n     forces and resources to efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan \n     as ``the central front in our enduring struggle against \n     terrorism and extremism'';\n       Whereas the valiant members of the United States Armed \n     Forces have courageously and vigorously pursued al Qaeda and \n     its affiliates in Afghanistan and around the world;\n       Whereas the anonymous, unsung heroes of the intelligence \n     community have pursued al Qaeda and affiliates in \n     Afghanistan, Pakistan, and around the world with tremendous \n     dedication, sacrifice, and professionalism;\n       Whereas the close collaboration between the Armed Forces \n     and the intelligence community prompted the Director of \n     National Intelligence, General James Clapper, to state, \n     ``Never have I seen a more remarkable example of focused \n     integration, seamless collaboration, and sheer professional \n     magnificence as was demonstrated by the Intelligence \n     Community in the ultimate demise of Osama bin Laden.'';\n       Whereas, while the death of Osama bin Laden represents a \n     significant blow to the al Qaeda organization and its \n     affiliates and to terrorist organizations around the world, \n     terrorism remains a critical threat to United States national \n     security; and\n       Whereas President Obama said, ``For over two decades, bin \n     Laden has been al Qaeda's leader and symbol, and has \n     continued to plot attacks against our country and our friends \n     and allies. The death of bin Laden marks the most significant \n     achievement to date in our Nation's effort to defeat al \n     Qaeda.'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) declares that the death of Osama bin Laden represents a \n     measure of justice and relief for the families and friends of \n     the nearly 3,000 men and women who lost their lives on \n     September 11, 2001, the men and women in the United States \n     and around the world who have been killed by other al Qaeda-\n     sponsored attacks, the men and women of the United States \n     Armed Forces and the intelligence community who have \n     sacrificed their lives pursuing Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda;\n       (2) commends the men and women of the United States Armed \n     Forces and the United States intelligence community for the \n     tremendous commitment, perseverance, professionalism, and \n     sacrifice they displayed in bringing Osama bin Laden to \n     justice;\n       (3) commends the men and women of the United States Armed \n     Forces and the United States intelligence community for \n     committing themselves to defeating, disrupting, and \n     dismantling al Qaeda;\n       (4) commends the President for ordering the successful \n     operations to locate and eliminate Osama bin Laden; and\n       (5) reaffirms its commitment to disrupting, dismantling, \n     and defeating al Qaeda and affiliated organizations around \n     the world that threaten United States national security, \n     eliminating a safe haven for terrorists in Afghanistan and \n     Pakistan, and bringing terrorists to justice.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

McCONNELL\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof John ``Jack'' McConnell to serve as a district court judge in the \nState of Rhode Island. We have heard and we will hear a number of very \nstrong statements about this nomination. I would argue very \nvociferously that many assertions that have been made are inaccurate at \nbest and they are not shared by the legal and business community in \nRhode Island. In fact, Jack McConnell is supported publicly and \nenthusiastically by the two former Republican attorneys general of \nRhode Island, Arlene Violet and Jeffrey Pine. He is not opposed by the \nGreater Providence Chamber of Commerce, which knows him and has worked \nwith him. He is supported by our legal community and our business \ncommunity. He has received the strong endorsement of our leading \nnewspaper, the Providence Journal, which has a record of moderation, \nindeed if not conservatism, in terms of their judgments about judicial \ncandidates and some issues, but certainly moderation.\n  Later, Senator Whitehouse and I will respond specifically about the \nassertions and concerns, but I think it is time at this juncture to \nmake a few brief points about where we are at this Senate. We are at a \npoint where we might be crossing a bridge from which we cannot return; \nthat, unlike our previous history, district judges will be subject \nroutinely to cloture motions because one faction or another decides, \nnot on the merits but procedurally, they should not go forward.\n  Let me make a few points. Senator Whitehouse and I recommended Mr. \nMcConnell to the President after publicly seeking applicants, talking \nto attorneys throughout our State, interviewing almost every single \napplicant. We took this decision seriously, as you would expect. We \nknow it is a reflection both upon ourselves and upon our State. From \nthis pool of applicants we selected Mr. McConnell because we found him \nto be among the best attorneys of the State, a pillar of our community, \none of the most generous philanthropists in our State--and in most \ncases anonymously--and in many cases not simply writing a check but \nstanding in a soup line early in the morning handing out food to people \nwho need it, without acclaim, without fanfare. This is the character of \nthe individual, and character, I think, ultimately is the test of a \njudge. He has a true desire to serve this country.\n  Indeed, Mr. McConnell has practiced law for decades. He has never \nbeen subject to an ethics claim, a malpractice claim, a rule 11 motion, \nand most importantly he has never had a motion for sanctions filed \nagainst him concerning his conduct in any litigation in which he has \nbeen involved. He has a spotless record.\n  Moreover, we selected Mr. McConnell because we knew, based upon all \nof his personal background, his sworn testimony, that he will follow \nthe precedents of the law and of the First Circuit Court of Appeals and \nof the United States Supreme Court. This is not something we take \nlightly and it is not something Mr. McConnell takes lightly. We know \nand he knows that when you step upon the bench you assume huge \nresponsibilities. You have to not only appear to be impartial, you have \nto in every word and deed go the extra mile to demonstrate that \nimpartiality, that you are not favoring anyone. He is prepared to do \nthat. In fact, I think that is part and parcel of the nature of this \ngentleman.\n  Now, we have to stop here and ask ourselves collectively, do we want \nto go ahead and take this step of cloture for district court nominees? \nDo we really want to add another front in the battle of partisan \npolitical ``gotcha''? Do they really want to cast aside, for example, \nthe blue slip process which allows Senators from a home State, \nparticularly with a district judge, to say yea or nay? It is a process \nthat has been in the Senate, in the informal culture of the Senate for \nyears and years. Do they want to deny a nominee who has been reported \nout of committee on a bipartisan vote three times, not once, an up-or-\ndown vote? I heard and I have heard for years--particularly under \nPresident Bush--many people coming to this floor and claiming everyone \nwho is nominated and comes out of committee deserves an up-or-down \nvote, particularly a district court nominee, especially a district \ncourt nominee. So this is where we are poised--to reject all of them, \nto enter a new dimension of controversy and conflict in the Senate.\n  We have a long history in the Senate of precedents and tradition when \nit comes to nominations, particularly district court nominations. In my \nState, my predecessors, men such as John Chafee and Claiborne Pell and \nLincoln Chafee and John Pastore, clearly adhered to those standards. \nAnd we have a record--a strong record\n\n[[Page S2611]]\n\nof judges in our State, and they have come from different backgrounds. \nThey have come from the practice of corporate law. They have come from \nbeing a former Federal attorney. They have come from being a \nsignificant and principal attorney for a major insurance company. They \nhave come from a vast array of legal backgrounds and professions. One \nthing they have had in common, and which is shared by Jack McConnell, \nis integrity and commitment to the law. And that we insist upon.\n  We have long recognized that these district judges serve a critical \nrole, and I think we all recognize, too, here as Senators that this is \na special role of the home State Senator. We understand that at the \ncircuit level, when judges have to consider issues of \nconstitutionality, where major policies issues could be resolved--in \nfact, finally resolved, at least for that circuit--we understand there \nis another added dimension. But with district courts, we have \ntraditionally recognized the judgment of not only the local Senators \nbut the judgment of the local legal community. And once again, here, \nboth the legal community in Rhode Island and, I cannot emphasis enough, \ntwo former Republican Attorneys General, who know him well, who have \nobserved him closely, have come forward of their own volition and \nenthusiastically supported his candidacy. They know him as a lawyer. \nThey know him as a man of integrity and honor and decency.\n  There are a number of my colleagues on the other side who recognize \nthis, and they have been very forthright in making the point about the \nprecipice that we are on and how that is not a precedent we want to \nestablish. I thank them for that. I thank them for their consideration. \nThey have literally adhered to consistently--not just in the past but \nnow--the notion that when a judge is given a qualified approval by the \nABA, when a nominee goes through the committee, comes to this floor at \nthe district level, that is when a vote should take place. And how you \nvote on final passage is a function of many things--your judicial \nphilosophy versus their judicial philosophy, your view of the judgment \nthey have and the responsibility a district judge has.\n  Now, I think we have again been engaged in difficult debates, and \nthey have been particularly difficult when it has come to the circuit \ncourt. I do think we recognize collectively that because of the nature \nof the circuit court, there is a difference. This is the gateway, and \nmany times, the cases never go beyond the circuit court. Constitutional \nlaw, principles that apply to whole circuits are affirmed by these \npanels of judges, and there is a different standard. But we have never \nreally applied that standard to the district court. We have relied--all \nmy colleagues have--on the ability of home State Senators, together \nwith their local lawyers, together with their local communities, to \nmake recommendations to serve on the district court.\n  Let me point out how extraordinarily unusual the vote tomorrow will \nbe. From our reference, talking to the Congressional Research Service \nand the Senate Library, as far as we can consider, there have been only \nthree cloture votes on Senate nominees for district courts in the \nhistory of the Senate--three times. Tomorrow will be the fourth. Oh, by \nthe way, all three of those individuals ultimately received \nconfirmation. It appears from our reconstruction that they were caught \nup in a procedural discussion of who should go first; this person \nshould not go first until others had been considered. All three, after \nthe procedural votes on cloture, were confirmed.\n  But it is quite clear that at least on the part of some, this cloture \nvote tomorrow is designed to stop and end the confirmation of Mr. \nMcConnell. That would be a first as far as we know in our \nreconstruction of the history of the Senate.\n  So we are facing this question, the question of whether we want to \nestablish this precedent, whether we want to disregard the record of \nthis individual, who is a man of integrity and honor, who is strongly \nsupported by our local business community, who is strongly supported by \nRepublican officeholders as well as Democratic officeholders, who has \ngained the trust and the respect of those who know him best, and who \nwill serve with distinction and integrity on the District Court for the \nDistrict of Rhode Island.\n  That is the big issue we face tomorrow. Later, we will come down and \nwe will respond to those issues of specific detail. But I can recall \nnot too long ago when there was a group of Republicans and Democrats \nwho came together and decided that these types of decisions should not \nbe subject to procedural defeats, but they should be based on the \nmerits. That was the Gang of 14's work on trying to pull together a \nconsensus on judges. I also know that both Senator Reid and Senator \nMcConnell are working with a group of people on a bipartisan \nunderstanding regarding executive nominations--not judicial nominations \nbut executive nominations. These are very hopeful and positive signs. I \nhope we can build on that process and not tomorrow take a step which I \nthink historically is atypical, unique, in fact, a step in the very \nwrong direction.\n  We will come back again, and we will talk about the specifics of Mr. \nMcConnell's nomination and these assertions. But all of these \nallegations cast, again, not only a cloud upon Mr. McConnell but on the \nABA process which looks very carefully at a candidate in terms of their \njudicial skill but also their character, their integrity, their ability \nto serve, and the process here in the Senate through the committee \nprocess.\n  So I would hope that we can favorably consider--in fact, I would \nhope, as is typical, that we would move quickly to a final passage \nvote, as we do with 99 out of 100 district court nominees.\n  But this is a serious issue. I fear we are on the precipice of taking \na step that will come back repeatedly to haunt us and undercut a custom \nand a tradition and a sense of this Senate which is necessary to \nmaintain, not to abandon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I know I am in Senator Landrieu's \ntime. I appreciate my friend's willingness to allow me just a moment to \nassociate myself with the eloquent and thoughtful remarks of my senior \nSenator and to urge all of my colleagues, before we steer this body off \nthe precipice to which he referred, to give his words their very \ncareful and objective consideration.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Louisiana.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I would like to speak for the next few \nminutes as in morning business about the subject that has been before \nthe Senate now for 5 weeks. In some ways, it is unprecedented that a \nbill of only 100 pages would actually take up 5 weeks of the Senate's \ntime. And you know as a member of the Small Business Committee, Madam \nPresident, how important, although only 100 pages and although only in \nthe law since 1982, this program is not just to the Federal Government \nbut to the taxpayers who are relying on this to spend their money \nwisely on their behalf, and they are looking to us to promote and \nextend the life of programs that actually work and return a great \ninvestment to them, particularly in these challenging budget times and \neconomic times.\n  This program, which was created by Senator Warren Rudman for the \nspecific purpose of stimulating technological innovation, encouraging \ngreater utilization of small businesses to meet Federal research and \ndevelopment needs, and to increase private sector commercialization of \ninnovations derived from Federal research and development, is a law \nthat we must find a way to reauthorize. We are well overdue. We have \nnow passed the authorization point by 3 years.\n  We have been unable to reauthorize this important program. It looks \nas if we may be stuck again although the major arguments about this \nbill have been resolved. We are actually not arguing over the nuts and \nbolts of this bill. Is that not sad, that all of the arguments about \nwhat percentage venture capitalists should get, by what amount we \nshould increase the allocation--we have worked through all of those \nbecause we have worked in good\n\n[[Page S2612]]\n\nfaith. We have compromised, Democrats and Republicans.\n  The bill passed out of our committee I believe 18 to 1. Authoring \nthis piece of legislation is myself, the chairperson, Senator Snowe, a \nstrong supporter of the underlying bill--let me get the other \ncosponsors. Senator Levin is a cosponsor. Senator Brown of \nMassachusetts is a cosponsor. Senator Kerry, the former chair, is a \ncosponsor. The Presiding Officer is an original cosponsor. I thank you. \nThe new Senator, your junior Senator from New Hampshire, is an original \ncosponsor. Senator Cardin. Senator Pryor. So we have a good number of \nRepublican and Democratic Senators.\n  This is the bill. It is 100 pages. The sad thing is that in 5 weeks, \nwe have had over 150 amendments filed on this bill. Very few of them \nhave anything to do with this bill. That is more amendments than there \nare pages of the original bill. And you can understand why the majority \nleader, Senator Reid, cannot allow a vote on all 150 amendments. We \nmight be here for another year, which is not fair to the Senate, it is \nnot fair to Congress. There are other important issues we have to get \nto. So we are trying to compromise. Senator Reid has been extremely \npatient trying to work with Republicans and Democrats. And I think the \nlast offer that was being considered would have made both sides even--\nwith 12 amendments, an equal amount, for both sides, most of which have \nnothing to do with this bill but that we will accept votes on.\n  Actually, one big amendment, significant amendment that had nothing \nto do with this bill has already been voted on, agreed to, detached \nfrom this bill, and sent to the President, and he has already signed \nit. And we are still on this bill. That was the repeal of 1099, which \nwas almost unanimously supported to repeal a very onerous provision of \npaperwork and regulation that was not proper to put on the backs of \nsmall businesses. And I am proud that I led, with others, the effort to \nrepeal that. That has been done. Yet we find ourselves still not in \ncomplete agreement that it is time to move on.\n\n  I just wish to say a few more things. No. 1, every State will benefit \nwhen this program is reauthorized. Most important, taxpayers will see \nsignificant results. Let me just tell you one that is quite startling \nbut true and I want it to be in the Record.\n  One company that participated in this program and received a small \ngrant many years ago and then received another grant to help them get \nstarted, Qualcomm, is now one of the most successful businesses in the \nworld. That one company pays more taxes to the Federal Government every \nyear than the entire budget of the Small Business Administration. Let \nme repeat: One company, started in large measure--not solely, but they \ntestified on the record in large measure--because of this program, was \ncreated. It grew and grew and grew and now pays more in taxes annually \nto the Federal Government than the entire budget of the SBA.\n  You would ask yourself: So what is the problem? Why can't we get this \nbill passed? I can only say we have Members who think they need to have \nvotes or discussion on 187 amendments that have nothing to do with this \nbill, and they think the majority leader is being unreasonable when he \ntries to bring this to an end.\n  As chair of this committee, I have to say again--and I am going to \nend with this--this recession we are in will never end--never end--and \nthe budget deficit that is crushing the economic potential of this \nNation will never be eliminated if we do not create jobs in America.\n  This program is a job-creating machine that is being shut down by \nthis inability of us to come to terms over this debate. It is a shame \nbecause everyone is counting on us--not just my committee, but the \nSmall Business Committee is one of the important committees here--to \nput this recession in the rearview mirror. I cannot do it if I cannot \npass legislation.\n  If we want jobs, if we want innovation, if we want to create the kind \nof jobs the SBIR Program--you can see here: SBIR-awarded firms add five \ntimes as many employees. These are kind of our supercompanies. These \nare companies, the smartest. They are on the edge. They are the best. \nThey have gotten the attention of many smart people in the government. \nYes, we do have smart people who work for the Federal Government. These \ncompanies and their technology have become known, and they say: Gee, \nthis is the kind of technology that could change this situation, save \ntaxpayer money, and it has such commercial application. Let's give it \nan award. We might not be able to give it an award because we are stuck \ntalking about 150 amendments that have nothing to do with this program, \nand the extension to operate this program expires on May 31st.\n  I am sorry I cannot solve all the problems of the world in the Small \nBusiness Committee. I am very sorry. I cannot solve all the health care \nproblems. I cannot resolve the debt situations. I cannot talk about \nsunset commissions and the Gang of 6 and put every piece of legislation \nin this bill. We have to stay focused. We have been moving some very \ngood legislation out of this committee, completely with bipartisan \nsupport, with a few little bumps here and there.\n  The small business lending program was not supported by the \nRepublicans. We only had two Senators who crossed the aisle to give us \nthe 60 votes to do it. I understand it is controversial. Not everything \nhere is done in such perfect precision, but we still have high hopes \nfor that program. Six hundred banks have applied. We believe billions \nof dollars will be lent out and that debate is still going on as the \nadministrators come up. But other than that, everything we have passed \nin our committee has been with bipartisan support. The same with this \nbill: It comes out 18 to 1.\n  I will finally say for the record--and will submit this letter for \nthe Record--I was asked by Senator Coburn, who has been cooperative \nactually--although he has had quite a few amendments, he has been very \nopen to negotiation--but he sent me a letter on January 26, and it \nbasically says: I would like to help you pass your SBIR bill, but would \nyou please get it out of your committee clean because I do not want \nother extraneous things attached to it because there are ``lesser'' \nprograms--he said--that I do not support. But I support this one.\n  He is not a member of the committee. He said: Senator, if you can get \nit out clean, then maybe I can support it on the floor.\n  So what do I do? I tell all my Members: I am sorry. You cannot have \nthe amendments in committee. I am sorry. We cannot attach anything to \nthis bill because I am trying to move a clean bill to the floor--only \nto get to the floor and have more than 150 amendments, most of which \nhave nothing to do with this bill put on this bill under the guise of: \nWell, we have to do it. We need time on the floor to debate our issue.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter I referenced \nfrom Senator Coburn be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                               Russell Senate Office Building,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 26, 2011.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     Small Business Committee Chairman, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu:  I wanted to thank you for your \n     letter regarding passage of the SBIR/STTR reauthorization \n     bill and oversight of the Small Business Administration \n     (SBA). I appreciate your commitment to review and eliminate \n     fraud within programs such as 8(a) and HUBZone, to streamline \n     federal regulations and their burden on small businesses, and \n     to eliminate wasteful and duplicative SBA programs that \n     increase our debt and limit expenditures to more worthy SBA \n     programs.\n       Thank you also for your letters, co-signed by Senator \n     Olympia Snow, Ranking Member of the Committee, to SBA \n     Administrator Karen Mills and SBA Inspector General Peggy \n     Gustafson regarding possible terminations of wasteful and \n     duplicative SBA programs. I applaud your oversight and look \n     forward to working with you and Senator Snowe to eliminate \n     waste, fraud and duplication within SBA and to help small \n     businesses excel.\n       I believe that should there be another broad extension of \n     SBA programs such as H.R. 366 in four months, any programs \n     that are not fulfilling their purpose, fail to consistently \n     encourage sustainable private growth, or have significant \n     overhead costs should be eliminated. I do not believe long-\n     standing and popular SBA programs like SBIR/STTR should be \n     lumped with lesser SBA programs. It is my hope that we can \n     come to an agreement before another temporary extension bill \n     is considered on what programs at SBA should be terminated.\n\n[[Page S2613]]\n\n       Again, thank you for your oversight and for your \n     consideration of my concerns. I look forward to working with \n     you this Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Tom A. Coburn, M.D.,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I have tried to be patient. I understand that. But I am \nasking one last time--I am asking my ranking member, I am asking the \nother members of my committee, I am asking my Democratic colleagues and \nRepublican colleagues--please, in the next few hours, please, let your \nvoice be heard to your leaders--the minority leader and the majority \nleader--and please try to come to some reasonable agreement.\n  I think the cloture motion is quite reasonable, the cloture motion \nSenator Reid has put down. If we could agree to that, get 60 votes or \nmore, we could move on and pass this reauthorization, which is so \nimportant for job creation in America.\n  We are 3 years behind schedule--not 6 months, not 8 months, but 3 \nyears behind schedule. We have been operating this program--a very good \nprogram, one of the best--every 3 months, sometimes one month, \nsometimes a bit longer, but people have to guess whether we are going \nto extend it. That is no way to run an airline or a train or a bus or \neven a two-seated car, for that matter. You have to have a long runway \nhere to get good things done and to stop wasting taxpayer money and \ntheir time.\n  So I am going to ask, please, let's try to get cloture.\n  Finally, the States that are most affected--the Senators who \nrepresent these States might want to be heads up--but Colorado, \nMaryland, Virginia, California, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Florida, \nTexas and Alabama are among the States that benefit the most from this \nprogram. All our States benefit. Companies in my own State of Louisiana \nhave received some of these awards and have gone on to hire hundreds, \nif not thousands, of people. But these other States have managed to \nactually get themselves to the front of the line.\n  I thank Senator Brown for his cosponsorship of this bill. I thank \nother Senators from these States. But the Texas and Florida and Alabama \nSenators, the New York Senators, the Senators from Ohio and \nPennsylvania, particularly, Massachusetts and California--the top of \nthe list--have a lot to lose if we cannot get this program \nreauthorized.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed in \nmorning business for 8 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/03/senate-section/article/S2613-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TORNADO SYSTEM DISASTER IN ALABAMA\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I rise to thank my colleagues in the \nSenate and countless others across the country for their outpouring of \nsupport and offers of assistance to my State of Alabama in this time of \nneed.\n  On April 27--this last week--an unprecedented tornado system struck \nthe State of Alabama, claiming hundreds of lives and destroying \nthousands of homes and businesses. At last count, 236 people in Alabama \nalone were dead, with thousands more injured and a lot missing. It will \ntake many years and potentially billions of dollars for my State to \nfully recover from this catastrophic disaster.\n  We have received calls from my fellow Senators, many of whom recently \nexperienced destruction in their own States due to floods and deadly \nstorms, with offers of help. To those who have reached out, I wish to \noffer my sincere gratitude on behalf of the people of Alabama. I also \nwish to thank President Obama and FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate for \ntheir swift response and commitment to restoring our State.\n  Their words of encouragement to disaster victims during their visit \nto Alabama helped ease the grief burdening local families, and their \nwork with Gov. Robert Bentley and Alabama Emergency Management Agency \nDirector Art Faulkner has provided vital assistance during these \ndifficult times. This continued level of Federal coordination is \ncritical to ensuring that Alabama gets back on its feet as quickly as \npossible.\n  I have never in my life seen such devastation to the extent I saw \nduring my visit to my home State of Alabama recently. Giant oaks lie \nflattened and splintered. Homes throughout the State were demolished, \nleaving thousands homeless and reliant on the Red Cross, the Salvation \nArmy, and others for shelter. At one point last week, over 1 million \nAlabama residents were without power--almost one-quarter of the State's \npopulation. It was gut-wrenching to walk through scattered rubble and \nrealize it was once the site of someone's home or someone's business. \nThe scale and the magnitude of destruction can only be described as \nhell on Earth.\n  In our State, while larger cities such as Birmingham and Tuscaloosa--\nmy hometown--suffered extensive damage, so did other rural areas. \nCommunities such as Pratt City, Pleasant Grove, Concord, Rainsville, \nHackleburg, Cullman, and many others also incurred the wrath of the \nstorm system and are now trying to assess the extent of their damage.\n  In DeKalb, Marion and Franklin Counties alone, we have seen nearly \n100 deaths. Virtually every part of the State was touched by storms, \nand all of us were affected. The pain and loss that families are \nexperiencing are still fresh. Many remain in shock.\n  However, we must also recognize that Alabama was not the lone victim \nof the storm. As we continue our cleanup and recovery efforts, so do \nthe people of Tennessee, Mississippi, Georgia, Virginia, Louisiana, and \nKentucky. Our thoughts and prayers are with all of the affected States. \nWe stand willing and able to assist you, as you have offered similar \nsupport to us.\n  I want to reassure the people of Alabama and all the affected States \nthat we will do everything we can on the Federal level to restore life \nas it was before. My staff and I are working with the State, FEMA, and \nthe other Federal agencies to ensure as quick and efficient a recovery \nas possible.\n  Thousands of Alabamians have opened their homes, donated supplies, \nmade contributions, and rushed to help in any way they could. After \nwitnessing the selfless generosity of complete strangers and the sheer \nresilience of those affected by the storms, I have never been more \nproud to call Alabama my home.\n  It will take a lot of work and help from volunteers, but I am \nconvinced that, together, we can overcome this terrible tragedy.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/03/senate-section/article/S2613-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2613-S2614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CONFIRMATION OF KEVIN HUNTER SHARP AND SKIP DALTON\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Justice\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam Presdient, it is with a solemn heart that I must \nhonor the life and service of a soldier from my home State today, SSG \nJames A. Justice of Grimes, IA. He was killed by enemy small arms fire \nin Kapisa Province, Afghanistan, at the age of 32. Staff Sergeant \nJustice died trying to rescue the crew of a downed helicopter that made \na hard landing in Alah Say District, Kapisa Province, Afghanistan.\n  Staff Sergeant Justice has served in the U.S. Armed Forces since \nSeptember of 1998. He was assigned to Troop A, 1st Squadron, 113th \nCavalry, Camp Dodge, Johnston, IA. He was deployed to Kuwait as part of \nOperation Desert Spring in 2001, the Multinational Force Observer \npeacekeeping mission in the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt in 2003-2004, and \nOperation Iraqi Freedom in 2005-2006. He volunteered to deploy to \nAfghanistan in November of 2010. In Afghanistan, he was one of \napproximately 2,800 members of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 34th \nInfantry Division.\n  Staff Sergeant Justice is survived by his wife Amanda Jo and daughter \nCaydence Lillian; his father and mother Larry and Lillian Justice; a \nbrother and two sisters; as well as many other family and friends.\n  Sergeant Justice's family remembers him as a caring individual who \nwas proud of the work he was doing for his country. He wanted nothing \nmore than to serve side by side with his brothers and sisters in arms. \nHis fellow soldiers remember him as a charismatic, natural leader and \nan integral part of his unit's community. The loss of Sergeant Justice \nis one that will be felt not only by his family and loved ones but by \nthe entire Iowa Army National Guard and all those that were privileged \nenough to have known him.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with the Justice family in this \nincredibly trying time. While words cannot express the debt that we as \na Nation owe to Sergeant Justice and his family, I would like to take \nthis time to remember the sacrifice that he made so that we can enjoy \nthe freedoms that this Nation provides.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/03/senate-section/article/S2614-3", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2614-S2615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JOE RICHARDSON\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, when most people think of how our \ngovernment works, they tend to think of the elected officials, the \nPresident, Senators, House Members, and of the institutions in which \nthey serve. However, in order for elected officials to fulfill their \nconstitutional duties, Members of Congress rely on many individuals and \ninstitutions whose work is vital to the basic functions of government. \nThese are individuals who often work in relative obscurity, but whose \ncontributions are often no less important than those of the more \nvisible actors and institutions who stand before the public.\n  I rise today to recognize one such individual who, over his decades-\nlong career of service at the Congressional Research Service, the \nnonpartisan research branch of the U.S. Congress, has had provided a \nprofound and lasting contribution to the U.S. Congress. That \nindividual, Joe Richardson, the food and nutrition policy analyst of \nCRS, will soon be leaving CRS and I, for one, feel that it is not only \nimportant, but vital, for Joe to be recognized for his decades of \npublic service to the U.S. Congress and to the American public.\n  As a long-time member of the Agriculture Committee, on which I served \nas both the chair and ranking Democrat on several occasions, my staff \nand I relied heavily on Joe Richardson on numerous occasions. He \nprovided technical assistance and professional judgment in the \nformulation of the nutrition title of the 2002 and 2007 farm bills, and \nalso played a key role in the committee's successful enactment of the \n2004 and 2010 child nutrition reauthorization. In each of these cases, \nJoe went above and beyond the call of duty--in many cases enduring, \nlike the rest of us, long, late night conference committee meetings \nthat would carry on for weeks, even months. As a result of his efforts, \nI can say with confidence that, absent Joe's efforts, the legislation \nthat we produced would not have been nearly as sound. More importantly, \nbecause of Joe's help, each of these pieces of legislation succeeded in \nits core mission--helping to ensure that millions of Americans are able \nto obtain a sufficient and nutritious diet.\n  Each of us, in one way or another, takes for granted the work of \nothers as we do our own jobs. This is not because their efforts are not \nnoticeable, but rather, because the efforts are so consistent and \nsteadfast, carried out with humility and without any expectation of \npraise or recognition. This is exactly how Joe has carried out his \nduties over the years. But I would be remiss in not taking the \nopportunity to stand up and thank Joe for his truly remarkable service \nto the Congressional Research Service, to Congress, and to the country. \nI have no doubt, after such long service, that moving on to new \nopportunities and challenges is not without its bittersweet moments for \nJoe. But I know that Joe can move on to these challenges secure in his \nknowledge that he has discharged his duties with the utmost \nprofessionalism and competence. He has been a pillar of the food and \nnutrition assistance policy community for years. For his service, I am \ngrateful.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I am pleased to recognize and commend \nJoe Richardson for his dedicated service as a Specialist in Social \nPolicy at the Congressional Research Service.\n  The Congressional Research Service, CRS, was formed in 1914 as a \nFederal agency within the legislative branch to provide Congress with a \nnonpartisan source of information. For nearly a century, CRS has \nsupplied valuable policy analysis to committees and Members of both the \nHouse and Senate, and it continues to play a vital role in all stages \nof the legislative process.\n  Joe Richardson has been with CRS for nearly 40 years and has proven \nhimself to be an expert agricultural policy analyst, particularly with \nregard to our domestic food assistance programs. These programs address \nmany needs of America's poor, youth, and elderly, and continue to be \nvery important in assisting our rural and underserved communities. \nJoe's contributions throughout his tenure have been invaluable in this \neffort, and his insightful input will undoubtedly be missed.\n  As a member and former chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, \nI have greatly benefitted from Joe's knowledge and experience. His \nexpertise has helped the committee formulate and pass a number of \nimportant pieces of legislation, such as the past several farm bills \nwhich authorize a wide range of agricultural and food assistance \nprograms. His timely reports and analyses have allowed Congress to \nbetter monitor, update, and improve nutrition programs as economic \nconditions change and the need for efficiency greatens.\n  We are forever grateful for Joe's service and commitment to \nagriculture policy and the U.S. Congress, and I wish him the very best \nin his future endeavors.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, from 1987 until 2002, I served as either \nthe chairman or ranking minority member of the Senate Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition and Forestry. The jurisdiction of the committee \nis quite broad. One important portion of that jurisdiction is food and \nnutrition programs.\n  During my years of service on the Agriculture Committee, the \ncommittee has considered several significant changes in the food and \nnutrition programs. However, one constant presence throughout all those \nchanges was Joe Richardson of the Congressional Research Service. Now, \nafter 40 years at the Congressional Research Service, Joe has decided \nto retire.\n  Joe's thorough knowledge of the history and programmatic details of \nnutrition programs was vitally important in those deliberations. \nMoreover, his cogent, thoughtful, and nonpartisan analysis was \nrespected on, and sought after by, both sides of the aisle, both \nchambers of Congress, and within the administrations of both parties. \nDuring\n\n[[Page S2615]]\n\ndeliberations on important legislation, Joe's willingness to be \navailable to committee staff on evenings, weekends and holidays was \nmuch appreciated.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues in thanking Joe Richardson for his \n40 years of service and wishing him well in his future endeavors.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I rise to congratulate Joe Richardson \non his pending retirement. Joe exemplifies the meaning of public \nservant. I have served as chairman and ranking member of the House \nCommittee on Agriculture, and today I serve as the ranking member of \nthe Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. All along \nthe way, Joe has served the Congressional Research Service and thereby \nthe Congress with excellence and distinction over the course of 40 \nyears. His focus has included the nutrition assistance programs, almost \nfrom their inception. From programs ranging from SNAP, WIC, school \nmeals, and faith-based initiatives, Joe is a recognized expert, a \nprolific writer, and unparalleled in his field.\n  A nonpartisan professional, Joe has been an invaluable resource for \nMembers and staff and has regularly been relied upon to navigate the \ncomplexities of statutes, rules, and regulations, and the myriad of \nforms public assistance has taken over the last several decades. From \nfarm bills to child nutrition reauthorizations and related legislation \nin-between, he has been a compendium of information on the ideas \ngenerated, efforts attempted, reforms enacted, and the effects and \nchanges to society our laws have made. He is a tribute to his \nprofession, and our Nation is a better place to live for all Americans \nas a direct result of his efforts.\n  I and my staff have greatly appreciated Joe's counsel. Whenever \ncalled upon, Joe would answer, be it during regular business hours, \nlate into the night, or early the next morning, always helpful, and \nalways forthright. I appreciate the dedication demonstrated by public \nservant Joe Richardson. Thank you Joe, you will be missed.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, as the chairwoman of the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, I know we will sorely miss the \nexpertise and dedication of Joe Richardson as we work this year to \nwrite the next farm bill. Since 1971, Joe has shared his expertise on a \nwide range of issues with Members of the House and Senate. He has an \nincredible understanding of social policy programs, and knows their \nhistory inside and out. He seems to know everything about everything. \nHis expertise has been absolutely invaluable to my staff over the \nyears.\n  In his four decades of service, Joe has played a key role in writing \nseven farm bills in 1977, 1981, 1985, 1990, 1996, 2002, and 2008. His \nunderstanding of Federal nutrition programs, which represent a \nsignificant majority of the farm bill, has helped the committee address \nthe issues of hunger in America and has helped keep millions of \nAmericans out of poverty.\n  While Joe is leaving us to spend time closer to his family in \nCalifornia, his work will continue to guide and inform us as we begin \nwork on the 2012 farm bill. He is a wonderful example of a great public \nservant, and I wish him well in his retirement.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, there is an old saying that ``where there \nis a will there is a way.'' That was very true of the many pieces of \nlegislation I worked on as chairman and ranking member of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee. The Senate Agriculture Committee has proven time \nand again that Congress can work together when it wants to get a job \ndone.\n  But I have to share with you that we had a secret weapon, at least \nwhen it came to the farm bill nutrition titles and the child nutrition \nbills. I know that we would have had a much tougher time getting that \njob done successfully without the assistance and technical expertise of \nJoe Richardson of the Congressional Research Service. Since 1971 Joe \nhas played an important part of nutrition policy discussions and has \nplayed a key role behind the scenes working on countless pieces of \nlegislation over these past four decades, including seven farm bills. \nAs a member of the Agriculture Committee during most of those 40 years, \nincluding turns as chairman and ranking member of the Agriculture \nCommittee, I have been fortunate to benefit innumerable times from \nJoe's institutional memory and impressive encyclopedic knowledge of our \nNation's critical nutrition programs.\n  Very few Americans have ever heard about the Congressional Research \nService, but for the men and women who served in the U.S. Senate and \nfor all of our staff, we know the important role that this branch of \nthe Library of Congress plays. The Congressional Service is a \nlegislative branch agency within the Library of Congress and works \nexclusively and directly for Members of Congress, their committees and \nstaff on a confidential, nonpartisan basis. The Congressional Research \nService, Congress, and the American people have been well served by Joe \nRichardson and his impressive public career.\n  For the last four decades Joe Richardson has gone above and beyond to \nserve the Senate and House of Representatives with his objective and \nalways helpful information and often 24 hours a day if needed. I know \nthat Members of both sides of the aisle have the highest regard for his \nwork, attention to detail, and dedication.\n  With the retirement of Joe Richardson, we are losing an important \nperspective and historical knowledge that I fear that no other single \nperson will be able to fill. To say that he will be missed is a true \nunderstatement. While I wish Joe all the best in retirement, I \ncertainly hope that he will make sure his replacement at the \nCongressional Research Service and the Senate Agriculture Committee \nstill know how to get ahold of him during development of the next farm \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/03/senate-section/article/S2615-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2615-S2616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WORLD PRESS FREEDOM DAY 2011\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today, people from across the country and \naround the world celebrate World Press Freedom Day--a time to \ncommemorate and honor the principles of freedom of expression. World \nPress Freedom Day was established by the United Nations General \nAssembly in 1993 and provides an important opportunity for us all to \nremember the journalists and other members of the news media--of all \nnationalities--who have sacrificed their personal safety, and in some \ncases their lives, to ensure the free flow of information to the \npublic.\n  The Nation's Founders prized and protected a free and vibrant press. \nIts prominence is found in the first amendment of the Constitution. \nSince the founding of this great Nation, American journalists have \ncourageously documented volatile turning points in our history and the \nworld's history. Elijah Lovejoy, the first of too many American \njournalists who have paid the ultimate price in service to press \nfreedom, remains a stalwart figure in media history, even today.\n  The International Federation of Journalists reports that at least 94 \njournalists and other members of the media have been killed in the line \nof duty during 2010. Countless others have been detained or arrested \nsimply for performing their professional duties.\n  In recent months, we have witnessed the troubling case of American \nand foreign journalists being detained, assaulted, and even killed in \ntheir efforts to tell the world about the democratic uprisings in the \nMiddle East. Last month, Oscar-nominated war-film director and \nphotojournalist Tim Hetherington and photojournalist Chris Hondros were \nboth killed while reporting on a battle between Libyan Government \nforces and rebels in the city of Misrata. In February, CBS war \ncorrespondent Lara Logan was brutally attacked and sexually assaulted \nwhile reporting on the historic uprising in Egypt. The recent news that \nOsama bin Laden has been killed--a price paid for his crimes against \nthe American people and the world--has focused even more attention on \nthe unrest in the Middle East. The efforts of journalists and members \nof the media in that region now have even greater significance.\n  Preserving press freedoms and freedom of expression remains one of my \nhighest legislative priorities as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. \nThat is why I have once again joined with Republican Senator John \nCornyn to introduce the Faster FOIA Act. This bill would create a \nbipartisan Commission\n\n[[Page S2616]]\n\nto help ensure that the Freedom of Information Act one of the most \nimportant tools by which the press can obtain critical information \nabout what our government is doing is not hindered by excessive delays.\n  A few days ago, President Obama observed that ``in the last months, \nwe've seen journalists threatened, arrested, beaten, attacked, and in \nsome cases even killed simply for doing their best to bring us the \nstory, to give people a voice, and to hold leaders accountable. And \nthrough it all, we've seen daring men and women risk their lives for \nthe simple idea that no one should be silenced, and everyone deserves \nto know the truth.''\n  As we celebrate World Press Freedom Day, we are reminded that an open \nand accountable society comes with not only the right of its citizens \nto know the truth but the duty to empower themselves with that \nknowledge. All of us--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--have an \ninterest in preserving press freedoms and protecting the public's right \nto know. Enacting the Faster FOIA Act will help to accomplish this \ngoal. For this reason, I strongly encourage all Members to join me in \ncelebrating World Press Freedom Day and in supporting this very \nimportant bipartisan bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/03/senate-section/article/S2616-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2616-S2617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF ALL AMERICANS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I recently joined Senator Durbin and \nSenator Graham at an important Senate Judiciary Committee hearing \nfocused on the civil rights of American Muslims. This bipartisan \nhearing was a positive statement from the committee that its members \nbelieve strongly that all Americans enjoy the rights and freedoms \nprovided by our Constitution and our civil rights laws.\n  Today, I wanted to highlight a recent column written by the U.S. \nattorney in Cleveland, OH, Steven Dettelbach, which addressed the same \nsubject. As one of our leading Federal prosecutors, Mr. Dettelbach is \nknown for protecting the people of northern Ohio by enforcing our \nFederal laws. But he is also known for his wise counsel which is no \ndoubt why the Attorney General selected him to serve on his advisory \ncommittee.\n  At the Attorney General's direction, several U.S. attorneys have been \ntrying to better understand the needs of American Muslims. This is a \nlaudable initiative, given that there have been attacks targeting the \nAmerican Muslim community in the past few years.\n  To make matters worse, some leaders have sought to sow fear and \ndivisiveness against American Muslims. Fanning the flames of hate \nagainst those with different faith traditions runs contrary to our \nAmerican values because this Nation was founded in large part on the \nimportance of religious freedom.\n  In his April 29 piece, Mr. Dettelbach wrote, ``Our enemies seek not \nonly to kill our citizens and destroy our cities, they also want to \nattack the most fundamental American principle of all--our free, open \nand diverse society. We cannot and will not let them succeed.''\n  I could not agree more.\n  All Americans deserve civil rights protections and the freedoms \nprovided in the Constitution. This does not end with the vital \nprotections afforded by the first amendment. It continues to ensure due \nprocess and equal protection. It is bolstered by important civil rights \nlaws that we have passed to protect the practice of religion without \ndiscrimination.\n  Religious freedom has long been a bipartisan issue in the Senate, but \nmore importantly it has been a consistent American value. American \nMuslims, like all Americans, must be protected by the rule of law that \nupholds these constitutional and statutory protections.\n  I agree with Mr. Dettelbach when he noted that, ``[w]e find ourselves \nfacing foreign-based terrorists, including al-Qaida, seeking to \nradicalize people here in the United States in new ways. Using sleek ad \ncampaigns on the Internet, these terrorists try to recruit Americans to \nattack their neighbors. We must counter these efforts, but must do it \nwisely and without sacrificing our ideals. ``\n  As the President said when he announced the news that the world's No. \n1 terrorist was dead, Osama bin Laden was not a Muslim leader. He had \nkilled scores of Muslims. I hope that in the coming days, we will not \nsee misguided passions lead to more attacks on American Muslims. In \norder to live up to our American values we must protect all Americans \nfrom attack. I thank the President and the Attorney General for their \nunwavering leadership on civil rights issues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Dettelbach's short article be \nprinted in the Record. I hope all Senators will read it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Apr. 29, 2011]\n\n                     Ohio's Muslim, Arab Neighbors\n\n                       (By Steven M. Dettelbach)\n\n       Those of us in law enforcement know all too well that \n     terrorists continue to target the United States. We have seen \n     the dangerous consequences take hold in places like Fort \n     Hood, Texas, and Times Square in New York, and even reach \n     here in Ohio, where our office and the FBI prosecuted a \n     homegrown terror cell plotting to kill Americans abroad. \n     Preventing these kinds of attacks is our top priority.\n       Our enemies seek not only to kill our citizens and destroy \n     our cities, they also want to attack the most fundamental \n     American principle of all--our free, open and diverse \n     society. We cannot and will not let them succeed.\n       We find ourselves facing foreign-based terrorists, \n     including al-Qaida, seeking to radicalize people here in the \n     United States in new ways. Using sleek ad campaigns on the \n     Internet, these terrorists try to recruit Americans to attack \n     their neighbors. We must counter these efforts, but must do \n     it wisely and without sacrificing our ideals.\n       Some, however, have wrongly resorted to portraying American \n     Arab or Muslim communities, or the Islamic faith itself, as a \n     threat to our country. While we must repel attempts by \n     foreign terrorists to radicalize Americans, vilifying Islam \n     or all Arab-Americans will not make our nation safer. Indeed, \n     suggesting these Americans are less loyal than their \n     countrymen is not only inaccurate and irresponsible, it also \n     adds an air of legitimacy to violent extremism of another \n     kind: directed not by American Muslims and Arabs, but at \n     them.\n       In the past year, a passenger stabbed a New York cabbie \n     after learning he was Muslim, and an arsonist in Tennessee \n     burned a mosque, among other examples. Such acts are not only \n     illegal, they are also profoundly at odds with one of our \n     nation's bedrock values: ``E pluribus unum,'' or ``Out of \n     many, one.''\n       Stigmatizing Muslim communities not only contradicts our \n     nation's commitment to religious freedom, it also makes it \n     easier for al-Qaida to radicalize Americans. Since the day a \n     band of religious refugees stumbled off their ship near Cape \n     Cod in what eventually would become the commonwealth of \n     Massachusetts, practitioners of every faith have come and \n     worshiped freely in this country.\n       Acts of violence and hostility against American Muslims \n     risk obscuring these truths and feeding the enemy's false \n     narrative that America is at war with Islam.\n       We must recognize that American Muslim and Arab communities \n     are a vital part of the solution to the problem of \n     radicalization. Terrorists do not radicalize entire \n     communities; they recruit individuals. American Muslims and \n     Arabs who recognized threats have worked with law enforcement \n     when they suspect a problem. For this we owe them gratitude, \n     not sideways glances.\n       In an effort to improve communication, collaboration and \n     trust with Muslims and Arab-Americans, I have been part of a \n     group of U.S. attorneys across the country having a series of \n     conversations to better understand the needs of these \n     American communities. The people of these communities should \n     understand that the Department of Justice is here to protect \n     them.\n       I have met with hundreds of American Muslims in Northern \n     Ohio over the past few months. Not surprisingly, they want \n     for their children what everyone wants--a good education, \n     freedom from bullying and the opportunity for their children \n     to grow and become productive citizens.\n       I heard troubling stories from parents whose children's \n     trust in this country was shaken by various indignities \n     suffered in our community, which they perceived to have \n     stemmed from their religion or ethnicity. This is wrong. It \n     is not the Ohio I know and love, and none of us should stand \n     silently by and tolerate such intolerance.\n       I heard from doctors, architects and workers who have a \n     deep love for their nation. I spoke with their American-born \n     children who, just like the youth in our Irish, Italian and \n     Eastern European communities, are working on their resumes, \n     fiddling far too much with their Blackberrys and who think of \n     themselves as American more than anything else--because that \n     is who they are.\n       Law enforcement alone cannot eradicate the root causes of \n     terrorism and hate crimes. Each of us must do all we can to \n     forge lasting relationships with our Muslim and Arab \n     neighbors. We need to affirm loudly that they, too, are \n     Ohioans, our neighbors in a wonderfully diverse state that \n     thrives on its many faiths, languages and ethnicities.\n\n[[Page S2617]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/03/senate-section/article/S2617-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2617-S2618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           2011 AMERICAN AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION STARS OF LIFE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I rise today to honor the brave men and \nwomen of the emergency medical services, EMS, profession all across the \ncountry who dedicate their lives to providing lifesaving health care \nand first responder services to people in need.\n  In particular, I would like to recognize the 81 EMS professionals \nbeing recognized today by the American Ambulance Association as ``Stars \nof Life.'' These 81 Stars of Life will be on Capitol Hill for the next \ncouple of days, and I strongly encourage my colleagues to take the time \nto meet with these exceptional individuals.\n  Every year, the dispatch of an ambulance is the first response to \nmillions of medical emergencies. Often, the survival of a patient is \nenhanced by the prompt medical attention provided by paramedics and \nemergency medical technicians, EMTs, prior to the arrival at an \nemergency room. As a result of the selfless acts of these courageous \nand devoted men and women, the lives of thousands of Americans are \nsaved each year. While these professionals do not expect to receive \nrecognition for their work, they deserve our outmost gratitude.\n  For the past 20 years, the American Ambulance Association has honored \nthose paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers, and other ambulance service \npersonnel who exemplify what is best about the EMS field. The American \nAmbulance Association has appropriately designated these individuals as \n``Stars of Life.'' Past Stars of Life have included paramedics and EMTs \nwho were part of the rescue efforts at the terrorist attacks on the \nWorld Trade Center or provided evacuation and response to the victims \nof Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the recent flooding and storms in \nthe South and Midwest. Of equal importance, this program also pays \ntribute to those ambulance service personnel whose heroic acts or \ncommunity service activities may not have made the news but were just \nas meaningful to the people they aided. I consider myself fortunate to \nhave met with many Vermont paramedics and EMTs over the years, and I \nhave heard firsthand accounts of the tireless efforts that they perform \non a daily basis for their communities. They are truly America's health \ncare safety net.\n  One of the Stars of Life from Vermont left a lasting impression on \nme. His name was Dale Long--a 2008 Stars of Life awardee. Just several \nweeks after I had the opportunity to meet him, Dale was killed in the \nline of duty as a paramedic with the Bennington Rescue Squad. Since \nDale was employed by a private nonprofit agency, he was not covered by \nthe Department of Justice's Public Safety Officer Benefit, PSOB, \nprogram--even though his agency is the 9-1-1 emergency ambulance \nservice agency for Bennington, VT. In honor of Dale, I introduced the \nDale Long Emergency Medical Services Provider Protection Act, S. 385, \nwhich would make paramedics and EMTs who work for a private nonprofit \nEMS agency eligible for the PSOB program. In February, the Senate \nunanimously approved the Dale Long Act as an amendment to the FAA \nreauthorization bill, and I am hopeful that the Dale Long provision \nwill be retained in the final conference report.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the names of the 2011 \nAmerican Ambulance Association Stars of Life honorees be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n           FIRST NAME                LAST NAME           COMPANY              CITY                 STATE\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDaniel.........................

Madam President, I join my colleagues to come to the \nfloor this afternoon and talk about tomorrow's votes on two different \nresolutions and to say that I am proud to join my female Senate \nDemocratic colleagues in this effort and to speak out about this \nimportant issue.\n  To me the American people have sent us a clear message. They want us \nto focus on job creation, promoting innovation and putting Americans \nback to work. But instead tomorrow we will be on the Senate floor \ntrying to defend access to health care for women. We will vote tomorrow \non whether to defund Planned Parenthood, an agency that serves hundreds \nof thousands of people in my State on important exams such as breast \nexamination and helping to prevent infections and various things.\n  And just a few weeks ago I talked about one of our constituents, a \n22-year-old woman from Seattle, who was diagnosed with an abnormal \ngrowth on her cervix at Planned Parenthood and was able to receive \nlife-saving treatment. She was uninsured, and without Planned \nParenthood, she would not have been able to get that kind of treatment \nand certainly her health would have been in major danger in the future. \nI tell her story to emphasize the importance of Planned Parenthood on \nprevention and that they are centers of prevention for many, many women \nwho have no other access to health care.\n  And so we cannot jeopardize the access to that preventive health care \nat a time when it is so important for us to reduce long-term costs. In \nfact, even in the investment area, every dollar invested in family \nplanning and publicly funded family planning clinics saves about $4 in \nMedicaid-related costs alone. So prevention of health care is good for \nus in saving dollars and it is certainly good for our individual \nconstituents who have a lack of access to health care.\n  That is why I am so disappointed and the situation that we are having \nnow where our colleagues are saying to us, you can get a budget deal, \nbut you have to defund women's health care access to do so. The \navoidance of a government shutdown has also brought on, I think, a \nchallenge on the backs of women in the District of Columbia because it \nincluded a provision denying DC leaders the option of using locally \nraised funds to provide abortion services to low-income women.\n  For those who argue against big government this is a contradiction \nbecause this is a real imposition on the ability of elected officials \nin the District of Columbia to decide what to do with their locally \nraised funds. I know because I am in the Hart Building, what the Mayor \nand others on the council had to say about this. This is an imposition \non the health services of low-income women in the District of Columbia \nand certainly has gone almost unnoticed in the eleventh hour. And I \nthink sets a precedent for a dangerous slippery slope with what we are \ntelling local governments to do.\n  But it is time for us to focus on our budget, living within our \nmeans, and getting back to work, but certainly not to try to do all of \nthat on the backs of women. And it is not time to shut down access to \nwomen's health care. Republicans in the house have decided to wage war \nand to say women should be a bargaining chip.\n  Well, I think the American people have sent us a clear message. They \nwant us to get back to work and they support Planned Parenthood and the \nefforts of Planned Parenthood on preventive health care and health care \ndelivery services. A recent CNN poll showed that 65 percent of \nAmericans polled support continued funding of Planned Parenthood.\n  And I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would like to \nsay that these funds are used and helped in funding organizations that \nmay be involved in doing full reproductive choice services. But I ask \nthem to think about that issue and that logic. Where will they stop? It \nis Planned Parenthood today, but are they going to stop every \ninstitution in America from receiving Federal dollars?\n  It is illegal for Planned Parenthood to use Federal dollars for the \nfull reproductive choice including abortion. It is illegal. You cannot \nuse those funds. And yet the other side would like to say that this is \nan issue where they would like to stop Planned Parenthood today and \nthen they will try to stop other organizations in the future.\n  It is time to say no to this tomorrow and to say no on trying to pull \nback from the full health care funding bill at a time when we need to \nimplement the reforms to keep costs down and to increase access for \nthose who currently don't have access to health care and come back to \nthe system with much more expensive health care needs in the future.\n  So I am very disappointed that at the eleventh hour of a budget \ndebate that is about living within our means, about how we take the \nlimited recovery we have had and move it forward economically, that \ninstead we are saying we cannot move forward on a budget in a recovery \nuntil we take everything that we can away from women and access to \nwomen's health care.\n  We will fight this tomorrow and I am proud to be here with my \ncolleagues to say we will be the last line of defense for women in \nAmerica who are going about their busy lives right now, taking their \nkids to school, trying to juggle many things at home and work and they \nare every day as the budget people within their own homes trying to \nfigure out how to live within their means and the national budget \ndebate has broken to this point? We can only have a budget agreement if \nyou defund women's full access to health care. That is wrong and we \nwill be here tomorrow to fight this battle and speak up for women.\n  I just want to point out to my colleague, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, \nthat I remember in 1993, in the ``year of the woman,'' when so many \nwomen got elected to Congress, it was the first time in the House of \nRepresentatives we had a woman on every single committee.\n  And the end result of that is we had an increase in funding for \nwomen's health research. So much of the research had been up to this \npoint focused on men. Why? Because there wasn't anybody on the \ncommittee to speak up about how women had uniquely different health \ncare needs and deserved to have a bigger share of funding for health \ncare needs of women than were currently being funded.\n  That is what you get when you get representation and the women \nSenators will be here tomorrow to fight, to say that women deserve to \nhave access to health care through Planned Parenthood and title X and, \nplease, for those working moms who are out there juggling dealing with \nchildren and\n\n[[Page S2619]]\n\nchildcare, dealing with their jobs, dealing with pay equity at work, \ndealing with all of these other issues that women are struggling with, \nthat they don't have to be a pawn in the debate on the budget. That \nthere are people who believe just like the majority of Americans do \nthat we should move forward with this kind of preventive health care \nfor women in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/03/senate-section/article/S2619-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING MAX VAN DER STOEL\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, as the Senate chairman of the U.S. \nHelsinki Commission, I rise today to pay tribute to Max van der Stoel, \nthe first High Commissioner on National Minorities at the Organization \nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe, OSCE, who died last week at his \nhome in The Hague at the age of 86. Van der Stoel, a two-time Dutch \nforeign minister, worked tirelessly throughout the OSCE region as High \nCommissioner from 1992 to 2001 to prevent crises involving minority \nissues.\n  Max van der Stoel had a life-long commitment to human rights. From \nhis early life in Nazi-occupied Netherlands to defining moments spent \nwith Soviet-era dissidents, van der Stoel was deeply affected by the \nabuses he witnessed. He described one such encounter, in then-\nCzechoslovakia in 1977, when as foreign minister he met with Charter 77 \nactivist, Jan Patocka in full view of Czechoslovak authorities. Van der \nStoel commented that, ``This support was of great concern to the \nCommunist authorities. After our short meeting, Professor Patocka was \narrested and rigorously interrogated. He died of a heart attack the \nnext day.''\n  Following the first gulf war, van der Stoel was appointed U.N. Human \nRights Representative for Iraq, and he continued to raise human rights \nconcerns in Iraq throughout the 1990s.\n  In 1992, he was appointed as the OSCE's first High Commissioner on \nNational Minorities, HCNM, with a mandate aimed at preventing conflict \nthrough quiet diplomacy and early warning to the OSCE countries. His \nsuccesses in that role are largely unrecognized, as they lie in what \ndid not happen rather than in what did. He traveled to countries where \ntensions were rising, encouraged dialogue, and made practical \nrecommendations to address underlying issues related to ethnic tension.\n  He worked in Estonia and Latvia in the early 1990s to address the \nprocessing for acquiring citizenship--which at the time disadvantaged \nparticularly ethnic Russians in the newly independent states because of \nstringent language testing. He was the OSCE Chairmanship's Personal \nRepresentative on Kosovo--although unfortunately his early warnings in \n1997 and 1998 went unheeded by policymakers. His work on inter-ethnic \nrelations and education in Macedonia resulted in the establishment of \nthe South Eastern European University in Tetovo in 2001, which is still \na model for integrated education. Throughout his time as HCNM, he \npromoted rights for Roma, the single largest minority in the OSCE \nregion as a whole.\n  His job was not easy, but his integrity, commitment, and diplomatic \nskills paved the way for his successors and built the position of the \nHCNM into one of the most effective OSCE tools for conflict prevention. \nHis legacy to the OSCE is not only the work he did as HCNM, but the \nadvice he left behind on the importance of early action to prevent \nconflict.\n  In his last statement to the OSCE Permanent Council in 2001, he said:\n\n       Governments should see the self-interest in protecting \n     minority rights and living in peaceful and prosperous multi-\n     ethnic states. The only people who profit from inter-ethnic \n     conflict are nationalist entrepreneurs. That is not a \n     business that reaps long term profits. In the end, \n     intolerance, violence and instability hurt us all.\n       I maintain that preventing inter-ethnic conflict will \n     continue to be one of the organization's biggest challenges \n     in the near future. Despite improvements in many OSCE states, \n     conflicts still rage and tensions boil below the surface. We \n     have to sharpen our tools and invest sufficient resources to \n     ensure that we remain on the cutting edge of conflict \n     prevention. . . . Collectively, we must do more to act in \n     response to the warning signs. It is not enough to admonish \n     States for falling short of their commitments. A concerted \n     response by the international community must be resolute, \n     targeted, and timely.\n       . . . When a crisis becomes acute, everyone wonders what \n     went wrong or what steps should be taken to contain the \n     situation. Things do not need to get to that point. While \n     Foreign Ministries seem to be increasingly sensitive to the \n     benefits of relatively limited funding, treasuries are still \n     hesitant to invest in preventing the conflicts of tomorrow. \n     We need to put our money where our mouth is. It makes \n     political and financial sense to put resources into keeping \n     multi-ethnic states together, rather than bailing them out \n     after they have fallen apart.\n\n  His words are as timely and relevant today as they were 10 years ago. \nIt is my hope that, inspired by the dedication and accomplishments of \nMax van der Stoel, the United States and its allies will strive to \nensure that ethic tension and human rights violations are not allowed \nto fester until they erupt into conflict.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/03/senate-section/article/S2619-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ROBERT McCARTHY\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, today I wish to \nrecognize Robert McCarthy of Watertown, MA, who is retiring after 23 \nyears as president of the Professional Fire Fighters of Massachusetts. \nAs a fire fighter, Bob McCarthy fought to save lives and property from \nfires and accidents. As head of the PFFM, Bob fought to protect and \ndefend his 12,000 PFFM brothers and sisters.\n  Thanks to his leadership, the Commonwealth's professional fire \nfighters are healthier, safer, better equipped and better trained. And \nof course, better equipped, better trained fire fighters mean increased \npublic safety.\n  For Bob McCarthy, fire fighting came naturally; you might say it was \nin his blood. Like his father and grandfather before him, Bob was a \nWatertown fireman, rising through the ranks to become captain of the \nWatertown Fire Department. When he retired from actively fighting \nfires, he dedicated his life to fighting for his fellow firemen.\n  Bob McCarthy served as the union's legislative agent for 2 years \nbefore being elected president of the PFFM in 1987. As president, Bob \nwas a highly effective advocate for Massachusetts' professional fire \nfighters. Believe me; as soon as an issue arose that impacted his \nmembers, it was usually about thirty seconds before my office phone \nrang.\n  I would like to note just a few of Bob McCarthy's many \naccomplishments as president of the PFFM. Bob McCarthy was a major \nforce in the passage of a cancer presumption law which protects \nfirefighters for 5 additional years after they retire. He worked \ndiligently to maintain laws pertaining to fire fighters' heart and lung \nhealth and to preserve grants for better safety gear. He played a major \nrole in funding critical incident stress management for the fire \nservice. And one of his greatest legacies are the biennial educational \nseminars which play a vital role in ensuring that Massachusetts' \nprofessional fire fighters receive ongoing education on the latest \nsafety issues.\n  Bob McCarthy hasn't limited his service to fire fighters; he was also \na valued member of numerous boards of directors of leading firms and \norganizations in my State. It is hard to gauge just how many people's \nlives he has not only impacted but actually saved. All too often the \nfocus is on what is lost in fires. What goes unreported is what \nprofessional firefighters save. Not only thousands of lives and homes, \nbut pets and items of sentimental value.\n  Bob leaves the PFFM in the very able hands of Mr. Ed Kelly who was \nsworn in as president last month. This evening, the Professional \nFirefighters of Massachusetts will celebrate Bob's 26 years of service \nto his community at their annual dinner. I join their 12,000 members in \nhonoring Bob McCarthy for his service to the PFFM and my Commonwealth, \nand wish Bob and his wife Dorothy all the very best in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/03/senate-section/article/S2619-3", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2619-S2620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FRATERNAL BENEFIT SOCIETIES\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise today to praise the work of \nfraternal benefit societies, little-known but critical nonprofit \norganizations that meet the needs of millions of Americans day in and \nday out. There are over 9 million fraternal members across the country.\n  Every day, their volunteers supplement the social services provided \nby overburdened government agencies--\n\n[[Page S2620]]\n\nserving children, the elderly, veterans, and others who need help. In \nthe past year alone, fraternal members invested 91 million hours in \ncommunity service and contributed $400 million to charitable programs. \nIn the State of Wisconsin, there are 252,232 fraternal members, and in \nthe last year, these members spent over 4 million hours volunteering \nand donated over $25 million throughout the state.\n  Fraternal benefit societies are tax-exempt organizations that sell \nfinancial products such as life insurance and annuities, and use the \nprofits to meet community needs. From a small Federal investment of $50 \nmillion a year, over $400 million is put back directly into \ncommunities. A recent study found that fraternal benefit societies \ncontribute more than $3 billion annually to society. The fraternal \nbenefit societies leverage additional community resources through fund \nmatching programs and by bringing people together to do good. These \ncommunity needs would not be met without fraternal benefit societies, \nespecially at this time of shrinking federal, state and local \nresources.\n  From acting as a first-response network in the face of natural \ndisasters, to building homes for families in need, to assisting \nfamilies struggling with overwhelming medical bills, to providing \nscholarships to deserving students, fraternals are dedicated to \nimproving the lives of their members, families, and communities.\n  Many of these societies have been around for over a century. They \nbegan, in large part to meet needs of immigrant populations that could \nnot otherwise be met--helping families when a breadwinner got sick or \ndied; helping a community member find a place to stay or meet medical \nneeds. While the organizations have evolved, today they still meet \nneeds that are otherwise not met. They help pay for medical bills, have \nscholarship funds, assist in neighborhood playground builds, clean up \nafter disasters, stock food pantries and bring meals to seniors.\n  I want to honor these groups during their annual meeting. I want to \ntake the opportunity to thank the 9 million fraternal members for all \nof the great work they do around the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/03/senate-section/article/S2620-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2620-S2621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL ALLEN E.

However, since the terrorist \nattacks of September 11, 2001, the members of the National Guard have \npulled double duty, becoming the essential soldiers in our military \nmissions overseas.\n  This new role for the Guard often means long and frequent deployments \naway from home, disruption to civilian careers, and new readiness \nchallenges for the Guard's leadership. For global peacekeeping missions \nin Bosnia, Kosovo, and for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Guard \nleadership has to ensure their troops have the right equipment at the \nright time, the proper training for uncommon dangers, and as needed, be \nthe glue that mends and holds together the families of Guard members. \nUnder General Tackett's leadership, the West Virginia National Guard \nhas received all this and more. With tenacious grace, the General asked \nfor--and received--new training facilities, planes, new runways, and \ncongressional backing for family support programs.\n  Under General Tackett's leadership, the readiness of the West \nVirginia National Guard skyrocketed to the best in the Nation.\n  Under General Tackett's leadership, the soldier, especially the new \nand uninitiated, took center stage. General Tackett believes a \nsoldier's success depends on higher education, the best training, and \npersonal initiative.\n  Under General Tackett's guidance, future leaders of the West Virginia \nNational Guard have a head start because of his dogged support for the \nNational Guard Youth Challenge Program, the Guard's Tuition Assistance \nProgram, and the technical skills program known as Helmets to Hard \nHats.\n  And, under General Tackett's leadership and vision, our Nation's \nGuard and Reserve components, Active-Duty servicemembers, and our first \nresponders use state-of-the-art training resources at the Memorial \nTunnel and Camp Dawson to prepare defenses in response to 21st century \nnational security threats.\n  Like other Golden Gloves champions, General Tackett struck his own \npath in his youth; he honed his individual athletic skills and refined \nthe meaning of a disciplined work ethic. His pride in his home State of \nWest Virginia kept him giving back to the Mountaineer State with years \nof civilian successes while rising in the ranks of the Special Forces.\n  His stellar leadership as Adjutant General for the West Virginia \nNational Guard began on September 11, 1995, under Governor Gaston \nCaperton. I would like to recall a list of his accomplishments in order \nto recognize the contributions of MG Allen E. Tackett.\n  Upon his retirement on January 31, 2011, MG Allen E. Tackett remains \nthe longest serving Adjutant General in the history of the State of \nWest Virginia and the United States.\n  As Adjutant General of the West Virginia National Guard, General \nTackett commanded more than 6,000 soldiers and airmen, including more \nthan 10,000 West Virginia National Guard, soldiers, and airmen that \nhave deployed since September 11, 2001 in support of the global war on \nterrorism.\n  General Tackett directed the West Virginia National Guard in response \nto more than 80 emergencies in the State of West Virginia.\n  General Tackett has served five Governors of the State of West \nVirginia, representing both political parties.\n  The West Virginia National Guard, under the leadership of General \nTackett, rose from the rank of 24th in the United States in readiness \nto first in an 18-month period, has continued to demonstrate its \nsuperior level of readiness as judged by the Army readiness criteria, \nand has remained at or near the top rank in readiness for 15 years.\n  Under the leadership of General Tackett, the West Virginia National \nGuard undertook a significant modernizaton program to ensure that \nmodern facilities are constructed to meet the demands placed upon \nsoldiers and airmen in the 21st century, including projects to replace \noutdated armories, build new hangars, acquire ramp space to protect the \n130th Airlift Wing from the base realignment and closure process, and \nto convert the Martinsburg Air National Guard base for a fleet of C-5s.\n  Under the leadership of General Tackett, the Joint Interagency \nTraining and Education Center was built to provide homeland security \ntraining to Department of Defense assets, other Federal agencies, and \nfirst responders at Camp Dawson and the Memorial Tunnel. As a result, \nhe was described in a 2001 U.S. News & World Report article as someone \nwho could soon be ``the nation's defacto chief of anti-terror \npreparedness.''\n  Under the leadership of General Tackett, the West Virginia National \nGuard maintained 36 armories and was present in 34 communities.\n  Under the leadership of General Tackett, the West Virginia National \nGuard has had a significant positive economic impact across the State \nof West Virginia, including the addition of nearly 1,500 full-time \njobs.\n  Under the leadership of Major General Tackett, the West Virginia \nNational Guard sponsored and operated the Mountaineer ChalleNGe \nAcademy, which provides at-risk youth with an opportunity to earn a \ngeneral education diploma.\n  And, under the leadership of Major General Tackett, 43 percent of the \nmembers of the West Virginia National Guard have earned a degree from \nan institution of higher education or are enrolled in an institution of \nhigher education and participate in the State of West Virginia tuition \nassistance program.\n  As his one-time commander, I am proud to share with the American \npeople General Tackett's distinguished and exemplary career, to take \nthis opportunity to publicly thank him, and\n\n[[Page S2621]]\n\nto wish him continued success and future happiness in his well-deserved \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/03/senate-section/article/S2621-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 VERMONTS' JUNIOR IRON CHEF COMPETITION\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, today I wish to honor the \nstudents who participated in Vermont's fourth annual Junior Iron Chef \nCompetition. Forty Vermont middle schools and 16 Vermont high schools \nsent teams to the day-long event, a cooking competition which promotes \nlocal agriculture and healthy choices in school nutrition. I was very \nimpressed, when I attended the competition, to see the creativity and \nenergy the students brought to this endeavor.\n  Vermont's Junior Iron Chef Competition brings aspiring chefs together \nfor a timed ``cook-off.'' Middle schools face off in one division and \nhigh schools in another. Each team is composed of up to five students \nand is accompanied by an adult supervisor who is allowed to offer \nguidance but not take part in the actual cooking.\n  Contestants must use their culinary skills to create original school \nlunch dishes using at least five ingredients produced by local farmers. \nPrizes were awarded in three categories. I would like to recognize the \nwinners from each category and commend the students from all competing \nschools for their excellent effort. Teams from Twin Valley swept the \nBest in Show prizes; Team Murdock winning at the middle school level \nand Hakuna Matata for high school. The Barre City Chefs of Barre City \nElementary Middle School won the award for Most Creative Dish for \nmiddle schools and the Food Fighters from Centerpoint School won in the \nhigh school category. The awards for Greatest Number and Best Use of \nLocal Ingredients went to the Barretown Bobcats of Barre Town Middle \nSchool and the Rebel Chefs from South Burlington High School.\n  In addition to extending education beyond the traditional classroom, \nI admire the competition for promoting local agriculture and healthy \neating choices. Junior Iron Chef attempts to change the often stale \nhomogeneity of school lunches by bolstering what is now a statewide \neffort, led by groups like Vermont Food Education Every Day, FEED, and \nthe Burlington School Food Project. It attempts, successfully, to \nreconnect young Vermonters with our state's agricultural roots and to \nrestore a bond between our schools and the food that Vermont produces.\n  Vermont is, I believe, among the leaders in promoting small scale \nagriculture. While Vermont has long been known for its dairy farms, \nsmaller scale agriculture is growing rapidly in our State.\n  Scientific studies have shown that the health of Americans is \nthreatened by an overdependence on fast food, on sugar-enhanced drinks, \non snacks low in nutrition and high in fats. Too often we, adults and \nchildren alike, turn to processed fast foods instead of eating \nnutritionally balanced meals. Our national diet is, unfortunately, \nresponsible for many unhealthy results, including a surge in both \nchildhood obesity and childhood diabetes. Creative efforts like \nVermont's Junior Iron Chef Competition are terribly important in the \neffort to effectively combat unhealthy diets and the rise of childhood \nobesity and childhood diabetes.\n  To the Junior Iron Chef Competition sponsors, Vermont's agriculture \ncommunity and its forward thinking school systems, to those who \norganized the event, to the adult supervisors, and especially to the \nVermont students who participated in the Junior Iron Chef Competition, \nlet me offer my congratulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/03/senate-section/article/S2621-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:04 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 362.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nmodify oil and hazardous substance liability, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, on April 20, 2010, an explosion and fire \ndestroyed BP's Deepwater Horizon oil rig, killing 11 workers and \ncausing the largest oil spill in American history.\n  A year later, the well is capped and Americans who live near and rely \non the Gulf of Mexico are still struggling with the ramifications of \nthe Deepwater Horizon spill, while facing destruction from \nunprecedented storms ripping across the region. Meantime, BP, the \nsecond largest oil company in the United States who just reported 7.1 \nbillion dollars in profits last quarter, is attempting to skirt their \nfines for this unprecedented disaster.\n  In early April, BP indicated it is exploring wording in the Federal \nWater Pollution Prevention Act or the Clean Water Act which allows the \ncourt to determine the fines by either the number of days of the \nincident, or by the number of barrels of oil spilled. Current law \nleaves the determination of which metric to use up to the court. In \nthis case, the difference between these two metrics is enormous. At the \nlow end, using the per-day charge of $32,500, BP could pay less than $3 \nmillion for the whole incident. This amount of money isn't sufficient \nto change BP's safety culture and improve its workplace and \nenvironmental safety.\n  Per barrel fines range from $1,000 to $4,300 per barrel. Under this \nmetric, BP's fines would total between $5 billion and $18 billion, \nwhich is a much more appropriate fine for the environmental damage that \nwas done.\n  We must address this outrageous loophole to prevent corporate \npolluters from skirting accountability and responsibility if they wreak \nhavoc on our land and in our water. We must speak the only language \nthat corporations understand and that is profit. These fines, which are \nthe only penalties the corporation cannot write off on their taxes, are \ncritically important to sending a message that pollution doesn't \nprofit; that corporations act responsibly to protect workers and the \nresources they use. If we accept minimal fines, we are condoning this \nirresponsible behavior.\n\n[[Page S2624]]\n\n  Many will argue that we don't need this legislation, because the \ncourt will fine them accordingly. But to date, the largest Clean Water \nAct fine ever levied was $13 million. $13 million is less than BP spent \nin 2009 on lobbying.\n  That is why I am introducing the Pollution Accountability Act of \n2011, which requires the court to fine violators of the Clean Water Act \nwhichever fine is higher, per day or per barrel. If you pollute, there \nwill be consequences. There will be accountability. We will demand \nresponsibility.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation and \nexpeditiously passing it into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 872. A bill to amend the Omnibus Indian Advancement Act to modify \nthe date as of which certain tribal land of the Lytton Rancheria of \nCalifornia is considered to be held in trust and to provide for the \nconduct of certain activities on the land; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Lytton \nGaming Oversight Act. This legislation will ensure that regular process \nunder Federal law is followed when Native American tribes take land \ninto trust for operating gaming facilities.\n  Congress passed the Omnibus Indian Advancement Act in 2000, which \nincluded a provision to re-recognize the Lytton Band of Pomo Indians \nand allow them to acquire trust land in the San Francisco Bay area.\n  The Lytton Band has had a long and difficult history in my state, and \nby all accounts the Tribe deserved to be recognized and have a \nhomeland.\n  But the Omnibus Indian Advancement Act did so in a way that was both \ncontroversial and unfair in how it granted an individual tribe an \nunprecedented exemption to the law.\n  The land taken into trust for the Lytton Band was miles away from \ntheir historical homeland and it treated the acquisition as if it was \ncompleted before 1988.\n  Why would something like that matter?\n  The answer is simple: the land the tribe acquired was home to an \nexisting casino and 1988 is the year that Congress passed the Indian \nGaming Regulatory Act.\n  Therefore, by treating the land as if it were taken into trust before \n1988, the Tribe is able to operate the casino outside the framework set \nup by Congress to govern how and where tribes may open casinos.\n  The Omnibus Indian Advancement Act set aside well-established rules \nand procedures, and left the government with little ability to regulate \nthe Lytton Band's gaming operation.\n  The result: the Lytton Band acquired land and a casino without having \nto go through the normal oversight process. No local input. No \ncommunity feedback and no consideration for the best interest of the \nregion.\n  The Lytton Gaming Oversight Act would implement a reasonable solution \nto this problem.\n  It does so by taking two simple steps.\n\n       It protects the sovereignty of the Tribe by allowing \n     continued operation of existing gaming activities, provided \n     the tribe follows standards established by the Indian Gaming \n     Regulatory Act for gaming on newly-acquired lands in the \n     future.\n       Secondly it protects the interest of the surrounding \n     community by precluding any physical or operational expansion \n     of the Tribe's current gaming facility unless the Tribe \n     consults with locals and obtains the consent of the Governor \n     and the Secretary of the Interior as required by current law.\n\n  The bill does not modify or eliminate the tribe's federal recognition \nstatus. It does not alter the trust status of the Tribe's land. It does \nnot take away the Tribe's ability to conduct gaming through the \nstandard process prescribed by current law.\n  Circumventing the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act process deprives local \nand tribal governments the ability to weigh in on this incredibly \nimportant issue.\n  A 2006 report entitled Gambling in the Golden State found serious \nproblems associated with gambling establishments; casinos are \nassociated with a 10 percent increase in violent crime, a 10 percent \nincrease in bankruptcy rates, and a per capita increase of $15.34 for \nlaw enforcement.\n  If this bill is not approved, the Lytton Tribe could take the \nexisting casino that serves as their reservation and turn it into a \nlarge Nevada-style gambling complex. In fact, this is exactly what was \nproposed in the summer of 2004. I am pleased that the tribe has \nabandoned the plan seeking a sizable Class III casino, but without this \nlegislation the tribe could reverse their decision at any time.\n  Identical legislation passed this body in the past two Congresses. It \nhad unanimous approval from both Democrats and Republicans. This is in \nlarge part because I have worked and negotiated with the Tribe to \nensure that this legislation is fair and balanced.\n  The bill is simple, straightforward, and reasonable. It restores the \nintent of Congress and preserves the sovereignty of the Lytton Band.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and look forward to \nworking with you to ensure its passage again in the coming year.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 872\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 159\n\n       Whereas, on May 1, 2011, United States personnel killed \n     terrorist leader Osama bin Laden during the course of a \n     targeted strike against his secret compound in Abbottabad, \n     Pakistan;\n       Whereas Osama bin Laden was the leader of the al Qaeda \n     terrorist organization, the most significant terrorism threat \n     to the United States and the international community;\n       Whereas Osama bin Laden was the architect of terrorist \n     attacks which killed nearly 3,000 civilians on September 11, \n     2001, the most deadly terrorist attack against our Nation, in \n     which al Qaeda terrorists hijacked four airplanes and crashed \n     them into the World Trade Center in New York City, the \n     Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and, due to heroic efforts by \n     civilian passengers to disrupt the terrorists, near \n     Shanksville, Pennsylvania;\n       Whereas Osama bin Laden planned or supported numerous other \n     deadly terrorist attacks against the United States and its \n     allies, including the 1998 bombings of United States \n     embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and the 2000 attack on the \n     U.S.S. Cole in Yemen, and against innocent civilians in \n     countries around the world, including the 2004 attack on \n     commuter trains in Madrid, Spain and the 2005 bombings of the \n     mass transit system in London, England;\n       Whereas, following the September 11, 2001, terrorist \n     attacks, the United States, under President George W. Bush, \n     led an international coalition into Afghanistan to dismantle \n     al Qaeda, deny them a safe haven in Afghanistan and \n     ungoverned areas along the Pakistani border, and bring Osama \n     bin Laden to justice;\n       Whereas President Barack Obama in 2009 committed additional \n     forces and resources to efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan \n     as ``the central front in our enduring struggle against \n     terrorism and extremism'';\n       Whereas the valiant members of the United States Armed \n     Forces have courageously and vigorously pursued al Qaeda and \n     its affiliates in Afghanistan and around the world;\n       Whereas the anonymous, unsung heroes of the intelligence \n     community have pursued al Qaeda and affiliates in \n     Afghanistan, Pakistan, and around the world with tremendous \n     dedication, sacrifice, and professionalism;\n       Whereas the close collaboration between the Armed Forces \n     and the intelligence community prompted the Director of \n     National Intelligence, General James Clapper, to state, \n     ``Never have I seen a more remarkable example of focused \n     integration, seamless collaboration, and sheer professional \n     magnificence as was demonstrated by the Intelligence \n     Community in the ultimate demise of Osama bin Laden.'';\n       Whereas, while the death of Osama bin Laden represents a \n     significant blow to the al Qaeda organization and its \n     affiliates and to terrorist organizations around the world, \n     terrorism remains a critical threat to United States national \n     security; and\n       Whereas President Obama said, ``For over two decades, bin \n     Laden has been al Qaeda's leader and symbol, and has \n     continued to plot attacks against our country and our friends \n     and allies. The death of bin Laden marks the most significant \n     achievement to date in our Nation's effort to defeat al \n     Qaeda.'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) declares that the death of Osama bin Laden represents a \n     measure of justice and relief for the families and friends of \n     the nearly 3,000 men and women who lost their lives on \n     September 11, 2001, the men and women in the United States \n     and around the world who have been killed by other al Qaeda-\n     sponsored attacks, the men and women of the United States \n     Armed Forces and the intelligence community who have \n     sacrificed their lives pursuing Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda;\n       (2) commends the men and women of the United States Armed \n     Forces and the United States intelligence community for the \n     tremendous commitment, perseverance, professionalism, and \n     sacrifice they displayed in bringing Osama bin Laden to \n     justice;\n       (3) commends the men and women of the United States Armed \n     Forces and the United States intelligence community for \n     committing themselves to defeating, disrupting, and \n     dismantling al Qaeda;\n       (4) commends the President for ordering the successful \n     operations to locate and eliminate Osama bin Laden; and\n       (5) reaffirms its commitment to disrupting, dismantling, \n     and defeating al Qaeda and affiliated organizations around \n     the world that threaten United States national security, \n     eliminating a safe haven for terrorists in Afghanistan and \n     Pakistan, and bringing terrorists to justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/03/senate-section/article/S2625-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 160--DESIGNATING MAY 6, 2011, AS ``MILITARY SPOUSE \n                           APPRECIATION DAY''\n\n  Mr. BURR (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mrs. Boxer) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Madam President, I am pleased that the Senate has acted \nquickly to pass a resolution designating May 2011 as National Inventors \nMonth. On May 4, the National Inventors Hall of Fame, in partnership \nwith the United States Patent and Trademark Office, will hold its 39th \nAnnual National Inventors Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony.\n  Our Nation's inventors are the catalyst of our economy. Their \ninventions, when protected by a strong, efficient, and balanced patent \nsystem lead to new products and processes for American consumers and \nnew jobs for American workers.\n  Earlier this year, the United States Senate passed overwhelmingly the \nAmerica Invents Act, to ensure that our Nation's inventors and \ninnovators have a 21st Century patent system that speeds high quality \npatents to market. The United States House Committee on the Judiciary \nrecently voted to approve a very similar version of this legislation on \na strong bipartisan vote. I look forward to working together to get the \nAmerica Invents Act to the President's desk and providing our inventors \nwith the legal landscape they need to flourish.\n  I appreciate the efforts of Inventors Digest Magazine and others who \nhave promoted National Inventors Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/03/senate-section/article/S2637-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, MAY 4, 2011\n\n  Mr. REID.
