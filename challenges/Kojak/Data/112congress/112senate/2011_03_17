THAD AUSTIN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it was a great honor to have the \nReverend Thad Austin, of the First United Methodist Church in \nMurfreesboro, TN, provide the opening prayer this morning. I thank him \nfor his wise words. Remembering the St. Patrick in St. Patrick's Day \nwas a wonderful way to begin the session.\n  I first met the Reverend Austin at his alma mater, Asbury University \nin Wilmore, KY, when I visited there in 2007. Asbury University's \nmission is to engage the world and serve the Word through public \nservice. Our guest Chaplain today has pursued that mission with great \nsuccess.\n  Maybe it is a family calling. The Reverend Austin's grandfather, Dr. \nEdward U. Austin, was an admiral in the U.S. Navy who volunteered \noverseas as a medical missionary. His father, Stephen B. Austin, is a \ndoctor who cares for our Nation's veterans.\n  They taught Thad that it was important to serve others--that in a \nnation that so generously provides what many in other parts of the \nworld do not enjoy, it is important to give back.\n  The Reverend Austin has taken that advice very much to heart. He is \nstill a young man, but he has accomplished a great deal. And he is not \none to look back with pride on where he has been, but rather, look \nforward to all that he has left to do.\n  The Reverend Austin earned his degrees from Asbury University and the \nAsbury Theological Seminary, and he has also studied at Oxford \nUniversity and the Wesley Theological Seminary here in the Nation's \nCapital. He is the pastor of congregational care at the First United \nMethodist Church, as well as a commissioned Elder there.\n  The Reverend Austin has preached in England, South Korea, and Mexico \nas well as in Kentucky, Tennessee, and several other States, and \nprovided spiritual guidance and volunteer work in Mexico, Guatemala, \nKentucky, and Tennessee. And while he has clearly gone on to do bigger \nand bolder things, let me also note that in 2009 he served as an intern \nin my office.\n  ADM Edward Austin, whose grandson has just addressed the Senate \nChamber, is buried at Arlington. Our own Senate Chaplain Barry Black, \nalso a Navy admiral, delivered his interment service. And I know \nChaplain Black is just as pleased to have the Reverend Austin here with \nus today as I am.\n  Once again let me say it was a true honor to listen to the Reverend \nAustin's words this morning. I want to thank him for taking time from \nhis important work to be here. And I thank him for his lifetime of \nservice to his community and our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S1772]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I join Senator McConnell in welcoming \nReverend Austin from Murfreesboro, TN, just down the road from \nNashville. He formerly worked here, as Senator McConnell said. We are \ndelighted he has this privilege today to pray at the beginning of the \nSenate, which is something that has happened since the beginning of the \nSenate, since the very first days of the Senate. I thank him for taking \nhis time to be here. Welcome.\n  Mr. President, will the Chair let me know when I have consumed 8 \nminutes?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/17/senate-section/article/S1772-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1772-S1774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this is St. Patrick's Day, as Reverend \nAustin mentioned, and we celebrate that. We are coming up on another \nimportant anniversary, and that is the anniversary of the enactment of \nthe health care law, which the majority regards as a historic \nachievement and most Republicans regard as a historic mistake.\n  I want to talk a little bit about that law, but there is another \nanniversary I remember very well that came a few days before enactment \nof the health care law--the so-called health care summit that was held \nat the Blair House. It was a remarkable event.\n  The President of the United States, who is highly intelligent and \nwell-versed on health care, invited a bunch of us down to discuss \nhealth care. He stayed and we stayed for 6 or 7 hours. During that \ndiscussion, it was a pretty free exchange. I especially remember one of \nthem. I had been asked by Senator McConnell and Representative Boehner \nto represent Republicans in presenting our side, and the President's \ninvitation gave us a platform we usually don't have. He has a better \nplatform than we do most of the time.\n  We made our argument that we would prefer an approach on health care \nthat instead of expanding the health care delivery system, which we all \nknow costs too much, we should go step by step to reduce the cost of \nhealth care so more people can afford to buy insurance. That was the \nbasic discussion we had. We got down to some facts. I had said that, \naccording to the CBO, the President's plan would raise individual \npremiums and make insurance cost more for individuals who buy insurance \nby 10 to 13 percent. The President said, after I finished:\n\n       So, Lamar, when you mentioned earlier that you said \n     premiums go up--that's just not the case, according to the \n     Congressional Budget Office.\n\n  I said:\n\n       Mr. President, if you're going to contradict me, I ought to \n     have a chance to respond. The Congressional Budget Office \n     report says that premiums will rise in the individual market \n     as a result of the Senate bill.\n\n  The President said:\n\n       No, no, no, no--let me--and this is an example of where \n     we've got to get our facts straight.\n\n  I said:\n\n       That's my point.\n\n  And it went on from there. I had to make a decision at that moment \nwhether I should continue to have a public disagreement with the \nPresident. I thought I was right, and he thought he was right, so I \ndecided it would be more appropriate for me not to do that in public, \nto let other Senators and Congressmen have their say. I exchanged a \nletter with the President that day, and I came to the floor of the \nSenate later that week to make my argument on why I believed premiums \nwould go up.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe transcript of my exchange with the President and that of Senator \nKyl and a couple of Members of Congress and the letter I sent to the \nPresident that day which made my point rather than publicly argue with \nhim. My remarks I made on the floor of the Senate later that day are in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            The White House\n\n  Discussion on Cost Containment at Bipartisan Meeting on Health Care \n                                 Reform\n\n                      (Blair House, Feb. 25, 2010)\n\n\n                           (Roughly 11 a.m.)\n\n       THE PRESIDENT: For folks who even with those lower costs \n     still can't afford coverage, we'd provide some subsidies. But \n     here's what I want to emphasize is that even without the \n     subsidies it's estimated by the Congressional Budget Office \n     that the plan we put forward would lower the costs in the \n     individual market for the average person who's just trying to \n     buy health insurance and they don't--they're not lucky enough \n     to work for a big company, would lower their costs by between \n     14 and 20 percent.\n       So, Lamar, when you mentioned earlier that you said \n     premiums go up--that's just not the case, according to the \n     Congressional Budget Office.\n       SENATOR ALEXANDER: Mr. President, if you're going to \n     contradict me, I ought to have a chance to--the Congressional \n     Budget Office report says that premiums will rise in the \n     individual market as a result of the Senate bill.\n       THE PRESIDENT: No, no, no, no--let me--and this is an \n     example of where we've got to get our facts straight.\n       SENATOR ALEXANDER: That's my point.\n       THE PRESIDENT: Well, exactly. So let me respond to what you \n     just said, Lamar, because it's not factually accurate. Here's \n     what the Congressional Budget Office says. The costs for \n     families for the same type of coverage as they're currently \n     receiving would go down 14 to 20 percent. What the \n     Congressional Budget Office says is, is that because now \n     they've got a better deal because policies are cheaper, they \n     may choose to buy better coverage than they have right now \n     and that might be 10 to 13 percent more expensive than the \n     bad insurance that they had previously. But they didn't say \n     that the actual premiums would be going up. What they said \n     was they'd be going down by 14 to 20 percent. And I promise \n     you, I've gone through this carefully with the Congressional \n     Budget Office. And I'll be happy to present this to the press \n     and whoever is listening, because this is an important issue.\n       SENATOR ALEXANDER: Well, may I--may I--\n       THE PRESIDENT: Let me just finish, Lamar. Now, the--what \n     we've done is we've tried to take every single cost \n     containment idea that's out there. Every proposal that health \n     care economists say will reduce health care costs, we've \n     tried to adopt in the various proposals. There are some \n     additional ideas that Republicans have presented that we \n     think are interesting and we also tried to include. So, let \n     me give you an example.\n       You mentioned the idea of buying across state lines, \n     insurance. That's something that I've put in my proposal \n     that's actually in the Senate proposal. I think that it shows \n     some promise. You mentioned that as--that Mike Enzi has \n     previously said, that he's interested in small businesses \n     being able to pool in the equivalent of some sort of \n     exchange. So that's where there's some overlap.\n       But I just think it's very important to understand that \n     what we've done is to try to take every single cost \n     containment idea that's out there and try to adopt it in this \n     bill. What I'd like to do is to see if we can proceed and \n     have a very concrete conversation about what are the ideas \n     that you guys have that you don't think are in our bill to \n     contain costs. And what I want to do is to see if maybe we \n     can adopt some of those or refine what we've already done in \n     order to further reduce costs.\n       SENATOR ALEXANDER: Mr. President, I've had my time--\n       THE PRESIDENT: And what I'd like to do also is to make sure \n     that you maybe suggest some of the ideas that are currently \n     in the bill that you think are good, because, Lamar, in your \n     opening introduction, what I saw was sort of a--the usual \n     critique of why you thought it was bad. But as I said, we've \n     adopted a lot of the ideas that we've heard from your side of \n     the aisle. So I hope maybe you could say, well, those are the \n     ones that we think are good ideas; here are the things that \n     we think are bad ideas, as opposed to just painting in broad \n     brush. Go ahead.\n       SENATOR ALEXANDER: Mr. President, let me--let me show some \n     respect for my colleagues here. They're all here eager to \n     speak, all sure they could do a better job than I could on \n     any of these points. And what I would like to do is get back \n     directly to you with why I believe--with respect--you're \n     wrong about the bill. Your bill would increase premiums, I \n     believe; you say it wouldn't. So rather than argue with you \n     in public about it, I'd like to put my facts down, give them \n     to you. Maybe other colleagues will say that. As far as Mike \n     Enzi's proposal, he is ready to talk about it; others are.\n       THE PRESIDENT: Good.\n       SENATOR ALEXANDER: So I appreciate the opportunity that \n     Mitch and John gave me to talk. You've made some interesting \n     points, and why not let other members of Congress have a \n     chance to talk.\n       THE PRESIDENT: I think it's a great idea. I'd like to get \n     this issue settled about whether premiums are reduced before \n     we leave today, because I'm pretty certain I'm not wrong. And \n     you give us the information--and we're going to be here all \n     afternoon. I promise you we'll get this settled before the \n     day is out. All right.\n\n[[Page S1773]]\n\n       Mitch, who would you like to talk about cost?\n\n\n         (REMARKS FROM CONGRESSMAN CAMP--LATER IN THE MEETING)\n\n       CONGRESSMAN CAMP: I'm almost done. I do want to say on this \n     issue on premiums, CBO, in their letter, on page four, does \n     say that the estimated average premium per person for non-\n     group policies would increase by 10 to 13 percent.\n       THE PRESIDENT: This is the discussion that I just had to--\n     about Lamar. And--\n       CONGRESSMAN CAMP: Yes, they do say that. And they do say \n     that the value of the benefit is higher, and that is why it \n     goes up.\n       THE PRESIDENT: Right.\n       CONGRESSMAN CAMP: But the reason the value of the benefit \n     is higher is because of the mandates contained in the \n     legislation. And this is one of our big concerns with a lot \n     of the issues that have been raised. Yes, we have \n     similarities. But when all of this is structured around a \n     government-centered exchange that sets the standard for these \n     policies, states can't get out of these requirements unless \n     they seek a waiver from the Secretary. That kind of approach \n     raises costs. And so both of your comments were correct that \n     costs do go up and it's because they have a richer benefit, \n     but the reason it's richer is because of the mandates \n     contained in these very large bills.\n\n\n            (REMARKS FROM SENATOR KYL LATER IN THE MEETING)\n\n       SENATOR KYL: Now, let me give you a couple of examples. \n     Dave Camp, I think, pointed out the answer to the dispute \n     that you and Lamar Alexander had a moment ago, and he was \n     exactly right. Let me quote from the Congressional Budget \n     Office letter--this is from Doug Elmendorf to Evan Bayh, \n     November 30th, 2009: ``CBO and Joint Tax Committee estimate \n     that the average premium per person covered, including \n     dependents for new non-group policies, would be about 10 \n     percent to 13 percent higher in 2016 than the average premium \n     for non-group coverage in the same year under current law.'' \n     Oliver Wyman, a very respected third-party group says it's \n     even more--about 54 percent; in my state of Arizona, 72 \n     percent increase. Why is it so? For a variety of reasons, but \n     one of which both you and Dave Camp agreed on. It is a richer \n     benefit. How did it get that way? Because the federal \n     government would mandate it under your legislation in the \n     insurance exchanges. And as a result, there would be a higher \n     cost. How does this happen?\n       THE PRESIDENT: Okay, Jon. I'm going to go to you, Jim, but \n     I--since as has tended to happen here, we end up talking \n     about criticisms of the existing bill as opposed to where we \n     might find agreement, I feel obliged just to go through a \n     couple of the points that you raised.\n       Just to go back to the original argument that Lamar and I \n     had and we've now chased around for quite some time. Look, if \n     I'm a self-employed person who right now can't get coverage \n     or can only buy the equivalent of Acme insurance that I had \n     for my car--so I have some sort of high-deductible plan. It's \n     basically not health insurance; it's house insurance. I'm \n     going to--I'm buying that to protect me from some \n     catastrophic situation; otherwise, I'm just paying out of \n     pocket. I don't go to the doctor. I don't get preventive \n     care. There are a whole bunch of things I just do without. \n     But if I get hit by a truck, maybe I don't go bankrupt. All \n     right, so that's what I'm purchasing right now.\n       What the Congressional Budget Office is saying is, is that \n     if I now have the opportunity to actually buy a decent \n     package inside the exchange that costs me about 10 to 13 \n     percent more but is actually real insurance, then there are \n     going to be a bunch of people who take advantage of that. So, \n     yes, I'm paying 10 to 13 percent more, because instead of \n     buying an apple, I'm getting an orange. They're two different \n     things.\n       Now, you can still--you still have an option of--no, no, \n     let me finish. The way that this bill is structured uses a \n     high-cost pool, a catastrophic pool, for people who can't \n     afford to buy that better insurance, but overall for a basic \n     package--which, by the way, is a lot less generous than we \n     give ourselves in Congress. So I'm amused when people say, \n     let people have this not-so-good plan, let them have a high-\n     deductible. But there would be a riot in Congress if we \n     suddenly said, let's have Congress have a high-deductible \n     plan, because we all think it's pretty important to provide \n     coverage for our families. And the federal health insurance \n     program has a minimum benefit that all of us take advantage \n     of. And I haven't seen any Republicans--or Democrats--in \n     Congress suddenly say, ``You know what, we should have more \n     choices and not have to have this minimum benefit.''\n       So what we're basically saying is we're going to do the \n     same thing for these other folks that we do for ourselves--on \n     the taxpayers' dime, by the way.\n       Now, there is a legitimate philosophical difference around \n     that, but I think it's just very important for us to remember \n     that saying there's a baseline of coverage that people should \n     be able to get if they're participating in this big pool is \n     not some radical idea. And it's an idea that a lot of \n     states--we were talking earlier about what states do--a lot \n     of states already do it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 25, 2010.\n     Hon. Barack Obama,\n     President, The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: During today's discussion on health \n     care, you and I disagreed about whether the health care bill \n     that passed the Senate on a party-line vote on December 24 \n     would cause health insurance premiums to rise even faster \n     than if Congress did not act. I believe premiums will rise \n     because of independent analysis of the bill:\n       On November 30, the non-partisan Congressional Budget \n     Office (CBO) wrote in a letter to Senator Bayh that ``CBO and \n     JCT estimate that the average premium per person covered \n     (including dependents) for new nongroup policies would be \n     about 10 percent to 13 percent higher in 2016 than the \n     average premium for nongroup coverage in that same year under \n     current law.''\n       When you asserted that CBO says premiums will decline by 14 \n     to 20 percent under the Senate bill, you are leaving out an \n     important part of CBO's calculations. These reductions are \n     overwhelmed by a 27 to 30 percent increase in premiums due to \n     the mandated coverage requirements in the legislation. CBO \n     added those figures together to arrive at a net increase of \n     10 to 13 percent--as shown in their chart in that same \n     letter.\n       In that same letter, CBO wrote, ``The legislation would \n     impose several new fees on firms in the health sector. New \n     fees would be imposed on providers of health insurance and on \n     manufacturers and importers of medical devices. Both of those \n     fees would be largely passed through to consumers in the form \n     of higher premiums for private coverage.''\n       On December 10, the chief actuary for the Centers for \n     Medicare and Medicaid Services--who works for your \n     administration--concurred with the CBO. In his analysis, the \n     actuary said, ``We anticipate such fees would generally be \n     passed through to health consumers in the form of higher drug \n     and device prices and higher insurance premiums.'' He also \n     said, ``The additional demand for health services could be \n     difficult to meet initially with existing health provider \n     resources and could lead to price increases, cost-shifting, \n     and/or changes in providers' willingness to treat patients \n     with low-reimbursement health coverage.''\n       For these reasons, the Senate-passed bill will, indeed, \n     cause Americans' insurance premium to rise, which is the \n     opposite of the goal I believe we should pursue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Lamar Alexander.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. We talk a lot about the law of unintended consequences \nin dealing with legislation. In this case I believe the health care law \nis a situation where we had a lot of predictable consequences. \nRepublicans were saying, for example, premiums are going to rise. In \nfact, they have. We were saying specifically that individual premiums \nwill rise. It was predictable they would because, in the first place, \nthe health care law requires that individuals buy a better policy than \nwhat they buy today. So if they are going to buy a Cadillac instead of \na Chevy, it will cost more and they will get more benefits.\n  Second, there are some taxes in the health care law, such as with \nmedical devices, that are passed on to the consumer and premiums will \ngo up.\n  Third, a lot of people who moved into Medicaid are going into a \nsystem of government health care where the doctors aren't properly \nreimbursed. Many of the doctors shift the costs over to the people who \nbuy insurance. That is called cost shifting.\n  For all those reasons, we have seen stories regularly in California, \nNevada, Wisconsin, and Connecticut that individual premiums, over the \nlast year, have gone up at least partially due to mandates included in \nthe new law.\n  Let's look at some of the other issues we talked about during that \ntime. We said the bill would raise taxes. In fact, it does--$813 \nbillion. As I mentioned, the tax on medical devices is passed right \nalong to people who buy insurance, and their costs go up.\n  We said it would cut Medicare, and it has. Eleven million Medicare \nAdvantage recipients--about one-fourth of everyone who has Medicare--\nare seeing or will see their benefits reduced.\n  We said there would be thousands of pages of new regulations that \nwould hamper small businesses and individuals as they go about their \ndaily lives. We are beginning to see them come. The most notorious is \nthat form 1099 which causes 40 million businesses to file a report \nevery time they buy something that costs more than $600. We hear a lot \nof talk about repealing that. We have tried to repeal it for some time, \nbut it is still the law.\n  Something that particularly bothered me about the debate were the \nunfunded mandates on State governments. We hear about college tuition \ngoing up in California 30, 40 percent. People would be surprised to \nthink that the reason may be that the Federal Government is imposing \nmore\n\n[[Page S1774]]\n\nhealth care costs on California, and the money that ought to go for the \nUniversity of California or the University of Tennessee isn't there. \nWhere does the university get the money to keep its excellence? It \nraises tuition.\n  Our former Democratic Governor, who just retired, said the health \ncare law imposes on Tennessee more than $1.1 billion in new costs \nbetween 2014 and 2019. That is an unfunded mandate from Washington that \nwill cost the people of Tennessee.\n\n  Fewer jobs will be created as a result of this law. Someone might \nsay: How can you say that? I will give an example. I met with a group \nof leaders of the restaurant industry in America. They are CEOs of all \nthe big restaurant companies. They are the second largest employer in \nAmerica. They hire a lot of low-income people. One of them said they \nhad been operating their stores with 90 employees on the average, and \nas a result of the health care law, their goal was to operate with 70 \nemployees. That is fewer jobs. And there were many other examples of \nthat around the room.\n  Even the student loan takeover has created a problem because students \nare actually paying more in interest on their student loans to help pay \nfor the new health care law, which I think a lot of students would not \nappreciate.\n  The health care law that was passed a year ago, which some believe is \na historic achievement, we believe is a historic mistake. We believe it \nwould have been better and will be better to, instead of expanding a \nhealth care system that costs too much, go step by step to reduce its \ncosts so more people can afford insurance. We will continue to advocate \nthat position. We voted to repeal the health care law. We lost that \nvote. But we are continuing to work.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's 8 minutes has \nexpired.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. With Senator Johanns' leadership and others, we will \nwork to repeal the 1099 provision. Senator Hatch and others are working \nto give Governors more flexibility in the Medicaid Program. And we will \ncontinue to advocate solutions such as allowing people to buy insurance \nacross State lines.\n  Next Wednesday is an important anniversary. Some believe it is a \nhistoric achievement. We believe it is a historic mistake and that \nthere is a better solution to health care costs.\n  I thank the leader for his courtesy in giving me a chance to go \nahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/17/senate-section/article/S1774-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, when I was a little boy growing up, we used \nto have chickens, and every morning the roosters we had would make the \nmost noise, unbelievable noise they would make. Maybe those roosters \nthought that when they crowed, the Sun would come up, but it had \nnothing to do with that. I have been places where roosters do not crow \nand the Sun still comes up.\n  My friend from Tennessee is using the rooster analogy and has about \nas much factual foundation as the analogy I just gave about the Sun \ncoming up when the rooster crows.\n  I was at a breakfast this morning. One of my friends, a former chief \nof staff to one of the Senators here, said to me: Passing the health \ncare bill was a miracle in the lives of him and his family. Those are \nhis words, not mine. They have a child who developed diabetes. They \ncould not find insurance for that child. Because of the health care \nbill, that child is fully insured now. That is what the health care \nbill is about.\n  For my friend to complain about the health insurance costs going up, \na little bit of facts would make a lot of difference in that argument.\n  The health care bill does not go into effect until 2014. Parts of it \ndo, but the main impetus of the health care bill to cover the 50 \nmillion people who have no health insurance does not kick in until \n2014. The insurance costs have gone up because insurance companies \nraised the premiums, as they always do. One of the reasons we did the \nhealth care bill is to rein in the health care companies around the \ncountry that are really bankrupting our country.\n  Let's talk about what is in effect with the health care bill and what \nwill be in effect. I did not come here to debate the health care bill, \nbut when something is so without foundation and fact, I have to \nrespond.\n  People, such as my friend Bob, have had miracles in their lives all \nover America during the past year because of that health care bill \nhaving passed because a child under 18 who has a preexisting illness \ncannot be denied insurance. Not only does it apply to children, every \nState in the Union has now set up programs for people who have long-\nterm disabilities. Now they cannot be denied insurance. Not everybody \ngets that. You have to be uninsured for 6 months and other certain \nrequirements, and it is not as good as for children under age 18, but \nit is pretty good.\n  I will also say this: Hundreds of thousands of students in college \ntoday have health insurance because their parents have health \ninsurance. That is what we did in the law. We raised the bar on that so \nchildren can stay under their parents' health insurance for longer \nperiods of time.\n  I am going to do an event next week in Nevada where we are going to \nhave a number of businesses come together. People who employ fewer than \n10 people whose average salary is less than $25,000 can have health \ninsurance for the employees, and they get a 35-percent deduction in \ntheir premiums. That is because of the health care bill we passed. Mr. \nPresident, last year the IRS sent notices to 4.4 million small \nbusinesses in America to let them know that they may qualify for \nreduced premiums.\n  The health care bill is a very important bill. It is a milestone in \nthe history of this country. We are setting up the exchanges now so \neveryone can have the same insurance I have. That is what it is all \nabout. Millions of Federal employees have not perfect insurance but \ngood insurance, as I have. My insurance is the same that an FBI agent \nhas. Our goal is to make sure everyone in America has an opportunity to \nhave insurance similar to ours.\n  The Presiding Officer may have a different health care plan than I \nhave because every year--we are part of an exchange that we are going \nto set up for the 50 million people who have no health insurance. Every \nyear, we get quotes from insurance companies, and we can buy different \ninsurance. We can buy a Cadillac policy or maybe a Ford policy. We have \na range of insurance we can buy. That is what we are trying and we have \nallowed America to have. Those exchanges are being set up in Nevada and \nother places around the country.\n  For people to talk about ObamaCare and let's get rid of it, get rid \nof it for what? Do we want my friend to go back to where he cannot get \ninsurance for his child from these insurance companies whose interest \nis one thing--money, how much money they make? We have had to rein in \nthose costs.\n  We keep talking about the cost of the health care bill. The \nCongressional Budget Office said it will reduce the debt of this \ncountry by $1.3 trillion. That is not some number I made up; it is the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n  I am convinced my friend was right. In his family's life, it was a \nmiracle this past year because they had the ability to get insurance \nfor their sick child.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/17/senate-section/article/S1774-3", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1774-S1775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, next week does indeed mark the 1-year \nanniversary since the Democratic health care bill was signed into law. \nWe all recall the debate quite well. It was the most partisan of \ndebates. The only bipartisan moment was in the House when there was \nbipartisan opposition to the new health care bill. In the Senate, it \nwas a strictly partisan vote--60 Democrats voted for it, 40 Republicans \nvoted against it. If a single Democrat--even one--had changed their \nvote on that Christmas Eve, we would not be looking at the 1-year \nanniversary of the Democratic health care bill. This morning, I would \nlike to look back on what we learned during that year.\n  Shortly before the final vote, then-Speaker Pelosi famously said that \nthe Democrats had to pass the bill so they could find out what was in \nit--away, as she put it, from the ``fog of controversy.'' Now that the \nfog has lifted, the question arises, What do we know now that we did \nnot know then?\n  We now know that those who promised us that ``if you like your plan, \nyou can keep it'' were dead wrong. The Obama administration has already \nadmitted that at least 7 million seniors will now lose their Medicare \nAdvantage plans. And one of the administration's own top health care \nanalysts recently admitted that this oft-repeated pledge was ``not true \nin all cases.''\n  We all knew the bill created strong incentives for businesses to drop \nor change employees' health care plans, the ones they get through their \njobs. Now that the bill is passed, the White House admits it too. One \nrecent study suggests that as many as 35 million American workers could \nsee their employer-based health insurance plans dropped in this way. \nThe administration's promises on this point, which were echoed by \nCapitol Hill Democrats, such as Speaker Pelosi, turned out to be \nhollow. Today, even the administration itself predicts more than half \nof all American workers will see their current employer-sponsored \nhealth care plans change within a couple of years' time.\n  Shortly after the health care bill became law, the Department of \nLabor acknowledged all of that. Small businesses would be most \naffected, it said, with as many as 80 percent expected to have to \nchange their coverage to comply with the new law. For all remaining \nbusinesses, the administration now estimates that somewhere between 39 \nand 69 percent will be forced to change their plans to comply with \ncostly and burdensome new dictates from health care bureaucrats in \nWashington.\n  What happened to the reassuring predictions that everybody's plans \nwould stay the same? It turned out to be nonsense--utter nonsense.\n  Americans have every reason to be outraged, not only by the bill \nitself but also by the rhetoric that was used to sell it. Far from \nbeing reassured of all the bill's merits, Americans feel betrayed. \nCheck the record. I doubt that one Democrat who voted for this bill \ntold their constituents they would see a change in their plans. Yet \nhere we are a year later and they just expect people to accept it. \nDemocrats knew exactly what Americans wanted to hear, and that is what \nthey told them. Perhaps the biggest deception of all was the claim that \npeople could keep the plans they have.\n  OK, what else do we know about the bill? At a time when nearly 14 \nmillion Americans are looking for work, we know this bill only \nincreases costs and burdens on employers and small businesses, making \nit even harder for them to keep current workers on board or to hire new \nones. According to the independent Congressional Budget Office, the \nhealth care bill will result in the loss of more than 800,000 jobs over \nthe next 10 years. What is more, 200 economists and experts, including \ntwo former CBO Directors, have said that the law's ``expensive mandates \nand penalties . . . create major barriers to stronger job growth.''\n  Another chief selling point of the bill is the promise that it would \nlower costs. Yet now we hear estimates from one of the administration's \ntop actuaries that it will increase costs by $311 billion. And the CBO \nnow estimates it will increase Federal health care spending by nearly \n$\\1/2\\ trillion over the next decade.\n  What about the cost to individuals and families? Well, according to \nthe same independent analyst at the CBO, once fully implemented, the \nbill is expected to cause premiums on family policies to increase an \naverage of $2,100 a year. So $311 billion more in cost to the \ngovernment; $2,100 a year more in cost to the average family.\n  Meanwhile, other new rules are making it difficult for families to \nsecure child-only plans. The fact that families in 19 States no longer \nhave access to these once-common plans is just one of the harmful, \nunintended consequences Americans are stuck with now that the ``fog of \ncontroversy'' has lifted.\n  Taken all together, these broken promises illustrate why so many \nAmericans continue to support a full--a full--repeal, which the new \nRepublican-led House has passed, followed by commonsense reforms that \nwill actually lower costs, improve care, and protect jobs.\n  The fog of controversy may have lifted, but contrary to the confident \npredictions of some, the contents of the health care bill are even \nworse than anyone expected. One year later, it looks even worse than it \ndid then, and that is saying something.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, as three of my colleagues have already noted \nthis morning, President Obama's health care law turns 1 next week, and \nin my view it hasn't been aging very well.\n  On the eve of its 1-year anniversary, I too would like to review a \nfew key developments related to the law and its implementation and note \nthat, at least to me, it is very clear this bill has not become more \npopular with Americans but decreasingly popular.\n  Let us go back to March 23, 2010, just about 1 year ago. That is when \nthe President signed this health care bill into law. Later, that very \nday, 13 States filed a lawsuit against it in a Florida Federal court. \nAnother 13 States have joined the suit since. In addition, Virginia \nfiled its own separate lawsuit on the day of enactment.\n  May 11, 2010. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office revised \nupward its cost estimate of ObamaCare. According to the CBO, ObamaCare \nwill cost $115 million more than originally estimated, pushing the cost \nof the program to over $1 trillion.\n  June 2010. With public opinion still decidedly against the law, a \npoll at that time found that 58 percent of Americans supported repeal. \nThe Department of Health and Human Services launched a public relations \ncampaign to try to change people's minds. Many seniors received a \npamphlet from HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius that made claims such as:\n\n       Your guaranteed Medicare benefits won't change--whether you \n     get them through original Medicare or a Medicare Advantage \n     plan.\n\n  But, of course, the pamphlet failed to mention the fact that the law \ncuts Medicare Advantage plans by $202 billion over 10 years, meaning \nhigher premiums, less benefits, and fewer plan choices for seniors. The \nCBO estimates that the extra benefits currently provided by Medicare \nAdvantage plans will be cut in half.\n  July 11, 2010. President Obama used a recess appointment to name \nDonald Berwick as Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, an agency that will play a critical role in the \nimplementation of ObamaCare. The President used this procedure in an \nattempt to bypass the regular confirmation process before the Senate \nhad held a hearing or voted on the nominee. The recess appointment \nallows Dr. Berwick to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices through the end of this year.\n  A hearing would have given Senators the opportunity to question Dr. \nBerwick about his very controversial views, including his espousal of \nhealth care rationing. He has, for example, praised the British \nnational health care system, which routinely denies and rations care, \nas ``extremely effective'' and ``conscientious.''\n  On September 24, 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services \nissued its first waiver of ObamaCare provisions dealing with the \nlimited benefit or mini-med plans. Since then, a total of 1,040 waivers \nhave been granted, many to the administration's favored political \nconstituencies. It seems as though they like the law as long as it \ndoesn't apply to them.\n  December 13, 2010. A Federal district court judge in Virginia ruled \nthat the law's mandate that individuals purchase government-approved \nhealth insurance is unconstitutional.\n  January 19 of this year. The House of Representatives voted 245 to \n189 to repeal ObamaCare.\n  January 25, 2011. My Governor, Jan Brewer of Arizona, asked Secretary \nSebelius to waive the maintenance-of-effort provision in the health \ncare law. That is the provision that forces an unfunded Medicaid \nmandate on States by denying them the flexibility, the full ability to \nmanage their own Medicaid Programs to fit their own budgets and their \nown unique Medicaid populations. This is a huge problem because \nArizona, along with most other States, is experiencing a dire budget \ncrisis.\n  January 26, 2011. Medicare Chief Actuary Richard Foster testified \nbefore the House Budget Committee. He acknowledged to the committee \nthat President Obama's promise that Americans will get to keep their \ncoverage if they like it is ``not true in all cases.''\n  January 31, 2011. Judge Roger Vinson, a Federal district court judge \nin Florida, ruled that the individual mandate in the law is \nunconstitutional and he invalidated the entire law. He concluded the \nlaw's requirement to buy insurance or pay a fee:\n\n       . . . is outside Congress' Commerce Clause power, and it \n     cannot be otherwise authorized by an assertion of power under \n     the Necessary and Proper Clause. It is not constitutional.\n\n  He also writes:\n\n       It is difficult to imagine that a nation which began, at \n     least in part, as the result of opposition to a British \n     mandate giving the East India Company a monopoly and imposing \n     a nominal tax on all tea sold in America, would have set out \n     to create a government with the power to force people to \n     buy the tea in the first place. Surely this is not what \n     the Founding Fathers could have intended.\n\n  On February 2 of this year, on the Senate vote to repeal the law, it \nfailed on a party-line vote, 47 to 51. So the Senate did not follow the \npath of the House of Representatives to repeal ObamaCare.\n  On February 14, Valentines Day, the IRS submitted to Congress its \nfiscal year 2012 budget request. The health care bill is mentioned by \nthe IRS more than 250 times. The IRS will have to hire thousands of new \nworkers to implement the many new tax provisions. As the request noted, \nthe health care law:\n\n       . . . presents a major challenge for the IRS. It represents \n     the largest set of tax law changes in 20 years, with more \n     than 40 provisions to amend the tax laws.\n\n  Just to remind my colleagues and our constituents throughout this \ncountry, the health care law has more than 40 provisions, the largest \nset of tax law changes in 20 years.\n  February 22 of this year. A Clinton-appointed Federal judge ruled \nthat ObamaCare is constitutional because the Constitution somehow \npermits the Federal Government to regulate what the court called \n``mental activity.''\n  So much for keeping your thoughts to yourself.\n  On March 3, 2011, at the request of the Obama administration, a \nFederal judge in Florida, the Federal judge who had previously ruled \nthat ObamaCare is unconstitutional, clarified his ruling and noted his \ncontinuing concern with the fact that if the law is upheld, he says, \n``Congress could, indeed, mandate that everyone buy broccoli.''\n  I think the first President Bush would have a real problem with that \nmandate.\n  March 14, 2011, just 3 days ago. The latest Rasmussen poll shows that \nsupport for repeal of the health care law has reached its highest level \nsince May of 2010, with 62 percent of likely voters now favoring \nrepeal.\n  That is what we should do. These developments highlight just some of \nthe reasons why the bill is so unpopular and so deeply flawed that the \nAmerican people agree it should be repealed and it should be replaced \nwith more sensible ideas.\n  The debate on the health care law will no doubt continue throughout \nthis year, especially now that two Federal courts have already ruled it \nis unconstitutional. It would be best if we could stay the law until \nthe Supreme Court rules on its constitutionality. States and businesses \ncould save a great deal of money, and insurance companies wouldn't have \nto raise their rates. We will have a chance, I hope, to vote on such a \nproposal.\n  Some things age well with time--not ObamaCare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise also to speak to the issue of the \nhealth care reform bill, which my colleague from Arizona has pointed \nout is now seeing its 1-year anniversary. I think it is good to put in \nperspective the issues most Americans care about.\n  As I travel my State of South Dakota and elsewhere in this country, I \nhear repeatedly what most Americans think we ought to be focused on \nright now in Washington, DC; that is, the economy, job creation, \nspending, and debt. They believe those are the issues that are most \nimportant. I think the public\n\n[[Page S1777]]\n\nopinion polls reflect that. If we look at any public opinion poll \ntoday, generally, they are in that order: It will be jobs, the economy, \nspending, and debt.\n  As I look at what this health care bill has done--and use the metric \nof jobs and the economy and spending and debt and look at it on the 1-\nyear anniversary--I think we would have to say this has been a major \nfailure in terms of speaking to or addressing the issues the American \npeople care the most about.\n  On the issue of jobs and the economy, there were lots of statements \nmade about this when it was passed; that it was going to create lots of \njobs. The former Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, said, in its life, \nthe health care bill will create 4 million jobs; 400,000 jobs almost \nimmediately. Yet we have the CBO Director recently testifying that the \nnew law will reduce employment over the next decade by 800,000 jobs.\n  So we have a piece of legislation that is going to, according to the \nCBO, cost us jobs in the economy. Couple that with the fact that it \nwill raise taxes, and raise taxes dramatically on the economy, by $\\1/\n2\\ trillion in the first 10 years, $1 trillion dollars when it is fully \nimplemented, and we see that businesses will pass those costs on to the \npeople in this country who buy things--consumers--and, obviously, it \nleads to higher costs for a lot of these items.\n  It leads to higher health care costs because most of those taxes were \nimposed upon health insurance companies, on pharmaceutical companies \nand on medical device manufacturers and many of those costs are being \npassed on. One would have to argue very hard to suggest that any kind \nof a tax increase is going to create more jobs. In fact, historically, \nit is very clear that any time we raise taxes, it actually costs the \neconomy jobs.\n  So we have the CBO Director talking about the loss of jobs, we have \nthe fact that we have some massive tax increases in this legislation \nthat will cost us jobs, and we also drive up the cost of doing business \nin this country because we are increasing the cost of health care for a \nlot of small businesses that are trying to provide coverage to their \nemployees.\n  What we have seen consistently is an argument from the other side \nthat this was going to drive down the cost of health care. Yet, again, \nthe facts tell an entirely different story.\n  There was a statement made by the President: Reform will lower the \ncost of health care for our families, our businesses, and our \ngovernment. Again, the Chief Actuary at the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services estimates the law will increase costs by $311 billion \nin the first 10 years alone, over and above normal inflation. CBO, the \nCongressional Budget Office, estimates the new law will increase health \ncare spending by the Federal Government by $464 billion over the next \ndecade. CBO estimates when it is fully implemented, the law will \nincrease insurance premiums on a family policy by an average of $2,100 \nper year--increased costs of health insurance for employers and \nemployees, which is going to cost the economy jobs. It drives up the \ncost of doing business in this country. All these factors in this \nhealth care legislation contribute to a loss of jobs because they make \nit more expensive for small businesses in this country.\n  If you use the metric of job creation and how this legislation \nimpacts the economy, I think you would have to describe it as a major \nfailure. The American people determine what is important. They have \ndecided, and rightly so, when you have as high unemployment as we have \nin this country today, job creation should be the No. 1 priority of \ntheir policymakers in Washington, DC. In fact, we should be looking at \npolicies that will be conducive to job creation, not policies that will \ninhibit job creation. The massive health care law that was passed last \nyear will have exactly the opposite effect we should be striving for \nwhen it comes to jobs. We ought to be looking for policies that will \ncreate jobs. This actually will cost the economy jobs. You have the \nmetric of job creation. If you measure the health care bill against \nthat a year later, I think you would have to say it was a complete \nfailure.\n  The issues I mentioned that also bear on what is important to \nAmericans today, spending and debt--how does health care legislation \nstack up against those criteria? First, with regard to spending, we all \nknow by now that when it is fully implemented this new health care \nlegislation will cost $2.6 trillion, a $2.6 trillion expansion of \ngovernment--literally the largest expansion of the Federal Government \nin the last half century. You would have to go back to the 1960s to \nfind a time that you see the government expand at the rate we have seen \nin the last 2 years alone, and that is reflected in the debt and \ndeficit figures over the last 2 years.\n  Since President Obama took office, the debt in this country has grown \nby over $3 trillion. In fact, if the budget he presented is \nimplemented, that total debt will double by the end of the next decade. \nIf you take a $14 trillion gross debt, almost $14 trillion--which is \nwhere it is today--if the President's budget is implemented you would \nsee that debt double over the course of the next decade to over $26 \ntrillion.\n  You have massive amounts of borrowing, massive amounts of debt, \nmassive amounts of new spending and tax increases, all of which create \nan environment in which it is going to be very difficult for our \neconomy and for the job creators to create jobs. But you have grown \nsignificantly the size of government.\n  How about the issue, as I said earlier, of debt? We talk a lot about \nthe $14 trillion gross debt we have today. We have a lot of research \nout there that suggests when you are carrying that kind of debt load, \nif you sustain it over any amount of time it is going to cost you a \nsignificant amount of economic growth. In fact, there is a good body of \nresearch out there that suggests when you have a gross debt-to-GDP \nratio of 90 percent or higher, which is where we are today, it costs \nyou about 1 percent a year.\n  The President's former economic advisor, Christina Romer, said \nanytime you lose a percentage point of economic growth it costs you a \nmillion jobs. If we are losing, because of this high level of debt, a \npercentage point of economic growth every year, we are losing a million \njobs every year as a result of that as well.\n  How does the whole health care debate bear on this issue of debt in \nthe long term? I think it is important, again, to point out that many \nof the things that were put into this bill, that were designed to be \nused as offsets to pay for the bill, end up in the outyears adding \nmassively to the deficit. I will use a good example of that, the CLASS \nAct, a new long-term care entitlement program which was put into this \nbill. At the time it was being debated it was actually described by the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, the Democratic chairman, as a Ponzi \nscheme of the highest order, something Bernie Madoff would be proud of. \nThat is how the CLASS Act was described. That particular act, and its \ncreation, was used as a $70 billion offset to pay for the new massive \nhealth care entitlement program.\n  What is going to happen, and we are finding out now more and more \nabout this, is that particular program, although it generates some \nrevenue in the early years, runs huge deficits when you get into the \noutyears because of the way the program is structured, because of \nadverse selection. Because of the way the program was designed in the \nfirst place you start adding massively to deficits in the outyears. \nSecretary Sebelius, at the Department of Health and Human Services, \nadmitted to me in answer to a question at the Senate Finance Committee, \nthat the CLASS Act program is ``totally unsustainable.''\n  During yesterday's Finance Committee hearing I asked the question \nabout whether there was actuarial modeling done prior to the law's \npassage so that Democrats and Health and Human Services would have \nknown how bad this program is, and she would not respond to or answer \nthat question.\n  I asked Chairman Conrad, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, \nfor a hearing to look at these actuarial models that Health and Human \nServices has developed to analyze the CLASS Act. Why has she come to \nthe conclusion that it is totally unsustainable when many of us knew \nthat in advance? In fact, that is what CBO, the Congressional Budget \nOffice, was saying in advance.\n  We have created these new entitlement programs that are going to lead\n\n[[Page S1778]]\n\nmassively to higher deficits and more debt well into the future, the \nCLASS Act being one example of that. I suggest as well that when you \ncreate a $2.6 trillion new entitlement program, if history is any \nindication, that would dramatically understate what the true costs are. \nWe have seen that historically, that whatever the estimates are about \nsome of these new government programs, they are significantly less than \nwhat was estimated when they were created in the first place.\n  I would argue on the issue of how the new health care bill on its \nfirst anniversary impacts the issue of debt, we are not going to know \nprobably for some time but I think we can get a pretty clear idea that \nthis is going to lead to much higher deficits and much higher debt in \nthe outyears because of the statement the Congressional Budget Office \nand the CMS Actuary and even now the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices are saying with regard to programs such as the CLASS Act--\nwhich was created under this bill.\n  I think the other reason you are going to see the debt and deficit \nexplode is because of the gimmicks that were used by the Democrats to \nfinance the health care bill. I mentioned the CLASS Act was one of \nthose, but there were a number of other gimmicks that were used as \nwell. There was the Medicare payroll tax increases, the Medicare cuts \nthat are supposed to occur under this to pay for the new health care \nentitlement program. It was also indicated at that time they were going \nto extend the lifespan of Medicare. Essentially, what happened is the \nsame revenues were spent twice; they were double counted. In other \nwords, there was new revenue going to come into the Medicare trust fund \nbecause of increased payroll taxes and because of the reductions in \nspending in those Medicare accounts that allegedly would create a \ncredit for the Medicare trust fund. Unfortunately, all those new \nrevenues are going to be used to finance this new health care \nentitlement program.\n  Somewhere down the road, when the time comes to pay the bills of \nMedicare, you are going to have to borrow money to do that because of \nthe way these gimmicks were used and the way the double counting was \nused, not only to credit the Medicare trust fund but also to use it as \nan offset for the new health care entitlement program.\n\n  If you look at the actual numbers it is somewhere on the order of \n$400 billion that was double counted in the Medicare trust fund and \nabout $30 billion, I believe, was the number on the Social Security \ntrust fund. For these gimmicks, the chickens are going to come home to \nroost at some point in the future and it is going to lead to \nsignificantly larger deficits and a much higher debt than we are \nlooking at today, than what was contemplated when the legislation was \npassed in the first place.\n  Whether it is the gimmicks that were used, whether it is these new \nentitlement programs such as the CLASS Act, whether it is the actual \ncost--even estimated cost of $2.6 trillion in new expansion of \ngovernment, whether it is the loss of jobs associated with the higher \ntaxes, the higher health care premiums in this legislation, if you are \ngoing to evaluate it based upon the issues that are most important to \nthe American people--and that is the economy, jobs, spending, and \ndebt--on the first anniversary of this health care reform legislation, \nthis has been already a huge failure by any objective measurement. My \nguess is before this is all said and done we are going to continue to \nsee more and more of our employers having to drop their coverage, \nperhaps pay the penalty rather than continue to provide coverage for \ntheir employees, and push them into the government program.\n  I think you are going to see more and more government control, more \nand more influence and intervention of the Federal Government, more and \nmore cost to taxpayers, and higher and higher health care costs for \nsmall businesses and for families and for individuals in this country. \nOn the first year anniversary of this legislation, I think the best \nthing Congress could do would be to repeal it and start over with \ncommonsense health care reforms that will actually reduce the cost of \nhealth care, that will be fiscally responsible, that will not break the \nbank, and that will help get us on a path where we can create jobs and \nget the economy growing again rather than inhibiting that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I usually do not get up in the morning and \nrace to read the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal. It is not \npart of my morning routine. I do not agree with them on most of the \npositions they have taken and I have found many times the statements \nthey make are sometimes grossly inaccurate. This morning was no \nexception.\n  They printed an editorial on the issue of interchange fees on debit \ncards. They had some critical things to say, which is their right, and \nmy responsibility as an elected official to absorb. I know folks on \nWall Street and their friends in the press are not happy with the \ninterchange reform which Congress passed last year. They are certainly \nentitled to their opinion, but they are not entitled to their own \nalternative reality. When I read this Wall Street Journal editorial \nthis morning, I felt as though I had entered into some fact-free \ntwilight zone.\n  Swipe fee reform is an important issue. So the people who are \nfollowing this debate understand what we are talking about; each time \nyou use a credit card or a debit card to pay for something--a meal at a \nrestaurant, groceries, pharmaceuticals, a donation to a charity, buying \ngas for your car--each time you do there is a fee that is charged to \nthe merchant. That fee is charged by both the bank issuing the card and \nthe underlying credit card company. It is called an interchange fee.\n  And it is a fee that is imposed on businesses large and small all \nacross America literally without negotiation. It is a fee that is \ndictated because there is little or no competition.\n  The Wall Street Journal probably prides itself on being the protector \nor defender of the free market system. There is no free market system \nwhen it comes to interchange fees. If you want to accept a Visa or \nMasterCard from a certain bank, you will pay a certain interchange fee \nevery time a card is used at your establishment. What I learned in a \nhearing on this subject years ago is that there is virtually no \nnegotiation in establishing these fees. And merchants came to me. The \nfirst who came to me was not a major retailer but a buddy of mine in \nQuincy, IL, named Rich Niemann. Rich Niemann is a very conservative man \nwho probably reads the Wall Street Journal every day, but he has done \nquite well for himself and his family and his company by opening up \nfood stores all over the Midwest.\n  Rich is a roll-up-your-sleeves, grassroots businessman. He said to \nme: Senator Durbin, these credit card companies and their banks are \nkilling us. The interchange fees bear no relationship to the actual \ncost of the transaction.\n  He said: You know, if somebody pays for groceries with a check, it \nclears the bank for pennies regardless of whether the check is for $10 \nor $100. If they use a debit card, which is a plastic check drawing \ndirectly out of their account to pay, it ends up we pay an interchange \nfee which is substantially higher; and there is nothing we can say \nabout it.\n  The Wall Street Journal, the defender of the free market system, the \ndefender of competition, has to acknowledge the reality that there is \nno competition when it comes to these duopolies, Visa and MasterCard, \nand when you consider that merchants have no voice or little voice in \nestablishing what their fee is going to be when it is charged.\n  So we came to the floor of the Senate and said we need to have \ninterchange fee reform. The measure passed, the amendment passed, by a \nmargin of 64 votes--17 Republicans, 47 Democrats--and then was accepted \nin conference\n\n[[Page S1779]]\n\nand became part of the law, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform.\n  What it said was this: The Federal Reserve would analyze the current \nstate of the market and establish what a reasonable and proportional \ninterchange fee would be, what is fair. Since there is no competition \nunder the current system, let's at least establish what is fair. Let's \nnot let Visa, MasterCard, and the banks fix prices for lack of \ncompetition.\n  You know what the early analysis showed? The average interchange fee \nwas in the range of 40 cents per transaction. The actual cost? The \nactual cost? Closer to 10 cents, maybe even less. They were charging \nthree to four times as much over the cost of actually clearing the \ntransaction to merchants and retailers across America, which, of \ncourse, diminishes their profitability, diminishes their ability to \nexpand their small businesses and large alike and is passed on to the \nconsumer.\n  Now, you would think even the Wall Street Journal, this bastion of \nconservatism and defender of the free market, would acknowledge the \nobvious. The obvious is, small businesses and large businesses alike \nare being overcharged across America by credit card companies and banks \nwithout restraint. That is not a free market that is imposing a cost.\n  What is it worth in terms of interchange fees, which they refer to \nkind of dismissively as small and not to be concerned about? What is it \nworth to the credit card industry and the major banks in America every \nmonth? It is worth $1.3 billion in interchange fees collected on debit \ncards--$1.3 billion.\n  So let's do the math for a minute. It is over $15 billion a year--$15 \nbillion a year--which the Wall Street Journal wants to protect as a \nhandout to the biggest banks and credit card companies in America. \nWell, be my guest, Wall Street Journal, but do not stand up and say you \nare defending businesses across America because businesses, large and \nsmall, are sick and tired of the noncompetitive, opaque system that \ncurrently exists they are paying for.\n  My amendment does not create price fixing. It places reasonable \nlimits on price fixing that is already present in the interchange \nsystem. If you look at any bank's Web site, see if you can find how \nmuch that bank charges merchants in interchange fees. You will not find \nanything. There is no disclosure.\n  Why? Because for years the banks let Visa and MasterCard fix the \ninterchange rates that each bank receives when its card is swiped. This \nmeans banks do not have to compete with one another on the fees they \nreceive from merchants. They all receive the same fees no matter how \nmuch any particular bank actually spends to process a transaction or \nprevent fraud.\n  The current interchange system, the one that needs to be reformed, is \na price-fixing scheme. Period. My amendment simply says if big banks \nare going to let the Visa and MasterCard duopoly fix fees on their \nbehalf, the Federal Reserve should regulate those fees so they are \nreasonable. If a bank wants to charge its own fees to reflect the cost \nit bears, so be it. My amendment does not regulate that. As long as \nthose fees are transparent and competitive, I am fine with them. But \nwhen the banks all get together, when they conspire to let Visa and \nMasterCard fix fees for them, that is when my amendment steps in. That \nis what offends the Wall Street Journal, the defender of America's free \nmarkets.\n  We know big banks today receive far more in interchange than it costs \nthem to do debit transactions. They use this excess interchange subsidy \nfor things such as ads and reward programs and executive bonuses and, \ncertainly, for profits. That is what they do.\n  The effect of my amendment will be to squeeze the fat out of the \ninterchange system. Big banks will still be able to use interchange to \npay for reasonable processing costs, but they will not be able to use \nthis interchange scheme to take excess fees out of the pockets of \nmerchants and their customers.\n  Well, you might ask, is this the case in every country? The answer \nis, no. In other countries that use Visa and MasterCard, something \ninteresting has occurred. Do you know what the interchange fee is on \ndebit card transactions in Canada? Zero. No fee. Do you know what it is \nin Europe? It is a tiny fraction of what it is in the United States. So \nfor Visa and MasterCard and the banks that issue these cards to argue \nthat even reducing interchange fees will cripple them, will force them \nto raise fees, will cancel services they already offer, is to belie the \nreality that in many places in the world, unlike America, they are not \novercharging merchants. They have reasonable interchange fees; in some \nplaces, no interchange fees.\n  Let's look at the Wall Street Journal's claim that because of swipe \nfee reform, we ``will soon be paying for check-writing privileges.'' \nWell, this is an old song. We have heard it before.\n  It is surprising the Wall Street Journal would repeat this argument \nto say that interchange reform will cause people to start paying for \ntheir checking accounts. I would urge them to read back issues of their \nown newspaper. Let's go back to the November 12, 2008, Wall Street \nJournal article entitled, ``Banks Boost Customer Fees to Record \nHighs.'' Well, this was long before the Durbin amendment. They were \nalready raising fees, and they will continue to raise fees. That is why \nsome of the banks enjoy huge profit margins and bonuses, dramatic \nbonuses, for the executives who work there.\n  They might read the opening line of that article which said:\n\n       Banks are responding to the troubled economy by jacking up \n     fees on their checking accounts to record amounts.\n\n  I am quoting the Wall Street Journal. They were already raising fees \non customers long before this debate began. Another line in the same \narticle says:\n\n       The average costs of checking-account fees, including ATM \n     surcharges, bounced-check fees and monthly service fees, have \n     hit record highs.\n\n  That was 2008, long before our debate on the Senate floor. If the \nWall Street Journal's writers cannot be bothered to even read their own \nnewspaper, I urge them to read what the Bank of America's spokeswoman, \nAnne Pace, told the Associated Press on October 19, 2010. She said:\n\n       Customers never had free checking accounts. They always \n     paid for it in other ways, sometimes with penalty fees.\n\n  Again, this is a spokesman for the industry being brutally honest \nabout free checking.\n  It astonishes me how many people simply repeat the banking industry's \ntalking points without ever doing any fact checking. Banks always say \nif anybody tries to regulate them, it will lead to higher consumer fees \nand checking fees; and reporters print it like it is the gospel.\n  Hasn't anyone ever realized that threatening higher consumer fees is \na great strategy to scare away any efforts at reform? It is a great \ntactic because it is all speculation. We cannot prove or disprove for \nsure what is going to happen in the future.\n  What we can do is look at past experience and use it as a guide. For \nexample, we know from the last few years that banks and credit card \ncompanies have constantly tried to raise fees both on consumers and \nmerchants as high as the market would allow them to go despite the \nrecession. We also know from experience that competitive markets, which \nthe Wall Street Journal should honor before they honor these duopolies \ninvolved in price fixing--competitive markets overseen by reasonable \nregulation are the best way to keep fees and prices at an appropriate \nlevel.\n  Unfortunately, we also know the current interchange system is an \nunregulated, uncompetitive market. That is why we see fees that are \nhidden, nonnegotiable, and many times higher than what a competitive \nmarket would produce.\n  Let's talk about the Wall Street Journal's views on how swipe fee \nreform will impact consumers. I do not know that the Wall Street \nJournal would be viewed by many, if any, as a great proconsumer \npublication. This morning they wanted to wear that mantle. They say it \nis a ``hoax'' that reform is proconsumer; then, ``as usual, the little \nguy is going to get trampled.''\n  How frequently have you turned to the Wall Street Journal to find out \nwho is going to stand up for the little guy in America? Almost never in \nmy case and, certainly, they have this wrong.\n\n[[Page S1780]]\n\n  Some might say it is great the Wall Street Journal now appears to \ncare about consumers. Of course, I would feel better about it if I had \nnot read yesterday's editorial in the Journal. That is one where they \nsaid they would like to see Congress kill the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau.\n  This is a series. There is a recurring theme. The theme is consumers \nare going to lose, and merchants are going to lose, and small business \nis going to lose if this defender of the market, the Wall Street \nJournal, has its way.\n  Here is the reality. Consumers right now are already paying for the \ninterchange system. In November 2009 the GAO said, under the current \nsystem, ``merchants pass on their increasing card acceptance costs to \nthe customers.'' The Consumer Federation of America, which supports \nreform and opposes the repeal that is now underway, does care about \nconsumers. That is why they exist. Here is what they said in a letter \nthis week:\n\n       The current interchange system is uncompetitive, non-\n     transparent and harmful to consumers. It is simply unjust to \n     require less affluent Americans who do not participate in or \n     benefit from the payment card or banking system to pay for \n     excessive debit interchange fees that are passed through to \n     the cost of goods and services.\n\n  That quote is from the Consumer Federation of America. U.S. PIRG, \nPublic Citizen, and the Hispanic Institute submitted testimony last \nmonth where they said:\n\n       The current swipe fee market is broken and all consumers \n     pay more for less because of escalating swipe fees.\n\n  They also said:\n\n       Sixteen countries and the European Union regulate swipe \n     fees and their experience demonstrates that regulation \n     benefits consumers in lower fees and lower costs of goods.\n\n  Make no mistake, what is at stake here--what is at stake here with \nthe effort to repeal or delay the implementation of this reform on \nbehalf of businesses, large and small, across America--what is at stake \nhere is a handout to the largest banks in America and the credit card \ncompanies of more than $15 billion a year.\n  A bailout was not enough for these big banks. Now they want a \nhandout, and the Wall Street Journal is standing by the sidelines \napplauding that notion. These defenders of free enterprise cannot wait \nto construct a system where the largest banks on Wall Street and the \ncredit card giants can take more money out of our economy from small \nbusinesses and consumers alike. That is their idea of free enterprise; \nit is not mine.\n  The Wall Street Journal accuses me of pushing for swipe reform as a \n``sop to Wal-Mart, Home Depot and other giant retailers.''\n  Well, make no mistake. Every merchant, every business accepting debit \ncards is going to be affected by this reform, large and small. And the \nfacts tell us that everyone who accepts debit cards will benefit from \nswipe fee reform, not just big merchants but small businesses, \nuniversities, health care providers, charities, government agencies, as \nwell as many others, convenience stores--the list goes on.\n  I ordered a study 2 years ago and held a hearing last year in my \nappropriations subcommittee on how much the Federal Government pays in \ninterchange fees with our taxpayer dollars. The total was $116 million \na year. Those who are supporting the repeal or delay of this reform are \nimposing additional debt on a government already deep in debt. Where \nwill those debts be incurred? From the biggest banks on Wall Street and \nthe biggest credit card companies, by and large.\n\n  I tried to reform the government interchange rate on my \nappropriations bill last year but could not get it through. I will be \nback.\n  I have been at this interchange reform effort for a number of years \nnow. I got into it because of a hearing held by then-Republican Senator \nArlen Specter. Before that hearing, I did not know or even understand \nthis issue. After it, I decided something had to be done. I would not \nbe doing this if it was just for the big box companies. I would not be \nfighting so hard for reform if it was not good for small businesses and \ncertainly for consumers and the American economy.\n  I hope the Wall Street Journal is also aware that card companies such \nas Visa charge higher interchange fees to small business than to big \nbusinesses. How do you like that for competition? Small businesses get \nit the worst under the current system. Wouldn't it be nice if the Wall \nStreet Journal stood for small business once in a while? Go look at \nVisa's Web site, at their interchange rates for retail debit. You will \nsee right now the biggest retailers have to pay an interchange fee of \n0.62 percent plus 13 cents a transaction, while the smallest retailers \npay 0.95 percent plus 20 cents a transaction.\n  Dollar for dollar, interchange reform will help small businesses more \nthan big ones. That is the reality of this reform.\n  I do not expect to ever be endorsed by the Wall Street Journal. I do \nnot even know if they make endorsements, and I have not even asked. But \nI am going to insist they stick with the facts. I know the Wall Street \nJournal is not going to stray very far from Wall Street banks, which \nbear the same basic name, as well as the credit card companies that are \na duopoly in this American economy. I am going to continue this battle \nfor Main Street, not Wall Street.\n  I urge my colleagues who are being inundated--literally inundated--by \nbanking lobbyists right now seeking to stop this reform; that when they \ngo home, steer away from the big banks. Go to the small businesses that \naccept credit cards and debit cards. Go to any one of them and ask them \nwhether they think this is an important reform for the future of their \nsmall business, their employees, and for the local economy. I think \nthey are going to hear the other side of the story. Some of these small \nbusinesses cannot afford the lobbyists who are prowling the halls of \nWashington today, but they deserve our attention as much as, if not \nmore than, the big banks on Wall Street and the card companies.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Thank you, Mr. President. That now puts us in order to \ncontinue the discussion of our very important bill that Senator Snowe \nand I have been managing this week on the floor. I appreciate all the \nMembers' cooperation, particularly the members of the Small Business \nCommittee who voted this bill out 17 to 1, because they know, both \nRepublicans and Democrats, the importance of reauthorizing this vital \nprogram--one of the Federal programs that works, one of the Federal \nprograms that helps to create private sector jobs, one of the Federal \nprograms that gives the taxpayer a great return on their investment.\n  One of the gentlemen who testified before our committee last week \nsaid for every $1 invested in this program, the taxpayers get a return \nof $107. That is a pretty good return on investment.\n  I see two of my colleagues. Senator Cardin is a member of our \ncommittee and a very valued member of our committee, I may say. He \nwould like to speak for 5 or 10 minutes about an amendment he thinks is \nimportant that we potentially could get included in our bill. I see \nSenator Coats from Indiana, who is here to speak on the McConnell \namendment. I think we do not have a consent, but we will kind of go \nback and forth as Members come and continue to talk about some \nimportant aspects of the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank Senator Landrieu for \nher extraordinary leadership in bringing this bill to the floor. This \nis a critically important bill for our economy. It helps small \nbusinesses. It helps the economic engine of America. It helps with \ninnovation with small businesses.\n  We already know small businesses will be where most of the job growth \nwill take place. We know that. We also know small businesses are where \nmost of the innovation will take place. When we look at patents that \nare filed, there are more from the small businesses per employee than \nwe see from large companies. But in order to help small businesses be \nable to be innovative, the SBIR Program is critically important.\n  I congratulate Senator Landrieu for bringing this bill forward. It \nhas received strong bipartisan support within the Small Business \nCommittee. It provides the resources where small companies can take \nrisks and innovate for America's future. It extends the program for 8 \nyears, giving predictability to companies and investors, so they can go \nout and do what is best for this country, extending the program to \n2019.\n  It increases the allocations available for the small business \ncommunity over time from 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent. It increases the \nindividual size of the grants from $100,000 to $150,000 in phase I and \nin phase II from $750,000 to $1 million. It does one other thing that \nis critically important. It allows small businesses to bring in venture \ncapitalists and still be able to qualify for an SBIR loan.\n  For all these reasons, I strongly support the efforts of Senator \nLandrieu and Senator Snowe and would encourage my colleagues to support \nthe legislation that has been brought forward.\n  But I come to the floor, and I am going to ask consent that the \npending amendment be set aside, but first let me explain the amendment \nI would like to offer. It is an amendment that would continue a policy \nthat was started in 2009 to allow small businesses the opportunity to \nbe able to get surety bonds to be able to compete on government \nprocurement in the construction industry.\n  Current law requires that for all Federal and State construction \nprojects--Federal and State construction projects--exceeding $100,000, \nthe company must provide a surety bond. Congress established the Surety \nBond Guarantee Program more than 30 years ago because they knew it was \ndifficult for small businesses to be able to get a surety bond. The \nlimit had been $2 million under that program. So we assisted small \ncompanies in being able to get surety bonds of up to $2 million until \n2009.\n  As part of the Recovery Act, I offered an amendment with Senator \nLandrieu and Senator Snowe--this was a bipartisan amendment; as a \nmatter of fact, I do not know of any objections to the amendment--that \nincreased the amount from $2 million to $5 million and gave the \nAdministrator the authority to guarantee bonds of up to $10 million to \npermit small companies to be able to compete with large construction \ncompanies for procurement work.\n  What is so difficult? Well, you talk to a small business owner, and \nthey will tell you what they have to go through with their bankers in \norder to get any type of financing. Then, if they try to get a surety \nbond, it is the same assets that the surety bond company wants them to \nguarantee in order to get the surety bond, putting them in a catch-22 \nsituation, where they cannot get the surety bond and financing. They \nhave to choose between one or the other. That is the reason why we \nestablished the Surety Bond Guarantee Program 30 years ago.\n  The higher limit had been in place from 2009 to 2010. The SBA had \nestimated they would issue $147 million in bonds in support of projects \nover $2 million. In March of 2010, the SBA Performance Report indicated \nthat more than $360 million in bonds was actually issued. It has been \nan unquestioned success--the higher limits.\n  One other point: There have been absolutely no losses under the \nsurety bond program, zero. That is why the Congressional Budget Office \nhas given us an informal estimate that this amendment would have no \ndirect impact on spending or revenue. This is a no-cost amendment that \nis strongly supported by the small business community because they know \nit is critically important for them to be able to compete fairly on \nconstruction contracts. It has bipartisan support.\n  What the amendment does is extend the limits we put in law in 2009 \nthat expired at the end of 2010. That is the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I do want to make a unanimous consent request, but I \nunderstand we are under an agreement now that we cannot ask that. I am \ngetting word from my chairman. But let me go on record to say I would \nrequest that there be an opportunity for this amendment to be offered \nor included. I do not believe it is controversial. It does not cost, as \nI said, any expenditures. It is very important for the small business \ncommunity. It has bipartisan support, and I hope I will be given the \nopportunity to be able to offer that amendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Cardin for his \ncooperation. He has been so patient. It is an important amendment. It \nis an amendment that both Senator Snowe and I support and many other \ncolleagues support it. We hope to get to a time, if not this week, as \nsoon as we get back, to be able to offer and have this amendment \npending so it can receive the vote I do think it deserves.\n  I see the Senator from Indiana, who I think wants to speak on a \ndifferent amendment, so I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The Senator from Indiana \nis recognized.\n\n[[Page S1782]]\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana for \narranging the opportunity for me to speak. I intended to do this in \nmorning business, but that time was running out, so she graciously \narranged time for me to speak as we took the bill back up.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 183\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak in support of the McConnell amendment \nthat would prohibit the EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, from \nregulating greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. This is \nnothing more than a backdoor energy tax that should be the purview of \nCongress to enact or not enact and not the responsibility or the \nauthority given to the EPA.\n  The McConnell amendment, which is essentially the amendment language \nthat was provided by Senator Inhofe and Senator Vitter, is patterned \nafter the Energy Tax Prevention Act, which I have cosponsored, along \nwith a bipartisan group of nearly 43 Senators. An identical bill was \npassed recently on a bipartisan basis by a House committee.\n\n  There is a growing consensus in Congress and across the country that \nWashington bureaucrats cannot be and should not be setting our Nation's \npolicy on climate change. The McConnell amendment would make it clear \nthat it is the Congress and not the Environmental Protection Agency \nthat ought to be squarely in the driver's seat with regard to energy \nand climate policy.\n  It has become clear that the administration's cap-and-trade bill has \nhad no chance of passing the Senate--again, because of bipartisan \nopposition. It is also clear that the White House has then determined \nthey are going to try to circumvent the Congress and try to push this \nagenda through rules and regulations made by unelected bureaucrats. As \na result, the EPA has created these new greenhouse gas regulations that \nare nothing more than a backdoor cap-and-trade regime. So while the \nadministration talks about the need to strengthen the economy and put \nAmericans back to work, these types of harmful rules that are being \nimposed by regulatory agencies--and specifically the EPA on climate \ncontrol in this regard--are having just the opposite effect.\n  The reality is that not only in my home State of Indiana, which \nobtains more than 90 percent of its electric power from coal resources, \nbut in States across this country that are using fossil fuels currently \nto generate energy, this would have an extraordinary, detrimental \neffect on their economies and their ability to produce the necessary \npower needed to run businesses and heat and cool homes.\n  Particularly at a time such as this, it is extraordinary that this \nbackdoor effort by the EPA is simply throwing a major impediment in the \nway of the economic growth we are now starting to see after 2 years of \na very serious downturn. The factories are starting to move again. Some \nare starting to hire. The machines are starting to turn. At a time such \nas this, all of a sudden, an unelected bureaucracy in this government, \nsupported by the White House, simply says: Now is the time to attack \nthe climate control issue. We didn't like what Congress did when they \nturned this down, so therefore we will take over and do it ourselves.\n  I have nothing against looking at ways to provide additional sources \nof energy that can help with our climate control, whether it is solar, \nwind, biothermal, biomass, geothermal, or any number of other \nalternatives. But these alternatives need to be cost-effective and \ncompetitive, and currently they are not.\n  I had the opportunity to serve in Germany as Ambassador for 4 years. \nDuring that time, I was able to pay very close attention to a mandate \nthat was imposed by the German Parliament of switching to alternative \nsources, on a mandated basis, to 20 percent of the total energy being \nderived by a certain period in time. As a result of that, the \ngovernment provided enormous subsidies to wind and solar in particular \nand other alternative forms of energy, which was to be financed by \nthose industries using fossil fuels to provide energy. The results \nrecently announced in Germany were that this is not obtainable, and \nthis came at a considerable cost to consumers and to industries of that \ncountry.\n  Two things happened. No. 1, when the government provided massive \nsubsidies to move to wind and solar, of course a lot of attention went \nto production of those two types of alternative energy sources, it \nwasn't based on a competition. It wasn't based on what it would cost \nthe taxpayer. There was an extraordinary subsidy that had to be paid by \nthe fossil fuel industries--namely, coal and oil and natural gas--to \nsubsidize those sources.\n  The problem is, they ended up with a distorted economic picture, and \nultimately the cost goes to the taxpayer and to the consumer. \nBasically, the fossil fuel industry producing energy had to subsidize \nthe alternative forms of energy--namely, wind and solar--on a 5-to-1 \nbasis, obviously raising prices to consumers and to industries using \nenergy that was derived through fossil fuels.\n  The second problem was that the politics--which always happens in any \nsituation like this--rears its ugly head, so every member of every \nState had to get their share of the subsidy. So we see windmills all \nover Germany that are not turning because the wind doesn't blow in some \nsections of the country, and we see solar panels being installed in \nplaces where, in the North in particular, the sun doesn't shine very \nmuch. So they have an extremely cost-ineffective system put in place \nsubsidized by the taxpayer.\n  So as we look forward to alternative sources of energy, we have to \nrecognize the realities of what we are dealing with here, particularly \nat a time when we are in economic distress and just trying to move into \na better economic picture for the future. If we are going to impose \nmassive taxes on industries that are providing energy to drive our \nfactories, run our businesses and heat and cool our homes, it is going \nto add significant costs to employment and all of those who use that \nelectric energy.\n  So these are issues that need to be debated in this Congress and with \nthe American people and in a transparent way, rather than addressed by \na regulatory agency that has no responsibility to the taxpayer, no \nresponsibility to the consumer, and is trying not to have any \nresponsibility to the congressional authority that governs this.\n  I have yet to hear of a credible alternative that can fully replace \ncoal for electric power generation. Most of our States and particularly \nmany of our heavy manufacturing States are nearly totally dependent on \nfossil fuels to run their businesses.\n  It seems to me that while technology can help us in the future move \ntoward a position of having some additional forms of energy to meet our \nenergy needs, today, the reality is we need this source of energy to \nrun our economy. If only the EPA could recognize the reality of this \nsituation, then maybe we could reach some commonsense agreement on how \nto move forward on climate control and other issues. Instead, it \nappears this agency is determined to shut down coal plants, costing \nthousands of jobs, weakening the economy, and increasing electric bills \nfor families who are already struggling to make ends meet. The EPA's \nactions simply are irresponsible and exceed their authority.\n  So we come back to the essence of what the McConnell amendment does. \nIt returns the responsibility and authority for energy and climate \npolicy to the elected Members of the Congress. These are issues that \nimpact every American and should not be determined by unelected \nWashington bureaucrats who have made up their minds to regulate \nregardless of the consequences. These decisions belong to the Congress \nand not to the EPA.\n  We need to pass the McConnell amendment. I believe it will achieve \nbipartisan support because our Nation's energy policy needs to be \naddressed by this body and not the EPA. So I urge strong support for \nthe McConnell amendment when it comes up for passage.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I again thank the Senator from \nLouisiana for the time that was allocated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The senior Senator from \nMaine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleague, the chair of \nthe Small Business Committee, to further elaborate on some of the key \nissues regarding the pending legislation before the Senate to \nreauthorize the Small\n\n[[Page S1783]]\n\nBusiness Innovation Research and the Small Business Technology Transfer \nPrograms for 8 years.\n  When we consider what the value is of both of these programs, what it \nwill represent to our Nation's economy during these perilous economic \ntimes is indisputable. It certainly will bolster economic growth. It \ncertainly will bolster small businesses and innovation and put America \nat the forefront of new technologies, as we have seen with the examples \nof those who have been recipients of awards from the SBIR Program, most \nnotably Qualcomm when they started more than 25 years ago with fewer \nthan a dozen employees and $1.5 million in awards from SBIR. Now they \nare, as we know, a Fortune 500 company with more than 17,000 employees, \njust to cite one example. There are numerous examples certainly in my \nState and in the chair's State of Louisiana and all across this \ncountry, and that is the point.\n  This program has an illustrious history. I think it is important to \nnote how far back this program goes. It was really inspired as a result \nof a White House small business conference that recommended applying \nthe original pilot program at the National Science Foundation to a \nwider range of agencies. In particular, according to the National \nAcademy of Sciences' landmark study on the SBIR Program, the \nrecommendation was grounded in a number of facts, including evidence \nthat a declining share of Federal research and development dollars was \ngoing to small businesses; difficulty among innovative small businesses \nin raising capital in a period of historically high interest rates; and \nresearch suggesting small businesses were at the vanguard of job \ncreation, which, as we all know today is certainly the truth.\n  So the SBIR Program was formally established in law back in 1982, and \nI was a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives and an original \ncosponsor of that legislation. The legislation set out several goals, \nincluding to stimulate technological innovation, use small businesses \nto meet R needs, foster and encourage participation by minority and \ndisadvantaged small businesses in technological innovation, and \nincrease private sector R\n  So all of that has occurred with this legislation over that period of \ntime in which it has been part of our Nation's laws. That is why it is \nso important, when we reconvene after this recess, to make sure we have \nthe opportunity to move this legislation along. It is critical because \nwe are at a point in time in our economy where we need the jobs, we \nneed the investments in small business.\n  This is not adding additional costs to the Federal budget because it \nis drawing from the already appropriated funds for research and \ndevelopment within 11 different Federal agencies that would set aside \ncertain amounts in both of these programs for small businesses. It has \nbroad support among a variety of organizations that are also crucial \nbecause they have been at the forefront of benefitting from these \nprograms and understand the value of these programs and how they will \nbolster our economy.\n  I am pleased to note that we have organizations such as the NFIB, the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Small Business Association, the \nSmall Business Technology Council, and the National Venture Capital \nAssociation which, in a letter, stated that our legislation:\n\n       . . . represents a fair compromise to ensure that America's \n     most innovative small businesses can once again have access \n     to existing government incentives to grow jobs by \n     commercializing new discoveries.\n\n  Furthermore, groups that have long been at odds with these small \nbusiness groups on SBIR reauthorization are now solidly behind the \nlegislation. This is because we worked over the last 2 years during the \ncourse of drafting this legislation for reauthorization and built a \ncompromise and a consensus on the definition of venture capital and who \ncan participate in the program. There had been a ruling within the \nSmall Business Administration that said it had to be individuals, which \nexcluded a number of different venture capital backed firms from being \nable to participate. So we developed a consensus across the political \naisle--with broad support--that ultimately brought additional \norganizations on in support of this reauthorization.\n  Most notable is the Biotechnology Industry Organization--again, \ntalking about bringing drug therapies to market that take 10 to 15 \nyears. They require millions and millions of dollars to develop a drug \ntherapy and bring it to market, and the research and development and \nultimately to commercialize that drug therapy treatment certainly is \nvery costly. So to have the added benefit of venture capital \ninvestments from research and development funds that are already \nprovided within the Federal agency is a long-term benefit for our \ncountry.\n  In its letter, the Biotechnology Industry Organization notes:\n\n       [t]his bill represents a balanced approach to ensure that \n     America's most innovative small businesses can access \n     existing incentives to grow jobs by commercializing new \n     discoveries.\n\n  The group also says it represents a compromise to ensure that \nAmerica's small businesses remain at the forefront of global \ninnovation. It also states that SBIR helps small biotechnology \ncompanies continue lines of medical research that might otherwise go \nunfunded. It will help to increase access to early-stage capital, which \nis a critical source of funding if we are to develop the therapies that \nare so important to advancing our medical systems in this country and \nour health care. It bolsters economic growth, job creation, \nbreakthrough drug treatments, and therapies for patients, and it also \nincreases America's competitiveness in the global economy.\n  That is exactly the intent of this program that was created in 1982, \nand that certainly underscores the value of this program as stated by \nthe Biotechnology Industry Organization. I am confident this \nlegislation represents an unprecedented compromise that will give us \nthe necessary momentum to get this reauthorization over the finish line \nonce and for all. This is a welcome change, after 10 temporary short-\nterm extensions over the past 2\\1/2\\ years. I think the legacy of this \nprogram is making significant contributions to America's economy, and \nto the well-being of small businesses, the engine that drives America's \neconomy. We depend on small businesses to create most of the jobs in \nAmerica. We need to facilitate that, given the high unemployment rate--\nwhen we have had 21 consecutive months of an unemployment rate at or \nabove 9 percent. That is the longest stretch in our Nation's history.\n  These two programs collectively and individually will contribute \nsignificantly to the growth of small businesses and job creation in \nthis country. That is why there is a broad array of organizations that \nare supporting this legislation, because it is a testament to its \nhistory of success.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The Senator from Louisiana \nis recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I see we have several colleagues on the \nfloor, and there is another coming down to speak on an amendment. I \nthank Senator Snowe for her explanation of some of the compromises and \nchanges and modifications the two of us worked on with our committee \nmembers over the last 6 years to bring a bill to the floor that has \nbipartisan support. I thank her.\n  One telling chart I want to put up before yielding to the Senator \nfrom Vermont, who wants to speak on an amendment, is very interesting. \nIt talks about job creation and the importance of this program. One \nreport that looked into this program between 1985 and 1995 said that \nSBIR-awarded firms added an average five times as many employees as \ncomparable firms that did not receive SBIR funding.\n  Again, this is the Federal Government's largest program. Amazingly, \nit doesn't cost the Federal Government any more money because it is \nresearch and development dollars that are already set aside for the \npurpose of research and development. It makes sure that small \nbusinesses have access to these dollars.\n  When we do provide that kind of access, which this bill does, these \ngrants and contracts go to companies that not only produce great \ntechnology but hire workers. I wanted to put that into the Record. I \nhave other things to put into the Record as well.\n  I see Senator Sanders, the Senator from Vermont, on the floor.\n\n[[Page S1784]]\n\n  At this point, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, it was my intention to offer a \nmodification of the amendment I offered yesterday on Social Security. \nGiven the parliamentary situation right now, I can't do that. I intend \nto do that as soon as I can.\n  Mr. President, the original Social Security protection amendment that \nI introduced earlier would have prevented Congress from cutting Social \nSecurity benefits, raising the retirement age or privatizing Social \nSecurity without the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Senate and \nthe House.\n  I introduced this amendment because I strongly believe that Congress \nshould not be able to cut the hard-earned Social Security benefits of \ncurrent or future eligible recipients without a super-majority vote in \nboth the Senate and the House, and I continue to hold those views.\n  I have heard from some of my colleagues--colleagues who strongly \nsupport protecting Social Security--that adopting this amendment would \nhave the effect of changing the rules of the Senate and establishing \nnew precedents. While I do not share those views, I have 1istened to my \ncolleagues' concerns and worked with the majority leader to modify this \namendment.\n  As a result, Majority Leader Reid is a cosponsor of this modified \namendment. There is not one Senator or Member of the House who is more \ncommitted to protecting Social Security than Majority Leader Reid and I \nthank him for his leadership on this issue.\n  The Sanders-Reid amendment expresses the Sense of the Senate that, as \npart of any legislation to reduce the Federal deficit, Social Security \nbenefits for current and future beneficiaries should not be cut and \nthat Social Security should not be privatized.\n  The Sanders-Reid amendment makes it clear that Social Security has \nnever contributed one dime to the Federal budget deficit or the \nnational debt.\n  The Sanders-Reid amendment makes it clear that Social Security \ncurrently has a $2.6 trillion surplus that is projected to grow to $4.2 \ntrillion in 2023.\n  The Sanders-Reid amendment makes it clear that it would be absurd to \nbe discussing Social Security within the context of deficit reduction.\n  Let me repeat what I said yesterday. Social Security has not \ncontributed one nickel to our deficit, and it makes no sense to \nconflate the serious problems of our deficit and national debt with \nSocial Security. That is not an accurate projection of reality.\n  As I think we all know, in 1983, Social Security did face a crisis. \nWithin a 6-month period of that point, it would not have been able to \npay out benefits it owed to eligible Americans. Today, Social Security \ncan pay out all benefits owed to all Americans who are eligible for the \nprogram for the next 26 years.\n  I will speak more about this issue. I wanted to inform my colleagues \nthat we intend to modify the amendment we have offered. We will do that \nwhen the parliamentary situation allows us to do that.\n  I thank the Senator from Louisiana for allowing me to say a few \nwords.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I want to talk for a while on the \nHutchison amendment which says that, while the health care reform bill \nPresident Obama and the majority passed last year is going through the \ncourts, any related provisions would be put on hold until the courts \ndecide whether the law is constitutional.\n  This is an important amendment because States and private companies \nare being forced to spend a lot of money putting programs into place \nthat may not have to be put into place if this bill is indeed struck \ndown as unconstitutional. During the health care debate last year, I \nraised a constitutional point of order against the individual mandate \nbecause, frankly, I believe strongly that it is unconstitutional. A few \nof the courts around the country have agreed with me and ruled that it \nis unconstitutional. Unfortunately, that constitutional point of order \nwas voted down along party lines. There is still a very good \npossibility--and I am hoping the courts will see it this way--that this \nbill will be struck down as unconstitutional because there are no \n``severability clauses'' in the legislation. In other words, if one \npart is found unconstitutional, the entire bill is unconstitutional.\n  The individual mandate is the place most people are focusing on. If \nthat is struck down as unconstitutional, the whole bill will come down. \nYet States, with all of the programs and exchanges they have to set up, \nwill literally be spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to \ncomply with a law that may be unconstitutional. We should not have them \ngo through that. We should actually have an expedited procedure to go \nthrough the courts and put everything else on hold so we can determine \nwhether this law is constitutional.\n  Let me talk a little bit about some of the problems we are seeing \nwith the health care bill. First of all, we know it is raising \npremiums. It was promised that the average premium in the United States \nwould go down by about $2,500 per year.\n  I will give you one quick anecdote I heard yesterday. I was on the \nphone with one of Nevada's largest employers, Steve Wynn, of Wynn \nResorts. He is known to be probably the most union-friendly, the most \nemployee-friendly employer in the State of Nevada. He has been for \nyears. His employees love him. He pays well and offers good benefits. \nHe told me yesterday they did a study from 2005 to 2010 of their health \ncare costs. They increased, on average, about 8 percent a year. This \nyear, he said that, specifically because of this health care bill, \ntheir increase was 12 percent. That is a 50-percent increase in the \nrate of growth of their health care costs.\n  What did that mean to the average employee who works for Wynn \nResorts? Wynn Resorts shouldered a lot of the costs, but the economy in \nNevada is pretty tough right now. It is tough on employers, so they \npassed some of those costs to the employees. It means an additional \ncost of $900 a year to the average employee who works for Wynn Resorts. \nThis is a story I have heard repeated across Nevada over and over \nagain.\n  Two-thirds of our economy is driven by consumer spending. If you take \n$900 out of the pockets of the average employee in my State--and I am \nsure that is being repeated across the country--that is less money \npeople have to spend to encourage economic growth.\n  We know that this bill was over 2,000 pages. Very few people, if any, \nhave read it. If they did read it, I can guarantee you that almost no \none understood it, even the people who wrote it. This bill now has over \n6,000 pages of regulations which, once again, are incredibly complex. \nUnless you are a large company that has experts and lawyers who can \nsearch through this law to figure out what it means to you, it is very \ndifficult to understand.\n  There was over $500 billion taken out of Medicare. It wasn't taken to \nshore up Medicare; it was actually taken out to create a brand new \nentitlement program. This health reform law takes $500 billion out of \nMedicare and puts it toward a new entitlement program instead of \nshoring up Medicare and making Medicare a better system.\n  There were also hundreds of billions of dollars in higher taxes in \nthis bill. Sure, the majority passed it. They said it was just the \nhealth insurance companies they were going to tax, and just medical \ndevices were going to be taxed. There were 11 new taxes in this health \ncare bill, which is one of the reasons I opposed it.\n  Here is a real-life example of what those taxes mean to patients and \nthose developing future cures. One company produces an extraordinary \ndevice for people who have uncontrollable seizures--epilepsy is a \ncommon name for that condition. One of the treatments developed by this \ncompany to treat epilepsy is an electronic device that helps reprogram \nthe brain. It is implanted in the brain: instead of a pacemaker for the \nheart, it is like a pacemaker for the brain. It is an expensive device, \nwhich costs over $20,000. The company that makes this device puts most \nof the money they make back into research and development so they can \nmake better devices. Because of this new tax, they are not going to \nhave nearly the same resources to put back into R to develop better \nproducts and help more patients in the future. If we had not had this \ndevice in the first place, many people who have completely \nuncontrollable seizures would\n\n[[Page S1785]]\n\nnot have had this help. With this device, over half of those people are \nactually able to control their seizures. No other medication works for \nthem. Half of them are able to control their seizures because of this \ndevice.\n  These are the types of things in this bill that are doing damage to \nour health care system, which is by all accounts the finest health care \nsystem in the world. The biggest problem with this health care bill is \nthat it didn't go after the No. 1 problem we have in health care: the \ncost. Health care is too expensive in the United States. Even though it \nis of the finest quality, it is too expensive. We should strike down \nthis bill as unconstitutional, or repeal it. Then, we should start with \na health care reform bill that goes after the true problem in health \ncare, and that is the cost.\n  What can we do about the cost of health care? We should absolutely do \nsomething that many States are already doing; the State of Texas is a \ngood example of where it has been successful. We should change our \nmedical liability laws, to rein in out-of-control trial lawyers across \nthe country who are driving up all our health care costs. We know \ndoctors prescribe all kinds of unnecessary tests just to cover \nthemselves in case of a lawsuit.\n  When good medical liability reform bills are put into place, the true \nvictims of medical malpractice actually get compensation because there \nare not as many frivolous lawsuits clogging up the courts. The other \nthing that happens is the cost of medical liability insurance and the \ncost to our health care system goes down.\n  The Congressional Budget Office reported that there would be \napproximately $70 billion to $80 billion in savings over the next 10 \nyears if we enacted medical liability reform. I think that estimate is \nvery low, but the number is not insignificant.\n  There are many other things we can do to create a health care reform \nbill that brings down costs. First of all, we need to put the patient \nback at the center of the health care universe. Today we have what is \ncalled a third-party payer system. The person receiving the care is not \nthe person paying for the care. We need to put the person who is \nreceiving care back with, what is known as, skin in the game. Then, \nthey will start talking with their doctor and their doctor will talk \nwith them. This can be done through health savings accounts.\n  Health savings accounts combine a high-deductible policy with a \nhealth savings account that either an individual's employer contributes \nto or the individual contributes to, and the individual actually \nnegotiates with their doctors. The beautiful part about that is that \nthey do not have to worry about a gatekeeper. Anybody who belongs to an \nHMO knows they have to go to a gatekeeper before getting to a \nspecialist. If it is your money, you can go to any doctor you want, and \nthe doctor has to be accountable to you because it is your money.\n  If we had over 300 million people in the United States shopping for \nhealth care, then market forces would drive down the cost of care and \nbring up the quality. Unfortunately, the government already controls \nmost health care in the United States. The government pays almost 60 \npercent of total bills. When we add it all up, about 60 percent of the \nbills are paid for by the Government of the United States. The \ngovernment already controls health care. That is the reason we continue \nto see costs in health care skyrocketing over many years, until \nrecently when the costs are going up even faster.\n  This health care reform bill that passed last year--some people call \nit ObamaCare--is actually making the situation worse, not better, for \nthe health care system in the United States.\n  I believe strongly that the Hutchison amendment, which would freeze \nany implementation of the health care bill until it is decided in the \ncourts whether it is constitutional, is a vital amendment. It will make \nsure that States and private sector companies do not waste a lot of \nmoney complying with a bill that might be struck down as \nunconstitutional. This is money we cannot get back. Once it is spent, \nit is gone. We cannot get that money back.\n  We already know how many States are struggling with their budgets \nright now. We see what is happening in Wisconsin, Ohio, and my State of \nNevada. It is happening all over the country. We need to put this bill \non hold until we know whether it is going to be ruled constitutional.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise to speak on a matter \nthat is a real concern to me and many in this body but, most \nimportantly, to the citizens of this country. It has to do with efforts \nto climb out of this long recession. There are still pockets of the \nUnited States--the Presiding Officer's home State, my State--that feel \nas if we have not made any progress. When I talk with business owners \nin my State, I know they are still weathering the storm, looking to \ninvest in a down economy, and they want to start hiring again. That is \nwhy I am glad we are, once again, debating a small business bill and \nthat I have a chance to reintroduce the bipartisan Small Business \nLending Enhancement Act as an amendment.\n  I have to say, this is a little like ``Groundhog Day.'' I am looking \nat my friend from the State of Louisiana. In October of last year, a \nreport by the New York Federal Reserve said three-quarters of small \nbusinesses looking for credit last summer were turned down or received \nonly some of the financing they requested.\n  In this report from the Federal Reserve, they stated: ``Reports from \nsmall-business owners of a credit gap have been both vocal and \nfrequent.''\n  We in Congress have decided to act on and try to extend additional \ncredit to small businesses because more credit means additional growth \nand, therefore, increased job creation.\n  Unfortunately--I should say ``fortunately'' we created a $30 billion \nlending fund for banks. The unfortunate part of that is we did not \nsimultaneously allow credit unions to do more. Since that time, banks \nhave been reducing credit availability. Even after receiving $30 \nbillion of taxpayers' money in last year's Small Business Jobs Act, \nbanks still are not meeting demands for small business loans.\n  I am still very committed to taking the commonsense step to allow \ncredit unions to increase the amount of money they can lend to small \nbusinesses. I, once again, introduced the Small Business Lending \nEnhancement Act, which would open additional credit to small businesses \nwithout costing taxpayers a dime. Let me say this again--without \nspending a dime of taxpayer money.\n  We have to acknowledge credit unions know the small businesses in \ntheir communities that need loans to expand and hire. The credit unions \nhave money to lend to those businesses. Right now, Federal law limits \nthe amount of small business loans a credit union can extend to 12 \npercent of their assets. Nearly 350 credit unions, accounting for \napproximately 60 percent of all business loans subject to the 12 \npercent cap, are facing their cap and will have to dramatically slow \ntheir business lending.\n  It is hard for me to believe the government is telling these \nfinancial institutions they cannot help create jobs in their local \ncommunities. That is why my amendment would double the amount of money \ncredit unions can offer small businesses.\n  We all know these small business owners. I wish to touch on two \nstories. I was particularly compelled by a small businesswoman in \nColorado by the name of Stacy Hamon. She is a small business owner in \nThornton, CO. She started her own business, 1st Street Salon. She \ninitially went to a bank for a loan and was turned down because credit \nwas in short supply. To make her dream of owning her small business \ncome true, she went to her credit union, and they gave her the loan she \nneeded through a second mortgage on her home.\n  The success story of Stacy unfolds in pretty dramatic and wonderful \nways. When I visited her, she had plenty of business and even hired \nmore workers. These are real American jobs and a shining example of \neconomic expansion that would not have been possible if it were not for \na credit union stepping up and offering her a loan.\n  Another Coloradan, Lisa Herman of Broomfield, e-mailed me her success \nstory of securing a credit union loan to expand her business. She is \nco-owner of\n\n[[Page S1786]]\n\nHappy Cakes Bakeshop in Denver's Highland Square neighborhood. She has \nbeen in business since 2007. Despite the troubled economy, her business \nblossomed. Her revenues were up 27 percent by the summer of 2009. She \nis booking 20 weddings a month and had to expand her retail operations \nand move into a new shop.\n  Same story: When she wanted to secure a loan through a traditional \nbank, it did not happen. It did not pan out. But a local credit union \nwas able to provide her with a loan for her to grow her business. That \nmeant more business and more jobs for her community. That is the \nAmerican way.\n  Banks and credit unions are competitors. They do not always get \nalong. But this is not about them. This is about small business. For \nperspective, credit unions today only represent 4.5 percent of all \nbusiness loans at depository institutions. If we take this commonsense \nstep I am proposing and double small business lending by credit unions, \nit would still leave 91 percent of the small business market to banking \ninstitutions. Again, this is a smart, no-cost way of increasing lending \nwithout drastically changing the composition of the small business \nlending market.\n\n  Since some of my colleagues I know have been visited by folks who do \nnot want credit unions to lend more to small businesses, I wish to make \none thing clear. Credit unions have been making small business loans \nsince their inception in the early 1900s. That is 100-plus years ago. \nIt was not until 1998 that there were any limits whatsoever on what \nthey could loan. That means, for 90 years, credit unions were free to \nhelp small businesses in their communities without the Federal \nGovernment necessarily getting in the way. That meant uninhibited small \nbusiness support, growth, and job creation. But right now, the Federal \nlaw, whether initially intentioned, is keeping these jobs from \nAmericans who are out searching for work.\n  It is estimated that the average credit union small business loan is \napproximately $220,000 and that each $92,000 in additional lending on \nthe part of the Nation's credit unions will create one additional job. \nIn the next year, I am going to say when we adopt this concept, credit \nunion business lending could increase to over $10 billion, which \nconservatively would create 100,000 new jobs. All we have to do is \nincrease the statutory cap on credit union business lending.\n  I wish to state again for the record: These small, simple statutory \nchanges would not cost taxpayers a cent, but they would dramatically \nincrease the capital available to small businesses to help make \npayroll, buy inventory, expand, and innovate.\n  Moreover, the proposed statutory changes are safe and fully supported \nby the National Credit Union Administration, which is the credit union \nregulator. They are the product of an agreement reached last year by \nthe Senate Banking Committee and the Treasury Department.\n  As I begin to close, I wish to note all the organizations that \nsupport increasing credit union small business loans: Americans for Tax \nReform, the National Association of Realtors, the National Small \nBusiness Association, the National Association of Manufacturers, the \nHeartland Institute, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the League \nof United Latin American Citizens, the National Cooperative Business \nAssociation, National Farmers Union, the Hardwood Institute, National \nCouncil of Textile Organizations, and many others.\n  I urge my colleagues to do what is right and let's finally fix this \nunnecessary Federal limit on small business loans and support a small, \nfocused, bipartisan amendment to increase job growth and support for \nour local small businesses.\n  I believe my amendment is at the desk. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe pending amendment be set aside and that the Udall amendment No. 242 \nbe called up and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes, I object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, if I may ask my colleague, \nthrough the Chair, the nature of the objection given that this would be \nso important to expanding business opportunities when our economy is in \na troubled state.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I am happy to report and respond through the Chair that \na Member of the Senate has put a hold on parliamentary procedures that \nwould allow us to move forward on any amendments, the Senator should be \naware. So we are unable, at this time, to have his amendment pending. I \nam personally happy he came down to speak on the amendment. There are \nother people who feel strongly about that issue as well. I hope the \nSenator understands we are not able to take up his amendment at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I know the Senator from \nLouisiana has an interest in the possibilities of this legislation. I \nalso see my colleague from Maine, who has graciously joined me in \ncosponsoring this important bill and, as well, understands the way in \nwhich we would trigger innovation, lending, and job creation. I thank \nher.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I might note that Senator Johnson's \ncommittee has jurisdiction over the amendment Senator Udall spoke \nabout. The Banking Committee has the jurisdiction, not the Small \nBusiness Committee, which is one of the concerns I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I want to rise in support of the comments \nas well as the initiative of the Senator from Colorado, Senator Udall, \nbecause I think this is a critical way to create jobs in America--by \nlifting the member business lending cap at credit unions. As he \nindicated, there was a historical norm of no cap on small business \nlending--or business lending--that could be done by credit unions in \nthis country. I am very pleased to join him in this effort. Hopefully, \nwe will have the opportunity to consider this initiative here on the \nfloor. It deserves it.\n  At a time when government essentially has exhausted all of its \noptions to create economic growth and jobs, this is one demonstrable \nway in which we can create jobs in America and also have a massive \ninfusion of capital at no cost to the Federal taxpayer, at no cost to \nthe Federal Government.\n  As the Senator from Colorado indicated, for 90 years there was no \ncap. In 1998 the Congress decided to impose a cap of 12.25 percent on \nbusiness lending that could be done by credit unions. We want to raise \nthat cap to 25 percent to inject more than $10 billion of new capital \nin our Nation's economy. It could create, potentially, as the Senator \nindicated, 100,000 new jobs within its first year, including some 1,000 \njobs in my own State. We are a small State--Maine. We have 1.3 million \npeople, and more than 600,000 Mainers are members of credit unions.\n  Credit unions play a pivotal role in our State and our Nation's \neconomy. They are on the front lines each and every day in our small \ncommunities, serving their members and local businesses. One of the \ngreatest handicaps and hardships right now for small businesses, as \ndemonstrated by a recent survey by the Federal Reserve, is that three-\nquarters of small businesses looking for credit last summer were turned \ndown and received only some of the financing they requested.\n  Small businesses are on the front lines of our economic recovery. \nThey are the innovators and the job creators, the driving engine of the \nNation's growth and prosperity, yet they are not getting the access to \ncapital that is necessary to create jobs and to make the investments in \ntheir companies and firms that will stabilize the economy. So it is \nindisputable about the value this legislation would represent in terms \nof helping small businesses have access to that capital.\n  Credit unions have been making business loans since their inception, \nfor more than 100 years. They provide the essential capital in small \ncommunities. They understand the importance of lending to creditworthy \ncustomers, they understand the nature of their communities, they know \ntheir members and can make a difference in so\n\n[[Page S1787]]\n\nmany businesses as well as in the local communities. We know that in \nthe past they have demonstrated responsible underwriting practices and \nstrong management. They have money to lend--at a time when capital is \nmuch needed.\n  At a time when we are struggling to find ways to create jobs, this is \none sensible solution to that approach. Frankly, I am very disturbed \nabout the inability of our economy to create the kind of jobs Americans \ndeserve. As I said earlier, as of January this year, we have \nexperienced 21 consecutive months of unemployment at or above 9 \npercent, which is the longest stretch in the recorded history. The \nsecond highest was back in the early 1980s. But if you think about the \njobs that were created last month--one of only 3 months in the last 2 \nyears in which 200,000 jobs were created, at that rate it would take 8 \nconsecutive years to achieve the pre-recession unemployment level of 5 \npercent. We would have to create more than 300,000 jobs every month \nover the next 2 years to reach a 7-percent unemployment rate. In the \nmonth of January only 36,000 jobs were created.\n  We have a long way to go. While the net unemployment rate, as it \nstands today, is 8.9 percent, in all reality--as an article indicated \nyesterday in the Washington Post--it is closer to 10.5 percent because \nof so many discouraged workers that have left the workforce. In this \ninitiative, we have an important, effective, responsible way of putting \nmoney into the communities, allowing the credit unions to lend to \ncreditworthy customers and businesses, the same entities that will help \ndrive this economy into recovery.\n  We depend on small businesses. They are the ones that are going to \nmake it happen. That is why I want to commend the Senator from Colorado \nfor offering this initiative. It is vitally important. I hope we don't \ndefer the consideration of this legislation in this Congress, that we \nhave the opportunity, when we return from this upcoming recess, to \nconsider it and to vote on it.\n  I also wish to give a few other facts that I think are important to \nillustrate the value of these loans in the community. The Treasury \nDepartment found that 25 percent of credit union member business loans \nwere made to members with household incomes of less than $30,000 and \nthat these loans totaled 13 percent of the outstanding member business \nlending balances. Another 20 percent went to households with incomes \nreported to be $30,000 and $50,000. So we are talking about middle-\nclass America. We are talking about mom-and-pop operations and \nhouseholds that otherwise would be denied access to credit. We know \nthat. We have heard it chapter and verse. I have heard it anecdotally \nfrom so many businesses in my State and across the country. We have \nheard testimony before the committee about the inability of so many \nsmall businesses to gain access to credit.\n  Banks have decreased lending, for all practical purposes, to small \nbusinesses. That is why we have to do everything we can to enable these \nfirms to access credit and loans that will allow them to stay in \nbusiness and to sustain their operations in these very difficult times.\n  Again, I want to thank the Senator from Colorado for offering this \ninitiative, and hopefully we will have the opportunity to consider it \nand to vote on it because it is one way of stimulating job growth. I \nthink that is indisputable based on the track record of the previous \nlending that has been done by the credit unions. This is one \nopportunity we should be able to have in making sure small businesses \nhave access to capital that will allow them to continue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senators for their \ndiscussion of that amendment. I wish, before Senator Udall leaves, to \ncorrect one thing for the record.\n  As the manager of the Small Business Innovation Jobs bill, which the \nSenator was so helpful to us in passing, we did ask the credit unions \nif they wanted to be a part of that lending program and they declined \nto participate. So I wanted, for the record, for that to be clear.\n  I do know--and let me speak for myself--that credit unions serve a \nvaluable role in our Nation today, and we want to acknowledge that. But \nI want the Senator from Colorado to know that, according to the \ninformation I have been given, they were asked if they wanted to \nparticipate in the Small Business Lending Fund, and they declined. They \nmay change their mind later, and we can amend that program later should \nthey so decide. But I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  I see the Senator from Georgia is on the floor, so I will yield my \ntime. I think he wants to speak on a different amendment, but I think \nthat is the purpose of this morning's discussion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank the Senator from Louisiana, and I look forward \nto being in New Orleans this weekend, I might add. It is a great State \nand a great city.\n  Madam President, there is a pending amendment by Senator Hutchison \ndealing with medical waivers, which prompts me to come to the floor for \na minute and talk about that issue as it affects Georgia today, and in \nparticular to talk about it in the context of what our Governor and \nlegislature are having to deal with right now in terms of the mandates \nof the health care bill signed on March 23 of last year by President \nObama.\n  In fact, on the signing of that bill, there were a couple of \nstatements made, reflecting back on that long debate, and I want to \nrepeat them right now. One was made by Speaker Pelosi, saying about a \nmonth before the House passed the health care bill, that you had to \npass it to find out what is in it. That was a funny statement at the \ntime, but it became prophetic as we are beginning to discover over and \nover the unintended consequences of the legislation on our States and \non medicine.\n  Secondly, Vice President Biden declared the magnitude of the impact \nof the health care bill. That magnitude is turning out to be higher \ncost, less benefit, and more regulation on our States.\n  In particular, I want to bring two points up to talk about why this \nwhole issue of medical waivers is so important. Our insurance \ncommissioner, Ralph Hudgens, has submitted to CMS for a waiver on the \nmedical cost-benefit rule in terms of benefits paid on policies, taking \nit up to 85 percent. That mandate in the health care bill is going to \nforce not better coverage but less coverage by our insurance companies \nin Georgia because they will leave when they cannot meet it.\n  It is the intention to regulate the amount of benefits paid. But the \napplication means companies that can't meet it by the time set in the \nbill will leave the State. So instead, you will have less of what was \npromised rather than more. You will have less available choice and more \npeople forced to a single-payer system in the government operated \nthrough an exchange.\n  This prompts me to talk about the second issue going on in Georgia. \nOur newly elected Governor, Governor Nathan Deal, is trying to deal \nwith a mandate on setting up the State exchange that will be available \nto operate by 2014, in a period of time where the public wants no part \nof the national health care bill and wants to wait on a Supreme Court \nruling on June Vinson's opinion from Florida.\n  I come to the floor to say these medical waivers are important. \nStates are having to ask for them because of the impact of the overall \nhealth care bill that was signed on March 23 of last year. If some \nrelief doesn't come, we are going to have some cataclysmic events. One \nwill be the impact on employees and small businesses, which is what \nthis bill is all about.\n  I ran a small business. I had independent contractors for whom under \nERISA you could not provide health insurance. I tried my best to get \nthis Congress and this President to consider an associated benefit \nprogram approval so we could have people, such as those in my \nprofession, assemble together and form large risk pools so they could \ncompete for insurance, the same as major companies and States do. That \nwas rejected instead for an exchange and for a simple system that says \nsmall businesses must provide health insurance to their employees, but \nif they do not provide it, they will pay a modest fine that is much \nless than the cost of the insurance. That one statement and rule alone \nforces people in\n\n[[Page S1788]]\n\nsmall business to leave health care coverage from an insurance carrier, \ngetting it through their employer, and instead they are forced to go to \na government exchange where choice is limited and mandates are many.\n  I want to commend the distinguished chairman and ranking member of \nthe Small Business Committee for the effort they are making on this \nbill, but also commend Senator Hutchison on the importance of \nconsidering the volume of these waivers being filed; why are they being \nfiled, and are they an early warning for what will happen to us when \nthis bill goes into effect if we don't take the ObamaCare legislation \nand commit drastic surgery or, better yet, start over and build a \nsystem that works, where we have the private delivery of health care \nand a minimum of government interference.\n  I thank very much the chairman for giving me the time to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Georgia for coming to the \nfloor to participate in the debate. I have a different view on the \namendment he spoke on, but we will continue that debate. In fact, we \nhave been debating health care policy in this country for the last 2 \nyears. While I appreciate his views, I am hoping we get to keep the \ndebate very focused and specific, if possible. But I understand the \namendment of Senator Hutchison, and the amendment Senator Isakson \nsupports does affect small business, so we look forward to more \ncomments as we go forward.\n  Madam President, as we wait to move to the CR--which under unanimous \nconsent I think we are moving to in a few moments, so we will be off \nthe debate on this bill--I want to submit for the Record some of the \ndata associated with job creation.\n  I know Senator Snowe is very sincere in her comments about the lack \nof job creation in the country, and I want to say I agree with \neverything she has said in terms of the rates of unemployment being \nvery concerning. That is why she and I have spent so much time in the \ncommittee trying to look at the array of bills we have, at least in our \njurisdiction, and see what we can do to help change the outlook. I am \nvery proud to say we have, I think, in large measure contributed in a \npositive way.\n  But for the record, in terms of job numbers, because I don't think \nPresident Obama and his administration get the kind of credit I think \nthey deserve, and frankly, the Democratic leadership doesn't get the \ncredit it deserves for turning around a desperate situation, I am going \nto submit these numbers for the record, but I will also have a chart \nlater because I think it is important for people to understand. I want \nto throw a few of these numbers out. I am sorry I do not have this \nchart clearly reproduced at this point, but I am going to give you a \ncouple of numbers.\n\n  In January of 2009, this country lost 820,000 jobs, in that 1 month. \nIn that 1 month, we lost more jobs, according to this document I am \nlooking at, than any month probably in the last 10 or 15 years. I am \ngoing to go back and check.\n  I ask for 1 more minute? I do not see Senator Inouye. I am going to \nactually ask for 2 or 3 more minutes until he gets to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. That is the highest number of jobs lost in years, and I \nwill tell you exactly how many. The point is, President Obama was not \nthe President in 2009, January of 2009; he was just sworn in in 2009. \nHe was elected in 2008. So the job losses of a year before, which \nstarted February of 2008, which was the beginning of the recession, \nbefore President Obama was sworn in--we lost 83,000 jobs; in March, \n72,000; in April, 185,000; in May, 233,000; in June, 178,000; in July, \n231,000; in August, 267,000; in September, 434,000; in October, \n509,000; in November, 802,000; in December, 619,000; and then in \nJanuary, the month he got sworn in, we lost 820,000. I understand \npeople have different views, but to blame a President who was not even \nin office for this recession is wrong and it is not fair. That often \nhappens. It does not happen from my ranking member, but it does happen \nfrom others around here.\n  In addition, that terrible loss of jobs continued as Wall Street \ncollapsed, fat cats ran off with the money, people's Social Security \nand 401(k)s--not Social Security, thank goodness, but 401(k)s tanked, \npublic pension funds that people are screaming about, that something is \nwrong with them--yes, a lot is wrong with them. The Wall Street greed, \nunparalleled in the history of this Nation, sunk so many of our pension \nfunds--not necessarily the fault of Governors or legislators or \nemployees themselves--and there is some underfunding opportunity, I \nwould say, there. I know something about this. But the big culprit was \nthe collapse of the market which was started before this \nadministration.\n  These numbers continue: 500; 300. What is happening this year, 2010? \nIt is starting to reverse. Yes, ma'am, it is starting to reverse--in \nMarch, a plus of 192,000; in April, a plus of 277,000; in May, a plus \nof 458,000; in October, a plus of 171,000. I could go on.\n  The point is, it is not all gloom and doom. There are some things \nthat are working. We need to keep working together. That is why Senator \nSnowe and I are on the floor.\n  I see Senator Inouye coming. It is time to go to the CR. But we are \nworking together the way our committee has had a tradition of working \nto try to take a bill here, a bill there, putting good programs in \nplace, putting new ideas in, thinking outside of the box, because we \nall have to do the best we can to get this economy moving again.\n  I wanted to say that for the record, to submit this data.\n  I see the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and I believe at \nthis time, Madam President, I will yield the floor and we can proceed \nto the next order of business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/17/senate-section/article/S1788-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1788-S1800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     MAKING FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2011\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of H.J. Res. 48, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A Joint Resolution (H.J. Res. 48) making further continuing \n     appropriations for fiscal year 2011, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 3 \nhours of debate equally divided between the leaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I rise to discuss H.J. Res. 48, a short \nterm continuing resolution designed to keep the Government open through \nApril 8th. If the Senate passes this resolution it will be the sixth \nshort term continuing resolution this year. With its passage we will be \nmore than half way through the fiscal year and still operating without \na budget.\n  H.J. Res. 48 would fund the Government for an additional 3 weeks and \nwould reduce the rate of operations for the Federal Government by an \nadditional $6 billion. If adopted, we would be operating the government \nat a rate that is $51 billion below the amount requested by the \nadministration for fiscal year 2011.\n  At this level, our spending on security programs will be $30 billion \nbelow the president's request and $21 billion lower on domestic \nspending. I would also point out to my colleagues that this is $31 \nbillion below the so-called Sessions-McCaskill level which every member \nof the Republican caucus voted for last year.\n  The aggregate amount in this short term CR is the level proposed by \nthe President as a compromise with the House Republicans and it is the \nsame amount that was included in the amendment which I offered as an \nalternative to the House continuing resolution last week.\n  By agreeing to this level, the Senate will be $6 billion lower than \ncurrent spending levels, but no lower than the President has \nrecommended.\n  While several of my colleagues have complained that we simply have \nnot cut enough Government spending, most of our subcommittee chairmen, \nand many Members of the Democratic caucus are beginning to think that \nwe have already cut too much.\n  I believe the disparity in views can be partially explained by the \ninformation described below.\n  Recently the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities released a report \nwhich notes that in comparing appropriations funding levels, the \nappropriate measurement should be expressed in inflation-adjusted \ndollars, normally referred to as real growth.\n\n[[Page S1789]]\n\n  The Center's point is that the cost of Government operations \nincreases each year by inflation. One cannot ignore the fact that if \nthe price of goods and services rise by 1, 2 or 10 percent, the Federal \nGovernment's cost in providing those goods and services also increases \nby this rate.\n  When we fail to consider the effect of inflation on Federal \ndiscretionary programs in viewing spending rates, we are not accurately \nreflecting what it costs to run the Government. If utility prices are \nincreasing by 5 percent, and if we don't budget the extra amount, we \nare forced to cut other programs to pay for the fact of life increase \nin our utility bills.\n  Longevity increases paid to civil servants and military pay raises \nare also fact of life increases that we cannot ignore. These bills have \nto be paid even if we aren't budgeting for their increased cost.\n  And. if we aren't basing our funding decisions on real costs, \nadjusted by inflation, we are in fact forcing Government to cut the \nservices it provides even when it receives the same funding level as in \nthe previous year. This isn't a political talking point; it is a \nmathematical fact.\n  The report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities measures \nthe impact of inflation on the cost of Government. By its calculation \nusing the CBO baseline, real spending approved for fiscal year 2011 to \ndate is $34 billion lower than what was provided in fiscal year 2010, a \ncut of $18 billion in real security spending and $16 billion in \ndomestic spending.\n  With this amendment we will be cutting domestic spending by another \n$6 billion in nominal terms, but more than that in inflation adjusted \ndollars.\n  Democrats have been chastised for only cutting $10 billion from \nfiscal year 2010 levels.\n  I would note that even in that comparison, which fails to take into \naccount many fact of life increases, we should all understand that \ndomestic spending is being cut by more than $14 billion, while security \nspending is slated to increase.\n  Furthermore we are now halfway through the fiscal year. Agencies have \nspent on average 50 percent of their funds. Each dollar we reduce at \nthis time has the effect of doubling the cut made in programs for the \nrest of the year.\n  Our subcommittee chairmen recognize the difficulties that this level \nof spending will create for the programs they oversee. Accordingly, \nmany of my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee are saying enough \nis enough, while those who are not as familiar with the details of \nbudgeting complain that we should be able to cut spending more.\n  I ask the Senate to consider one more measurement. For domestic \ndiscretionary spending the total available for the whole year after the \npassage of this bill will be $400 billion. In FY 2010 we had $413.6 \nbillion for these purposes. For nearly the entire first half of this \nyear we were spending funds at a rate of nearly $410 billion.\n  Since the year is halfway over, approximately half of the $140 \nbillion--or $205 billion--has already been allocated. In general, that \nmeans we will only have approximately $195 billion to cover the cost of \noperations for all of our domestic agencies for the rest of the year.\n  This rate of spending for the rest of this fiscal year is $23.6 \nbillion below the rate we spent last year. And when we compound this, \nrecognizing that inflation has increased the cost of operations for \ndomestic programs by $16 billion a year according to the center on \nbudget and policy priorities, we see that effectively for the remainder \nof the year we will be asking our agencies to operate at a rate which \nis $39.6 billion below what we gave them for the same level of goods \nand services that we supported last year. In real terms even under this \nshort term CR, we will be requiring our agencies to absorb more than a \n9 percent reduction in spending compared to a year ago.\n  Agreeing to a cut of this size this late in the fiscal year will be \nchallenging for our agencies to manage. I believe our subcommittee \nChairmen recognize this reality and it is why most of them are \nconcerned that the level of cut that we are agreeing to is already \ndeeper than is prudent.\n  Finally, I want to point out to everyone who is listening exactly \nwhere we are, and what we are really talking about in trying to \nconclude our negotiations on spending for this fiscal year. Those who \ntalk about $3.7 trillion in spending and billions in unneeded funds are \nnot dealing with the reality of this continuing resolution.\n  What the decision comes down to is this. After this resolution \npasses, our domestic agencies will have approximately $195 billion to \nmeet all their needs through the end of the year.\n  This covers the salaries of people who monitor our food supplies, of \nour air traffic controllers who keep U.S. airspace safe, of our customs \nofficials and U.S. Marshalls who monitor our borders. It includes the \ncost of all of our programs to support education from kindergarten \nthrough college, of those who ensure that our social security benefits \nare paid, and of thousands of other activities.\n  We have reduced their funding effectively by 10 percent.\n  How much more of this $195 billion which accounts for only about 5 \npercent of the $3.7 trillion budget; how much more of this spending can \nwe really afford to cut before we are required to lay off food \ninspectors and shut down meat plants?\n  How much more can we cut before we have no funds to pay employees to \nmonitor our borders and ports? How much more before we have to cancel \nthe construction of dams, bridges, highways, levees, sewers, and \ntransit projects and throw thousands of private sector workers onto the \nstreet?\n  It should not be forgotten that when we force either civil servants \nor private sector workers out of their jobs, they both add to the \nunemployment rolls. They will not be paying taxes any longer, but they \nwill tax already stretched social services. Surely we can agree cutting \njobs, whether public or private, is not the right approach to assist \nour slowly rebounding economy.\n  This is not a question of how much we can or should save from a $3.7 \ntrillion budget, but a question of how much more our colleagues think \nwe should cut from the $195 billion we have left to pay for our \ndomestic agencies when we will be effectively asking the agencies to \ncut another 10 percent in spending over the next 6 months.\n  In the coming days as we try to resolve our differences on domestic \nspending for the rest of this fiscal year I hope my colleagues will \nkeep these points in mind.\n  Having said that, I intend to support this CR because it will provide \nthe funding level that the White House has endorsed, and because if it \nfails we would likely have to shut down the Government. That would be \nunacceptable.\n  I encourage all my colleagues, those who think we have cut too much \nand those who do not, to support this 3 week extension to allow our \ncolleagues additional time to try and reach an overall compromise on \ndiscretionary spending for the rest of the fiscal year.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time in quorum \ncalls be allocated on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, you remember a year ago, before \nwe passed the health care bill, everybody testified that Medicare was \nset to go into bankruptcy in 7 years? Do you remember back then, just a \nyear ago, Medicare paid doctors when seniors got sick, and Medicare was \nfocused on the quantity of care instead of the quality of care? Back \nthen Medicare paid hospitals more if a patient got an infection that \ncould have been avoided in the hospital, and they paid hospitals less \nif they avoided that infection in the first place because Medicare, \nwhatever the cost was, paid it. And do you\n\n[[Page S1790]]\n\nremember back then that doctors would perform the same test over and \nover for the same patient because they had not been encouraged in a law \nto work together and to share results? That is why a year ago we passed \nthe Health Care Reform Act. Now that act extends the life of Medicare \nby 12 more years until at least the year 2029.\n  Now, because of a change in that law, Medicare does not just care for \npeople when they get sick, it is a more comprehensive health care \nsystem. Now the senior citizens receive an annual wellness visit. As \npart of the new Medicare law they can receive screenings and tips on \nhow to manage or prevent conditions such as if they have diabetes or \nhigh blood pressure, and they do not have to wait until they get sick. \nIn my State of Florida that is a lot of senior citizens. That is 3.2 \nmillion senior citizens.\n  Another thing this health reform law does is increase payments to \nhospitals for providing higher quality care. It gives hospitals the \nincentives to prevent avoidable illnesses, and the law improves the \nquality by increasing the number of primary care physicians.\n  In my opening statement I said hospitals were paid more if people got \nan infection in the hospital. We are now going to pay the hospital \nless. We are going to give the hospital an incentive not to have that \nkind of hospital that increases infections while the patient is there. \nNow doctors, under the new law, can track the patient care. They can \nmake sure patients are seeing the right specialists, and they can help \nspecialists avoid repeating the tests and the procedures.\n  There is a part that is just being implemented now in the health care \nbill called the accountable care organization. Combined with that will \nbe electronic records. So, instead, the Medicare beneficiary, the \nsenior citizen going to this specialist, this specialist, this \nspecialist, and this specialist, and all of them getting Medicare fee \nfor service, now they are going to be under the umbrella of an \naccountable care organization that may be in the private sector. It may \nbe part of Medicare Advantage, in an insurance company that is managing \nthe care for the Medicare recipient.\n  Whatever it is, it is going to integrate with electronic records, \nwith the enhancement of primary care physicians, so that all of that \nduplication is not done and so that everybody is talking to everybody \nthrough the electronic records. So these doctors now are going to be \nable to keep track of patient care, to see the right specialists, and \nto help the specialists avoid repeating the tests.\n  Now, you remember a year ago when senior citizens had to pay a lot \nfor their senior citizen prescriptions under Medicare? That meant that \nsometimes our seniors did not get the treatment they wanted because \nthey could not afford it. Remember back then that Medicare covered the \nfirst $2,800 worth of prescription drugs, but then they did not get any \nMedicare coverage for drugs until they had exceeded $6,300.\n  If they did not have the money and were a senior citizen, I will tell \nyou what was happening in that $3,000-to-$4,000 gap. The senior \ncitizens, as some of the senior citizens in my State and in your State, \nMadam President, were doing without, or they were cutting their \nprescription drugs in half, or they were, unfortunately, making the \nchoice between food or their medicine, something that in America, in \nthe 21st century, you cannot believe is going on. But, in fact, it was \nand, unfortunately, it still is.\n  It is about to go out because we are now covering that gap that is \nknown as the doughnut hole in the new health care reform bill. So this \nbill that was passed a year ago is closing the gap in that coverage, \nand in my State alone, that means that 235,000 Florida seniors received \na check this year of $250 that helped cover the cost of those \nprescriptions in that last year of 2010. This year, in 2011, under the \nnew law, the seniors who hit that gap called the doughnut hole are \ngoing to receive a discount of 50 percent off the cost of their \nprescriptions.\n  The gap under this new law is going to be entirely eliminated by the \nyear 2020. It is going to be gradually phased in.\n\n  One year ago, a lot of folks talked about the effect of health reform \non Medicare Advantage. Remember that? Remember all that criticism about \nhow Medicare Advantage was going to go down and how it was going to get \ncut? When we started proposing some real improvements to Medicare \nAdvantage, a lot of the opponents were saying it was going to kill the \nprogram. They said it was going to cut those benefits, and it scared a \nlot of our senior citizens.\n  The truth was, the insurance companies that provided Medicare called \nMedicare Advantage had a cushy extra 14 percent over Medicare \nprescription direct benefits. Medicare fee for service plus 14 percent \nis what the insurance companies were getting. Those insurance companies \npocketed much of that government extra spending, and we were not, under \nthe old law, holding those insurance companies accountable for enough \non quality.\n  As a result of that health care reform bill, today that program is \nstronger than ever. Remember how they said it was going to get whacked \nand it was going to cause the seniors to go way down?\n  I can tell you, in my State, enrollment is up 6 percent in Medicare \nAdvantage, and the premiums are down in Florida by 9.6 percent on \nMedicare Advantage. The new health care reform bill allows us to push \nback against the insurance companies that wanted to charge too much for \nMedicare Advantage. Just in my State, we were able to save Florida \nseniors $4 million in the form of extra health benefits or reduced out-\nof-pocket costs for their Medicare coverage.\n  Under the new law, we are going to be able to reward Medicare \nAdvantage plans: Medicare insurance companies--we are going to be able \nto reward those that provide the quality plans, the high-quality care.\n  Remember back 1 year ago what was happening on waste, fraud, and \nabuse in Medicare? The standards to prevent that waste, fraud, and \nabuse in Medicare were certainly not tough enough. How many times did \nwe pick up the newspaper and we read about this guy had fleeced \nMedicare by opening a storefront that was a fake storefront and they \nstarted billing Medicare right and left and Medicare was paying it. As \na result, the criminals were able to rip off Federal health care \nprograms. A lot of that was because there was not an adequate enough \nreview.\n  This new law has enforcement officials with new tools to prevent \nfraud before it occurs. This Senator had a part, a little bitty part, \nin that. The law gives States money to conduct background checks on \nlong-term care providers and to educate seniors on fraud prevention, to \neducate them about those people who prey on our senior citizens and \ntake advantage of them. My State has received in excess of $3 million \nthus far in order to provide that education on fraud prevention.\n  Because of the changes in this health care reform bill, Medicare is \nnow stronger than ever. As it is being implemented over the course of \nthe next several years, it did not take effect all at once. There is a \nlot of implementation in each year over about the next 4 years. As it \ndoes, Medicare is going to be stronger than ever. We certainly need to \ncontinue to protect and strengthen Medicare for all of our seniors.\n  On the occasion of 1 year ago, when this new law on health care \nreform became law--it is so complicated and there are mistakes in it \nand we will correct those mistakes over time. That is the good part \nabout this being implemented over the next several years; that where \nthere is a mistake, it can be corrected. If this goes all the way up to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, which I expect it will, and if the Court \ndeclares a part of it as unconstitutional, that does not mean the Court \nis going to strike down the whole law. But there are plenty of \nopportunities, where there need to be corrections as it is being \nimplemented, that we can do that.\n  But I wished to come to the floor and point out some of these reforms \nthat have already strengthened the Medicare Program, as well as \nproviding a more favorable environment in which to receive health care \ncoverage, particularly for America's senior citizens.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1791]]\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a moment on the \ncontinuing resolution and then speak on something else. It should not \nmatter which political party we belong to. It is not right for any \nelected official to use the budget process to squander our economic \npotential and undermine our economic competitiveness. I see far too \nmany people doing that in this debate.\n  I also see we are looking in a small window of the budget--something \nlike one-sixth of the budget is where all the cuts are--confining the \ndiscussion to that, without looking at a millionaire's tax, without \nlooking at closing loopholes.\n  We know, the Presiding Officer knows, if a company in Wheeling, WV, \nright across the river, or in St. Clairsville, OH, shuts down and moves \nto Mexico or China, they can actually deduct the cost of that move and \nthat shutdown. That makes no sense. We need to close those tax \nloopholes. We need to look at the entire budget as we make these cuts.\n  Yesterday, I was on the phone with the majority leader talking to \nOhio and Nevada media and also with John Paul Hill, an Ohio veteran \nwho, after being discharged from the Army, was left homeless and turned \nto drug abuse.\n  With the help of a Housing-Urban Development-Veterans Affairs \nSupportive Housing--called HUD-VASH--Grant Program, he has an \napartment. His life is on track. He is enrolled in college at Cuyahoga \nCommunity College in northern Ohio and he is on track to graduate and \nwill be very employable.\n  Those are the kinds of cuts Republicans have made to maternal health \ncare programs, to Head Start, to programs such as this for homeless \nvets. It is unconscionable that is the approach they have taken instead \nof much more serious long-term deficit reduction.\n  We also know from what John McCain's chief economic adviser said that \nthe Republican budget that came out of the House would result in \n700,000 lost jobs this year because of their approach, and that is \nclearly not good, as this economic recovery has begun--not fast enough \nin West Virginia or Ohio or anywhere else in this country, but it has \nbegun. So we do not want to undercut that.\n  (The further remarks of Mr. Brown of Ohio are printed in today's \nRecord under ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nBennet and I have up to 10 minutes for a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, Senator Bennet and I have just \nannounced an effort that I think most teachers, most principals, and \nmany parents will want to be a part of. We are going to look at the \neducation system in Tennessee and in Colorado--two of the more \nprogressive States in education--to see if there are too many tests and \ntoo many regulations. We want to make sure the tests we have are good \ntests and the regulations we have are reasonable regulations, and any \nminute we can save from an unneeded test or an unnecessary regulation \nis a minute a teacher can spend devoted to teaching.\n  So we have done two things. First, we are introducing today \nlegislation that we hope will be a part of the new Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act when it is passed that will have the Education \nSecretary set up a task force that will do something we don't usually \ndo in government, which is subtract instead of add government--in other \nwords, to continuously ask teachers, principals, and others what tests, \nwhat regulations are unnecessary so we can get rid of them.\n  Second, we are going to start right away to do this in Colorado and \nTennessee. We have talked to our Governors--Governor Hickenlooper and \nGovernor Halsam--and we are going to put together a task force of \neducators in our State and ask them to say to us: What regulations are \nunnecessary? What tests are unnecessary?\n  When I was Governor, I used to say to the Education Secretary, who \nwas then Bill Bennett: There are too many Federal regulations. He would \nsay to me: I bet you have more State regulations than Federal \nregulations. And he was right.\n  When I was Education Secretary, I had many teachers and others say to \nme: We can't do this, we can't do that because of the Federal \nregulation, when, in fact, there was no such Federal regulation. What \noften happens is that the confusion between what the Federal Government \nrequires and what the State government requires creates inordinate \nconfusion in the classroom, and teachers feel all tied up.\n  So we are going to start right away to do this. We are both very \nexcited about this. We think this should give teachers and others in \nthe classroom an opportunity to do their jobs. One day less on an \nunneeded test might mean one more day teaching a child U.S. history, \nwhich would suit me fine.\n  I wish to congratulate Senator Bennet for his contribution to the \ndebate, his ideas. His ideas come from his experience as an \nextraordinarily successful superintendent of the Denver Public School \nSystem. So we are taking his more recent experience and my own \nbackground, putting them together with our teachers and principals, and \nwe look forward to reporting to our colleagues what we find, as well as \nto Secretary Duncan, who will be a full partner with us in this. We \nhope this is part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act when it \nis enacted in a bipartisan way.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I thank Senator Alexander for his \nleadership over so many years on education issues confronting this \ncountry and making sure every child in America has the opportunity to \nfulfill their full potential. I thank him also for his work on this \nbipartisan effort to do something very unusual for government and also \nfor public education, which is actually to begin an inquiry about not \nwhat the next rule or regulation should be but whether there are rules \nand regulations that are now obsolete or whether our State regulations \nand Federal regulations are actually not accounting for each other in \nany way other than to overburden the people who are actually teaching \nour kids and our kids themselves.\n  I used to spend a lot of time when I was superintendent of Denver \npublic schools wondering why everybody in Washington was so mean to our \nteachers and to our kids. Now that I have been here for a couple years, \nI know the people here are not mean. But this Senate floor is a very \nlong way from the classrooms of this country--the classrooms in \nTennessee and the classrooms in Colorado. We have to remember what the \neffects of everything we do are on that moment when a teacher is in her \nclassroom with 20, 30 kids and trying to do her best to make sure they \nmove forward.\n  This is an opportunity to not show up with the answers but to ask \nquestions of our teachers and principals and moms and dads and see what \nwe can take away. I have learned something since I have been here, \nwhich is that an awful lot of the burden we are placing on people in \nschools and classrooms and the way in which State and Federal \nregulations interact with each other--if we can reduce that burden \nwhile at the same time elevating our accountability system, improve our \naccountability system, make sure we are holding everybody accountable \nfor delivering the outcomes from our kids, that not only will we get \nbetter results but we are going to find that there is a lot more time \nin the schoolday and the school year for kids to have well-rounded \neducation all across America.\n  I thank our former Education Secretary for his work, and I thank our \ncurrent Education Secretary, Arne Duncan, for working with us on this \ninitiative. I am so looking forward to having a conversation with \npeople, where we are saying: What can we take away, rather than: What \nare we going to impose on you now?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a memorandum on the\n\n[[Page S1792]]\n\nColorado-Tennessee working group on effective regulation and assessment \nsystems for public education, which outlines the roles Senator Bennet, \nmyself, Secretary Duncan, along with Governor Haslam of Tennessee and \nGovernor Hickenlooper of Colorado, will have.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nGo-TN Working Group on Effective Regulation and Assessment Systems for \n                            Public Education\n\n       The structure of the working group will be as follows:\n       Co-Chairs: Sen. Michael Bennet, Sen. Lamar Alexander, \n     Secretary Arne Duncan, Governor Bill Haslam, Governor John \n     Hickenlooper.\n       Charge:\n       (1) Examine Federal, State, and local regulations governing \n     public schools in Colorado and Tennessee.\n       a. Differentiate between financial, programmatic, general \n     education, special education, and civil rights requirements.\n       b. Identify which governmental entity requires each \n     regulation.\n       c. Measure cost of compliance in terms of funds spent on \n     compliance and time in hours and personnel.\n       d. Identify duplicative, redundant, or unnecessary \n     regulations at each governmental level.\n       e. Investigate how Federal, State, and local \n     interpretations of laws and regulations create additional or \n     unnecessary burden and are used as rationale (or cover) for \n     imposing requirements that are not actually mandated by law.\n       (2) Examine Federal, State, and local assessment systems \n     for public elementary, middle, and high schools.\n       a. Determine purpose and intent and length of each \n     assessment (e.g., measuring student achievement, teacher \n     effectiveness, system accountability).\n       b. Determine frequency, length, and scheduling and measure \n     impact on length of time in hours and days spent on testing.\n       c. Identify duplication in the current system and \n     opportunities to streamline the accountability system.\n       d. Examine whether current assessments are returned with \n     sufficient speed and quality to inform instruction, student \n     grading, and teacher effectiveness.\n       e. Examine reporting practices of test results and the \n     degree to which they are returned in a timely manner with \n     sufficient quality to be useful to parents, teachers and \n     principals, and students to inform and improve their work, \n     including targeting instruction to student needs, grading \n     student work, and evaluating teacher and principal \n     effectiveness.\n       f. Analyze the ability of quality assessments to measure \n     whether a student is prepared to graduate from high school \n     and pursue college or a career without the need for academic \n     remediation.\n       g. Examine what factors most contribute to quality \n     assessments and the extent to which high-quality assessments \n     can advance student learning.\n       h. Assess the technology infrastructure for next generation \n     assessments.\n       i. Identify opportunities to improve assessment practices \n     to better promote parent, teacher and principal, and student \n     understanding of progress toward college and career readiness \n     and public understanding of school performance and \n     educational productivity.\n       (3) Prepare a report analyzing findings and make \n     recommendations for local, State, and Federal policy makers \n     including:\n       a. State legislators\n       b. Chief State School Officers\n       c. State Federal Programs Director\n       d. Superintendents\n       e. Principals\n       f. Teachers\n       g. Assessment Experts\n       h. Educator Effectiveness Experts\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, one more time, the bottom line of this \nproposal by Senator Bennet and myself is that every minute a teacher \nspends on an unneeded test or regulation is a minute the teacher cannot \ndevote to teaching a child. What we are asking the teachers of \nTennessee and Colorado to do for us is to identify the rules and \nregulations we need and the rules and regulations we can get rid of.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I will add one more example to this from \nmy experience in Denver. We complied with No Child Left Behind in the \nDenver public schools. But there was something that didn't make sense \nto me and to our teachers and our families, which is that we thought we \nwere asking and answering a completely irrelevant question when it came \nto accountability, which was: How did this year's fourth graders do \ncompared to last year's fourth graders?\n  The accountability system in the United States is based upon that. \nWhat our teachers told me is: Michael, it is irrelevant because they \nare not the same kids.\n  They are right. So we moved to a system that asked the question: How \ndid this group of fifth graders do compared to when they were fourth \ngraders and third graders, compared to what every other child in \nColorado with a statistically similar test history did as well. All of \na sudden, we began to see places that were driving growth for kids but \nthat were completely unrecognized by the Federal law. We saw other \nplaces where kids were achieving at high levels but were falling behind \nduring the course of the year.\n  There is a lot of wisdom in this country about how to move our kids \nforward. What we have to do is tear down some of the barriers that are \nin the way of those good ideas. It took me a long time to get that \nperformance system signed off on both at the State and Federal levels. \nThe State of Colorado has a growth model, and we are talking about \ngrowth models all over the country as a result of the work we did in \nColorado and the good work that has been done in other States as well.\n  Sometimes people ask: Why is it so hard to scale quality in public \neducation? If we can, in some small way, tear down some of the \nunintended barriers to that scaling of quality education, I think our \nkids will be better for it.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for signing up on this \ninitiative. I look forward to learning what is working well and what is \nnot working so well in our respective States and watching this spread \nacross the United States. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair also.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we will soon be voting on a continuing \nresolution to continue funding the U.S. Government for 3 weeks. I \nbelieve that will reduce spending over that 3-week period by $2 billion \na week, which is far less than the debt we are incurring in each of \nthose weeks, but it is significant progress. Add it to the $4 billion \nwe did in the previous 2-week CR.\n  I will support this continuing resolution. It keeps us on track to \nachieve a $61-billion reduction in Federal spending this fiscal year, \nwhich ends September 30. It is important we take action. It is a matter \nthat is important financially to American business interests and \nforeign business interests that may be thinking of investing in the \nUnited States and people who might buy our huge number of Treasury \nbills that we sell each week and are purchased by people all over the \nworld. They want to know if we have our house in order, if this is a \nsafe place to invest their money.\n  We need to do something now. When our majority leader, Senator Reid, \nproposed not $61 billion but that we reduce spending only $4 billion \nthroughout the rest of this fiscal year, I said then and believe now \nthat is only a product of being in the Washington bubble. We are in \ndenial of the reality of the crisis we face. I do not want to talk down \nthe American economy. I believe the American worker is willing to work, \nis competitive, but we cannot burden that worker with excessive debt.\n  How does that happen? I am ranking Republican on the Budget \nCommittee. We have heard testimony from Drs. Rogoff and Reinhart, who \nhave written a book called ``This Time is Different.'' Their study of \nnations that have gotten into trouble financially and have had debt \ncrises over the last 20 years shows a consistent pattern of problems.\n  One of the things they concluded is that when a nation's debt reaches \n90 percent GDP, the economic growth in that country slows down. The \nmedian was 1 percent, but the average was more than 1 percent. Some \ncountries had more than a 1-percent drop in growth. Japan has a higher \ndebt than we do, I think the highest in the world. They have an \ninteresting way they have been able to finance it, but they have had no \ngrowth for quite a long time. It is consistent with the Rogoff-Reinhart \nstudy.\n  Does that apply to us? We are about 95 percent now. Our debt is \nsurging. By the end of this fiscal year, the numbers are that our debt \nwill be 100 percent of GDP, well above the figure. One might\n\n[[Page S1793]]\n\nask: What does 1 percent growth mean? If we are looking for growth of 2 \nor 3 percent, 1 percent is half our growth.\n  What does it mean in other terms? Experts have said that a 1-percent \nreduction in growth amounts to 1 million jobs lost.\n  I believe we are beginning to feel a negative pull on our bounce back \nfrom this recession as a result of growing debt right now, not years \ndown the road as some people have been saying and predicting; that we \nare going to have a debt crisis down the road. I hate to say it.\n  Erskine Bowles, President Clinton's Chief of Staff, was appointed by \nthe President to cochair the debt commission with Senator Alan Simpson. \nThey testified before our committee last week, and this is what they \nsaid about the nature of the crisis we face. They spent weeks studying \nthe numbers, hearing from experts all over the world, about our debt \nsituation. They reported that we have to take action now.\n  In a joint statement they presented to the committee, they said this \nis the most predictable financial crisis this Nation has ever faced. In \nother words, they said if we do not change course, it will be the most \npredictable crisis we have faced.\n  Senator Conrad, our Democratic chairman, who is very concerned about \nthese issues, asked them when. Mr. Bowles, who himself is a successful \nfinancial businessman and financier, said about 2 years. Senator \nSimpson contributed to the discussion and said: I think a year.\n  I hope we do not have some sort of debt crisis in a year. The fact \nthat has even been discussed should be a cause for alarm. Let me say, \nin January, Alan Greenspan said we could have a debt crisis in 2 to 3 \nyears. Moody's has discussed downgrading our debt. They have warned \nthey might downgrade our debt in less than 2 years. We need to take \naction now. That is the deal. That is the matter.\n  We had some fine new Members elected to the House and the Senate last \nFall. The American people believed those they elected would come to \nWashington and help us get off this course of wild spending. I believe \nthe American people get it. They are not in a bubble. They know we \ncannot continue this way. They are prepared to take some action, and we \nneed to do it. If we fail to take action that is noticeable and \nsignificant, it would send the wrong message around the world. They \nwould say: Even with this election change that occurred in Washington, \nyou are still not changing your course.\n  I urged the President before the State of the Union Adderss to talk \nstraight to the American people about the threat we face, and he did \nnot do so. The first 37 minutes of his speech was about new investments \nhe called on us to make. Investments, of course, is new spending. He \nnever once took a few moments to explain to us the kinds of things Mr. \nErskine Bowles said or Mr. Alan Greenspan said about how we are on an \nunsustainable course. He never even acknowledged we are on an \nunsustainable course. He never warned us that we are going to have to \ntighten our belts, just as Governors are doing, as mayors are doing all \nover America. When we do not have money, we do not have money. If we do \nnot have money, we have to change course.\n  I was disappointed, as were some of our Democratic colleagues, that \nwe have not had the kind of national dialog and ask the American people \nto receive somewhat less from the Federal Government than they have \nbeen.\n  Why do we have to do it? Because we are facing a crisis in good \nleadership, which means the leader has to tell the people what the \nthreat is, what the danger is, and how we are going to get out of it.\n  I truly believe one of the highest duties of any Member of Congress \nor any leader in America is to protect the American people from \nforeseeable dangers. As Erskine Bowles said, this is the most \npredictable crisis we have ever faced. It is heading to a bad end--\nhopefully, not as soon as they warned us it could happen so we will \nhave time to get off this course. That is important.\n  The President said in his State of the Union Address that we will be \nliving within our means. He did a radio address after he submitted his \nbudget, and he said: We are going to be living within our means. My \nbudget puts us on a track to prosperity. We are going to continue to \ninvest, and we will be living within our means and paying down the \ndebt.\n  Mr. Jack Lew, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, \nsays we are going to be living within our means and paying down our \ndebt. Basically, they are saying: Don't worry. You guys are getting all \nhyped up. We can still invest. We can still spend. Don't worry about \nit.\n  What do the facts say? We do not need political talk; we need a fact-\nbased budget. We need fact-based discussions. The facts are we are not \ngoing to be paying down our debt in 10 years under the President's \nbudget. We are not going to be living within our means.\n\n  What is the situation? His own budget is four volumes. In that plan \nit calls for spending levels that increase the total gross debt of the \nUnited States from $13 trillion to $26 trillion. Under that plan, the \nlowest single annual deficit that occurs is over $600 billion. The \nhighest deficit President Bush ever had was 450. That was too high. The \nlowest he is projecting in his own numbers is 600.\n  Even more troubling, in years 7, 8, 9 and 10 of his budget the \ndeficits are going up. It is almost $900 billion in the 10th year. How \ncould they say that? How could the President look the American people \nin the eye and say my budget is going to cause us to live within our \nmeans? How could Mr. Lew say that?\n  I examined Mr. Lew in the Budget Committee. I asked Mr. Lew, the \nlowest deficit you are going to have is $600 billion. How is that \nliving within our means? He said: Well, there is something called a \nprimary deficit. I said: What? He said: The primary deficit. I asked: \nWell, what is that? He said: Well, you don't count interest.\n  You don't count interest. When a family living in tight times today \nis trying to squeeze their budget, do they not count their interest on \ntheir credit card or their mortgage payment? How can they say they are \nbalancing the budget, living within our means and not count interest \nthat we pay on the debt? All of the money we borrow we have to pay \ninterest on. We pay interest on $14 trillion. If it doubles to 26, we \nwill pay interest on that. Last year, our interest payment for the \nUnited States of America was about $208 billion in interest payments \nalone.\n  Under the President's budget, the interest payment in the 10th year \nis $844 billion, according to his numbers. This is the fastest growing \nitem in the entire budget. They assume an interest rate at 3.5 percent. \nI don't think and most experts do not believe that is going to remain \nso low. This is historically very low. Historically, we average about 6 \npercent on our debt. So if it went from 3 percent to 6 or 7 percent, \ninstead of $840 billion I guess it would be $1.9 trillion in interest \npayments. And that could happen if we don't get off this unsustainable \npath we are on.\n  I am frustrated about this. People say: Well, this CR business is \nonly discretionary spending. It is only a small part of the overall \nbudget. You shouldn't even attempt to fool with it. You are wasting \nyour time. No, no, no. We are going to have to take every part of the \nbudget and see what we can do to contain the growth in spending, or \neven reduce spending, to eliminate some spending that is totally \nworthless because we get no real benefit from it. We need to make our \ngovernment more productive, lean, and efficient. We can do that.\n  We cannot continue on this course. The House of Representatives has \npassed a proposal, a continuing resolution, that would reduce spending \nthrough the rest of the fiscal year a total of $61 billion. We should \naccept that. That is not too much. It is probably not enough, but it is \nenough to count.\n  For example, it is a $61 billion reduction in baseline U.S. spending. \nIf you reduce the baseline, even if next year you start going up 1 \npercent, that 1 percent will be on a baseline that is $61 billion \nlower. We have calculated the numbers, and over 10 years, that $61 \nbillion, plus the interest you don't have to pay, will save the United \nStates Treasury $860 billion. That is a good step. That does make a \ndifference. People who deny it makes a difference are wrong. It is not \ngoing to savage\n\n[[Page S1794]]\n\nanybody, unless some of these programs aren't working, and then they \nought to be zeroed out. So I want to make that point clear.\n  How much is the discretionary spending--the money we spend here on \neducation, on highways, on things of that nature--defense? \nDiscretionary nondefense is about 12 percent of the budget; 60 percent \nor so is in Social Security and Medicare, and they are growing at an \nunsustainable rate. We need to take steps now to save Social Security, \nto put Social Security on a path so our seniors can rely on it and our \nyoung people can have confidence that when they become senior citizens, \nthey can rely on it also. It is not that difficult to do.\n  This has been talked about by editorial boards around the country, by \nexperts and economists and professors and Congressmen and Senators for \nyears. But the crisis is getting more real and acute now. Yet what did \nthe President do? He said not one word about that in his State of the \nUnion or his budget. His budget doesn't do anything about any of the \nentitlements. You can't cut discretionary spending and you can't cut \nentitlement spending. In effect, they are saying nothing is to be \nchallenged. I know that is not a rational approach to the crisis we are \nin today.\n  We have to work together. We have Senators together right now--\nDemocratic and Republican--who are trying to figure out a way to make \nsome alterations in the trajectory of our debt in America and to put us \non a sound path. Democrats and Republicans are meeting--Senator Warner, \nSenator Chambliss, I think Senator Manchin and others are talking. They \nwant to see us do something historic. I think we need to. But on the \nBudget Committee, Budget Director Lew said the President wasn't for any \nchange. He took the view that Social Security doesn't have a problem; \nnothing is going to happen until 2037. Well, what happens then? It \nfalls off a cliff, and that is assuming you count this paper that is \nsupposed to be backing it up. But the money has been spent. We need to \nget Social Security on a sound course, and we can do it.\n  We have to work on Medicare, which is even more problematic and more \ndangerous. We need to get it on a sound course. We need to get our \nheads together on discretionary spending and contain our growth in \ndiscretionary spending, all of which is possible to do. All of that is \npossible to do. We have the opportunity to put our country on a road to \nprosperity and growth. We will need to do some things such as reforming \nour tax laws to more fairly raise revenue in a way that allows more \ngrowth to occur, because we need to have growth. We have to create \njobs. We need to redo our energy policy and produce more American \nenergy and hold the cost of energy down, not drive up the cost of \ngasoline and electricity on the American people.\n  Momentum, I think, is on the side of this. When Majority Leader Reid \noffered his pittance of a reduction--a $4 billion reduction--10 \nDemocratic Senators defected. They didn't vote for it because they \ndidn't think it reduced spending enough. We had three Republicans who \ndidn't support the $61 billion. They thought it ought to go lower than \nthat. So the momentum out there is to go further than we are going.\n  The American people get it. Our expert testimony from witnesses tells \nus that. We have seen Bill Gross, of the PIMCO Bond Fund, the largest \nfund in the world, say they are not buying any more U.S. Treasuries, \nbasically calling on the United States to reduce our debt. He didn't \nhave confidence in it. We need to get busy and do some things. It is \ngoing to have to be done in a bipartisan way, there is no doubt about \nit.\n  There are two choices, I believe, truly. One is a tougher road, but \nit is the road to prosperity. It can return us to the kind of \nleadership role in the world we need to be in. The other road is the \nroad to decline. Nothing comes from nothing. Nothing ever could, Julie \nAndrews sang. There is no free lunch. Debts have to be paid. Interest \nhas to be paid on debts. This is reality. We don't live in a fantasy \nworld. The time to stand and be counted is now.\n  This $61 billion reduction in spending through the last 6\\1/2\\ or so \nmonths of this fiscal year is a statement. It is actual, it is real, it \nwill reduce the total indebtedness of the United States by $860 billion \nover 10 years. We could do more, but Congress being what it is, slowly \ncoming around to the challenge, we are not ready probably to do more. \nBut we need to do $61 billion. We do not need a compromise halfway, \nsome $30 billion reduction in spending. I do believe that would show \nweakness on our part--a lack of resolve--which would not be a good \nsignal for our fragile economy today.\n  We need to meet the test, to face the defining challenge of our time, \nand that is spending. It is the dominant issue facing America today, no \ndoubt about it. It dwarfs every other issue. I wish it weren't so. When \nI came, in 1997, I guess we were still fighting over spending then, \ntrying to contain spending, but by 1998 and 1999 we were in surplus. We \nbalanced the budget. They started in 1994 and made some tough \ndecisions. It is going to be harder this time. The hole is deeper, the \ndemographics and the systemic threats to our financial order are \ngreater than it was, there is no doubt about it. But we can do it.\n  I think it is our time to fulfill our duty--our duty to our Nation \nand to the American people to preserve America's heritage. We are \nstanding at a time in this country where we have to make a choice. \nLet's make this choice. Let's do this 3-week extension, take it down $6 \nbillion more over that 3 weeks, and then let's come back and do $61 \nbillion and celebrate the first real step in decades to contain growth \nand spending. Let's promise this is the beginning. Let's promise that \nwe are going to review all our spending, and we are going to do it in \nan honest, aboveboard way, fact based, not politics, not smoke and \nmirrors, or fantasy budgets, but real numbers facing real threats.\n  If we do that, I think the American people will be supportive. They \nwere supportive in the last election. I believe they will be supportive \nagain.\n  I thank the Chair for his leadership on these issues in the Senate. I \nthink there is growing consensus here that progress must be made.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wanted to say a few words in support of the \ncontinuing resolution that the House of Representatives passed that we \nare going to be voting on here in another hour or so. It is H.J. Res. \n48.\n  This is the second short-term funding extension to prevent a \ngovernment shutdown while our congressional leaders are negotiating to \ntry to reach an agreement on a long-term plan to keep our government \nworking through the end of this fiscal year ending in September. The \nshort- and long-term continuing resolutions under discussion are \nleftover work from 2010 to finish the job of funding the government, as \nI said, through the end of this fiscal year.\n  Notably, the spending cuts that have been achieved so far are really \nthe first meaningful spending cuts the Congress has passed since the \nDeficit Reduction Act which was enacted in February 2006.\n  The House-passed 3-week CR or continuing resolution, which runs until \nApril 8, includes $6 billion in spending cuts, which will keep the \nCongress on track to implement the overall $61 billion in spending \nreductions which are included in the long-term CR. Enactment of this \nshort-term measure would mean that in just 5 weeks we will have cut $10 \nbillion from this year's spending, and because of the adjustment in the \nbaseline, that means that over a 10-year period of time, we will have \nsaved the taxpayers $140 billion. Even in Washington, DC, that is real \nmoney.\n  The cuts in H.J. Res. 48 include funding rescissions, reductions, and \nprogram terminations. It also eliminates earmarked accounts within the \nAgriculture, Commerce-Justice-Science, Financial Services, General \nGovernment, and Interior Subcommittee jurisdictions. It reduces or \nterminates 25 programs, for a savings of $3.5 billion, and\n\n[[Page S1795]]\n\neliminates $2.6 billion in earmarked account funding--all in all, a \npretty good day's work. While we could argue the spending cuts are not \nlarge relative to the overall budget, as I said before, they will \namount to $140 billion in savings over 10 years.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this ability to cut funding--\nsomething we do not often have the opportunity to do. Why do we need to \ndo this? Well, we all know that, first of all, we have a gross Federal \ndebt exceeding $14 trillion. In fact, we are piling up debt at such a \nfast rate, that soon, the administration says--and the administration \nhas--the President has asked us to increase the debt ceiling of the \nUnited States because of the amount of debt we keep adding to that that \nexists.\n  Obviously, we are living beyond our means. We have to borrow $4 \nbillion a day. Another way to look as it is that for every dollar we \nspend here, we have to borrow 42 cents of that from somebody else. \nAbout half of that borrowing occurs from foreign nations. If you want \nto look at how the debt relates to the American citizens, it is equal \nto $45,500 per American or, if you want to relate it just to those who \npay taxes, it is $127,000 for every taxpayer in the United States. That \nis how big our debt is.\n  That money has to be paid back. This is not something that just is \nout there in the ether somewhere; our creditors will want to be paid \nback when the bonds we have issued become due. It is either going to be \nus here in Congress and the President deciding how to reorder our \npriorities so we get our fiscal house in order or eventually the \nbondholders are going to do it for us by demanding far higher interest \nrates in order to buy our debt.\n  It is not just a fiscal problem, it is a national security problem. \nThe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mike Mullen, has made the \npoint: ``I believe that our debt is the greatest threat to our national \nsecurity.''\n  Now, why does he say that? Well, there are two basic reasons why. If \nwe do not have the economic capability of funding all of the national \nsecurity requirements we have, we no longer are the world's leading \npower, able to project our authority throughout the world, our ability \nto help others as well as defend ourselves.\n  Second, when we get into hock with other countries, become their \ndebtors, our ability to influence their decisions in the world is \ndiminished. It is very hard for us to go to the Chinese, who hold a \ncouple trillion dollars of our debt--I think it is a figure roughly in \nthat neighborhood--and say: We demand that you support us in the United \nNations Security Council to impose sanctions on Iran. It is pretty easy \nfor them to say: Oh, really? How about that debt you owe us? How about \nif you pay a little higher interest rate on that money?\n  Well, of course, paying a higher interest rate would devastate both \nour Federal budget and our economy. So it impacts our ability to \ninfluence others around the world, thereby also influencing our \nnational security.\n  Finally, there is the impact of the cuts we are making today, when we \npass this legislation, on job creation in our country. There is a \ndirect relationship between government spending on the one hand--going \ninto debt--and job creation on the other. It is one of the reasons we \nhave the high unemployment we have today. In fact, if you look at a \nchart, there is an absolute direct correlation between the unemployment \nin our country and the deficit spending and debt in our country. That \nis why we have to get that lower. When we reduce the amount of debt and \nwe spend less, which is what this legislation will do, we can leave the \nmoney in the private sector, enabling private businesses to invest that \nmoney, including in jobs, thereby not only hiring more people but \nhelping our economy to grow.\n  In his work, Stanford economist John Taylor has shown this direct \ncorrelation between these spending cuts and increased employment. He \nrecently released an analysis, and it is titled ``Why a Credible Budget \nStrategy Will Reduce Unemployment and Increase Economic Growth.'' That \nis the title. It concluded that the spending cuts in H.R. 1, which is \nthe underlying continuing resolution in the House, ``will increase \neconomic growth and employment as the federal government begins to put \nits fiscal house in order and encourage job-producing private sector \ninvestment.'' He is, by the way, among 150 top economists in the United \nStates who signed a statement arguing for a change in direction and \nimmediate action ``to begin to slow government spending, reduce \nuncertainty, and support the creation of new private sector jobs.''\n  We can begin that process by adopting the legislation that is before \nus here in another hour or so. It will, as I said, cut an additional $6 \nbillion, so that the total in this last month and 1 week will be $10 \nbillion in spending cuts that will, over a 10-year period of time, save \nthe taxpayers $140 billion--all in all, a good day's work.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the current debate \nover the current Federal budget. On Tuesday, a very telling and very \ntroubling vote was held in the House of Representatives. In order to \npass the 3-week continuing resolution needed to avert a government \nshutdown, which we are considering here in the Senate today, Speaker \nBoehner was forced to rely on votes from House Democrats.\n  He had to do so because conservative Republicans abandoned their \nparty leadership in droves. They fumed that the measure lacked special \ninterest add-ons dealing with ideological issues such as abortion, net \nneutrality, and global warming.\n  In all, 54 conservative Republicans rejected the measure--even though \nit was necessary to avert a shutdown, even though their own leadership \nnegotiated the proposal, and even though it included $6 billion in \nadditional cuts to domestic discretionary spending. This is a bad omen.\n  Last week, the Senate held two test votes: one on H.R. 1 and one on a \nDemocratic alternative. We knew that neither proposal would have the \nvotes to pass and, sure enough, both went down.\n  The purpose of those votes was to make it clear that both sides' \nopening bids in this debate were nonstarters and thus pave the way for \na serious and good-faith compromise. But, unfortunately, an intense \nideological tail continues to wag the dog over in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Speaker Boehner had hoped after H.R. 1 failed in the Senate, it would \nconvince his conservatives of the need to compromise. Instead, those \nconservatives have only dug their heels in further, and that is no way \nto improve our Nation's fiscal footing.\n  Speaker Boehner has said in no uncertain terms that he wants to avoid \na shutdown, and I believe him. He is a good, honest man. The problem \nis, a large percentage of those in his party think ``compromise'' is a \nfour-letter word.\n  I do not envy the position the Speaker is in, but he is going to have \nto make a choice. This is not a yellow wood in Robert Frost's poem, but \nthere are two divergent roads, and, sorry, Speaker Boehner cannot \ntravel both. He can cater to the tea party element and, as Congressman \nMike Pence has suggested, ``pick a fight'' that will inevitably cause a \nshutdown on April 8--that is one path--or he can abandon the tea party \nin these negotiations and forge a consensus among more moderate \nRepublicans and a group of Democrats. I think we all know which road he \nshould choose.\n  Speaker Boehner would not have been able to pass this short-term \nmeasure without Democratic votes, and he will not be able to pass a \nlong-term one without Democratic votes either.\n  Throughout this debate, Democrats have repeatedly shown a willingness \nto negotiate, a willingness to meet Republicans somewhere in the \nmiddle, and yet the rank and file of the House GOP has been utterly \nunrelenting. They have wrapped their arms around the discredited, \nreckless approach advanced by H.R. 1, and they will not let\n\n[[Page S1796]]\n\ngo. In fact, they just keep squeezing harder.\n  Worse, the last few days have taught us that spending cuts alone will \nnot bring a compromise.\n  The new demand from the far right is that we go along with all their \nextraneous riders. These riders don't belong on a budget bill, but they \nwere shoehorned into H.R. 1 anyway. Now the hard-liners want them in \nthe final deal.\n  This is why a compromise has been so hard to come by in the budget. \nIt is because Republicans want more than spending cuts; they want to \nimpose their entire social agenda on the back of a must-pass budget.\n  Those on the right are entitled to their policy positions, but there \nis a time and a place to debate these issues, and this ain't it. If \nthis debate were only about spending cuts we probably would come to an \nagreement before long, but we will have a hard time coming to an \nagreement if those on the hard right treat the budget as an opportunity \nto enact a far-ranging agenda.\n  Many Republicans in the House recognize the unreasonableness of the \nhard-liners, to their credit. Steve LaTourette of Ohio said passing the \n3-week stopgap was ``exactly what people expect us to do--find cuts and \ncontinue to talk.''\n  Michael Grimm, a very bright freshman from my home State of New York, \nsaid the tea party lawmakers were making ``a big mistake.''\n  This is proof positive there are reasonable Republicans in the House, \nincluding some reasonable freshmen such as Mr. Grimm who, along with a \ngroup of Democrats, can provide Speaker Boehner with the way around the \ntea party. In order to avoid a dead end on these budget talks, Speaker \nBoehner should abandon the tea party and work to forge a bipartisan \nconsensus. It is the only way out of this bind.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on March 2, we voted on a short-term \ncontinuing resolution. We vote today on another. I opposed the earlier \nmeasure, and for the same reasons, I oppose this one as well.\n  First, this legislation makes unjustified cuts in important Federal \nprograms. These cuts will affect the safety and well-being of Americans \nwho already have suffered through the worst recession since the Great \nDepression, and who still are waiting for a robust economic recovery to \nlift their fortunes.\n  The cuts in this bill include a more than 15-percent reduction in \nimportant agricultural research programs that help our farmers fight \nthreats such as plant diseases and invasive species. And they include a \nreduction of $200 million--almost 25 percent--in funding for community-\noriented policing grants that help local law enforcement agencies \nafford the equipment they need to keep our communities safe.\n  Second, while this legislation will do real damage to important \nprograms, it will have little effect on its professed target: the \nFederal budget deficit. Focusing solely on cuts in nondefense \ndiscretionary spending, as this and previous continuing resolutions \nhave done, cannot solve our budget problems, because those programs \nmake up less than 15 percent of our budget.\n  Lastly, this legislation makes not even a gesture toward what must be \nan essential part of any deficit-reduction strategy: revenue \nimprovements through the closing of tax loopholes and a rollback of the \nunjustified tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans that occurred under \nPresident Bush.\n  I will repeat what I have said before: We cannot seriously dent the \nFederal budget deficit unless we address revenues as well as spending. \nThis is a matter of simple arithmetic. Hacking away at a narrow slice \nof the budget cannot significantly reduce our deficit. But it can do \nsignificant damage to our Nation's safety and security and to the \nwelfare of American families. Passing legislation that does such damage \nis an error; passing it while failing to address unjustified tax cuts \nand loopholes that benefit the wealthy adds insult to injury.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to discuss a \npressing matter.\n  In a few hours, the Senate will take up another short-term continuing \nresolution to fund the government for fiscal year 2011. Earlier this \nmonth, I voted no on another short-term CR. From my perspective, the \nspending reductions provided in that bill were a start, but they sent a \nbad sign.\n  Washington needs to make clear, to citizens and to the markets, that \nit is serious about restoring the fiscal integrity of the United \nStates. Don't get me wrong, any spending reductions are good spending \nreductions. But by getting into the habit of passing continuing \nresolutions rather than long-term funding bills with significant \nreductions in government spending, Congress and the White House send \nthe signal that real spending restraint is impossible. The spending \nreductions in the last CR were a start, but they simply did not go far \nenough to bring fiscal sanity back to Washington. Unfortunately, in \nthis opening volley in the debate over spending--to borrow from the \nformer coach of the Arizona Cardinals, Denny Green--Democrats have \nshown that they are what we thought they were.\n  The rest of the world heard voters loud and clear last fall. Voters \nwant spending restraint from Washington. Republicans told voters that \nDemocrats could not be trusted on spending. And Democrats are still \nmaking our case.\n  One of my Democratic colleagues in the Senate has said that with \nrespect to fiscal year 2011 spending reductions, I think we have pushed \nthis to the limit. Last week, Democrats drew their line in the sand, \nand according to the Congressional Budget Office, they refused to \nreduce spending by any more than $4.7 billion. So in an appropriations \nbill that would spend over $1 trillion, Democrats could not find any \nmore than $4.7 billion in reductions. The most they could come up with \nis a spending reduction of one-half of one percent? If Democrats \nconsider these pathetic spending reductions pushing it to the limit, I \nwould hate to see them really slacking off. In the Democrats' world, \nyou are only truly stingy if you fail to increase spending. But failing \nto increase spending is not reducing spending, and we need to be \nreducing spending. American families are doing it at home, and we need \nto be doing it here. Pushed it to the limit? Give me a break.\n  There is no better time than right now to get serious about reducing \nspending. First, with each short-term CR that passes, it becomes less \nlikely that we will get the full $61 billion in spending reductions \nthat Americans want to see Congress adopt. Second, I am not going to \nsign onto the Democrats' strategy of short-term CRs that will \njeopardize our national defense. We cannot be funding national defense \nin little 2- and 3-week blips. And third, we need to make it clear that \ndiscretionary spending matters. Democrats are fond of saying that the \nproblem with our budget deficits is not discretionary spending. Well, \nit might not be the entire problem but it is a big part of the problem.\n  Democrats suggest that discretionary spending is a sideshow. The real \nmoney is in entitlements. Let me make one point here. Democrats today \nsay they want to focus on entitlements, but you can bet the farm that \ntoday's budget-minded Democrats will start bludgeoning Republicans for \nany effort, no matter how modest, to get entitlement spending under \ncontrol. The writer Andrew Ferguson got it right when he called these \nDemocrats tough-choosers. They always talk about making the tough \nchoices to get our spending under control, but the minute Republicans \nattempt to address deficits and debt, these same Democrats hammer \nRepublicans for the coldheartedness.\n  Getting at entitlement spending requires bipartisan leadership and \nPresidential leadership. Yet the President, who has enough time to go \non national television and fill out his NCAA bracket, is only committed \nto a serious conversation about entitlements. We need more than a \nconversation; we need leadership. But leadership on spending is wanting \namong Washington Democrats.\n  In the end, these Democratic tough-choosers won't stand strong on \ndiscretionary spending or entitlement spending. So let's focus on \ndiscretionary spending. It is a problem, and it is what the American \npeople sent us here to address. Nondefense discretionary spending has \ngrown by 24 percent over\n\n[[Page S1797]]\n\nthe last couple of years. This needs to be rolled back significantly. \nPeople in Utah understand that returning us to 2008 spending levels is \nthe responsible thing to do.\n  When Democrats tell you that discretionary spending does not matter, \nthink of a person who needs to go on a diet. The person weighs 300 \npounds and needs to radically change his lifestyle in order to get in \nshape. When a Democrat says that we don't need to worry about \ndiscretionary spending, it is like an overweight person saying there is \nno need to worry about the half-pint of cookie dough ice cream he eats \nevery day because he has cut out his daily large pizza. If you want to \nlose weight, you can't have either. And if you want to reduce spending, \nyou need to address all of it.\n  The fact is, we are up to our eyeballs in deficits and debt. For the \nthird consecutive year, we will have a deficit of over $1 trillion. We \nblew $1 trillion on the stimulus and followed that up with a $2.6 \ntrillion health care bill that we could not afford.\n  I appreciate the efforts of my Republican colleagues, both in the \nHouse and the Senate, as they try to reach an agreement on a spending \nbill that should have become law last year. But Democrats, who \ncontrolled the White House and both Houses of Congress, shirked their \nresponsibilities. And now they are digging in, trying their best to \nthwart the will of the American people and hold the line on the \nspending that Democratic special interests demand.\n  Here is a basic question that should inform this debate. What do you \ndo when you are spending more money than you make? Even a second grade \nstudent could tell you that you stop spending money. Democrats' \nsubservience to the spending status quo would not pass a second grade \nmath class. But do they really mean to say that they can't find \nanything to cut? For some, every new crisis--real or imagined--seems to \ndemand a solution that only government can provide. But how often do we \nreally look back with a critical eye and evaluate the effectiveness of \nall of these new government programs? I am afraid not nearly enough.\n  Thanks to the work of my colleague from Oklahoma, Dr. Coburn, the GAO \nrecently identified possibly hundreds of billions of wasteful and \nredundant government spending. Government is littered with programs \nthat can be reduced or eliminated. To that end, along with my colleague \nfrom Colorado, Senator Udall, I have introduced legislation that would \ncreate an anti-appropriations committee specifically designed to ferret \nout and cut government waste. And, of course, the ultimate fix for all \nof this spending is the balanced budget amendment, which I have \nintroduced with my colleague Senator Cornyn, and is cosponsored by 31 \nof our colleagues. With a balanced budget amendment and with serious \nefforts by Congress, we can reduce spending in Washington, and we can \nrestore constitutional limits on the size and reach of the Federal \nGovernment. This is no longer an ideological issue. Democrats might not \nknow that yet. But spending is now an issue that transcends partisan \nallegiances.\n  Washington's reckless spending has now become a serious enough issue \nthat financial markets are paying attention. Just last week, the \nworld's largest bond investor divested all of its holdings in U.S. \nTreasuries. This is hardly a vote of confidence in the integrity of our \nNation's finances. Yet what is the Democrats' solution? Let's reduce \nspending by $4.5 billion. To borrow from my friend and colleague from \nIowa, Senator Grassley, this is a spit in the ocean.\n  Congress needs to send a signal to the world that it is serious about \ntaking on government spending. Unfortunately, Democrats remain intent \non being unserious. I will not play these games with our Nation's \nfiscal integrity. I look forward to a meaningful debate over a long-\nterm fiscal year 2011 spending bill. In the meantime, I will not be \nsupporting the CR when it comes up later today.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on the sixth \ncontinuing resolution of the fiscal year. While this is not a record \nfor Congress, it is certainly a number far higher than is appropriate \nfor responsibly funding the government. I want to take a minute to \nexplain how we got to this point.\n  Last December the Senate Appropriations Committee prepared an omnibus \nspending bill to fund the government for fiscal year 2011. The omnibus \nwas not a perfect bill, but it was based on hundreds of hours of \nhearings, committee meetings and bipartisan negotiations. Members of \nboth parties had input into the process and content of the bill. So it \nwas perplexing that in the waning hours of the 111th Congress our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle walked away from this bill. \nBecause any action in the Senate is now subject to the approval of a \nsupermajority we were unable to pass the omnibus and instead passed a \ncontinuing resolution to fund the government through the beginning of \nMarch.\n  I fully understand concerns about using an omnibus as a method for \nbudgeting; it is far from a perfect mechanism. But the alternative is \nto operate the way we have for the last 6 months, stringing along stop-\ngap measures that undermine Federal programs and agencies. The impact \nof uncertain budgeting is felt at the State and local levels as well. I \nhear on a daily basis from Vermonters about Head Start programs that \nare considering layoffs, college students concerned whether they will \nhave to take out more loans if Pell grants are cut, and hundreds of \nothers worried about the future of home heating, housing and basic \nsafety net programs for many who are struggling mightily right now.\n  It is critical that rather than muddling along with more short-term \ncontinuing resolutions that we pass a responsible budget plan for the \nremainder of the year. The current 3-week CR under consideration is an \nexample of how this process does not serve us well. Halfway through the \nfiscal year we are debating significant cuts to infrastructure funding \nlike Save America's Treasures, the Public Television Facilities Program \nand to efforts that provide basic services such as rural housing \nassistance to Vermonters.\n  I am extremely disappointed with the elimination of the Save \nAmerica's Treasures program. It has preserved hundreds of historic \nlandmarks throughout the country, a number of which are iconic Vermont \nstructures, valuable parts of my State's identity. Another cut that is \ndisappointing is the elimination of funding in fiscal year 2011 for the \nInternational Fund for Ireland. It is an unfortunate twist that on St. \nPatrick's Day, Congress is poised to pull the plug on this program of \nassistance for the most economically depressed communities of Northern \nIreland.\n  These are not abstract cuts. The elimination and reduction of this \nfunding will have a measurable and negative impact on job creation and \nthe daily lives of Americans. While I believe these cuts are misguided, \nI will reluctantly support the continuing resolution. I do not make \nthis decision lightly or with any enthusiasm. Unfortunately this bill \nis the only option available to keep the government running and prevent \na shutdown. A shutdown would cause severe hardship for countless \npeople, and the President and Congress must use this time to find an \nacceptable compromise to fund the government through the remainder of \nthe year.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in reluctant support of another \nshort-term CR because I am absolutely against a government shutdown.\n  But enough is enough. We are 6 months into the fiscal year and no \ncloser to having a budget than the day we started. The American people \nwant a budget that is frugal, on their side and brings stability to \ntheir lives. Both parties must come together and agree to sensible \nbudget cuts for remainder of this year. But cuts are not a strategy to \nreduce the deficit. Cuts are a tool, not a strategy. We must also \ntackle the items that are responsible for adding to our deficit.\n  We cannot continue a cycle of cutting $2 billion every 2 weeks. That \nis no way to govern. Even though many of the cuts in the new CR are \ncuts that I agree with, short-term CRs are a government shutdown by \nproxy. I don't want a government shutdown. I am fighting to prevent it. \nBut we cannot fund the government with two to three week payments. It \nis bad for Federal workers, contractors, families and the economy.\n  Senate Democrats have initiated cuts. First we cut $41 billion from \nthe\n\n[[Page S1798]]\n\nPresident's budget request. Then we offered to cut another $10 billion \nfor a total of $51 billion in cuts. But our offer was rejected. \nRepublicans want to cut $100 billion. We met them halfway. But that \nwasn't good enough. Whether we cut $100 billion at once or several \nbillion at a time in short term CRs, this is not a strategy to reduce \nthe deficit and will hurt middle class families.\n  I am for cuts. The biggest cut I want to make is to the unemployment \nrate. Last week, I voted for Chairman Inouye's package with $51 billion \nin cuts. And in my own CJS bill, I have agreed to cut agency overhead \nby 10 percent, and cut agency party funds by 25 percent.\n  I am for making cuts to programs that middle class families don't \ndepend on for their survival. Let's end lavish subsidies for oil and \ngas companies to save $4 billion each year before we cut Head Start and \nChild Care by $1 billion. Let's stop the tax breaks for corporations \nthat send jobs overseas to save $5 billion before we cut afterschool \nprograms by $100 million. Let's stop subsidizing big agribusiness to \nsave another $5 billion a year before we cut Pell grants for middle \nclass kids by more than $600. And let's end the war and bring our \ntroops home which costs $1.1 billion a week in Iraq and $2.5 billion a \nweek in Afghanistan before we ask our military men and women and their \nfamilies to sacrifice any more for our country.\n  The uncertainty of these short-term CRs is bad for workers and \ncontractors. One-hundred thirty-thousand Federal employees and tens of \nthousands more contractors live and work in Maryland. These are some of \nthe most dedicated, hardworking people in our Nation. They make sure \nthe food we eat is safe, find cures for the most devastating diseases, \nand make sure seniors get their checks every month. At Goddard Space \nFlight Center in Prince George's County there are 9,100 employees 3,400 \ncivil servants and 5,700 contractors leading the world in green science \ninitiatives. Of these 9,100 workers, 65 percent are scientists, \nengineers and technicians taking us into the next century with research \non the Earth and its climate and leading missions to learn about the \nSun, Moon, Mercury and Saturn.\n  Maryland's Federal employees win Nobel Prizes. Dr. Bill Phillips of \nthe National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg \nshared the 1997 Physics Nobel Prize for development of methods to cool \nand trap atoms with laser light, making it possible for us to study \natoms with unprecedented precision. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu was \none of his co-winners. Dr. Martin Rodbell of NIH shared the 1994 Nobel \nPrize in Medicine for his discovery of G-proteins and the principles of \nsignal transduction in cellular communication. Dr. John C. Mather of \nNASA Goddard shared the 2006 Nobel in Physics for a discovery that has \nenabled precise measurements of the first moments of the universe. \nWhether they have won a Nobel Prize or provide the petri dishes or \nsupport services for this important work, these are hard working \nfederal employees and contractors who are duty and mission driven.\n  In Prince George's County, I heard from a small business owner who \ndoes contract business with the government. Over the years she has \ngrown her business with help from the Small Business Administration. \nHer company graduated from the SBA's 8(a) business development program, \nwhich was created to help small and disadvantaged companies compete. By \ntaking advantage of the resources offered like mentoring, business \ncounseling, training, financial assistance and technical assistance she \ngrew to a $43 million business based in Maryland with divisions in \nother states. She's a success story. She asked me, ``What should we do \nif the government shuts down?'' She's afraid that the gains she's made \ncould all be lost in a shutdown. At a time when we are seeing signs of \neconomic recovery Congress should be nurturing this trend with \npredictable, stable funding for small business owners, not destroying \nit.\n  I support Federal employees and contractors. I support the mission of \nour government agencies and I support providing the money needed to \ncarry out their mandates. But I don't support a government shutdown.\n  I support cuts. But cuts are not a strategy to reduce the deficit. \nCuts are a tool, but they are not the only tool. We need a more \nthoughtful approach. We need a real strategy.\n  I will vote for today's CR but we cannot continue to pass short-term \nspending bills. Both sides must come to agree on a long-term budget for \nremainder of fiscal year.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I will vote in favor of the \ncontinuing resolution to keep our government and all its essential \nservices open and operating for the next 3 weeks. I am supporting \nanother short-term extension for the last time. I am only supporting \nthis legislation today because I have been guaranteed by the leadership \non both sides of the aisle that this will be the last time we will be \nforced into adopting a short-term fix to our budget problems and \nbecause the only other option would be to shut down the operations of \nthe government.\n  I believe a government shutdown is in no ones interests but I remain \ndeeply disappointed in the political process that has put us in this \nuntenable position. A 3-week extension that merely defers tough \ndecisions on funding for the fiscal year that started almost 6 months \nago is hardly progress. The American people deserve better than a \nstalled process which delays important decisions of how we can reduce \nour Federal budget deficit while maintaining our important investments \nin infrastructure, research, education, technology, and clean energy \nwhich will result in new jobs and will bolster our long-term \ncompetitiveness.\n  The American people deserve a serious dialogue within the Congress \nabout our fiscal situation, discretionary spending, entitlements, and \nrevenues. We need to work towards a long-term solution to reduce both \nour current budget deficit and our staggering debt. We will need to \nreduce federal spending and make appropriate changes to our entitlement \nprograms to meet the fiscal challenges facing our country. To do this \nappropriately, everything--revenue, tax reform, spending and \nentitlements--needs to be on the table.\n  The question now is what are the tough decisions we are going to make \ntoday? What are the issues we are going to wrestle with together at a \nmoment of enormous challenge? This process cannot be done in 3 weeks, \nbut it should have already begun--and it needs to begin today. The \nAmerican people deserve no less.\n\n\n impacts of cuts to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, at my request, the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration has provided information on the potential \nimpact of a fiscal year 2011 continuing resolution on the agency's \nlong-term ability to effectively carry out its mission. In particular, \nthey highlight potential impacts to their ability to provide accurate \nand timely weather and hazard forecasts and what the economic impacts \nmay be on a State-by-State basis. I ask unanimous consent that their \nresponse be printed in the Record so that we may have a more informed \ndebate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      U.S. Department of Commerce,\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Inouye,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Inouye: Thank you for meeting with me on \n     Monday, March 7, 2011, and for your letter regarding the \n     level of funding for National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration included in the proposed FY 2011 Continuing \n     Resolutions. Enclosed are answers to your questions on the \n     Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) and state-by-state data \n     on NOAA funding.\n       I appreciate your interest in our polar satellite system, \n     which is of vital importance to the Nation. NOAA provided the \n     best information possible in the rapid time frame that the \n     current debate demands. If we may be of further assistance to \n     focus on more specific information or examples, please do not \n     hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                        Jane Lubchenco. Ph.D.,\n\n                                   Under Secretary of Commerce for\n     Oceans and Atmosphere.\n                                  ____\n\n       What impacts would the CR have on NOAA's ability to \n     continue development of the Joint Polar Satellite System \n     (JPSS), and if it is not adequately funded this year, how \n     would that affect funding needs in future years?\n       The FY 2011 President's Budget Request included $1.06 \n     billion to maintain continuity of\n\n[[Page S1799]]\n\n     earth observations with the next generation of polar \n     satellite, NOAA's JPSS. To ensure data continuity, the \n     Administration had submitted an anomaly request for $528 \n     million.\n       Because of insufficient funding, and the uncertainty caused \n     by the temporary continuing resolutions this year, the launch \n     date for JPSS-1 has already slipped to March 2016, a delay of \n     at least 14 months and the costs of the program have risen. \n     Continued inadequate funding will cause further delays--on an \n     approximate day-for-day slip--and further cost growth. Thus, \n     if JPSS funding were kept at the CR level for the entire FY \n     2011, the launch date for JPSS-1 will slip to no earlier than \n     September 2016.\n       An analysis done by the Aerospace Corporation demonstrates \n     that even small slips to the launch schedule for JPSS-1 in \n     2016 yields large increases in the likelihood that a gap in \n     satellite coverage will occur. This is because NASA's NPOESS \n     Preparatory Project (NPP) that will launch later this year as \n     a temporary replacement will have reached its end-of-life and \n     the probability it will survive another day or month \n     decreases dramatically. Thus, additional funding in FY 2011 \n     of $528 million will allow for a launch in the March 2016 \n     timeframe vice September 2016 timeframe and decrease the \n     probability of a gap in coverage from 90 percent to 35 \n     percent. Additionally, in order to maintain a March 2016 \n     launch date, full funding of JPSS will be required in FY 2012 \n     of $1.07 billion.\n       At the CR level, NOAA can only support about half the JPSS \n     workforce planned. Funding uncertainty also precluded hiring \n     the approximately 700 additional contractors, nationwide, \n     required for the program. As a result, NOAA has focused its \n     development efforts on the delivery of those program elements \n     that will support the launch of the NPP satellite this fall, \n     which will provide data for NOAA operational weather \n     forecasts after the failure of NOAA's current operational \n     polar-orbiting satellite. The inability to support the \n     necessary workforce requires us to focus the resources we \n     have on the NPP mission and forces us to delay work on the \n     JPSS spacecraft and instruments resulting in a delay of at \n     least 14 months to the date JPSS needs to be available to \n     launch. The planned launch has now slipped from 2015 to 2016. \n     Given this schedule slip and the amount of time needed to \n     calibrate a new satellite before it can generate useful data \n     for weather and climate needs, it is highly likely that JPSS \n     will not be operational in time to ensure data continuity \n     with NPP. We estimate a 90% likelihood of a ``data gap'' in \n     2017, which would result in a degradation of forecast \n     accuracy that is further discussed in the next response. A \n     lack of funding in FY 2011 will also increase the total life-\n     cycle cost of the system as development efforts are \n     stretched, opportunities to capture purchasing and production \n     efficiencies are lost, contract management expenses increase, \n     and the compounding impact of inflation as the program is \n     delayed. Experience suggests that without additional \n     funding in FY 2011 the total life-cycle cost of the \n     program could grow by approximately $1.6 to $2.6 billion.\n       What kind of impacts do you foresee for weather forecasting \n     capability if JPSS is not adequately funded, and what would \n     be the effects on the safety of U.S. citizens?\n       What economic impacts would you expect if the U.S. were to \n     lose the observations expected from the JPSS program?\n       During the gap period, NOAA will have to rely on \n     international partners for non-optimal data to support our \n     weather prediction models, resulting in a degradation of \n     forecast accuracy by 1 to 2 days. Higher confidence forecasts \n     would only extend out 5 days instead of 7 days as they do \n     currently. This degradation would cause the National Weather \n     Service to suffer a loss of decades' worth of continual \n     improvements in forecast ability. The economic and security \n     consequences to the Nation would be severe:\n       $100 to $200 million per year to the aviation industry from \n     reduced volcanic ash monitoring.\n       $6--$8 billion lost annually due to reduced accuracy of \n     drought forecasts impacting the agriculture, transportation, \n     recreation and tourism, forestry, and energy sectors.\n       Alaska, due to its high northern latitude and remoteness is \n     only serviced by our polar satellites. During a gap the State \n     would lose almost all of its weather forecasting for aviation \n     as well as for the economically vital maritime, oil and gas \n     industries. The estimated average expected annual losses to \n     container shipping (lost containers and damage to vessels) in \n     the absence of good information about extratropical storm \n     conditions is on the order of $250 million/year in the North \n     Pacific.\n       Less accurate long range forecasts of severe weather will \n     adversely impact emergency response and evacuation planning \n     for major storms and events. Every excess mile unnecessarily \n     evacuated during a coastal storm or hurricane costs an \n     estimated $1 million and disrupts thousands of lives.\n       The degradation of 2-10 day long-term forecasts, which are \n     imperative for troop deployments and planning operations. \n     Within the military, these data and products allow military \n     planners and tactical users to focus on anticipating and \n     exploiting atmospheric and space environmental conditions. \n     For example, Air Force Weather Agency requires accurate wind \n     and temperature forecasts for any decision to launch an \n     aircraft that will need midflight refueling or for weapons \n     deployment.\n       In 2010, 295 lives in the U.S. alone were saved thanks to \n     the satellites picking up rescue beacons. NOAA's polar \n     satellites carry the search and rescue antennas that receive \n     these signals. During a gap in coverage the emergency \n     response times would increase or rescue signals may be \n     missed, significantly increasing the jeopardy of those in \n     distress.\n       Recognizing the troubled history of the National Polar-\n     orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS), \n     do NOAA and NASA now have the right acquisition and \n     management mechanisms in place for the program to succeed?\n       The NPOESS Program attempted to reduce duplication of \n     efforts and reduce costs by combining common requirements of \n     the civil and defense satellite programs. However, after a \n     decade of continued program cost growth and schedule delays, \n     an Independent Review Team found that the tri-agency \n     management structure was ineffective and there were divergent \n     program priorities for civil and defense needs. In February \n     2010 the White House announced a restructuring of the \n     program. The current JPSS program replicates the successful \n     NOAA-NASA partnership with NOAA as the responsible agency for \n     operating this critical national resource to support weather \n     warnings and forecasts and monitor climate and NASA acting as \n     NOAA' s satellite acquisition agent. Over the last four \n     decades, this partnership has successfully developed, built, \n     launched and operated over 60 weather satellites.\n       Do you believe that NOAA's Earth Science mission can be \n     completed by other Government agencies, like NASA? Is there \n     duplication in the U.S. Government's Earth Science missions?\n       For over forty years, NOAA and NASA Earth observation \n     missions have operated to complement and not duplicate each \n     other's efforts. NASA and NOAA have fundamentally different \n     missions, meeting the needs of different user communities. \n     NASA focuses on new science and discovery; NOAA focuses on \n     reliable and stable long-term monitoring of the environment \n     to protect life, property and commerce. Ensuring the \n     continuity of weather data from our satellites is fundamental \n     to NOAA's mission; it has historically not been fundamental \n     to NASA's mission. The structure of the U.S. civil space \n     programs results in complementary programs, located within \n     the agencies that have clear authority, accountability, and \n     responsibility for budgetary, policy, and user requirement \n     decisions.\n       Time and again, Congress and Presidents (including the 2010 \n     National Space Policy, http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/\ndefault/files/national__space__policy__6-28-10.pdf) reaffirm \n     the need to maintain funding of the civilian meteorological \n     satellite program in a manner that extracts the core \n     capabilities from NASA and NOAA to execute continued US \n     advancement of space-based Earth observations that protect \n     life, property and economic competitiveness. In a 2009 \n     report, after an in-depth analysis of NASA's Earth Science \n     projects related to climate and weather research, the \n     Government Accountability Office (GAO) confirmed that there \n     was no duplication of effort with other federal agencies.\n       Can you provide information on NOAA's economic impact on a \n     state-by-state basis?\n       I have attached a breakdown of the amount of money NOAA \n     provided to each state through grants and contracts in FY \n     2010 for your review.\n       I appreciate your interest in this issue of vital \n     importance to the nation, and provided the best information \n     we can in the rapid time frame that the current debate \n     demands. If we may be of further assistance to focus on more \n     specific information or examples, please do not hesitate to \n     contact me.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of Amy Berman Jackson, of the \nDistrict of Columbia, to be United States District Judge for the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we yield back all time on this matter.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the leader withhold?\n  Mr. REID. The chairman is here.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I thank the majority leader for \nscheduling this confirmation vote today. I have been talking about this \nnomination since last year. Amy Jackson is one of four nominees to the \nvacancies that have plagued the District Court for the District of \nColumbia, this Nation's Capital, for some time. This is another of the \nnominations that could--and in my view should--have been considered and \nconfirmed last year. Instead, it was one of two nominations to that \ncourt unnecessarily returned to the President without final Senate \naction, despite the nominee's qualifications and the needs of the \nAmerican people to have judges available to hear cases in the Federal \ncourts. The President has had to renominate Ms. Jackson, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee has had to reconsider her and now, finally, the \nSenate is being allowed to consider her.\n  I have spoken about the vacancies in the District of Columbia on \nnumerous occasions, including during the last 2 weeks. I have noted the \ncriticism from Chief Judge Lamberth of the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia. Chief Judge Lamberth wrote to Senate leaders last \nNovember urging action by the Senate to fill the vacancies that exist \non the District Court for the District of Columbia. We could and should \nhave acted before adjourning last year in response to his request. All \nfour nominations were reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee \nlast year. They were needlessly delayed.\n  When the Senate was allowed to consider and confirm Judge Boasberg on \nMonday, I, again, raised the question of the refusal on the other side \nof the aisle to proceed to consider the Jackson nomination. Ms. \nJackson's nomination was reported without opposition by the Judiciary \nCommittee last year and, again, earlier this year. Ms. Jackson is a \nformer assistant U.S. attorney with outstanding credentials and \nexperience who the Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary of the \nAmerican Bar Association gave its highest peer review rating of ``well \nqualified.'' Representative Norton has called her one of the top \npractitioners in one of the District's top law firms and given her a \nstrong endorsement. I expect this will be another of the nominations \nthat has been needlessly delayed and then confirmed unanimously or \nnearly so.\n  In addition to the Jackson nomination, there remain 10 additional \njudicial nominees awaiting final Senate consideration after having been \nreviewed by the Judiciary Committee. Also reported from the Judiciary \nCommittee and before the Senate are nominees to fill two judicial \nemergency vacancies in New York, a judicial emergency vacancy on the \nSecond Circuit, two judicial emergency vacancies in California and \nvacancies on the Federal and D.C. Circuit, in Oregon, and two vacancies \nin Virginia.\n  Federal judicial vacancies around the country still number too many \nand they have persisted for too long. That is why Chief Justice \nRoberts, Attorney General Holder, White House Counsel Bob Bauer and \nmany others--including the President of the United States--have spoken \nout and urged the Senate to act.\n  Nearly one out of every nine Federal judgeships remains vacant. This \nputs at serious risk the ability of all Americans to have a fair \nhearing in court. The real price being paid for these unnecessary \ndelays is that the judges that remain are overburdened and the American \npeople who depend on them are being denied hearings and justice in a \ntimely fashion.\n  When Chief Judge Lamberth wrote to Senator Reid and Senator McConnell \nlast November, he noted that Senate action to fill the vacancies in DC \nwas needed so that ``the citizens of the District of Columbia and the \nFederal Government and other litigants'' who rely on the Court could \nreceive ``the high quality of justice they deserve.'' The Chief Judge \nwrote about the ``severe impact'' these judicial vacancies were having \nand observed that the ``challenging caseload'' of the Court ``includes \nmany involving national security issues, as well as other issues of \nnational significance.'' I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the \nChief Judge's letter be printed in the Record at the end of my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Regrettably, the progress we made during the first 2 years \nof the Bush administration has not been duplicated, and the progress we \nmade over the 8 years from 2001 to 2009 to reduce judicial vacancies \nfrom 110 to a low of 34 was reversed. The vacancy rate we reduced from \n10 percent at the end of President Clinton's term to less than four \npercent in 2008 has now risen back to over 10 percent. In contrast to \nthe sharp reduction in vacancies we made during President Bush's first \n2 years when the Democratically controlled Senate confirmed 100 of his \njudicial nominations, only 60 of President Obama's judicial nominations \nwere allowed to be considered and confirmed during his first 2 years. \nWe have not kept up with the rate of attrition, let alone brought the \nvacancies down significantly.\n  By now, judicial vacancies should have been cut in half, but they \nhave not been. Unlike in the first 2 years of President Bush's first \nterm when with a Democratic majority the Senate reduced vacancies from \n110 to 60, judicial vacancies topped 90 in August 2009 and have \nremained above that level ever since. After tonight's confirmation, \nthey will still number 95, putting at risk the ability of Americans to \nhave a fair hearing in Court.\n  The Senate must do better. The Nation cannot afford further delays by \nthe Senate in taking action on the nominations pending before it. \nJudicial vacancies on courts throughout the country hinder the Federal \njudiciary's ability to fulfill its constitutional role. They create a \nbacklog of cases that prevents people from having their day in court. \nThis is unacceptable.\n  We can consider and confirm this President's nominations to the \nFederal\n\n[[Page S1801]]\n\nbench in a timely manner. President Obama has worked with Democratic \nand Republican home state Senators to identify superbly qualified, \nconsensus nominations. The nominations on the Executive Calendar should \nnot be controversial. They all have the support of their home State \nSenators, Republicans and Democrats. All have a strong commitment to \nthe rule of law and a demonstrated faithfulness to the Constitution.\n  During President Bush's first term, his first four tumultuous years \nin office, we proceeded to confirm 205 of his judicial nominations. We \nconfirmed 100 of those during the 17 months I was chairman during \nPresident Bush's first 2 years in office and by this date in President \nBush's third year had confirmed 110. So far in President Obama's third \nyear in office, the Senate has only been allowed to consider 73 of his \nFederal circuit and district court nominees. We remain well short of \nthe benchmark we set during the Bush administration. When we approach \nit we can reduce vacancies from the historically high levels at which \nthey have remained throughout these first three years of the Obama \nadministration to the historically low level we reached toward the end \nof the Bush administration.\n  I have thanked the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Grassley, for his cooperation this year. I was pleased to see \nhim taking credit for what he called ``our rapid pace.'' I was \nencouraged by his commitment to ``continue to move consensus nominees \nthrough the confirmation process.'' My friend from Iowa is fond of \npointing to the vacancies for which there are not nominees. Of course, \nsome of that is attributable to a lack of cooperation by certain home \nstate Senators with the White House. Nonetheless, I agree with the \nSenator from Iowa that we can do little about confirming nominations we \ndo not have before us. What we can do is proceed expeditiously with the \nqualified nominations the President has sent to the Senate.\n  In that regard, I would temper my friend's extolling our achievements \nthis year by observing that every judge confirmed so far this year \ncould and should have been confirmed last year. Every one of them was \nunanimously reported last year and would have been confirmed had \nRepublicans not objected and created a new rule of obstruction after \nmidterm elections. We have long had the ``Thurmond rule'' to describe \nhow Senator Thurmond shut down the confirmation process in advance of \nthe 1980 presidential election. Last year's shutdown was something new. \nI cannot remember a time when so many consensus nominees were left \nwithout Senate action at the midterm point of a Presidency. That new \nlevel of obstruction has contributed to our being so far behind and \njudicial vacancies having been perpetuated at so high a level for too \nlong.\n  I thank Chief Judge Lamberth for his efforts on behalf of his Court, \non behalf of the people of the District of Columbia, and on behalf of \nour justice system. The American justice system is not some \ndiscretionary luxury. It serves an essential function in our democracy. \nI thank all the women and men who work every day in our courts to \nguarantee justice for the American people.\n  I am glad that Amy Jackson's wait is finally over and congratulate \nher and her family on her confirmation.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                       U.S. District Court for the\n\n\n                                         District of Columbia,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 4, 2010.\n     Re Judicial Vacancies--United States District Court for the \n         District of Columbia.\n\n     Hon.

Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid and Senator McConnell: On behalf of the \n     judges of the United States District Court for the District \n     of Columbia, I request that the Senate act soon to fill the \n     vacancies that exist at our Court.\n       Of our 15 authorized judgeships, we currently have four \n     vacancies. One has been vacant since January 2007. With the \n     additional vacancy that will result from Judge Ricardo M. \n     Urbina's assumption of senior status, effective January 31, \n     2011, this Court faces the prospect of having only 10 of its \n     15 authorized judgeships filled. The severe impact of this \n     situation already is being felt and will only increase over \n     time. The challenging caseload that our Court regularly \n     handles includes many involving national security issues, as \n     well as other issues of national significance. A large number \n     of these complex, high-profile cases demand significant time \n     and attention from each of our judges.\n       Without a complement of new judges, it is difficult to \n     foresee how our remaining active judges will be able to keep \n     up with the heavy volume of cases that faces us. A 33 percent \n     vacancy ratio is quite extraordinary.\n       Two nominees (Beryl Howell and Robert Wilkins) have been \n     reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee and await \n     floor votes; two nominees (James Boasberg and Amy Jackson) \n     have had their hearings and hopefully will soon be reported \n     out of Committee.\n       We hope the Senate will act quickly to fill this Court's \n     vacancies so the citizens of the District of Columbia and the \n     Federal Government and other litigants who appear before us \n     continue to enjoy the high quality of justice they deserve.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Royce C. Lamberth,\n                                                      Chief Judge.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President; toady we vote on our 13th judicial \nnominee in just 29 legislative days. In this session of the Senate, we \nhave confirmed more judicial nominees than in the same time period for \nany of the previous four Presidents.\n  I like to keep my colleagues up-to-date with our cooperation and \nprogress on judicial nominees. We continue to process nominees at a \nfast pace in committee. We held our fourth nominations hearing \nyesterday and have heard from 17 judicial nominees this year. The \nJudiciary Committee met this morning and reported an additional \ndistrict court nominee. We have now reported 23 nominees, nearly 40 \npercent of the 58 judicial nominations made by President Obama this \nyear. The committee has taken some step forward on 55 percent of the \njudicial nominees. We have delivered on our promise to move consensus \nnominees.\n  Even with our fast pace, the current vacancy rate remains high. But \nwith 94 vacancies in the Federal courts, the President has only put \nforward 44 nominees for those vacancies. That is 50 vacancies without a \nnominee. For seats designated judicial emergencies, 57 percent of those \nvacancies have no nominee.\n  As I have said in the past, the burden is on the President to \nnominate consensus individuals for current vacancies. Yet, for the \nsecond time, President Obama has sent up a nomination to a seat which \nis not vacant. I think we can all agree the Senate's time and resources \nare valuable. My priority continues to be carefully reviewing \nnominations for vacancies which require our immediate attention.\n  Today we vote on Amy Berman Jackson, nominated to be a U.S. district \njudge for the District of Columbia. Ms. Jackson is not the first \nnominee to be considered for this vacancy. Michael O'Neill, who served \nas chief counsel and staff director to then-Chairman Specter, was \nnominated by President Bush to fill this seat in June of 2008. He \nwaited for more than 18 months for a hearing and a vote--neither of \nwhich he received. His nomination was returned to the President in \nJanuary 2009. I am disappointed the Senate did not give Mr. O'Neill the \ncourtesy Ms. Jackson is receiving today.\n  Ms. Jackson received her A.B., cum laude, from Harvard College and \nher J.D. from Harvard Law School, cum laude. Upon graduation from law \nschool, she served as a law clerk to the Honorable Harrison L. Winter \nof the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\n  Ms. Jackson served as an assistant U.S. attorney before moving into \nprivate practice. She has focused on white-collar crime, plaintiffs' \nwork involving multidistrict litigation and civil matters. The ABA \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary has unanimously rated her \nas ``well qualified.''\n  I congratulate the nominee and wish her well in her public service as \na U.S. district judge.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield back any time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Amy Berman Jackson, of the District\n\n[[Page S1802]]\n\nof Columbia, to be U.S. District Judge for the District of Columbia?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Udall) \nis necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from New \nMexico (Mr. Udall) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I rise in support, strong \nsupport of the SBIR bill. As many of you know, the SBIR bill and the \nSTTR Programs provide vital resources to small businesses, not only in \nMassachusetts but throughout the country. This reauthorization is \nincredibly important to not only businesses in my State but businesses \nin everybody's State.\n  This compromise bill has been under development and negotiation long \nbefore I got here. I applaud Senators Landrieu and Snowe, our chair and \nranking member on the Small Business Committee, for their persistence \nin pushing this bill through. As a matter of fact, I have two \namendments that are in the bill that is before us now. I will be \noffering, not today but in the near future, an amendment which I am \nabout to talk about.\n  As a small business owner myself for many years, and a longstanding \nmember of many Chambers of Commerce, I believe the Massachusetts small \nbusinesses and businesses throughout this country are the economic \nengine that will help get us out of this economic slowdown we are in. \nThey have the potential to grow, to expand and hire, unlike many \nbusinesses throughout the country. Massachusetts is widely regarded as \nthe center for innovation in biotechnology. We are a small State but we \nhave received the most SBIR awards, only after California. That goes to \nshow how important our State is when it comes to creating small \nbusinesses. The success of the SBIR Program serves as a reminder that \ngovernment can play a role in the business community. But it also needs \nto know when to step out of the way and allow businesses to grow and \nactually create jobs.\n  I want to speak about an amendment I filed, amendment No. 212. It is \nbased on S. 164, the Withholding Tax Relief Act of 2011, which enjoys \nbipartisan support and is critically needed now. The ranking member of \nthe Small Business Committee, Senator Snowe, is a cosponsor. I am \nlooking forward to getting many other cosponsors and working very \nclosely with the chair on this timely piece of legislation.\n  We need once and for all to repeal an onerous and costly unfunded \nmandate that directly affects businesses, not only in my State but \nthroughout the country. This is a jobs amendment, plain and simple. It \nwould repeal part of our Tax Code that absolutely promises to kill \njobs, jobs that these young people up here could someday have. If we do \nnot act soon, section 3042(t) would require, beginning January 12, \nFederal, State, and local governments to withhold 3 percent of nearly \nall contract payments made to private companies as well as Medicare \npayments, farm payments, and certain grants. It is an arbitrary tax and \nit is nearly impossible to actually implement it. It is one of the \nthings we have done that makes absolutely no sense. It has been delayed \nmany times.\n  The Government Withholding Relief Coalition, a coalition of more than \n100 members encompassing a cross section of America, has estimated the \ncombined total 5-year cost to the State and Federal Government of \nimplementing this legislation could be as high as $75 billion.\n  That makes a lot of sense? That $75 billion is coming out of those \ncoffers at a time we can least afford it, and it is estimated only to \nbring in about $7 billion over that same time period. It makes \nabsolutely no sense. It is absurd. Any tax that costs more to implement \nthan it actually brings in makes no sense at all. I hope with your \nleadership and many other Senators' leadership on this issue we can \nattack these bad laws that are about to click in. It should be repealed \nimmediately. As a matter of fact, last week I received a letter from \nMassachusetts State Secretary of Finance Jay Gonzalez, warning Congress \nof the inevitable threat to small businesses' ability to survive in \nthis tough economic climate if we allow the continuation of what I \nconsider a stealth tax. We cannot discuss the health of small \nbusinesses on the floor without acknowledging that these very same \nsmall businesses we aim to help with the SBIR Program, the bill before \nus now, will be suffocated by this 3-percent withholding tax. For some \nbusinesses it may be the entire net profit of what they make per year.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the letter from Secretary Gonzales \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Executive Office for \n           Administration and Finance,\n                                       Boston, MA, March 11, 2011.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Dave Camp,\n     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Sander Levin,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Chairman Baucus, Ranking Member Hatch, Chairman Camp, and \n     Ranking Member Levin: As Secretary for the Executive Office \n     of Administration and Finance for the Commonwealth of \n     Massachusetts, I am writing to express my strong support for \n     legislation to repeal Section 511 of the Tax Increase \n     Prevention and Reconciliation Act (TIPRA) of 2006. Section \n     511 amends the Internal Revenue Code by adding a provision \n     mandating that government entities with greater than $100 \n     million in annual spending withhold three percent on payments \n     made for most goods and services, including Medicare payments \n     and certain grants. That three percent is allocated toward \n     the vendor's tax liability. S. 89 and S. 164, currently \n     pending in the Senate, and H.R. 674, currently pending in the \n     House, would eliminate Section 511.\n       As a state finance official, I strongly support enhanced \n     transparency and tax compliance; however, I am very concerned \n     about the impact of Section 511 on the Commonwealth of \n     Massachusetts' accounting and\n\n[[Page S1803]]\n\n     procurement systems. Specifically, compliance with Section \n     511 will require that the Commonwealth devote personnel and \n     other resources to overseeing collection and remittance of \n     the fees, thus causing administrative and financial burdens. \n     The Commonwealth and its municipalities likely will face \n     increased costs to purchase affected goods and services, as \n     vendors can be expected to raise prices to recoup their own \n     added costs or simply refrain from doing business with \n     government purchasers. The negative impact of Section 511 may \n     be particularly acute for women and minority owned businesses \n     as well as small businesses, since it will affect cash flow, \n     their ability to raise capital and to pay subcontractors.\n       I strongly encourage you to support repeal of Section 511 \n     and to visit the Government Withholding Relief Coalition's \n     website at www.withholdingrelief.com to see the number of \n     government associations and businesses that support \n     abolishing this mandate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jay Gonzalez,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. The Department of Defense alone has \nestimated this provision will cost about $17 billion to comply with \nover the first 5 years. Unfortunately, there are many other provisions \nand reasons why this provision should be repealed as soon as possible. \nAt a time when State and local governments are under extreme fiscal and \nfinancial stress, why? I don't get it. Why would we actually start to \nput in and enforce another unfunded, costly mandate on them to recover \nminimal funds for the Federal Treasury? This is a question of the \nFederal Government seeking more funds to pay its bills. Only in \nWashington--and I have been here a little over a year, very similar to \nwhat the Presiding Officer has--only in Washington can they try to \nconvey that something like this is good when they actually spend $10 of \neverybody's money, nearly, to recoup a dollar. It makes absolutely no \nsense to me at all.\n  Many businesses that contract with the government will simply pass \nthis provision on, as we know, back to the government in the form of \nhigher bids on contracts. So having a bid on a contract here, when this \nparticular tax is implemented--it is going to be here and is ultimately \ngoing to cost every single one of us more money to do the same thing.\n  I listen to the administration, I listen to all the political \npundits, I listen to everybody talk about the fact that we need to get \nour fiscal and financial house in order. We are in trouble fiscally. \nThis country, if we do not do something quickly, is going to be in deep \ntrouble. Here we are. We have an unfunded mandate, something that is \ngoing to add to the cost of doing business, and here we are. Are we \ngoing to take it up and vote on it? I hope we do. I am looking forward \nto the bipartisan leadership from the Presiding Officer and others on \nthis very important issue.\n  Many businesses that contract with the government, as I said, will \nmerely pass this on. It will crush them and restrict a critical \ncashflow and discourage them from participating in government \ncontracts. They will go other places.\n  Members of the construction industry are also worried that the \nprovision will tax away all of their anticipated profit on government \ncontracts, hence diminishing competition and actually raising costs to \nthe government at a time we cannot afford it.\n  This provision passed in 2005, long before we got here--but we, as \nthe new breed of Senators, recognize we need to get our house in order. \nThere is a reason the implementation of this has been delayed over and \nover. Everyone knows it can never go into effect. We will be back on \nthe floor later this session, because we need to repeal this tax. We \ncan do it in the next weeks. I appreciate the effort of the majority \nleader to now include us in the amendment process so we can actually be \npart of the process and come up with new ideas, from new people, to \nlook at things in a different way and actually solve problems. That is \nwhat this amendment offers. I plan to offer it. I welcome everybody's \nsupport.\n  Before I conclude, I want to wish everybody a happy St. Patrick's Day \nand I appreciate your listening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/17/senate-section/article/S1803-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1803-S1804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL AGRICULTURE WEEK\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an industry \nthat has helped shape our country since the days of our Founding \nFathers.\n  This industry is part of the very fabric of my home State of Nebraska \nand of many States. It drives our economy, fosters ingenuity, and \npreserves the value of a handshake in our society. I am speaking about \nagriculture, an industry near and dear to this farm boy's heart.\n  What better time to celebrate the remarkable advances in agriculture \nthan National Ag Week.\n  It is not because of my roots on a farm, nor my time as Secretary of \nAgriculture that I am inspired to speak today. It is because of the \nremarkable men and women who rise before the sun each morning to feed \nthe world. They provide safe, abundant, and affordable food, fiber, and \nfuel. They are stewards of our natural resources and drivers of \ninnovation.\n  More than 2 million farmers and ranchers contribute more than $300 \nbillion to the U.S. economy each year. In Nebraska alone, agriculture \ncontributes over $15 billion to the State's economy. Our leading \ncommodities include: cattle, corn, soybeans, hogs, wheat, dairy \nproducts, and the list goes on and on.\n  It is estimated that each American farmer feeds more than 144 people, \na dramatic increase from just 25 people per farmer in the 1960s. And, \nas our population and the global population continue to grow, demand \nfor our food, fiber, and fuel products is growing, not just at home but \naround the globe. In fact, USDA projects that agriculture exports will \nset a new record, exceeding $135 billion this year.\n  It is estimated that every dollar in agriculture exports generates \n$1.36 in additional economic activities, including transportation, \nwarehousing, and financing.\n  Nebraska's $4.8 billion in agricultural exports last year generates \nan additional $6.5 billion in economic activity. Now that is a big \ndeal, particularly during these struggling economic times.\n  However, the demands facing our Nation's farmers and ranchers are \ndaunting.\n  We should ensure the government is not adding unnecessary regulatory \nand paperwork burdens to their load.\n  Instead, we must empower our Nation's farmers and ranchers to \ncontinue to be among the most competitive, productive, and efficient in \nthe world.\n  We should be actively promoting U.S. agriculture by enhancing \nrenewable fuels; ensuring regulations are transparent and science-\nbased; and creating international opportunities through enhanced trade \nagreements.\n  This last one should be easy, but this administration has made it \ndifficult.\n  Congress has been waiting on the President to submit three free trade \nagreements, Colombia, Panama, and Korea for more than 2 years now.\n  It is estimated that this cumulative delay has cost almost $2.5 \nbillion in lost agriculture exports per year.\n  And while we have been hobbled on the sidelines, our competitors, \nincluding, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, and the EU, have been full speed \nahead on trade agreements that put U.S. agriculture at a disadvantage.\n  Instead of a maintaining market share and a preference for Nebraska \ngrown wheat, corn, and beef, consumers in Colombia, Panama, and Korea \ncould turn to our competitors.\n  That is because their trade agreements have lowered tariffs while \nours collect dust on a White House shelf.\n  And once market share is lost by the United States, it is difficult \nto regain.\n  I have talked to colleagues on both sides of the aisle who understand \nthis reality.\n  In fact, the chairman of the committee that oversees trade could not \nhave been more clear in recent comments. Senator Max Baucus said:\n  ``The Time Is Here. The Time Is Now. We're Losing Market Share Hand \nOver Fist.''\n  I could not agree more.\n\n[[Page S1804]]\n\n  Yet, more than 2 years into their term, the administration still has \nfailed to send us these pending trade agreements for approval.\n  Our Nation's farmers, ranchers and many American workers are asking \nfor them.\n  They know that new orders will be placed and business will flow from \nthe agreements.\n  New jobs will be created.\n  Instead of spending hundreds of millions of dollars to try to create \njobs, how about we sign agreements that will do it for us?\n  Approving trade agreements increases spending: zero. Not one penny. \nCongress simply says, ``aye.''\n  Perhaps that simply makes too much sense for Washington.\n  The bottom line is that increased trade is one of many opportunities \nthat will help to ensure a bright future for American agriculture.\n  There are many reasons to be optimistic.\n  One need only consider the breathtaking advances in productivity.\n  I have long said that our farmers and ranchers can compete with \nanyone in the world on a level playing field.\n  It is nothing short of phenomenal that average corn yields are now \n160 bushels per each acre of land compared to only 53 bushels just 50 \nyears ago.\n  Frankly, it is difficult to keep pace with the new technologies \ntransforming agriculture.\n  Consider this. Thanks to biotechnology and improved farming \npractices, last year, American farmers nearly doubled their soybean \nproduction from 1980 levels, with just a 10 percent increase in total \nacres planted.\n  And did you know, some farmers now use satellite and GPS technology \nto apply water and fertilizer where and when it has the greatest \nbenefit to crops.\n  American agriculture truly is a remarkable success story.\n  It is true that we have big challenges ahead for agriculture. I say \nbring them on.\n  Our producers have faced down every challenge set before them and I \nam confident nothing will stand in the way.\n  That is, assuming the Federal Government does not wrap so much \nredtape around them as to suffocate their ingenuity.\n  There simply is no more resilient bunch than farmers and ranchers.\n  How many Americans would be willing to work hard often 7 days a week, \nonly to leave any profit in the hands of Mother Nature?\n  Only those who recognize that living close to the land comes with its \nown rewards, and feeding the world is a higher calling.\n  I would suggest that agriculture is the very foundation of our \ncountry's rich heritage. Our Founders clearly understood and \nappreciated the importance of agriculture.\n  George Washington once said he knew of ``no pursuit in which more \nreal and important services can be rendered to any country than by \nimproving its agriculture. . . . ''\n  Thomas Jefferson noted that ``Agriculture . . . is our wisest \npursuit, because it will in the end contribute most to real wealth, \ngood morals and happiness.''\n  National Ag Week is a good time to reflect on the rich agricultural \nhistory of this great Nation. It is a time to celebrate the exciting \nscientific advances and new opportunities.\n  One thing all my colleagues should be able to agree on: We owe our \nNation's farmers and ranchers a sincere thank-you. Every time we go to \nthe grocery store, we are reminded how little of our disposable income \nwe spend in this great Nation because of the good work of our farmers \nand ranchers. We compare better in our country than just about any \ncountry in the world.\n  So we are grateful today for their good work. We say thank you to \nthem for the food, fiber, and fuel that keeps our Nation strong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Mr. President, I guess we are technically still talking \nabout our reauthorization of the SBIR and STTR Programs. Senator Snowe \nand I have been working through the week to manage this bill on the \nfloor, and I wish to again say how pleased I am with the progress we \nmade this week. I know we have had about three or four votes on \namendments, and there are others that are pending, but we have made \nprogress. I truly appreciate the cooperation of all the Members.\n  This is a very important program. We have struggled, as I have said, \nfor 6 years to get this program reauthorized. While everybody is \nrunning around fussing about programs that do not work, it is important \nfor us to focus on those programs that do work, particularly those \nprograms that work to create private sector jobs.\n  It is important for us to stay focused on reducing and, hopefully, \neliminating our Federal debt and reducing annual deficits. That is \ngoing to be done when we do a couple of things all at one time. It is \nnot going to be done by standing on the sidelines, slashing and burning \ndiscretionary domestic spending only, particularly some of the best \nprograms in America. It is going to be done by thoughtful cuts and \neliminations of some programs that don't work, some thoughtful \neliminations and cuts to the Defense budget. It is going to be done by \nraising revenues where appropriate to close some of the gaps and taking \nback some of the excessive grants to high-end taxpayers, particularly \nthose making over $1 million a year, in the view of this Senator. It is \ngoing to take some investments that can actually save taxpayer money in \nthe long run, and cutting some mandatory programs.\n\n  We know--and I think it is becoming very clear to the American \npeople--as this debate over the House CR and the debate over deficits \nand debt goes on, people are understanding this better and better. So \none of the reasons I am personally happy to be on the floor this week \nis because I know the bill I am supporting and offering here to the \nSenate--hopefully getting to the House and then eventually to the \nPresident's desk--will create private sector jobs and close this \ndeficit gap and begin to chip away, in a substantial way, at the debt. \nWe need to grow our economy.\n  I have a chart I will put up in just a minute, but before I do that, \nI wish to show again a specific example of a program I am talking about \nso people will be very clear. Projects such as this were won by iRobot. \nThis is just one example of the hundreds and thousands of small \nbusinesses that received either a contract or an award through this \nvery important program.\n  DOD has the largest--over $1 billion--portion of their research and \ndevelopment budget. Prior to this program, almost 100 percent of that \nmoney went to big businesses or to universities and big businesses. \nSmall businesses were summarily overlooked. Regardless of whether they \nhad good technology, they really weren't let in the front door. This \nprogram we are talking about reauthorizing for 8 years creates that \ndoor and opens it for the small businesses in Louisiana, in Colorado, \nin New Mexico, in New York, and that is why we are going to fight hard \nfor this program, to get it reauthorized and to the President's desk.\n  Let me give one example. The DOD needed more reliable, cost-effective \nrobotic devices for going into caves, checking and diffusing IEDs.\n  I don't think I have to explain to anyone listening or any Member of \nthis Senate the challenges our soldiers face in Afghanistan. I have \nbeen to Afghanistan. I have not been in caves in Afghanistan, but I \nhave visited our troops there. I have heard their stories. I have seen \npictures and read enough books to know the frightening thousands of \nmiles of caves and crevices our soldiers are having to go into to hunt \ndown Osama bin Laden, who still has not been found and captured, and to \nprotect our forces overseas.\n  We have been in some ways as a nation kind of caught off guard about \nthe\n\n[[Page S1805]]\n\nterrorist attacks and military strategies using explosive devices. I \nguess we knew this could be a tactic, but, honestly, we did not have \nwhat we needed to protect our troops to win the battles.\n  So this program steps up and says: OK, this is what we need. Let's go \nout and see who has the best technology. Instead of spending billions \nand billions and millions and millions of dollars giving a contract to \na big company and getting them to go through all the rigmarole to \ndevelop it--it is kind of an off-the-shelf technology almost, except \nthat we develop the idea and give a small business the opportunity.\n  Unlike large businesses, these small firms approach the project \nunencumbered by past research and approaches. They start with a clean \nslate. They often have innovative approaches that would be challenged \nby conventional large businesses. They often attract researchers fresh \nout of a university, such as iRobot, which started with two MIT \nstudents and their professors. Ideas that started just off the MIT \ncampus have turned into a company with a market cap of now $400 \nmillion, with strong military and private sector sales.\n  My colleagues have probably heard of the private sector spinoff of \nthe military robot, the Roomba, a product that vacuums while one is at \nwork and has now sold over 5 million units in the United States. This \nis a different product than the IED robot I will speak about in a \nminute, but it is an example of one of these programs.\n  When our forces needed to go into caves and find IEDs, there was some \ntechnology that was developed in order to do that. The Navy has many \nexamples. The Army has many examples. I am encouraged to see these \noutstanding opportunities.\n  This was in Bedford, MA. This is the iRobot I mentioned. I will get \nthe chart for the IED explosive in just a moment. This is an example of \nsome of the projects that have been funded. This is not just good for \nour soldiers, but obviously this company then became a company that \nwent on to sell other products in the conventional market and created \njobs along the way.\n  I know Senator Bingaman wants to speak on energy, and I am going to \nyield the floor and then come back later and put a few more things into \nthe Record before this week ends so that when we come back in a couple \nof weeks, we will have built the strongest record possible for a vote \nas soon as possible on a program that works, that is cost-effective, \nthat really creates some new technologies that help our soldiers \noverseas and help us vacuum our floors here at home and create American \njobs in the process and help us to close this deficit and debt gap.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to share a couple of thoughts on \nthe budget process that is underway and where we are with the \ncontinuing resolution we voted on this afternoon.\n  First, with respect to the CR, that was a tough vote for me. It was a \ntough vote because this is no way to run the government. We are here \nnow dealing with business that should have been done last year. \nUnfortunately, last year the Senate didn't get its work done, didn't \neven do a budget, didn't go through the normal appropriations process. \nThey started kicking the spending can down the road last year, and we \nare still in the midst of that. I am not sure how many continuing \nresolutions we have had at this point--three, four, five, six; I am \nlosing track--but this last one for this next 3 weeks, frankly, is the \nlast one I will vote for. This one I could support because it does \nsustain the lower level of spending as passed by the House. There are \nsome tough cuts in that bill, but it is very necessary that we get \nserious about getting our spending under control. This is a small step \nin that direction.\n  I really want to urge my colleagues to bring an end to these 2-week, \n3-week, short-term CRs. It is just kicking the can down the road. Let's \nresolve this. Let's get a funding measure in place that will fund the \ngovernment for the remainder of this fiscal year and be done with it. \nWe have serious work to do. We have a budget resolution we need to \ngovern the spending that will occur for next year. We have process \nreform that we badly need. There is an awful lot that needs to be \naddressed, and this really just needs to get done. So I hope we will do \nthat soon.\n  As we discuss the level of spending we are going to have in this CR \nthat will continue from when the current one ends--hopefully, there \nwill be just one more that will take us through the remainder of this \nfiscal year--it is very important that we get that level of spending \ndown to at least the level that was passed in the House, and I want to \ntalk about why.\n  I have looked at some of the individual cuts, and they are tough. \nThey are going to make things difficult in many cases. But it is very \nnecessary that we do this for the sake of beginning to restore some \nsense of fiscal sanity to get us on a sustainable trajectory.\n  One of the arguments I have heard from some of my friends on the \nother side of the aisle who have real concerns and objections in some \ncases to adopting a spending measure that does reduce spending--I would \nargue modestly over all--is that this will cost jobs; that if the \ngovernment doesn't spend more than what is contemplated in the House-\npassed continuing resolution, we will lose jobs; that if we cut \ngovernment spending, we will have lower employment. I am here to \nsuggest that is exactly backward. That is precisely wrong. In fact, it \nis the exact opposite.\n  At the point we are now, the more the government spends, the fewer \njobs we will have. And the sooner and the more quickly we bring this \ngovernment into some sense of fiscal stability, the more employment we \nare going to have and the more job creation we are going to have. I \nthink for many people that is common sense, but it is not universally \naccepted here. I understand that. But consider this: If all we needed \nto do was have the government spend more money to create jobs, then \nrecessions would always be a trivial matter because we would just crank \nup some government spending and everybody would be back to work and we \nwould be fine. But we know that doesn't work. It has never worked. If \nthat is what worked, frankly, the economy would be booming right now.\n  We have been spending on a scale we have never even contemplated \nbefore. As a percentage of GDP, deficit spending, total spending, by \nany measure--the spending is at a record high, and yet unemployment is \npersistently much, much higher than we had hoped it would be, much \nhigher than it typically is at this stage in what should be an economic \nrecovery.\n  It isn't just this experience we can look at. We can look around the \nworld. Countries that have lived beyond their means and where the \ngovernment occupies a big segment of the economy and spends a great \ndeal, those are not the more successful economies. In fact, those are \nthe least successful economies. They have persistently high \nunemployment, low economic growth, low job creation, and a low standard \nof living. I think this is all widely recognized but not entirely so \nhere in Washington.\n  Of course, it is true that the government can always create a job. \nThe government can have a program that instructs someone to go out and \nhire someone, give that person a wage and, bingo, they have created a \njob. Government can always do that. Of course, the problem is that in \nthe process, the government destroys jobs in the private sector. That \nis because the money that is necessary to create that government job \nhas to come from somewhere, and it always comes from the private sector \nunnecessarily.\n  When the money comes from out of the private sector and goes to the \ngovernment for the government to create a job, that does several \nthings. First of all, the government tends to allocate resources much \nless efficiently than free men and women do in the voluntary exchanges \nof the marketplace, so you get politically motivated allocation of \nresources rather than market-oriented allocation, and this is widely \nacknowledged to lead to lower investment returns, less efficient \ninvestment, and therefore less job creation.\n  This isn't just theory. There is plenty of empirical data on this \nissue. I wish to observe for my colleagues and talk\n\n[[Page S1806]]\n\nabout one particular chart that I think is a very helpful illustration \nbecause this kind of goes to the heart of my point. My point is that \nthe job creation we desperately need right now is only going to come \nfrom the private sector. The sustainable jobs that lead to solid \neconomic growth, permanent jobs, wealth creation, and real opportunity \nare going to come from the private sector, and that is driven by \nprivate investment. The more government spends, the more it crowds out \nprivate investment and precludes the very engine of economic growth and \njob creation we need.\n  The chart behind me is a great illustration of this. It is provided \nby John Taylor, a very well regarded economist whose work is highly \nrespected and widely circulated. In this chart, Mr. Taylor illustrates \nthat the unemployment rate is inversely related to private investment.\n  So when the private sector is making investments--and this can be \ninvestments in new business or in capital, but when private money is \nbeing put to work by business, as the percentage of the economy, the \namount of this investment declines as a percentage of our economy, we \nsee the unemployment rate go up.\n  When we see private investment growing, as it did for a sustained \nperiod from the early 1990s until the early part of this decade, we see \nthe steady upward trend, and it was driving down the unemployment rate. \nIt is clear that as this line goes down--the private investment line--\nthe unemployment rate goes up. When it turns around and private \ninvestment as a percentage of our economy grows, the unemployment rate \ndeclines--not just for this period--and you can see the trend \ncontinues.\n  Again, we have another period after about 2000 of declining private \ninvestments as a percentage of GDP and a rising unemployment rate. Now \nthat we have seen in recent years a long, pretty precipitous decline in \nprivate investment as a percentage of our economy, we see this huge \nincrease in the unemployment rate.\n  These lines--at a quick glance, you can see it--are almost a mirror \nimage of each other. This is a great illustration of a simple and well-\nknown fact: It is private investment that drives job growth.\n  When the government gets too big, as ours is today, and when it \nspends too much money, as this one does, and when the deficit gets too \nbig, it crowds out and precludes the private investment that drives job \ngrowth. That is why it is so important that we get spending under \ncontrol. That is why it is so important that we pass a continuing \nresolution that will fund the government for the rest of the year, at \nthe lowest possible level we can reach an agreement on, because lower \nspending is going to drive job growth.\n  There are several other aspects to this fact that lower spending will \nlead to greater job growth. Everybody knows that higher government \nspending eventually leads to higher taxes. We are at this point now \nwhere we have this huge shortfall in the revenue relative to the amount \nof money that is being spent. So any potential investor wonders, how \nmuch are taxes going to go up? When will they go up? Are they going to \ngo up on me, or on my investment, or on my labor?\n  These are the uncertainties we in Washington have introduced into the \neconomy. But everybody who is contemplating an investment has to \nwrestle with this question. Uncertainty is the enemy of private \ninvestment and job growth.\n  The other possibility is that instead of a tax increase, maybe there \nwill be a debt crisis. We are borrowing money on such a huge scale, it \nis not at all clear that we can continue that. I guarantee we cannot \ncontinue this indefinitely. I don't know how much longer it can \ncontinue. That is a very dangerous thing to flirt with--ever higher \nlevels of debt and the expectation that lenders will lend us money when \nthere are such large percentages of our economy.\n  There is another variable in the mix, and that is the danger that the \ncentral bank, the monetary authority, will decide maybe the easiest way \nout of this mess is to print money.\n  This is a road that has been gone down many times before in many \nparts of the world. It always leads to a disaster. Monetizing the debt \nis the way many governments have chosen to deal with excessive \nspending. I am very worried now about the policy of the Fed, and QE2 is \nthe policy by which they are currently monetizing more than half of the \ndeficit we are running this year. That is a dangerous policy. Combine \nthat with the beginnings of this fiscal imbalance and imprudent policy, \ntogether with this very accommodative monetary policy, and this is a \nvery dangerous mix.\n  What we can do in the short run, and what we ought to be doing right \nnow, is addressing the spending problem that is at the heart of all of \nit. It is driving this. In my view, that starts with the continuing \nresolution that will fund the government for the remainder of this \nyear. We passed one that will fund the government for the next 3 weeks, \nbut I wish it had been for the remainder of the year. We have no time \nto waste; we have to get this resolved and we have to move on to a \nbudget that brings our spending and revenue into balance, without \nraising taxes and ruining economic growth.\n  This should be the big priority for this body. I hope when we get \nback from this recess, this is what we will be working on--the spending \nmeasure to close out this fiscal year, a budget that will put us back \non a sustainable path, and progrowth policies that will lead to the job \ncreation we need.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar).

I want to take a few minutes to discuss high oil and \ngasoline prices. I think when we get home to our respective States this \nnext week, we are going to find that many of the people we represent \nare understandably concerned about the rising price of gasoline at the \npump. They have good reason to be concerned.\n  Senator Murkowski and I hosted a Senate-wide briefing on Tuesday \nafternoon with three top oil industry analysts. We had Dr. Richard \nNewell, the head of the Energy Information Administration; Mr. Bob \nMcNally, who was part of the Bush administration's White House team on \nenergy markets; Mr. Frank Verastro, who is the head of the Energy and \nNational Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International \nStudies. They gave us their insights and explanations as to what is \ncausing the rise in the price of gasoline at the pump.\n  Let me go through four charts to try to summarize what they told us \nat that briefing. I think it is very useful information for my \ncolleagues, and anybody else who is interested in the subject.\n  This first chart is labeled ``Gasoline Prices Reflect the Cost of \nCrude Oil.'' A fundamental truth, which they all subscribe to, is that \nthe primary driver of the price of gasoline at the pump is in fact the \nprice of crude oil on world markets. This chart demonstrates that. It \nshows the price trends since 2005 for gasoline; that is the yellow line \non the chart. It shows the price of crude oil; that is the green line. \nWhile some past gasoline price spikes can be attributed to phasing out \nthe additive MTBE, for the last 3 years gasoline price movements have \ntracked global crude oil prices. So the idea that our gasoline prices \nare high today because of some particular action the Obama \nadministration has taken is not supported by the facts.\n  The reasons for the current crude oil price increase are equally \nstraightforward. In listening to each of the analysts highlight the \nfactors he thought were important in explaining why crude oil prices \nare at the levels we have not seen since 2008, I was struck by two \nexplanations advanced in many of the political speeches in Washington \nand around the country about oil and gas prices. Frankly, the \nconclusions, or the allegations, or the arguments made in those \npolitical speeches did not comport with what the analysts told us.\n  First, none of the experts who talked to us highlighted the \nadministration's permitting process in the Gulf of Mexico as being a \nsignificant factor in determining world oil markets. I asked Dr. Newell \nwhether the current pace of permitting had any implication for the\n\n[[Page S1807]]\n\nEnergy Information Administration's short-term forecast. His answer was \nrefreshingly direct; he said, ``No.'' I will point out that neither of \nhis co-panelists disagreed with that conclusion.\n  Second, any anticipated Environmental Protection Agency regulation of \ngreenhouse gas emissions at refineries was not included in any of the \npresentations as a driver behind the current increase in prices. In \nfact, more broadly, neither the EPA nor any kind of U.S. regulations \nwere discussed as important to understanding world oil prices. I know \nsome of my colleagues remain concerned that we have not built a new \nrefinery in the United States since the 1970s. I assure them that the \ndata suggests that their concerns are not well-founded at this \nparticular point. Demand for refined products is believed to have \npeaked in the United States. At the moment, 17 percent of our existing \nrefining capacity in this country stands idle, and that is not because \nof environmental regulations; it is because demand for refined products \nhas come down. In my opinion, it doesn't make a lot of sense to be \ndebating whether we need new refineries, when we are not using the \ncapacity we already have in existing refineries.\n\n  Having explored those factors that are not influencing oil price \nmovements, let me discuss factors that are contributing to increased \noil and gasoline prices.\n  The bulk of the discussion at this briefing we had on Tuesday about \nhigh oil prices was about what is going on in the Middle East and North \nAfrica. This chart depicts what happened to the price of oil. This says \n``U.S. Oil Prices, January through March 2011.'' From the beginning of \nthis year, until the current time, I think it is obvious that the major \nforce driving oil prices is the instability we have seen in the Middle \nEast and North Africa.\n  When the world's key oil-producing and exporting region--which is the \nMiddle East and North Africa--is unstable, world oil markets are also \nunstable.\n  When political unrest threatens major chokepoints in the world oil \ntransit routes, world oil markets react as they have.\n  When a member of OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting \nCountries, stops exporting oil, which has virtually occurred in the \ncase of Libya, world oil markets react.\n  Also, when there are fears that a nearby neighbor, and a close ally \nof Saudi Arabia, home of the world's largest oil production capacity, \nbegins to have political upheavals, that raises tensions in world oil \nmarkets as well.\n  So as you can see from this chart, oil prices are very sensitive to \nthese kinds of developments. Oil prices went up as regime change was \nrealized in Egypt, amid concerns about access to the Suez Canal. Prices \nquickly came down again as it looked increasingly unlikely that traffic \nthrough the canal would be disrupted.\n  Then Libya became the first major oil-exporting country to be \naffected by the wave of popular uprisings spreading throughout the \nMiddle East and North Africa, and oil prices reacted immediately, \nindicating market concerns that the situation might get worse before it \ngot better. It, indeed, has worsened. We have virtually all Libyan oil \nexports terminated or stopped or suspended. Sanctions against Qadhafi's \ngovernment, combined with chaos on the ground in Libya, have driven \nLibya's exports to near zero. There is little hope for improvement, so \nfar, in the near future.\n  We are just beginning to face a potential further escalation of \ntensions in the region. On Monday, of course, Saudi Arabia sent troops \nacross the causeway onto the island neighbor Bahrain. This adds to \nworld tension.\n  World oil markets have reacted to this tension with expectations--and \nI am avoiding using the more politically loaded term ``speculation,'' \nalthough I do believe that word is appropriate--that the situation is \nat risk of getting worse before it gets better.\n  Into this uncertain environment, we now have a new source of even \ngreater uncertainty. The earthquake that has plagued the island nation \nof Japan, the ensuing tsunami, and the nuclear disaster that struck \nJapan--all of that has introduced the possibility that the world's \nthird largest economy might be consuming less oil in the near future \nthan was earlier assumed.\n  Worldwide markets have again reacted, this time by falling to under \n$100 per barrel as we try to better understand the size and the scope \nof the disaster our Japanese friends and allies are facing.\n  What can Congress do to help ease the burden of high prices for U.S. \nconsumers when oil prices are determined mostly outside our borders, as \nI think they clearly have been?\n  A realistic, responsible answer has to be focused on becoming less \nvulnerable to oil price changes over the medium and the long term. By \ndoing so, we become less vulnerable by using less oil.\n  I believe increased oil production can play a significant role in \nworld oil markets. The United States has fairly modest resources \ncompared to much of the world. Our base of proven reserves is small. \nMany people have observed that the United States has less than 2 \npercent of the world's proven reserves.\n  Despite what economists and analysts agree is a relatively modest \nresource oil base, the oil and gas industry in the United States has \nled the world in developing state-of-the-art technology for exploration \nand production. Our companies are continuing to get more oil out of the \nground and into world oil markets than any of us could have believed \nwas possible. To use a boxing metaphor, we are punching above our \nweight in oil and gas production thanks to the technology lead our \ncompanies have developed.\n  According to the Energy Information Administration, oil production in \nNorth Dakota has risen by 150 percent since 2005. That is all from the \nBakken shale formation. This is due to the advent and application of \nnew drilling technology. It is a success story that we all can \ncelebrate.\n  Let me talk about this third chart. Oil production is up strongly \nacross the United States in the last few years. This chart demonstrates \nthat current increases in oil production are a significant change from \nwhat we have seen in the last several decades. We have not had to \nrepeal any environmental laws to achieve this or change the protections \nthat apply on public lands.\n  Let's not forget that even with U.S. production strongly increasing \noil prices have also been increasing. While domestic oil production \nplays an important role in ensuring the energy security of the country, \nits contribution to the world oil balance is just not sufficient to \nbring global oil prices down. It is, therefore, not a complete answer \nto the high oil and gas prices that tax our consumers and threaten our \ncountry's economic health.\n  This leads me to conclude that the key to reducing our vulnerability \nto world oil prices and volatility is for us to find ways to use less \noil. We need to diversify our sources of transportation fuel. We need \nto set ourselves on the right path, as we did when we passed the Energy \nIndependence and Security Act of 2007. That law required us to make our \nvehicles more efficient and to shift toward relying more on renewable \nfuel.\n  This final chart shows the Energy Information Administration's long-\nterm forecasts for U.S. dependence on imported oil as predicted prior \nto the passage of that 2007 bill, and what they now predict it is after \nthe passage and implementation of that bill.\n  There are two main features of this graph that I think are \nnoteworthy. First, prior to the enactment of this bill in 2007, the \nEnergy Information Administration had been predicting that U.S. \nreliance on imported oil would continue to increase. In large part, \nbecause of the biofuels and the fuel efficiency policies that we \nincluded in that act, the latest forecast shows our reliance on \nimported oil probably peaked, in fact, in 2005, and is now going down \nand is expected to continue going down for the rest of this forecast \nperiod, which is out to year 2035.\n  Second, the amount of oil we now will not need to import from today \nto 2035--that is, the oil that we will be able to save because of the \nEnergy Independence and Security Act we passed in 2007--amounts to \nabout 26 billion barrels. That compares to the previous forecast.\n  What I am saying is, the difference between the blue line, which is \nthe earlier projection, and the red line, when we take that out to \n2035, the total oil involved there is 26 billion barrels. This amount \nis greater than the total U.S. proven oil reserves, which are estimated \nat 23 billion barrels. I hope we\n\n[[Page S1808]]\n\ncan all agree this has been a significant success.\n  How do we continue on this path toward reducing our oil dependence? I \nwill conclude by highlighting three areas, three key goals I hope we \ncan focus on in the Senate in the coming weeks.\n  First, we need to enable further expansion of our renewable fuel \nindustry, which is currently facing infrastructure and financing \nconstraints.\n  Second, we need to move forward the timeline for market penetration \nby electric vehicles.\n  Finally, third, we need to make sure we use natural gas vehicles in \nas many applications as makes sense based on that technology.\n  Every barrel of oil we displace from the transportation sector and \nwe, therefore, do not need to consume in the United States makes our \neconomy stronger--not to mention our personal pocketbooks--and less \nvulnerable to the volatility of the current marketplace.\n  We need to keep drilling. We are good at that. It is helpful to have \nmore supplies on the world market. I am not arguing against that. But \nat the same time, we need to recognize that the long-term solution to \nthis challenge is to move away from such great dependence on oil. This \nis a strategic vision President George W. Bush, who previously had \nworked in the oil industry, clearly articulated in his 2006 State of \nthe Union Address. We subsequently proved in Congress, in 2007, the \nyear after that State of the Union Address, that we have the ability to \nmake significant changes in our energy consumption and that it is \npossible to mobilize a bipartisan consensus to do so.\n  The bipartisan path we laid out in the Energy Independence and \nSecurity Act in 2007 is the right approach. As part of whatever \nbipartisan approach we take to energy in the weeks and months ahead, we \nneed to continue moving in this same direction.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/17/senate-section/article/S1808-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1808-S1809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEE PENSION CRISIS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak on a matter of great \nimportance to the economic health of State and local governments. I am \ntalking about dangerously underfunded employee pensions.\n  We hear about this problem every day in States such as Illinois, \nCalifornia, New Jersey, and many others. It is a multitrillion-dollar \nproblem. Let me repeat that. The underfunding of these pensions runs \ninto the trillions of dollars. Not billions, trillions.\n  How did this happen? There are two primary causes. First, governments \nhave promised too much money in lifetime pensions; and, second, \ngovernments have not set aside enough money to pay for those pensions. \nThe shortfall between the money that has been promised and the money \nset aside is called underfunding, but that is just a sterile accounting \nterm that means we don't have enough money to pay the bills. Where I \ncome from, that is called being broke. It is bad enough when you go \nbroke because you have been irresponsible with your own money. Yet it \nis a tragedy when governments go broke being irresponsible with \ntaxpayer money.\n  That is what I fear we are watching as this public pension crisis \nunfolds. There have been many studies in recent years of our public \npension crisis. There is no question about whether this crisis exists. \nThe only question is the magnitude of the crisis.\n  One prominent study by scholars at the Kellogg School of Business at \nNorthwestern University estimates that public pension plans are \nunderfunded by over $3 trillion. That is a lot of money. An analyst at \nthe Brookings Institute says public pensions are $2.5 trillion in the \nred. A study published last month found that all by itself, California \nhas a $240 billion pension shortfall. You heard that right. California \nalone has a pension debt of $\\1/4\\ trillion. Some have estimated that \nIllinois is in even worse financial shape.\n  If the States and localities do not act aggressively to address these \nshortfalls, then the question will not be whether the States will \nbecome insolvent but when? Regardless of whose numbers and which study \ngets the closest to the mark, there is no denying that public employee \npensions face a multitrillion-dollar shortfall in the aggregate.\n  Though none will deny this shortfall. Some will seek to shift the \nblame and shirk responsibility for this crisis. I want to nip in the \nbud one of the arguments of those interests who would prefer to ignore \nthis crisis. They will argue this is not a problem of too many pension \npromises and the underfunding of those promises. They will try to \ndivert attention from the fact that public employee pensions have too \noften not been funded on a sound basis. Instead, they will say the \npension funding problem is owing to the 2008 economic crisis and the \nbig businesses that, they say, caused it. This is way off the mark. But \ndon't trust me, trust the numbers. This pension shortfall existed \nbefore the recession, and an attempt to lay blame at the feet of Wall \nStreet or big business or some other group is just plain blame \nshifting.\n  One aspect of the problem is that governments have been slow--and \npublic employees have been resistant--to transitioning to the types of \nretirement plans that private sector workers have been living with for \nyears. The rest of the world has moved toward 401(k)-style plans, \ncalled defined contribution plans. In these plans, costs are lower and \nmore predictable. They fit well with an increasingly mobile and dynamic \nworkforce. Yet governments have remained wedded to expensive, \ntraditional pension plans for far too long.\n  These old-style traditional pension plans--defined benefit plans--owe \na monthly payment for life to each employee regardless of how much \nmoney the government has set aside, regardless of how well the pension \nassets have been invested, and regardless of whether the ratio of \nactive workers to retirees has remained stable. For most private \ncompanies these plans proved simply unsustainable, and over time they \nmoved toward more flexible retirement plans for employees. Yet as \nusual, government is slow. It is slow to innovate and slow to adapt.\n  So even though these defined benefit plans had the potential to cause \nenormous financial problems for governments, governments stuck with \nthem. Private companies learned long ago that traditional pension plans \nare too expensive for most businesses.\n  In 1985, 80 percent of medium and large private companies had a \ntraditional pension plan. Today, just 30 percent have a traditional \nplan. By contrast, 84 percent of State and local government workers are \ncovered by high-cost traditional pension plans. And government is not \njust any employer. Governments only exist because of taxpayers.\n  Ultimately, taxpayers are the employers of government employees. Yet \nthese governments are living in the past, playing irresponsibly with \ntaxpayer money, and leaving taxpayers to foot the bill for too many \nlifetime pension promises.\n  So why do these lifetime pension guarantees continue? There are many \nreasons, but at the top of the list is the unique character of \ngovernment as an employer. Private employers moved away from \ntraditional pensions to more affordable 401(k)-style plans because they \ncan't stay in business if they ignore economic reality. Yet governments \nhave kept their unaffordable traditional plans, often because public \nemployee unions use taxpayer-funded union dues to elect State and local \npoliticians and then ask the same politicians they just elected for \ncostly pension deals at taxpayer expense.\n  When a union bargains with a private employer, employer and employee \nhave an interest in the business continuing as a viable enterprise. If \nthe benefits are costly and uncontrollable, the business goes under and \neveryone is out of a job.\n  But where are the interests in a negotiation between a public \nemployee union and the person they just helped to elect to office? \nWhere are those interests? Union bosses are sitting across the table \nfrom the Governor of the\n\n[[Page S1809]]\n\nState--the Governor they just helped to elect with millions in campaign \ncontributions--and they ask him for a costly, guaranteed lifetime \nretirement package, often with little or no cost-sharing by the public \nemployee. What is a politician going to say? Sorry, but I can't help \nyou? I doubt it.\n  I want to read something from the Wall Street Journal. On October 22, \n2010, just prior to the last election, the Journal carried a story \nabout the role the American Federation of State, County and Municipal \nEmployees, or AFSCME, was playing in that election. According to the \njournal:\n\n       The American Federation of State, County and Municipal \n     Employees is now the biggest outside spender of the 2010 \n     elections. The 1.6 million-member AFSCME is spending a total \n     of $87.5 million on the elections after tapping into a $16 \n     million emergency account to help fortify the Democrats' hold \n     on Congress. Last week, AFSCME dug deeper, taking out a $2 \n     million loan to fund its push. The group is spending money on \n     television advertisements, phone calls, campaign mailings and \n     other political efforts. ``We're the big dog,'' said Larry \n     Scanlon, the head of AFSCME's political operations. ``But we \n     don't like to brag.''\n\n  ``We are the big dog.'' That about sums it up. And when the big dog \nbarks, it expects the people it helped elect to jump. Why do you think \nthey are spending all this money? Because public employee unions care \nabout global warming?\n  Richard Trumka, the head of the AFL-CIO, a man I respect, has said he \ntalks with the White House every day and visits a couple times a week. \nWhy do people think he is doing that? Playing pick-up basketball with \nthe President? He is talking about how to benefit his unions, and \nlately that means public employee unions.\n  There were some recent reports suggesting that Organizing for \nAmerica--a Democratic National Committee project designed to reelect \nPresident Obama--was helping to foment the protests in Wisconsin. These \nunions are spending big-time money to elect politicians because they \nknow the politicians will deliver big-time benefits. But the chickens \nare coming home to roost. As we are seeing in State after State, the \nmarkets have something to say about these collusive relationships and \nthe benefits they secure. The credit-rating agencies have announced \nthey will begin factoring unfunded pension obligations into the \ncalculations they use to rate the creditworthiness of States. This is \nsignificant because the total value of State bond debt is estimated to \nbe around $1 billion, while pension debt is at least two or three times \nthat amount.\n\n  State credit ratings reveal another aspect of the State budget \ncrisis. The five States that prohibit collective bargaining of \nretirement benefits have Moody's highest credit rating. California and \nIllinois, which allow collective bargaining of retirement benefits for \npublic employees, have the lowest credit rating among the 50 States. \nThe next four lowest States also allow collective bargaining.\n  Illinois is in the worst shape of all, with less than 40 percent of \nthe funds needed to pay its public employee pensions. The Illinois \nsituation is so dire that for the last 2 years the State has had to \nborrow money just to make its pension contribution. This year Illinois \nhad to pay a 2-percent higher interest rate just to borrow money to \ncontribute to its pension program. Now, this is madness, and it cannot \ngo on forever.\n  Thirty years ago the Federal Government moved away from an expensive \ntraditional pension plan and set up a basic pension plan in combination \nwith a 401(k)-style defined contribution plan. The system has worked \nwell so far, although at some point we might need to reform Federal \npensions too. Some forward-looking States have begun moving to 401(k)-\nstyle plans.\n  In my own home State of Utah the traditional pension plan is being \nreplaced. New employees are being given a choice between a 401(k)-style \nplan and a hybrid plan with a combination of traditional and 401(k)-\nstyle features.\n  Last year Governor Chris Christie in New Jersey added a 401(k) plan \nfor a portion of the New Jersey workforce. In Kansas, Governor Sam \nBrownback and the Kansas Legislature are studying the possibility of \nconverting their pension system into a 401(k)-style plan. In Wisconsin, \nGovernor Scott Walker has asked that the State study the feasibility of \nestablishing a 401(k)-style plan.\n  There are many potential solutions to the public pension crisis, and \nall of them should receive consideration. We should be encouraging \nthese courageous Governors on rather than demonizing them and \ndemagoguing this issue. I, for one, would like to congratulate the \nGovernor of Wisconsin for his bold stand on the issue of public \nemployee benefits. The victory he secured last week is significant. He \nstood responsibly for the long-term interests of his State rather than \ndoing the easy thing and caving under the pressure of union-organized \nprotests and the childish and disrespectful resistance of Democratic \nlawmakers who chose to flee the States rather than engage in this \ndebate.\n  Governor Walker understands our greatest enemy is delay. The director \nof the Pew Center on the States has said that while these problems are \nsignificant, they can be solved if we act now. If we wait, the crisis \nwill become unmanageable.\n  Mr. President, it is my intention as ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee to find a way to address the public pension crises if State \nand local governments don't step up to the plate. I am under no \nillusions this will be an easy task. The problem is both large and \ncomplex. There are many potential solutions that must be studied, and \nsome will not be pleasant.\n  Some of my colleagues in the Senate have a proposal to address the \nproblem, and I will be working with them as well. I do not have all of \nthe answers yet, and I have not settled on what I believe are the best \nsolutions. But we are working hard and talking to the experts about the \nbest way to proceed.\n  I am sure of one thing, however, and I want to be 100 percent clear \nabout this. There will be no Federal bailout of any State or local \ngovernment. Let me just repeat that. No Federal bailout.\n  Just last month, after Illinois sold its high-interest bonds, the \nGovernor indicated that he plans to ask for a Federal guarantee. Well, \nGovernor, you can save your breath. The answer is, no.\n  We cannot ask taxpayers and the rest of the country to pay for \nunderfunded pensions in Illinois, California, or any other State that \nmade promises it clearly cannot keep. To do so would be more than \nunfair; it would be immoral. A Federal bailout cannot happen, and it \nwill not happen.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/17/senate-section/article/S1809-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1809-S1811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IRAN'S HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSERS\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \ndeteriorating human rights situation in Iran.\n  We understand that Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei--Iranian President Mahmoud \nAhmadinejad's Chief of Staff will be arriving in the United States as \nearly as tomorrow.\n  Mr. Mashaei is a close friend and trusted adviser of President \nAhmadinejad. Their kinship began in 1982 when President Ahmadinejad was \ngovernor of Khoy in West Azerbaijan and the Intelligence Ministry \nappointed Mr. Mashaei to the security team in the Kurdistan region next \ndoor. Since then, Mr. Mashaei has been a member of Ahmadinejad's inner \ncircle.\n  The world knows of President Ahmadinejad's public incitement against \nJews and Israel--most infamously with his pledge to wipe Israel off the \nmap. But the world may not know the virulent anti-Israel and anti-\nSemitic views of his trusted adviser.\n  In 2008, Mr. Mashaei told Sudanese President Omar Hassan Ahmad al-\nBashir:\n\n       The corrupt and criminal Zionist regime is harming not only \n     the Arab and Islamic world, but humanity in its entirety . . \n     . in order to save humanity from its different crises, there \n     is no other way other than the limiting of Zionist influence \n     on human society, because the root and origin of most of the \n     world's current crises are related to Zionism.\n\n  Shortly after the discredited Iranian Presidential election in June \n2009, Mr.\n\n[[Page S1810]]\n\nMashaei was appointed Presidential Chief of Staff--after a very brief \nand unsuccessful attempt to serve as the first Vice President of Iran.\n  Since then, the persecution and repression in Iran has steadily \nincreased. Thousands of peaceful protesters, dissidents and activists \nhave been detained.\n  Let there be no doubt, Mr. Mashei, like his President, is directly \nresponsible for human rights abuses in Iran. He should not be granted a \nvisa to enter the United States and he, like his President, should be \ndesignated under U.S. law as a human rights abuser in Iran.\n  Mr. Mashaei's visit will come just 4 days after the United Nations \nSecretary-General released an interim report on the human rights in \nIran.\n  The report states:\n\n       The human rights situation in Iran has been marked by an \n     intensified crackdown on human rights defenders, woman's \n     rights activists, journalists and government opponents.\n       Concerns about torture, arbitrary detentions and unfair \n     trials continue to be raised by UN human rights mechanisms.\n\n  Additionally:\n\n       Discrimination persisted against minority groups, in some \n     cases amounting to persecution.\n       A worrying trend is the increased number of cases in which \n     political prisoners are accused of Mohareb--or enmity against \n     God--offences which carry the death penalty.\n\n  At least 22 people charged with Mohareb have been executed since \nJanuary 2010.\n  Journalists, bloggers, human rights defenders and lawyers continue to \nbe arrested or subjected to travel bans. Blogs and Web sites are \nrestricted and now more than 10 national dailies have been shut down \nfor refusing to toe the official line.\n  Concern remains over a lack of due process rights and the failure to \nrespect the rights of detainees.\n  Particularly, ``concerns were expressed at routine practice for \nincommunicado detention, use of torture and ill-treatment in detention, \nuse of solitary confinement and of individuals without charges.''\n  Finally, ``concerns were expressed in public about people sentenced \nto death often do not have access to legal representation and their \nfamilies and lawyers are not even informed of the execution.''\n  The report continues to detail the Iranian persecution of religious \nminorities, especially the Baha'i. The report notes concern for six \nmembers of the Baha'i community arrested by officials from the \nIntelligence Ministry in the months of June and July 2010--and the \nseven Baha'i community leaders recently sentenced to 10 years in \nprison.\n  Regarding Iran's persecution of its Kurdish minority, the report \nnotes:\n\n       Members of the Kurdish community have continued to be \n     executed on various national security-related charges \n     including Mohareb. At least nine Kurdish political prisoners, \n     including Jafar Kazemi, Mohammad Ali Haj Aghaei, and Ali \n     Saremi were executed since January 2010, and several others \n     remain at risk of execution.\n\n  And regarding Iran's persecution of Christians, we read:\n\n       Reports also continued to be received about Christians, in \n     particular converts, being subjected to arbitrary arrest and \n     harassment.\n\n  The Secretary-General's report follows others by our own State \nDepartment and human rights groups like Amnesty International and Human \nRights Watch.\n  While we expect the State Department to release its 2010 country \nhuman rights reports on March 25, these are a few highlights from the \n2009 report on Iran.\n\n       Security forces were implicated in custodial deaths and the \n     killings of election protesters and committed other acts of \n     politically motivated violence, including torture, beatings, \n     and rape.\n       * * *\n       The government administered severe officially sanctioned \n     punishments, including death by stoning, amputation, and \n     flogging.\n       * * *\n       Authorities responded to all the demonstrations with raids \n     on opposition activists' offices.\n       * * *\n       Some prison facilities, including Evin Prison in Tehran, \n     were notorious for cruel and prolonged torture of political \n     opponents of the government. Authorities also maintained \n     ``unofficial'' secret prisons and detention centers outside \n     the national prison system where abuse reportedly occurred. \n     The government reportedly used white torture--prolonged \n     solitary confinement with extreme sensory deprivation--\n     especially on political prisoners, often in detention centers \n     outside the control of prison authorities, including Section \n     209 of Evin Prison.\n       * * *\n       The government threatened, harassed, and arrested \n     individuals who posted comments critical of the government on \n     the Internet; in some cases it reportedly confiscated their \n     passports or arrested their family members.\n\n  Amnesty's 2010 report on human rights in Iran starts with the \nfollowing summary:\n\n       An intensified clampdown on political protest preceded and, \n     particularly, followed the presidential election in June, \n     whose outcome was widely disputed, deepening the long-\n     standing patterns of repression. The security forces, notably \n     the paramilitary Basij, used excessive force against \n     demonstrators; dozens of people were killed or fatally \n     injured. The authorities suppressed freedom of expression to \n     an unprecedented level, blocking mobile and terrestrial phone \n     networks and Internet communications. Well over 5,000 people \n     had been detained by the end of the year. Many were tortured, \n     including some who were alleged to have been raped in \n     detention, or otherwise ill-treated. Some died from their \n     injuries. Dozens were then prosecuted in grossly unfair mass \n     `show trials.' Most were sentenced to prison terms but at \n     least six were sentenced to death.\n       * * *\n       The election-related violations occurred against a \n     background of severe repression, which persisted throughout \n     2009 and whose victims included members of ethnic and \n     religious minorities, students, human rights defenders and \n     advocates of political reform. Women continued to face severe \n     discrimination under the law and in practice, and women's \n     rights campaigners were harassed, arrested and imprisoned. \n     Torture and other ill-treatment of detainees remained rife \n     and at least 12 people died in custody. Detainees were \n     systematically denied access to lawyers, medical care and \n     their families, and many faced unfair trials.\n\n  In its 2011 World Report chapter on Iran, Human Rights Watch writes:\n\n       Iran's human rights crisis deepened as the government \n     sought to consolidate its power following 2009's disputed \n     presidential election. Public demonstrations waned after \n     security forces used live ammunition to suppress protesters \n     in late 2009, resulting in the death of at least seven \n     protesters and, I would add, we all remember Neda, who was \n     killed online. Authorities announced that security forces had \n     arrested more than 6,000 individuals after June 2009. \n     Hundreds--including lawyers, rights defenders, journalists, \n     civil society activists, and opposition leaders--remain in \n     detention without charge. Since the election crackdown last \n     year, well over a thousand people have fled Iran to seek \n     asylum in neighboring countries. Interrogators used torture \n     to extract confessions, on which the judiciary relied on to \n     sentence people to long prison terms and even death. \n     Restrictions on freedom of expression and association, as \n     well as religious and gender-based discrimination, continued \n     unabated.\n\n  The report continued:\n\n       Authorities systematically used torture to coerce \n     confessions. Student activist Abdullah Momeni wrote to \n     Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei in September \n     describing the torture he suffered at the hands of jailers. \n     At this writing no high-level official has been prosecuted \n     for the torture, ill-treatment, and deaths of three detainees \n     held at Kahrizak detention center after June 2009.\n\n  We cannot allow these violations to go unnoticed. Nor can we continue \nto turn a blind eye to the countless prisoners of conscience fighting \nfor basic human dignity in this brutal dictatorship.\n  It is time we take a stand for people like Nasrin Sotoudeh, detained \nfor her work as a human rights lawyer, women's rights activist, and \ndefender of children who face capital charges; Hossein Ronaghi-Maleki, \ndetained for his work as a blogger and human rights activist. He has \nbeen refused medical treatment for kidney failure; and Fariba \nKamalabadi, Jamaloddin Khanjani, Afif Naeimi, Saied Rezaie, Behrouz \nTavakkoli, Vahid Tizfahm, Mahvash Sabet--all detained for their \nleadership in the Baha'i community.\n  As of today, the precise whereabouts of opposition leaders Mehdi \nKarroubi and Mir Hossein Mousavi, and their respective wives Fatemeh \nKarroubi and Zahra Rahnavard, remain unknown following their arrest and \ndetention in February. Meanwhile, according to international human \nrights organizations, the whereabouts of hundreds of Iranians, \nincluding journalists and political activists, arrested just before the \nFebruary 14 opposition protests remain unknown.\n  To each of them, I echo President Reagan's words: ``I came here to \ngive you strength, but it is you who have strengthened me.''\n  As we approach the Iranian New Year celebration of Nowruz, it is time \nfor\n\n[[Page S1811]]\n\nthe President to demonstrate this administration's commitment to the \nIranian people's struggle for human rights.\n  We know that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iranian \nPresidential Chief of Staff Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei and other senior \nIranian government officials are directly responsible for and complicit \nin ordering, controlling, or otherwise directing the commission of \nserious human rights abuses against the people of Iran on or after June \n12, 2009.\n  Pursuant to Executive Order 13553 and the Comprehensive Iran \nSanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010, the President \nshould designate these individuals as human rights abusers and reaffirm \nour core American values: freedom, democracy and human rights.\n  I would just end by quoting from section 105 of the Comprehensive \nIran Sanctions Accountability and Divestment Act of 2010, signed by the \nPresident into law last year. It requires that the executive branch \nproduce a list of persons who are responsible or complicit in certain \nrights abuses. It says:\n\n       Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the President shall submit to the appropriate \n     congressional committees a list of persons who are officials \n     of the Government of Iran or persons acting on behalf of that \n     Government (including members of paramilitary organizations \n     such as Ansar-e-Hezbollah and Basij-e Mostaz'afin), that the \n     President determines, based on credible evidence, are \n     responsible for or complicit in, or responsible for ordering, \n     controlling, or otherwise directing, the commission of \n     serious human rights abuses against citizens of Iran or their \n     family members on or after June 12, 2009, regardless of \n     whether such abuses occurred in Iran.\n\n  Clearly this official about to arrive in the United States meets the \nstandard under section 105 of CISADA, and the U.S. administration \nshould designate him as an abuser of human rights. He should not be \nadmitted entry into the United States.\n  We should call it the way we see it, which is, this is one of the \nmost dangerous human rights-abusing officials that we know of. \nComprehensive data now exists from Human Rights Watch, from Amnesty \nInternational, even from the United Nations on what this man has \ndirected. He should not be given a visa, and he should be so listed \nunder U.S. law.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on an issue I feel I have \nspent a lot of time talking about in recent years but without much \neffect on either of the last two administrations. This is the issue of \nthe Iran Sanctions Act. Congress has worked in a bipartisan way to \nstrengthen and expand the Iran Sanctions Act, but in spite of our \nrepeated efforts, the administration has not been willing to use the \ntools the Congress has given them.\n  In my mind--and I am sure in the minds of a great many of my \ncolleagues--nothing would be more destabilizing to the Mideast region \nand to Middle Eastern regional security or global security than Iran's \ndevelopment of a nuclear weapon. I will not spend a lot of time talking \nabout why that is because I doubt there is any Member of this body who \nis not aware of how dangerous this situation is or could be, which is \nwhy it is even more frustrating that we have not been able to get the \nadministration to push a more robust set of sanctions using the \nsanctions policy and the sanctions tools we have given them.\n  During the 15 years between the time the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act \nwas passed, in 1996, and last year, no meaningful application of these \nsanctions was ever adopted. From 1996 until last year, no meaningful \napplication has ever been adopted.\n  In 2006, I worked closely with the Bush administration to pass a bill \nknown as the Iran Freedom Support Act, to improve the menu in the \nchoices of sanctions available to that administration and future \nadministrations. Under that bill, Congress codified some of the \nexecutive actions President Clinton and President Bush appropriately \ntook and ensured that these tools became more permanent.\n  Last year, alarmed again at the administration's disinterest in using \nthe sanctions available to it, Congress again acted to tighten our \nsanctions policy. The Congress sunsetted the State Department's period \nof investigatory review to ensure that once an investigation is \nlaunched, it has to be concluded. It is now up to the Obama \nadministration to pursue a vigorous sanctions policy that sends the \nmessage to Iran that: You are isolated in the world and the world will \nnot tolerate this nuclear program.\n  On March 26, 2009, I sent a letter to Secretary Clinton asking for \nclarification on why the administration had not fully implemented \nsanctions against Iran. I had sent a similar letter to Secretary Rice \nin 2007, suggesting--in fact, stating--that the Bush administration was \nsimilarly delinquent in its enforcement efforts. We have given them the \ntools, but, simply, these administrations, in both cases, have not used \nthose tools.\n  Fortunately, we now see the first indications that we are beginning \nto head in the right direction. Last fall, the State Department \nannounced sanctions against Naftiran, a Swiss subsidiary of the \nNational Iranian Oil Company. In an appearance before the Senate I was \nat with Secretary Clinton a few days ago, I was positive about my sense \nthat this was a big step in the right direction but really only one \nstep. Since the Iran Sanctions Act, this is the first time ever the act \nhas been used. I am pleased it has been used, but, remember, it is the \nfirst time ever it has been used.\n\n  This action--to make it even more important that it is being used and \nfrustrating that it hasn't been used--by the State Department had an \nimmediate effect, as I and many others have been suggesting it would \nsince the passage of these tools to the administration. Within days of \nthe State Department's actions against Naftiran, and according to news \nreports at the time, European firms such as Royal Dutch Shell, Total, \nStatoil, and Italy ENI announced they would pull operations out of \nIran's energy sector--exactly the kind of impact the Congress had hoped \nthis would have.\n  On September 29, 2010, Deputy Secretary Steinberg announced the State \nDepartment's initiation of investigations into international firms that \nhad not yet committed to exit Iran's petroleum sector. While the full \nlist of these firms remains classified, publicly available reports \nsuggest that list includes at least a dozen firms, many of which are \nChinese, including the Chinese National Offshore Oil Company, Chinese \nNational Petroleum Company, and Unipec. Other firms come from Germany, \nfrom Turkey, and from Venezuela. The list also includes the Industrial \nBank of China, the China Construction Bank, the Agricultural Bank of \nChina, and the Bank of China, which are reportedly providing financial \nservices to Iranian interests in violation of the Comprehensive Iran \nSanctions Act.\n  Under the law that now governs our sanctions policy, the State \nDepartment has 6 months to complete these investigations before \nannouncing whether these entities will face sanctions. These \nnotifications are due by March 29 of this year. I am very hopeful the \nState Department report sends the right message on March 29. It has \nbeen a long time for those of us who have advocated that this kind of \naction would produce the right kind of results.\n  U.S. sanctions policy should complement the international sanctions \neffort underway at the U.N. and other international venues. There is no \nreason we can't pursue a strategic sanctions policy that ensures \ncompanies operating in the United States or affiliated with U.S. \nentities don't invest in Iran's energy sector. It is time we \ndemonstrated that we are serious about this before it is too late.\n  We have now taken the first step in the right direction. It has \nproduced exactly the results we had hoped those steps would take. I and \nothers anxiously await the report that will come out between now and \nMarch 29 to see what the next steps are, and then we will be looking \ncarefully to see what\n\n[[Page S1812]]\n\nthe reaction to those actions is. I hope we continue to show we are \nserious, that sanctions will only work if the nations involved--and \nparticularly the United States--follow their own policies and use their \nown tools.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have come to the floor this evening \nto discuss America's tremendous natural resource potential and to again \nhighlight the fact that if we choose to, we can absolutely produce more \nof our energy to meet more of our Nation's needs. I also wish to \naddress an argument that is often made in opposition to new domestic \nproduction, because I believe each and every Member of this Chamber \nneeds to know the facts and the consequences of our current approach.\n  Without a doubt, understanding how much energy we have is at the very \nfoundation of an energy policy. The Presiding Officer sits on the \nEnergy Committee with me and we talk about our Nation's energy policy. \nWhen we talk about an all-of-the above, balanced energy portfolio, it \nis important to understand what it is we have. For resources such as \nwind and solar, it is pretty easy. They are renewable, so theoretically \nwe should never run out. But for conventional resources, which make up \nabout 83 percent of the energy America consumes, it is a different \nstory. Oil and natural gas and coal aren't located on the surface of \nthe Earth, so we don't exactly know what it is we have and where we \nhave it. We have to look around for it.\n  Finding and quantifying our resources is a tough enough task. Adding \nto the complexity is litany of technical terms used to describe them. \nThere are proved reserves, probable reserves, possible reserves, \nunproved reserves, and our demonstrated reserve base. Then we move into \nthe resources which are different from the reserves, and that list \nincludes eight more categories, and every one of them means something \ndifferent. I would imagine most people don't have a great understanding \nof these terms, and by and large I suppose that is fine, unless you \nhappen to be a Member of the Senate, because we are tasked with helping \nto formulate our Nation's energy policy. We need to know the details \nand the distinctions.\n  Before we make critical decisions that affect the price and the \nsource of our energy supply, it is our responsibility to know what our \nexperts think we actually have in this country. To help gain a better \nunderstanding of our Nation's energy base, Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma \nand I requested a report from the Congressional Research Service. The \nreport was first released back in October of 2009, and then in November \nthe CRS experts updated that report. It is entitled ``U.S. Fossil Fuel \nResources: Terminology Reporting and Summary.'' Fascinating, I am sure. \nIt actually is fascinating, and it should be required reading for each \nand every Member of the Senate.\n  Education is not the only reason we released this report, though. We \nalso hope it will help to set the record straight. Too many of the \nfacts presented here, particularly about energy, are based upon \nforegone conclusions. In some people's minds, we are supposedly running \nout of oil--well, because we have always been running out of oil. So at \nour request, CRS also surveyed existing government estimates to \ndetermine exactly how much conventional energy we think we might have.\n  I think most would find the results surprising. The truth is, our \nexperts don't believe we are on the verge of running out of oil, out of \nnatural gas, or of coal. Far from it.\n  According to the government's own estimates, the United States \nactually has the largest fossil fuel endowment in the world. To repeat, \nwe have the largest fossil fuel endowment in the world--larger than \nRussia, far larger than countries such as Saudi Arabia and China. \nWithin our own endowment is an incredible source of oil--an estimated \n163 billion barrels of technically recoverable resources--again, going \nback to that terminology. There are 163 billion barrels of technically \nrecoverable resources, which would be enough to maintain current \nproduction for more than 60 years.\n  We have huge volumes of natural gas, potentially more than 2,000 \ntrillion cubic feet, which would last 90 years at today's rate of \nconsumption. Our coal resources are truly unrivaled, and at 264 billion \nshort tons, our supply will last more than 200 years.\n  I will put up a chart here and speak to what we are looking at in \nterms of proven reserves and recoverable resources, when we are talking \nabout oil.\n  Back to the CRS report. They found that we have a tremendous range of \nsubeconomic resources that are not yet commercialized, including an \nestimated 100 billion barrels of heavy oil, more than 800 billion \nbarrels of oil shale, and up to 320,000 trillion cubic feet of methane \nhydrates. For oil shale, that is over 100 years' worth of conventional \noil. For methane hydrates, that would be an amazing 14,000 years' worth \nof natural gas, if we endeavor to find ways to produce it.\n  Looking at the chart--I am throwing out a lot of numbers and years. \nIt is kind of tough to get your arms around all of this. But if you \nlook to the share of proven reserves only, within our country--that 28 \nbillion barrels of oil, 17 percent--it leaves out the rest of America's \nrecoverable oil, or 135 billion barrels. 83 percent of what is \nestimated that we have within this country are resources and are, for \nall intents and purposes, off limits to us. So the share of proven \nreserves that we are talking about--the 17 percent--versus the 83 \npercent of recoverable oil which is off limits to us.\n  The numbers in the CRS report are our best experts' best estimates on \nhow much we have out there--how much oil, natural gas, coal, and \nunconventional fossil fuels lie within the United States. These numbers \ncan be obtained by anybody who works in Congress, anybody who is \ncapable of navigating to my Web site, or you can go to Senator Inhofe's \nWeb site. I do hope Members in the Chamber will make good use of it.\n  Not only does this report provide objective figures for the Senate to \nuse, it also casts serious doubt on many of the false arguments made \nagainst new domestic production. So I think it is important to \nrecognize again what it is that we have. This is not any classified \nsecret.\n  I want to give a couple specifics here, if I might. When you hear \nabout some of the language or the statements that are made and are \naccepted as fact, there is a claim heard regularly on the Senate \nfloor--and I heard it used by the President last week--that the United \nStates has just 2 percent of the world's oil reserves but consumes 25 \npercent of the world's oil. Well, that line is designed to make the \naudience think that the United States is both running out of oil and \nalso using it at an unsustainable rate. The truth is that government \nofficials have claimed that in the United States we have been running \nout of oil since about 1919, but we are still the world's third largest \nproducer, behind Russia and Saudi Arabia. But we are well ahead of \neverybody else.\n  If you think back to the categories I named earlier--and I am talking \nabout the different categories of reserves and resources--you can see \nwhy simply referring to proven reserves is misleading because those \naccount for only a very small sliver of our total oil. So to classify a \nbarrel of oil as a reserve, you literally have to drill and prove that \nit is there. By definition, that excludes all the lands that have never \nbeen explored, so that is the big chunk of the pie on the chart here. \nIt excludes a huge range of places where we believe there is oil, and \nin the end, it dramatically underestimates our Nation's oil resources.\n  Consider this: The proven oil reserves of the United States--the \nshare of proven reserves, the 17 percent--have never exceeded 40 \nbillion barrels. But over the past 110 years that the United States has \nbeen producing, we have managed to produce nearly 200 billion barrels \nof oil. On the books, we say there is only 40 billion barrels, but we \nhave been producing nearly 200 billion barrels of oil over the pass \ncentury. That alone should cast doubt on the words of so many.\n\n[[Page S1813]]\n\n  Arguing that we have just 2 percent of the world's oil is like \narguing that only your checking account, but not your much larger \nsavings account, counts toward your net worth. I will only count what \nis in my checking account, not what is in my savings account. But in \nreality, I have all of this; I have the whole combination. The reality \nis that if you have money in both accounts, neither provides a complete \npicture by itself. Oil is much the same way.\n  Between 2008 and 2009, our reserves actually rose by more than 8 \npercent, even as we produced about 2 billion barrels of oil, and that \nwas made possible by our substantial resource base. So why claim that \nAmerica is running out of oil when that is not the case?\n  The easiest explanation is that it is an attempt to turn perception \ninto reality. If Americans can be convinced that we have no oil, we \nwill stop demanding that our government allow access to it. Instead of \nrunning out of oil, we will simply stop producing it. In some people's \nminds, regardless of the economic consequences, the end result will be \nthe same.\n  The reason I am so encouraged by the CRS resource report and I am \nencouraging other Members to review it, and the reason I am so \ndisappointed by continued claims that America has nearly exhausted its \nresources, is that an understanding of our true energy potential helps \npoint the way to a viable national policy. Instead of locking up our \nlands, we need to open them up and streamline access, streamline \npermitting, and bring more of our own resources to market. Doing so \nwill not only allow us to increase domestic production but also \ndecrease domestic consumption. These steps are not mutually exclusive. \nGiven our energy and our fiscal challenges, they are actually dependent \nupon one another. Let me put it into context a different way.\n  For years, Alaska's congressional delegation has sought to allow \n2,000 acres of the nonwilderness portion of ANWR to be opened to \ndevelopment. Usually, when we talk about ANWR, we talk about how much \nnew oil production could result, probably somewhere between 800,000 and \n1 million barrels a day--truly, that would help us out at this time. \nBut left out of that conversation are the tremendous revenues that \nwould accrue to the Federal Government. According to CRS, those \nrevenues would reach more than $150 billion. I will repeat the number \nbecause we are looking for dollars. It would reach $150 billion at \ntoday's oil prices. If we use those revenues wisely, we could make \ngreat and serious progress on deficit reduction and investment in new \ntechnology.\n  Now, there is a bill from the Michigan delegation that would increase \nincentives for electric vehicles by an estimated $19 billion. It is a \ngreat idea, but the reason the bill will not go anywhere is that there \nis no way to pay for it right now.\n  Think about what would happen if we brought ANWR into the \nconversation. We could fully fund incentives to put not just a couple \nmillion but upward of 20 million electric vehicles on the road. We \ncould help create an entire industry even as we fully protect our most \nvaluable resource, which is the American taxpayer.\n  At the end of the day, our decision to produce more of our own oil \nwould be matched by a tremendous reduction in our oil consumption, \nthanks to the advanced vehicles we deploy from the revenues from oil \nproduction. But by holding back production, we hold back progress.\n  For far too long, I believe the antiproduction arguments have \nprevented Congress from developing a coherent energy policy. We see \nthem again today. They say, ``oh, it's the speculators'' or ``oh, the \nproducers aren't using the lands they have already leased, that's \nall.'' But today, we are also seeing the consequences of those \narguments: higher gasoline prices, a weaker economy, and a loss of \ninternational standing.\n  The longer our Nation waits to develop its resources, the longer we \nwait to create new jobs, to improve our energy security, to pay down \nthe debt, and to invest in next-generation technologies. The longer we \ndecide it is acceptable to import oil instead of producing our own, the \nlonger we will continue to export our wealth, export our jobs, and give \nthe benefits of production to other nations.\n  I think CRS's new report on America's true energy potential should be \nan eye-opener to us. I intend to circulate a copy to every Senate \noffice. I ask my colleagues to look through this report and understand \nwhat it means for our energy policy and then join me to make sure this \nCongress takes advantage of the opportunity it presents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/17/senate-section/article/S1813-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1813-S1814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONGRATULATING JOHN BAKER\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I have a short statement recognizing \nthe phenomenal historical win of the Iditarod race. John Baker is an \nInupiaq Alaska Native and is the first Alaskan Native to win the \nIditarod in 35 years, and it has been around for 39 years. He made it \nto Nome on the thousand mile-plus Iditarod Trail in record time: 8 \ndays, 19 hours, 46 minutes, and 39 seconds on the trail, which is the \nfastest time in the Iditarod history. We are exceptionally proud of \nJohn Baker.\n  I had an opportunity to be with John Baker and his phenomenal dog \nteam as they were preparing to leave from Anchorage 2 weeks ago, and \nJohn said, ``It's my time, Lisa.'' He has been in the top 10 for 11 \ntries now, and we are exceptionally proud of him, but not only proud of \nJohn Baker and his approach to the care of his dogs and his team, but \nwe are proud of the canine athletes. He has a couple lead dogs, Velvet \nand Snicker, that are pretty incredible.\n  Mr. REID. If my friend will yield, I got a call from one of the \nsecretaries, so why don't you give your statement.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank the leader. I will share it with you, and I \nappreciate the indulgence.\n  Again, I speak on behalf of not only John Baker as a great athlete \nbut his canine athletes. When the mushers leave out of the start in \nWillow, they leave with about 16 dogs on the team. These are remarkable \nanimals that love nothing more than to be on the trail and to be \nmushing. His team demonstrated a resolve and a commitment and a \ndedication to not only their musher, Mr. Baker, but to what the whole \nsport of dog mushing is all about. For those who follow the Iditarod \nTrail, you know this is not for the weak. This is over exceptionally \nrugged terrain, oftentimes in exceptionally rugged circumstances where \nyou have Arctic winds howling down off the coast, blizzards that \nprovide for whiteouts, going down passes that cause encounters that \nflip you over and break sleds and break bones. It is not for the timid.\n\n  But Alaska brings out some exceptional individuals. There were 62 \nteams that mushed from Willow to Nome this year. They are still out \nthere on the trail as we speak. We wish those who are still coming in \nwell along the way. We had some accidents, but there is never an \nIditarod when we do not seem to have Mother Nature intervening in one \nway or another. The good news for us is that those who have had a \nhappenstance, whether it was a broken collarbone or a happenstance with \na knife, those men are doing fine and the dogs, again, are coming in \nand doing fine.\n  Again, Madam President, I am thrilled to congratulate Alaskan dog \nmusher John Baker and his exceptional team of dogs, who carried him \nacross the Iditarod finish line for a first place finish in Nome, AK, \nat 9:46 a.m. Tuesday morning. The Iditarod is not for the faint of \nheart--the trail is made up of some of the harshest terrain in North \nAmerica spanning over 1,000 miles of rugged mountains, frozen tundra, \nand dense forests. Baker and his team made history yesterday beating \nevery Iditarod record after racing eight days, 19 hours, 46 minutes, \nand 39 seconds on the trail--the fastest time in Iditarod 39-year \nhistory by 3 hours.\n  John Baker is a hometown hero in Kotzebue, a small northwest Alaskan \ncommunity that rests roughly 33 miles north of the Arctic Circle on the \nChukchi Sea. Yup'ik drumbeats and seal calls welcomed John, an Inupiaq \nAlaska Native and the first Alaska Native Iditarod champion in 35 \nyears, as he and his team raced into Nome yesterday.\n  The Iditarod is the world's longest dog sled race. It requires \nmushers to have tenacity and a sort of fearless courage, but even those \nqualities will not make a winning team. Extraordinary leadership is \njust as essential of the lead dogs who must guide their\n\n[[Page S1814]]\n\nteam through the toughest of conditions for days on end. Together, man \nand dog are pitted against nature and the raw elements of the Last \nFrontier. John Baker's team of canines is truly the cream of the crop.\n  I have had the pleasure of meeting his lead dogs Snicker and Velvet. \nTogether, Snicker and Velvet guided the Baker team across frozen lakes \nand tundra, through freezing temperatures, winds, and snow. Although \nyesterday was the first time Snicker and Velvet have been draped in \nflowers and adoration at the finish line in Nome--this is not their \nfirst run at the Iditarod. Baker has run the Iditarod 15 times before \nand amazingly garnered 11 top 10 Iditarod finishes. This was their \nyear--and Alaskans are celebrating with them across the State. John and \nhis team have trained for this, they have fought for this, and they \nhave made history.\n  I am proud to congratulate the Baker team on this extraordinary \nvictory and I send my best wishes to John and his family today as they \ncelebrate this well-deserved victory in Alaska's great race.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. They had a great piece on public radio before the race \nstarted--it was very good--as to why the race takes place. I want to \nfind out if what I understood from that radio piece is valid.\n  Wherever the race winds up, there was a place badly in need of some \nkind of serum because there was an illness there, diphtheria. I do not \nreally remember. They had no way of getting the medicine there. Some \nperson decided what they could not do with machines they could do with \ndogs. They took the medicine and saved all these lives. Is that valid?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. The majority leader watched that report well--\n  Mr. REID. I listened to it. It was on the radio.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. The Senator listened to it well. He heard it right. It \nwas an outbreak of diphtheria in Nome. There was no way to get the \ndiphtheria serum to the residents of Nome. It was a true and honest \nscare in the middle of the winter. The concern was that if they were to \ntake it through a regular route during the winter months, it would not \nget there in time to save the residents of Nome.\n  The airfields were not sufficient. They could not travel by air \nbecause we did not have the airfields back in the twenties. It was a \nteam of dogs that did a relay across the State. They delivered the \nserum in time and saved the town.\n  This race has been resurrected, if you will, to commemorate the Great \nSerum Race to Nome, as it is called, to commemorate the delivery of the \nserum, an act that would save that community. It is quite a remarkable \nstory in our State's history.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I hesitate saying this because I will \nprobably get in trouble, but this is a good reason why the House vote \nwas bad today to disband public radio.\n  It was such a wonderful piece. I did not know that.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I, too, will take an opportunity to plug public radio \nbecause the majority leader heard the piece on NPR, but in my home \nState and in many of the villages we are talking about where these \nteams will go through on their way to Nome, it truly is the public \nbroadcast system that is their means of communication.\n  Mr. REID. I heard Ted Stevens talk about this in the past.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mukluk Telegraph is what he would call it. It was a \nway to convey birthday greetings to people in the next village. It was \na way to say: I made it back from hunting camp safely. It is a way of \ncommunication. People do not often recognize that in many parts of our \nState, and certainly along parts of where these teams are traveling \nright now, we do not have a level of communication that we see in \nWashington, DC, or in most parts of the country.\n  That is our plug for public radio. I appreciate that bit.\n  Mr. REID. The only radio station I can get in the daytime in \nSearchlight is public radio.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. There you have it.\n  Madam President, I appreciate the indulgence of the majority leader. \nAgain I send my warmest well wishes to John Baker and his team. I will \nbe greeting the mushers in Nome on Sunday at the mushers banquet, and I \ncan't wait.\n  I thank you for the time you have given me. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/17/senate-section/article/S1814-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1814-S1815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              TRADE AGENDA\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, we were considering, earlier this \nmorning, when I was presiding--and through much of the morning--the \nSmall Business Innovative Research bill. Senator Landrieu and Senator \nSnowe are leading very well on that issue.\n  I would like to speak for a moment about another important issue for \nsmall businesses and workers everywhere; that is, our Nation's trade \nand globalization agenda.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the Generalized System of Preferences, \nthe so-called GSP, the Andean Trade Preferences for Colombia and \nEcuador, and the 2009 reforms to the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nProgram all expired in mid-February.\n  I do not think too many people are happy about that. I am certainly \nnot. I have offered amendments with Senator Casey and requested \nunanimous consent to pass both the Andean Trade Preferences and the \nTrade Adjustment Assistance, but my Republican colleagues objected.\n  Others, such as Senator McCain, requested a unanimous consent on only \nthe Andean Trade Preferences, and I have objected. I have objected \nbecause we cannot turn our back on American workers who lose their jobs \nthrough no fault of their own, only to, then, help workers in other \ncountries.\n  Since Congress made reforms to the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nProgram in 2009--trade adjustment assistance has been with us since the \nKennedy administration. It clearly works. When workers lose their job \nthrough no fault of their own, they get some assistance from the \ngovernment to go back to school to get retrained so they can be \nproductive workers again. Again, they lost their jobs through no doing \nof their own.\n  But since Congress made the reforms in 2009, 170,000 additional \ntrade-impacted workers became eligible for training under the TAA for \nWorkers Program. So if somebody loses their job because of a trade \nagreement we pass in this institution--trade agreements that I think \nwere wrongheaded: NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China, other kinds of trade \nagreements with Australia and Jordan and Panama and Peru--when workers \nlose their job because of these agreements, we at least owe it to them \nto help them with trade adjustment assistance.\n  But since this program expired last month, we have shut out service \nworkers, we have shut out manufacturing workers who lost their jobs to \ncountries we do not have a free-trade agreement with. So we do not \nactually have a free-trade agreement with China or India. We did \nsomething called PNTR with China.\n  So if a worker in Dayton or Toledo or Findlay or Zanesville loses \ntheir job because of a trade agreement to China or India, they are out \nof luck. They do not get TAA. How awful is that? They worked at a \nplant, where that plant moved because of trade being moved to China, \nbut they do not get any kind of assistance. It was not their fault.\n  It should not work that way.\n  In addition, improvements to the Health Coverage Tax Credit Program \nalso expired. HCTC helps trade-affected workers purchase private health \ncoverage to replace the employer-sponsored coverage they lost. Again, \nthey lost their job because of a trade agreement. They cannot afford \nhealth insurance because they do not have much money and they get some \ntax credit from the government to help them be able to afford this \nhealth care. It has helped thousands of workers manage hospital costs, \nmedication, and necessary doctor visits. Without it, not only do \nAmericans lose their jobs, but they are at risk of losing their health \ninsurance. They generally cannot afford their health insurance, which \nalso may lead them more likely to lose their home and suffer from \nforeclosure.\n  TAA--trade adjustment assistance--and HCTC--health coverage tax \ncredit--have both expired. They must be renewed regardless of whether \nthis Congress considers or passes any new trade agreement.\n\n[[Page S1815]]\n\n  Ambassador Kirk, the U.S. Trade Representative, will soon be \nsubmitting the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement to Congress. I have \nexpressed my concerns about this agreement. I am concerned it will be a \nstep backward for American manufacturing, especially in the auto \nindustry. I am concerned that low-wage Asian nations will use Korea as \na platform to export auto parts and steel--duty free--to the United \nStates. They will come in from some country to Korea--maybe China, \nmaybe India, maybe somewhere else--through Korea and then get access to \nU.S. markets duty free.\n  These are serious concerns. This is not theory. This is based on what \nhas happened since passing other free-trade agreements. Every time we \npass a free-trade agreement, the supporters of it say there are going \nto be more American jobs and we are going to close the trade \ndeficit. It never does. It is always false manufacturing jobs. In \nnorthern West Virginia and in much of my State, we have seen that \ninflicted on families day after day after day, and it means a larger \ntrade deficit.\n\n  At least we will have the time to debate and consider the Korean \ntrade agreement. Unfortunately, several of my colleagues across the \naisle don't even want to consider the Korean trade agreement unless it \nis packaged with the Colombia and Panama trade agreements. So on top of \nnot extending trade adjustments, on top of not extending the health \ncare tax credit, our Republican colleagues want to move on all three \nleftover Bush trade agreements: Korea and Colombia and Panama. These \ntrade deals will not be winners for American workers. We know our \nexports increase with free-trade agreements. We also know our imports \nincrease to a larger degree.\n  The first President Bush said that when we have a trade surplus or \ndeficit of $1 billion, it translates into 13,000 jobs. So a $1 billion \ntrade deficit is 13,000 lost jobs. A $1 billion trade surplus is 13,000 \nincreased jobs. That is President Bush's numbers. We can just do the \nmath.\n  We have trade deficits of hundreds of billions of dollars in this \ncountry, and when production jobs move offshore, innovation is not far \nbehind. All of us, including the Presiding Officer, have gone through \nmanufacturing plants, and what we see there are workers and engineers \ntrying to figure out how to innovate and how to increase productivity, \nhow to make production more efficient and less expensive.\n  If we innovate in this country and invent in this country and then we \nsend those jobs overseas for production, we begin to lose the \ninnovative edge because over there, whether it is Mexico or China or \nIndia or Japan or anywhere else, when the production is done, then the \ninnovation is also done on the shop floor. So while we brag about being \nthe most inventive, innovative people on Earth--which we are--the \nfuture doesn't necessarily work that way as we outsource so many of \nthese jobs.\n  We have seen how these free-trade agreements give incentives to move \nproduction overseas, and instead of taking away those incentives, \ninstead of giving incentives to American companies to manufacture over \nhere, we do the opposite by passing the Korean Free Trade Agreement or \nPeru or NAFTA or CAFTA or any of those.\n  Peru's President Garcia spoke to the U.S. Chamber of Congress before \nsigning the Peru Free Trade Agreement. He said: ``Come and open your \nfactories in my country so we can sell your own products back to the \nUnited States.'' Come sell your own products back to the United States. \nHow is that good for American workers? How is that good for innovation? \nHow is that good for American manufacturing? How is that good for \nAmerican middle-class communities? It has become a business plan for \nfar too many companies in this country. Think about, in the broad sweep \nof history, how often this has happened, where the business plan for a \nU.S. company is, they invent something here, then produce it in China, \nthousands and thousands of miles away, and then it is shipped back to \nthe United States, back to the home country. That is the business model \nfor far too many companies. If they were to set up in China and sell \ninto China and east Asia, that would be one thing. But company after \ncompany after American company has gone abroad, done the production \nthere, sold it back into the United States, so it is not providing the \nwork for American workers that it should.\n  Again, my colleagues are holding people who need retraining and \nadjustment hostage to another trade agreement. So they are saying: If \nyou don't pass Colombia and Panama and Korea, then we are not going to \nextend trade adjustment assistance, we are not going to extend the \nhealth coverage tax credit.\n  Free trade's biggest supporters put so much stock into these free-\ntrade agreements and they do so ignoring the elephant in the room, and \nI am talking about our relationship with China. Congress approved China \nPNTR more than 10 years ago. We know what has happened. We have had \nliterally $\\1/2\\ billion a day in trade deficits with China. That means \nwe buy $500 million a day more in products from China than we sell to \nChina. That is what a trade deficit of $\\1/2\\ billion a day means--that \nwe actually are buying $500 million every single day more from China \nthan we are selling to China. That is not a long-term sign of \nprosperity. That is not a long-term indicator of the strengthening of \nthe middle class.\n  Until we figure out where we are going on trade and put a halt to \nthese trade agreements and look at what we need to do instead, we are \ngoing to continue to see the shrinking of the middle class.\n  Last week, an appeals court of the World Trade Organization made a \nhorrendous decision in favor of China against our trade remedy laws. \nThe WTO has again overreached beyond WTO laws and rules against our \nantidumping and countervailing duty laws. These laws have been the only \nway to protect ourselves and protect our economy and protect our \ncommunities and protect our workers and protect our small businesses. \nOne of the last tools we have to defend against unfair trade law are \nthese trade remedy laws, and the WTO, with a bunch of bureaucratic \ntrade lawyers, is taking them away. The WTO risks its own legitimacy \nwith a ruling like this one.\n  I urge the Obama administration to respond aggressively to this \ndecision. I urge my colleagues to step back from this stalled trade \nagenda--step back from Korea, Panama, and Colombia. I urge my \ncolleagues to examine instead what is in the best interests of American \nworkers and businesses. We can find a balanced trade agenda that makes \nsense for our businesses, makes sense for our workers, and makes sense \nfor our communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/17/senate-section/article/S1815-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1815-S1818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO RICHARD JAY CORMAN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise to recognize a good friend of \nmine, a very special Kentuckian who I and many others can look up to, \nMr. Richard Jay Corman of Nicholasville, KY. Mr. Corman is a successful \nbusinessman, a self-made man who started what is today a multimillion-\ndollar company. He is also living with cancer--and I do mean living, as \nfor several years now he has continued to make the most of each day \ndespite this disease, and he has become an inspiration for many.\n  Richard grew up on a farm that did not get indoor plumbing until he \nwas in the fourth grade. Now he is the head of the R.J. Corman Railroad \nGroup, a construction and railroad operation company he founded when he \nwas 18 years old. When Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005, the Corman \nRailroad Group was there, repairing the railways that had been damaged \nin dangerous conditions, and Richard was the one leading the operation. \nHe is known for his intensity, his determination, and his indefatigable \nenergy.\n  Richard has so much energy he has barely slowed down even after being \ndiagnosed with multiple myeloma nearly 10 years ago. Without treatment, \nhe was told he may have only a year to live. He survives thanks to a \nfantastic medical team, and Richard himself is funding medical research \nthat is not only keeping him alive but will benefit untold others. And \nRichard is still working and running marathons.\n  I am proud to call Richard Jay Corman a friend and I think his life \nstory holds lessons and inspiration for others. I read an article in \nFortune magazine recently that was a fascinating look at Richard's life \nand work. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n[[Page S1816]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      [From Fortune, Mar. 7, 2011]\n\n                    The Ballad of Richard Jay Corman\n\n               (By Carol Loomis, senior editor-at-large)\n\n       Richard Jay Corman is hardly a household name. But this \n     entrepreneur, a son of Kentucky, has made himself a force in \n     the railroad industry, where in up-from-nothing fashion he \n     has created a thriving, highly respected company. Called R.J. \n     Corman Railroad Group, it's a construction and operating \n     enterprise that takes in around $300 million a year. Rick \n     Corman, 55, is its sole owner. Earnings? He will say only \n     that it's ``incredibly profitable.'' But we'll make an \n     informed estimate: This business, after taxes, has in more \n     than one recent year earned $50 million in profits.\n       A Kentucky friend of mine, impressed by Corman and aware \n     also that he was facing some complex estate-planning \n     problems, suggested he'd make a good story. You couldn't say \n     the idea was a natural for us: Corman's financial feats, \n     while first-class, don't exactly put him in the Fortune 500 \n     league. Still, Corman seemed worth a trip, so last fall I \n     went to see him in his home state. And well before we \n     finished talking, I realized that he just might be--apologies \n     here to the Reader's Digest, which popularized this title--\n     the Most Unforgettable Character I've Ever Met in my more \n     than a half-century at Fortune. That may seem surprising \n     given that I've come to know more than a few standout CEOs \n     over the years. But the emphasis here is on the word \n     ``character.'' In the way he operates--and faces the world--\n     Rick Corman is truly larger than life.\n       And that's not just in business. Corman has also led a kind \n     of soap opera existence, whose chapters he began describing \n     to me in his twangy Southern drawl, and with a startling lack \n     of inhibition, within minutes of our starting to talk. We \n     were at his headquarters in the Lexington, Ky., suburb of \n     Nicholasville, in a small conference room adjoining a \n     cafeteria. He made sure I sat where I could look through a \n     glass wall down to a hangar in which there were parked two \n     private jets and a helicopter, all of them bright red (more \n     on that later). At that moment, I was too obtuse to grasp how \n     unusual those aircraft were. I mean, really, how many red \n     planes have you seen?\n       Asking a journalist's throwaway kind of question, I said \n     that driving to Nicholasville I had noticed a sign that said \n     REELECT KEVIN CORMAN FOR SHERIFF, and was he related? ``No,'' \n     said Rick, ``but if I get into trouble, he will be.'' And \n     those were the first of many laughs that I got from the very \n     funny and quick Rick Corman, who laughs along at high \n     decibels and loves it.\n       Hours later, Corman ended our talk with a plan for getting \n     me back on the road. Standing in his red baseball cap and \n     red-and-white corporate jacket outside his red-trimmed glass \n     offices, he told me to drive behind him as he led me to a \n     locked back gate and a shortcut to Lexington. The ride \n     unrolled a pristine scene of success. Ignoring a profusion of \n     red 25-mph signs he himself had ordered installed, Corman \n     raced at twice that speed for more than three miles through \n     2,000 acres of manicured rolling fields, past red sheds and \n     red work-barns and red bridges and small, shapely roadside \n     maples cooperatively turned, of course, red. In the left sky, \n     a pilot in still another red Corman helicopter was practicing \n     powerless emergency landings on a road. There were two \n     snapshots in white: the three farmhouse rooms that Corman \n     grew up in (and that got indoor plumbing when he was in the \n     fourth grade) and the large frame house, featuring half-\n     octagon windows at the end of recently built wings, that he \n     lives in now.\n       And as the back gate opened and I started to wave thanks, \n     Corman unfolded his gangly 6-foot-3 frame from his Lincoln \n     Navigator SUV, came to my right window, and said, ``I just \n     had to add one more thing: I would not be alive today if it \n     weren't for Kathy Martin.''\n       So, yes, there is a dark side to this tale. Kathleen \n     Martin, a gastroenterologist, is Corman's Lexington doctor. \n     He has an incurable form of cancer: multiple myeloma, which \n     attacks the plasma cells in bone marrow and destroys bones. \n     The disease killed Wal-Mart (WMT) founder Sam Walton, \n     quickly, in 1992. But Corman was diagnosed nearly 10 years \n     ago, when he was only 45. With the aid of two bone marrow \n     transplants, the determined ministrations of both Dr. Martin \n     and Harvard's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and the strong \n     will that allowed him to build a major business from scratch, \n     Corman has survived.\n       You can read about it on his company's website, where Dr. \n     Martin conveys the latest medical news about Corman. Last \n     July, following a period of remission for him, she posted a \n     new report saying that unfortunately a small amount of \n     recurrent cancer had been detected in his bone and that he \n     would therefore undergo new doses of radiation and \n     intensified chemotherapy.\n       Then, in October, the doctor triumphantly posted ``good \n     news.'' A PET scan had found Corman's myeloma to have again \n     gone into remission. ``We remain hopeful,'' Dr. Martin added, \n     ``that new therapies will become available to treat any \n     future relapses.''\n       Since R.J. Corman, the company, has no shareholders to \n     ponder this information, Martin's reports inform and reassure \n     the company's employees and customers--and even a board of \n     directors--who know Rick Corman to be the soul of the \n     company. True, he ostensibly retired about 14 years ago when \n     he suffered his third divorce and took over shared custody of \n     his three youngest children, then 6, 8, and 10. His \n     description of life as an idled, single father is that every \n     day he took the kids to the playground and sat there and \n     cried. And that was before he knew he had cancer.\n       Reports of his ``retirement'' are, in any case, highly \n     exaggerated. When his storm-team unit won a large and hugely \n     difficult Hurricane Katrina railway-repair job in 2005, he \n     was on site, leading the work, which produced revenues of \n     more than $100 million. ``He knows everything that's going \n     on,'' says W.W. ``Half'' Halfhill, a close friend. And Corman \n     circulates within the company's offices, and even its \n     cafeteria, like a boss--``Tell the cook not to fix so much \n     catfish at a time, because it gets cold,'' he ordered as our \n     interview turned into lunch. Says a veteran Corman employee, \n     Dickie Dillon: ``He's the motivator.''\n       Now, deeply aware of the doomsday clock, Rick Corman has \n     the untimely job of planning his company's future. Private \n     equity firms circle, some no doubt figuring they might sell \n     off pieces of the company. But out of loyalty to his 900 \n     employees, Corman refuses to sell.\n       Instead, he considers alternatives, a subject that \n     inevitably leads to the soap opera part of his life. His two \n     oldest children, a daughter and son who bear his name but \n     were born to a woman he never married, do not seem slated to \n     run the business. The three others--the ones he once took to \n     the playground--are still young, only in their twenties. On \n     the other hand, he has a highly competent staff, headed by a \n     talented president with whom Corman communicates with ease: \n     She's 49-year-old Tammie Taylor, dark-haired and attractive--\n     and Corman has lived with her for nine years.\n       Corman has a Kentucky expression for almost every \n     situation, including his death. That would be no big deal for \n     the company, he says: ``One monkey don't stop no show.'' But \n     in reality, for the Corman empire, that's as flawed in logic \n     as in grammar.\n       Corman came from a farm family, which included a \n     grandfather who did odd jobs hauling goods and took Rick in \n     as a 25% partner when he was only 11. A few years later, high \n     school utterly bored him. He got married in September of his \n     senior year and, when she didn't turn out to be pregnant \n     after all, they got divorced. Totally impatient with \n     schooling, Corman missed 105 days out of a scheduled 175 \n     during the 1973 school year but managed to graduate.\n       Having devoted his days playing hooky to learning the \n     excavation trade from an uncle, Rick rented a backhoe and a \n     dump truck and set out to do whatever jobs he could pick up. \n     The dump truck was red, and that became his color. ``You \n     can't be good if you don't look good,'' he says.\n       He edged into railroad work, rebuilding crossings and \n     driving grueling distances to wherever the job was, sometimes \n     sleeping in his truck and regularly braving terrible weather. \n     ``Railroads don't care--well, they really can't care--what \n     the weather's like when something needs fixing,'' he says. \n     Workers who couldn't take the punishment left. Corman kept \n     making himself the model for doing things right. A ``go-\n     getter'' by the description of many, including even himself, \n     he steadily picked up construction jobs and gained a \n     reputation for fast, expert service. It also helped that most \n     people simply liked him, sensing his innate intelligence, \n     quickly learning that he was totally honest, enjoying his \n     openness and humor and boisterous, cackling laugh.\n       In business, Corman was opportunistic. A Columbus company \n     to which the rail industry outsourced some of its derailment \n     business quit the city, and Corman was asked by railroad \n     friends to step into the void. He did, accepting the need to \n     acquire heavy, expensive equipment--machines that will lift a \n     derailed car, for example, so that the rails beneath it can \n     be repaired or replaced. That naturally led to ``crisis'' \n     work. ``He's kind of like an oilfield firefighter,'' says \n     Matt Rose, CEO of Burlington Northern Santa Fe, of his friend \n     Corman. ``He's the Red Adair of the railroad industry.'' But \n     Corman also has a hand in more prosaic businesses, such as \n     selling rails and ties to railroads. In effect, he takes on \n     inventory costs they'd just as soon not bear.\n       By 1984, when Corman was paying 24% interest to finance new \n     trucks, he sought help from Luther Deaton, a lending officer \n     at Lexington's Central Bank & Trust. Deaton, now president of \n     the bank, recalls that ``a very self-confident and happy-go-\n     lucky'' Corman, then just short of 30, arrived for their \n     first meeting wearing boots, khaki pants, and a big belt \n     buckle flashing his initials, and with no financial \n     statements in hand. ``I just couldn't get comfortable with \n     him,'' Deaton remembers.\n       Deaton stayed skeptical until Corman got him to visit a \n     couple of work sites--``to see what we do.'' On his first \n     visit, to a sprawling Baltimore & Ohio wreck, Deaton saw \n     shiny red trucks and bulldozers and watched Rick work atop a \n     railroad car, rigging cables to start pulling derailed cars \n     out of a tunnel. Next, on a deathly hot August day, Deaton \n     drove to see a stretch of railroad being rebuilt. Deaton \n     found Rick pulling up spikes so that track could be re-laid, \n     while sweat poured out of the top of his work boots. \n     Explaining to Deaton that he couldn't right then talk to him, \n     Corman said that if he got\n\n[[Page S1817]]\n\n     the job finished by midnight, he would get a bonus and in \n     turn be able to pay bonuses to his workers--those remaining, \n     because several had quit during the day owing to the harsh \n     conditions.\n       Deaton went home, comfortable, and says he told the \n     president of the bank, ``Look, we've got to help this guy. He \n     knows how to get it done. He's free to go be a great \n     success,'' and the boss said, ``Do it.'' The next day, a \n     Saturday, Deaton found Corman sitting in the engine he used \n     for an office, with blisters on his feet visibly oozing. \n     Deaton cut his interest costs on the trucks to 14% and \n     offered him a $500,000 credit line. ``We've never looked back \n     since then,'' says Deaton. ``He's a banker's dream.'' \n     Translation, according to Deaton: Corman is a brilliant \n     businessman who borrows frequently, but is conservative and \n     always good for his debt.\n       Corman's improved financial position helped set him up for \n     his biggest opportunity, which materialized when the passage \n     of the deregulating Staggers Rail Act of 1980 caused the \n     industry to gradually reshape itself. Many railroads sold off \n     their ``short lines,'' usually meaning rail lines of 100 \n     miles or less. These were like baubles to the trunk lines, \n     but they were nice baubles, being monopolies (as is the case \n     with almost all railroads), except for competition from \n     trucks.\n       Corman got in this game when a Seaboard System executive \n     who took to Rick said, ``I'm going to sell you a railroad.'' \n     And that's how it happened that Corman, in 1987, paid \n     $300,000 for a 20-mile line in Kentucky, the first of eight \n     short lines, covering about 620 miles, he picked up. \n     Naturally, the engines on these lines are red. On the profit \n     side, though, the short lines began to deliver very black \n     profits, becoming Rick's biggest moneymakers.\n       Then came the cancer. It revealed itself in the spring of \n     2001 in Amsterdam, where Corman, generous to others all his \n     life, had taken a group of friends and relatives to see the \n     blooming of the tulips. He was running in a park one day, \n     when another runner passed him doing 5\\1/2\\-minute miles. \n     Corman immediately tried to match the pace. Within minutes he \n     was brought to his knees by excruciating pain in his back.\n       Managing to get home to Kentucky, he got two doctors on the \n     case. One, his family internist, Terrance Furlow, ordered a \n     blood test and a bone biopsy that strongly indicated multiple \n     myeloma. The other doctor was Kathleen Martin, a tall, \n     striking blond whom Corman had dated until they had recently \n     broken up in a friendly way. Corman knew the woman he calls \n     ``Kathy-leen'' to be a dedicated patient advocate. ``There's \n     no dam big enough if she's the beaver,'' he says, speaking \n     Kentucky. He wanted her at his side as he dealt with his \n     illness, and that's where she has been for nearly 10 years.\n       Dr. Furlow sent the two of them to the Mayo Clinic for a \n     bone marrow biopsy and a confirming diagnosis. There, Dr. \n     Stephen Ansell, a hematologist, told Rick soberly, ``It is \n     myeloma. It's not curable, but it's treatable.''\n       Rick said: ``Well, there are worse cancers than this, \n     right?'' Neither Ansell nor Martin spoke. ``It seemed like a \n     year passed,'' Corman recalls, ``until finally both came up \n     with pancreatic cancer.'' He said at least it was good to \n     know there was a worse one. But by that time he was breaking \n     up with laughter at their halting answer--and so were the \n     doctors. ``It's a gift of Rick's,'' says Martin. ``He gets \n     people to laughing no matter what.''\n       Dr. Ansell said that without treatment Rick might have a \n     year to live. Rick instantly became a fan of treatment. Dr. \n     Ansell allowed that a bone marrow transplant, which he \n     suggested be done at Mayo, would reset the clock and possibly \n     give Rick three years. The doctor added that Rick should \n     focus on spending his money and enjoying life. ``The \n     message,'' says Rick, ``was that my life was going to be \n     short.''\n       After that meeting, Corman and Martin, in effect, shopped \n     for time, hoping to find a specialist who might visualize a \n     better outcome. At the University of Arkansas for Medical \n     Sciences, a center of myeloma research, doctors said the \n     right treatment could give Corman seven years. And then he \n     and Martin went to Boston's Dana-Farber, whose myeloma chief, \n     Dr. Kenneth Anderson, looked down at Corman's file and said: \n     ``I see you're 45, Rick. I'm surprised that you'd be \n     satisfied dying at age 52. If you come here, we will do \n     everything possible to see that you grow old gracefully and \n     die of something other than multiple myeloma.''\n       And thus was struck a memorable bargain, for both sides. \n     Against terrible odds, Corman has survived; Dana-Farber has \n     received millions for the R.J. Corman Multiple Myeloma \n     Research Fund, most of the money contributed by Rick, some by \n     friends of his. He told Dr. Anderson at the outset: ``Every \n     year you keep me alive, Santa Claus will visit you.'' Corman \n     proceeded to deliver Dana-Farber at least $250,000 each \n     December, usually in packs of $100 bills (though he has \n     stopped the cash deliveries because of security concerns) \n     that he ostentatiously plunks down before his doctor, Paul \n     Richardson, and other staff members. And Rick would say, \n     ``Don't forget that this won't be coming if I die.''\n       Dr. Richardson, 48 and internationally known for his work \n     on multiple myeloma, has done his part by cycling new and \n     improved drugs (some developed at Dana-Farber) into the oral \n     and intravenous ``cocktail'' that Corman takes. Dr. \n     Richardson says he and Dr. Anderson have ``kind of taken this \n     disease by the scruff of the neck and given it a damn good \n     shake.''\n       Richardson's affection for his patient has in the interim \n     grown so deep that he never runs out of praise for him. He \n     watched Rick give $12,000 to a cancer patient he didn't know \n     for a transplant that might otherwise have not been \n     performed. Every week Rick funds a group luncheon for Dana-\n     Farber's doctors, picking up the check because the \n     institute's rules won't let it pay. ``Rick is a profoundly \n     good man,'' says Richardson, finding him a remarkable mixture \n     of ``humbleness and--I don't say this lightly--greatness.''\n       Richardson does not talk, meanwhile, of a cure because \n     there isn't one. Richardson says, ``I hope--well, actually I \n     pray--that he can have another five to 10 years.'' Rick, not \n     much into religion, says simply of his prospects, ``If you \n     make it to tomorrow, you've done good.''\n       All of Corman's doctors agree that he has come this far by \n     keeping himself remarkably fit. In 2002, five months after \n     his first bone marrow transplant, Corman ran the Boston \n     Marathon to aid a cancer fundraiser. He still runs five \n     kilometers almost every day, but his illness has caused his \n     pace to slow, from maybe 19 minutes for the distance to 27. \n     The drugs he takes also have intermittently caused him \n     intense, neuropathic leg pain, which he sometimes can ease \n     only by elevating his legs above his heart. He often does \n     that in deep La-Z-Boy recliners at home, in a space once \n     called the living room and now christened the ``cancer \n     room.''\n       The discovery of his illness brought about large changes in \n     both Rick's business and personal life. Dr. Richardson asked \n     to see Rick frequently in Boston, which raised the threat of \n     commercial flights exposing him to germs. No problem: Rick (a \n     pilot himself) constructed a city-airport-size 5,600-foot \n     runway on his property. For transportation, he bought two \n     planes for $12 million, a Challenger and a Learjet, naturally \n     decking them out in his color. That move was automatic, even \n     though a dark paint like red increases operating costs--\n     absorbing heat, for example, and making the plane more \n     difficult to cool. That's a reason, folks, you do not see \n     many red planes.\n       Though turning his grounds into an airfield kept Rick busy, \n     he wasn't spared periods of great sadness and despair about \n     his illness. On one 2001 Friday night several months after it \n     flared, with his young kids away at their mother's, he phoned \n     Tammie Taylor, then the chief of one of his company's \n     divisions. Finding her at the office, he asked her to come \n     the short distance to his house. ``Why?'' she asked. ``Is \n     anything wrong?'' ``Please just come,'' he answered. When she \n     got there, he says, he was ``sitting there bawling.'' To her \n     anxious question, he said simply, ``I'm scared.'' Things \n     moved on after that in quite a remarkable way: Taylor stayed \n     that night, and she's been there ever since.\n       As a manager, Taylor wins Rick's ultimate accolade: ``She's \n     a go-getter'' (a description that, were it in a thesaurus, \n     would be in the vicinity of ``industrious''). But she is the \n     first to say that the secret of R.J. Corman's success is, \n     simply, Rick. She spends her days, in fact, trying to hire \n     people who will bring his kind of ``passion and pride'' to \n     their work.\n       And what is to happen when Rick--this inspirer and \n     motivator--is not there to keep that culture going? The legal \n     answer is that a trust will take over ownership of the \n     company. It will exist for a near-unimaginable 200 years and \n     is likely to have Dana-Farber as its ultimate beneficiary. A \n     handful of trustees will run it--people that Rick knows well \n     and indeed trusts--and they will be paid handsomely, probably \n     dividing one-fifth of the company's pretax profits. That \n     would be big money. But Rick expects the trustees (who could \n     include some of his children) to devote all their might to \n     preserving and building the company. And if they do that, the \n     price will seem cheap to him. All the while, Rick says, \n     Tammie Taylor and her staff will run the company and can be \n     expected to do it very well.\n       He does not rule out the possibility that eventually one or \n     more of his children will move into management, though at the \n     moment the three oldest have careers that are not headed in \n     that direction. Amy, 33, is a marketing analyst at a \n     Lexington uniform company, Galls; Richard Jay, 30, is an \n     associate dean at Lenoir Community College in North Carolina; \n     Jay Richard, 24, drives a tractor-trailer for R.J. Corman. \n     The other two children are Ashley, 22 (called by her first \n     name, Shawna, by everybody but Rick), and April, 21. Both, \n     Rick thinks, might have the ``capacity'' for running a \n     business. Each, though, has entertained the thought of \n     becoming a doctor. Ashley is currently a clinical research \n     coordinator at Dana-Farber and a student of her father's \n     disease. April is a junior at Transylvania University in \n     Lexington.\n       Dale Hawk, formerly a CSX (CSX) executive and today an R.J. \n     Corman director, says Rick's kids will undoubtedly have to \n     earn their way into management if that's where they'd like to \n     be. Right now, he says, the company is well established and \n     will endure if Rick dies. But he also acknowledges that it \n     will miss Rick's flair and the personal relationships that he \n     has in the railroad industry. ``The company will go on,'' he \n     says, ``but it will never be the same without Rick.''\n       After my long Nicholasville interview with Rick, I saw him \n     three times more. In November, I traveled with him and Dr. \n     Martin to\n\n[[Page S1818]]\n\n     Dana-Farber. As we waited in a corridor, every doctor who \n     passed greeted the two warmly. One doctor, a Kentuckian \n     himself, joked with Rick about the next bone marrow \n     transplant he might need, saying it would undoubtedly be easy \n     to find a donor of cells ``because we know that all \n     Kentuckians are related.'' (``Oooh, be careful,'' said Rick. \n     ``Mrs. Loomis, here--she's from the press.'')\n       I next saw Corman twice in New York City. On a Monday he \n     unexpectedly dropped by my office to introduce me to the \n     University of Kentucky's famous basketball coach, John \n     Calipari. The two men had flown to New York for the day to \n     shop at Brioni, the upscale tailoring establishment that \n     makes Rick's flamboyant, double-vent red sports jackets. I \n     thanked Calipari for a favor he'd done me. There had been a \n     time, early on, when Rick thought he might not cooperate with \n     this article. But friends had talked him into it, among them \n     Calipari, who argued, ``Somebody reading it might be \n     inspired.''\n       In my other New York visit with Rick, he came to breakfast \n     at my office cafeteria in December so I could do a little \n     wind-up reporting. Heads turned to marvel at his jacket as we \n     stood waiting for our bacon and eggs. He was in Manhattan to \n     take 130 people to the Radio City Christmas show and then to \n     dinner at Del Frisco's, an expensive restaurant nearby.\n       On that Friday morning he had the look of invincibility \n     that appears to have characterized him all his life, but that \n     sometimes, as you've read, is stripped away by sadness. Even \n     so, Rick Corman had made it to that December day and to the \n     others that passed before this story closed some weeks later. \n     He'd ``done good,'' by his way of reckoning. You can't help \n     but feel that he will keep on beating the odds. And, when his \n     luck runs out, the word will go up on the company website, \n     and the world will have lost some of its style.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/17/senate-section/article/S1818-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 TIBET\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today to express my \ncontinuing concern about the current situation in Tibet.\n  Before I do so, I would like to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues a recent statement made by His Holiness the Dalai Lama on \nhis political future.\n  In his March 10 statement marking the 52nd anniversary of the Tibetan \nuprising, His Holiness announced his intention to propose amendments to \nthe Charter for Tibetans in Exile, handing over his formal authority to \nan elected leader.\n  Let me read a portion of his message to the Fourteenth Assembly of \nthe Tibetan People's Deputies:\n\n       The essence of a democratic system is, in short, the \n     assumption of political responsibility by elected leaders for \n     the popular good. In order for our process of democratization \n     to be complete, the time has come for me to devolve my formal \n     authority to such an elected leadership.\n\n  I applaud His Holiness for this decision and I stand ready to do my \npart to help the Tibetan community in exile transition to a new \npolitical structure.\n  I take great comfort in the knowledge that His Holiness will continue \nhis role as spiritual leader to the Tibetan people and will work \ntirelessly to preserve the Tibetan culture both inside and outside of \nTibet.\n  I also support His Holiness' call for fact-finding delegations to \nTibet, including representatives of international parliamentarians, to \nsee for themselves the current situation on the ground.\n  As His Holiness pointed out, similar delegations visited Tibet in the \nlate 1970s and early 1980s and I strongly encourage China to allow them \nagain.\n  I believe such delegations could increase awareness about the \nchallenges facing Tibetans and Tibetan culture and enhance dialogue and \ncooperation with China on finding mutually beneficial solutions.\n  Indeed, as a friend of His Holiness and as a friend of all Tibetan \npeople, I remain deeply concerned about the situation in Tibet.\n  In 2008, a wave of violence swept across Tibet which was met with \nviolence by the Chinese government.\n  Reports out of Tibet continue to paint a picture of the suppression \nthe Tibetan culture and people are confronted with.\n  And despite nine rounds of talks between the United Front Work \nDepartment of the Communist Party of China and envoys of His Holiness \nthe Dalai Lama, a comprehensive solution to the Tibetan issue remains \nout of reach.\n  As a friend of China and the Dalai Lama, I am saddened to see the \nsituation in Tibet further deteriorate.\n  The Dalai Lama has been trying to engage the Chinese leadership for \nmore than 50 years.\n  In the 1990s, I carried three letters to President Jiang Zemin from \nthe Dalai Lama requesting a face-to-face meeting.\n  In my view, the Dalai Lama's concerns are driven by the fact that the \nChinese Government continues to suppress the Tibetan way of life.\n  Yet he has made it clear that he does not support independence for \nTibet, but rather meaningful cultural and religious autonomy for the \nTibetan people within the People's Republic of China.\n  This can only come about through meaningful dialogue and negotiation, \nnot actions that would undermine Tibetan culture.\n  As such, I urge the administration to support fact-finding \ndelegations to Tibet and work with our friends and allies in the \ninternational community to call on the Chinese Government to begin a \nsubstantive dialogue with the Dalai Lama on national reconciliation, \nrespect for the Tibetan culture, and meaningful autonomy for Tibet.\n  I have been blessed to call the Dalai Lama a friend for more than 30 \nyears. I first met him during a trip to India and Nepal in the fall of \n1978.\n  During that trip I invited His Holiness to visit San Francisco--where \nI was mayor at the time--and he accepted. In September 1979, I was \ndelighted to welcome the Dalai Lama to San Francisco to receive his \nfirst public recognition in the United States.\n  During our many conversations, His Holiness often reiterates that, at \nits core, Buddhism espouses reaching out to help others, particularly \nthe less fortunate. And it encourages us all to be more kind and \ncompassionate.\n  His teachings truly cross all religions, cultures, and ethnic lines.\n  Over the decades, his principled beliefs have never wavered, yet his \nteachings have become more expansive. His message of peace and \nunderstanding has never been more relevant than it is today.\n  In the midst of war and bloodshed, the Dalai Lama has been a champion \nfor peace and nonviolence. In his quiet but undeniably firm manner, he \nchallenges all of us to look beyond conflict and harmful rhetoric to \nseek positive change by embracing dialogue, cooperation, and negotiated \nsolutions.\n  In the face of hatred and intolerance, he has faith in love, \ncompassion, and respect.\n  He reminds people from all corners of the globe to move beyond our \nethnic, religious, and racial divisions and embrace our common \nhumanity. He encourages us to believe in something bigger than \nourselves and work together for a better future.\n  He sets a wonderful example for all of us, and I am proud to call him \nfriend.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Dalai Lama in \nworking toward a humanitarian solution to the problems plaguing Tibet \nand the Tibetan people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/17/senate-section/article/S1818-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1818-S1819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IRISH-AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, today I applaud the President in \ndeclaring March 2011 Irish-American Heritage Month, and I speak in \ncelebration of the rich Irish history, culture, and customs still alive \ntoday in the hearts and minds of Irish Americans everywhere.\n  The association of our two nations began early in our country's \nhistory. Irish immigrants arrived in the early colonial days as \nindentured servants, which was often the only affordable method of \npassage to the ``New World.'' Close to a quarter of a million Irish \nimmigrated during the colonial era, and many of them to Maryland. Upon \ntheir arrival, they set immediately upon the heady things of the time: \nindependence, and the building of a nation. Irish immigrants took up \ntheir new national identity with fervor, especially in Maryland, and \nhelped to found lasting institutions. Charles Carroll, his family \ndescendants from the O Cearbhaill lords of Eile, was a member of the \nsecond Continental Congress and signed the Declaration of Independence. \nHis cousin, John Carroll, born in Upper Marlboro, was elected the first \nbishop of Baltimore, and was elevated to the first Archbishop of the \nUnited States when Pope Pius VII made Baltimore the first American \nCatholic archdiocese. James Calhoun, of Irish descent, was the first \nmayor of Baltimore City, and held a commission with the Baltimore \nmilitia.\n\n[[Page S1819]]\n\n  From these auspicious beginnings, those reporting Irish ancestry in \nMaryland have today grown to over 700,000, according to the 2006 \nAmerican Community Survey. These sons and daughters of Eire did not \ngrow without tribulation. As famine and hunger gripped the Emerald \nIsle, nearly 3.5 million Irish immigrants fled to America between 1820 \nand 1880, engendering discriminatory reactions that often strayed into \nviolence. Signs of ``No Irish Need Apply'' appeared in business \nwindows, and young Irishmen were often drummed into service on the \nquayside to fight for the Union Army. Indeed, in my own home town of \nBaltimore, the mayoral elections of 1856, 1857 and 1858 were marred by \nviolence, political intimidation and well-founded accusations of \nballot-box stuffing, fomented by nativist political organizations, such \nas the Know-Nothing Party.\n  Irish Americans pushed past these shortsighted prejudices, time and \nagain, and put their shoulders to the wheel of industry in America. \nThey helped settle and farm the breadbasket of America, they took up \narms in the defense of freedom and liberty, and they helped build an \never strengthening bond with the island nation of Ireland. They built \nstrong communities around the values of hard work, perseverance, faith, \nand a shared remembrance of an ancestral home across the sea. Irish \nAmericans have ever understood that great joy is only earned with great \nhardship, and our 35th President, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, showed this \nethic. In service to our country, he faced down the threat of worldwide \nnuclear annihilation, and pushed our Nation to do the impossible: to \nclaim the Moon as the province of man. Irish Americans proudly continue \nthis tradition of service, and serve at every level of public office, \nincluding in the Governor's Mansion in Annapolis, MD, where Maryland's \nfavorite Irish-American son, Governor Martin O'Malley, resides.\n  The millions of Irish that immigrated to the United States, escaping \nhunger and religious persecution, chasing the elusive American dream, \nforever knitted Ireland and America together. It is right that we honor \nthis bond, and take this occasion to reflect on the deeply inlaid \nthreads of American history and tradition that sound, look, feel, and \nare distinctly Irish.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/17/senate-section/article/S1819-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HOUSE HEARINGS ON MUSLIM AMERICANS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise today about an issue of grave \nconcern to me. All of us agree that America must be vigilant to stop \nviolent extremists and terrorists who want to attack our Nation. We \nmust do everything possible to fight terrorism and keep our country \nsafe and free.\n  But as we have seen, the House of Representatives recently held a \nhearing on the ``Extent of Radicalization in the American Muslim \nCommunity and that Community's Response,'' targeting only Muslim \nAmericans. This approach is the wrong way to fight terrorism.\n  History has shown us that terrorists can come from anywhere, from any \ncountry or from any faith. We sadly know this from the tragedy in \nOklahoma City. Focusing only on one group is not only un-American, it \nalso ignores real threats from homegrown terrorists. Unfortunately, \nthere are extremists in every religion. We know that the terrorists who \nattacked us on September 11, 2001, had perverted the message of Islam \njust as people have perverted other faiths at times throughout history \nto justify violent acts.\n  America is home to millions of hard-working, patriotic Muslim \nAmericans who stand with us in the fight against terrorism. Muslim \nAmericans died in the attack on September 11, 2001, and Muslim-American \nfirefighters and police officers, who rushed into the towers to save \npeople while putting their own lives at risk, were rightly called \nheroes.\n  I am proud to represent the great State of Michigan where we benefit \nevery day from the hard work and dedication of Muslim leaders in \nbusiness, medicine, education, science and many other professions. \nAmerica was founded on the premise that all of its citizens are free to \npractice their religion openly, without government interference. We are \na country founded on the principles of equality and liberty.\n  I urge my colleagues to continue to forcefully fight terrorism while \nrespecting the values that our country was built upon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/17/senate-section/article/S1819-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              REMEMBERING LIEUTENANT JAY FREDERICK SIMPSON\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I rise today in honor of a man who gave \nhis life serving the United States of America in World War II.\n  LT Jay Frederick Simpson was a pilot with the ``Mighty Eighth'' Air \nForce of the U.S. Army Air Corps.\n  On January 9, 1944, Lieutenant Simpson's mission was to test fly a \nThunderbolt P-47 over Moreton, England. But something went wrong. His \nplane caught fire and flipped over in the air. As the P-47 hurtled to \nthe ground, witnesses say Lieutenant Simpson managed to guide it away \nfrom nearby homes, avoiding certain casualties. Instead that P-47 \ncrashed in a nearby field, killing the 27-year-old pilot.\n  Today, LT Jay Simpson is still celebrated as a hero in England. In \nfact, you can find a memorial to him in that grassy field.\n  But for three generations following Lieutenant Simpson's death, his \nheroism was overlooked by his own country. Until a year and a half ago. \nThat is when a young man in Billings, MT, started doing some research. \nWith help from his father and his grandfather, 14-year-old James \nSimpson discovered that his great-grandfather Jay never received the \nrecognition he earned as a fallen American hero.\n  Young Jim Simpson wrote me a letter, saying proper recognition of his \ngreat-grandfather's service and sacrifice would bring about much needed \nclosure for his family.\n  Indeed, honoring our heroes brings about much needed closure for all \nAmericans. On behalf of a grateful nation, it is my tremendous honor to \npresent LT Jay Simpson's medals to his great-grandson.\n  To Jim and all the Simpson family: Let these medals be family \ntreasures that remind you--and all of us--that this Nation will never \nforget Jay's heroism. And we will never forget all Americans--known or \nunknown, celebrated or overlooked--who paid the ultimate price in \nservice to the United States.\n  It is said that Lieutenant Simpson was a member of the Greatest \nGeneration. But thanks to people like young Jim Simpson, I am reminded \nthat there is greatness in all generations.\n  Thank you, Jim, for your hard work in allowing us to honor your \ngreat-grandfather. God bless you and your family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/17/senate-section/article/S1819-3", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1819-S1820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING FRANK BUCKLES\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

I also thought about the \nAmerican flags at half mast in our embassies in the countries of our \nWorld War I allies.\n  Honestly though, the way I want to remember Frank Buckles is in his \nstudy, surrounded by books and telling amazing stories about the \nadventures of his life. Frank Buckles' rich and colorful life is now \npart of our national history, our national consciousness and our \nnational effort to pay tribute to the men and women who died in the \nmost significant wars of the last century.\n  Frank's effort to join the Army was a deliberate commitment to join \nmilitary service and he was eager to get to Europe. He loved the Army \nand his service in World War I as an ambulance driver which exposed him \nto some of the worst horrors of that conflict.\n  After his military service, Frank Buckles continued his efforts to \nengage the world. His life, a long sweeping arc across the last \ncentury, included an exciting and varied life where he traveled the \nworld, working abroad and experiencing things that most of us can only \nread about. As if he hadn't endured enough suffering in the First World\n\n[[Page S1820]]\n\nWar, he would later spend 3 years as a civilian POW in World War II.\n  When his days of being an active participant in two World Wars ended, \nhe eventually settled into a quiet existence in Charles Town where his \ntractor, his farm, as well as his friends and family were enough to \nsustain him.\n  As I got to know him, I learned that his deep appreciation for books \nand culture was an important part of who he was. He spoke multiple \nlanguages, enjoyed talking about culture more than he did war, and was \nthoughtful and interested to the end.\n  To most of us though, Frank in the end amounted to so much more than \njust a man who had lived a life that was as interesting as it was \nunpredictable.\n  Frank became a symbol for the entire war for the nearly 4.5 million \nU.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines who defeated the Central \nPowers in the first Great War.\n  As the last living connection to the First World War, his importance \nin our collective psyche grew with each passing year. He seemed \nimpossibly stubborn and tough and his long and wonderful life made him \nall the more special.\n  Towards the end of his life, more and more people understood just how \nprivileged we all were to keep company with the last surviving \nDoughboy.\n  He was a link to a long ago war, not forgotten but so far in the past \nthat the pictures that we think of when we conjure up images are all \ngrainy and tattered.\n  It made it all the more amazing that Frank was the only man who could \nhonestly look any of us in the eye and say ``this is what the war was \nlike.''\n  More than 116,000 Americans died in World War I. Frank was an adamant \nproponent of remembering these heroes by establishing a National World \nWar I Memorial on the National Mall.\n  I agree and support him on that effort which is why I am the proud \nsponsor of the bipartisan bill to truly honor our World War I veterans. \nThe bill would create a commission to plan for the upcoming centennial, \nand it would rededicate the DC memorial as the DC and National World \nWar I memorial. It would also dedicate the National World War I Museum \nand Memorial in Kansas City, MO. I agree with Frank Buckles on the \nimportance of remembering our veterans and want to say again here \ntoday: I am more determined than ever to make this happen and will not \ngive up until we get that bill passed.\n  Finally, I want to extend my sympathies again to Frank's daughter, \nSusannah Buckles Flanagan. She has lovingly looked after Frank and \nhelped make sure his last years were lived with dignity and care.\n  Frank, you will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/17/senate-section/article/S1820-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING CESAR ESTRADA CHAVEZ\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I rise today to recognize the \nlife and achievements of Cesar Estrada Chavez, a man who led our nation \nin the struggle for civil rights and whose efforts helped create a \nbetter future for all Americans.\n  On March 31, 2011, we will celebrate Cesar Chavez Day to remember his \ncourageous fight for justice and the lessons he taught us about the \npower people have when they join together to face the challenges before \nthem.\n  Colorado's Hispanic community heard that message loud and clear \nduring the days of the civil rights movement. Our State was an \nimportant stage for engaging Mexican-Americans in that time. Not only \ndid Chavez-led efforts bring better living and working conditions to \nfarm workers of all backgrounds in Colorado, from the Eastern Plains to \nthe San Luis Valley and the Western Slope, but this movement also \nignited service veterans, students and community leaders in Colorado to \nchampion a cause that promoted equality, justice and empowerment. \nLeaders like Colorado's own Rodolfo ``Corky'' Gonzales, who as a young \nstudent labored in the beet fields and later became a respected poet \nand leader in the civil rights movement, joined an effort to speak for \nthose who felt they had no voice and empowered those who felt helpless. \nGonzales found strength in youth empowerment, and he dedicated his life \nto helping Hispanic youth in Colorado and the Southwest realize their \nvalue in their communities. The legacy of these leaders can be seen \ntoday in the many organizations that grew from this movement and which \ncontinue to inspire youth and veterans of all backgrounds to develop \ntheir talents and skills for a brighter future.\n  Our Western heritage is richer for the hard fought contributions of \nRodolfo Gonzalez, Cesar Chavez and others. These figures drew on their \ndetermination and hard work to cultivate a more informed youth and sow \nthe seeds of civil justice in the West. Chavez embodied an unparalleled \ncommitment to millions who worked the land to provide for their \nfamilies and for a growing country. With his father unable to work, \nChavez himself labored in the fields to support his family and provide \na better life for them. He worked under poor conditions and earned low \nwages, facing the same struggles as so many migrant workers. Chavez's \nstory serves as a testament to a community searching for justice. It \nwas his resolute leadership that brought national attention to the \nunacceptable working conditions and unfair pay faced by farm workers in \nthe West and across America.\n  Through nonviolent protest, Chavez mobilized and improved the lives \nof millions, and he is a role model for Coloradans, and all Americans. \nThis March, communities throughout Colorado will once again come \ntogether to honor his legacy and the continued fight for justice. \nToday, I am proud to rise on behalf of Coloradans, to honor those \ncontinuing his work and to acknowledge Chavez and the vision captured \nin his own uniting words, ``We have seen the future, and the future is \nours.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/17/senate-section/article/S1820-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO STEVEN J. GOOLS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenator Levin to pay tribute to Stephen J. Gools, a tireless champion \nof causes important to senior citizens and an agent of positive social \nchange throughout his long and distinguished career. Indeed, there are \nmany across Michigan that have benefited greatly from his many efforts \nover the years.\n  Since March 2000, Steve has served as director of the AARP Michigan \nState Office in Lansing, leading a team of 11 staff and serving more \nthan 1.4 million AARP members in the Great Lakes State. Under his \nleadership, AARP Michigan has been enormously successful in protecting \nconsumers, championing the rights of those over the age of 50 in \ncommunities across our State and helping AARP members live their lives \nto the fullest. His innovative volunteer training and development \nconferences have served as the gold standard for State management \nwithin AARP.\n  Prior to joining AARP, Steve served as communications director for \nthe Michigan Democratic Party and held senior management positions with \nMichigan candidates. Steve worked for me as my communications director \nand played an instrumental role in electing me to Congress. In \naddition, he worked for the bipartisan Northeast-Midwest Congressional \nCoalition and the U.S. House Budget Committee Task Force on Community \nand Natural Resources.\n  Throughout his professional career, Steve has been a role model and \nshining example of leadership, intellectual curiosity, courage and \ndetermination. He always met his responsibilities with warmth, humor, \nand infectious enthusiasm.\n  To honor his work and leadership, AARP has announced the \nestablishment of the Stephen J. Gools Award for Social Change. The \nannual award will recognize a Michigan individual or organization that \ndemonstrates outstanding achievement in improving the lives of the 50+ \npopulation in our State.\n  It is most fitting that the award will bear the name of a man who has \nchampioned the causes of justice, compassion, and equality throughout \nhis life. The award will encourage and recognize those who seek to \nfollow in his footsteps.\n  We are grateful to him, his wife Kimberly, and his family for the \nwork he has done for the people of Michigan and our country. He has had \na lasting impact on the lives of many, and we honor his dedicated \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/17/senate-section/article/S1820-3", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1820-S1821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOHN RHYNO\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, I rise today to \nrecognize John Rhyno of North Attleboro,\n\n[[Page S1821]]\n\nMA. John is a community leader with an innate sense of right and wrong \nand the courage to put it into action.\n  Some people decide they should help those in need. Some people do it \nas part of a company or religious group's volunteer day. Then there are \nthe quiet heroes and unsung patriots like John, for whom helping others \nis simply part of who they are.\n  I met John during my first campaign for Massachusetts State Senate in \n2003. He is the son of a World War II veteran, John Sr., who returned \nfrom the war to work as a jeweler, when that industry still had a \ncommanding presence in the Attleboros. In addition to working long \nhours herself, John's mother was devoted to caring for her husband and \ntheir only son. The values John learned at home were reinforced in his \ncommunity through the YMCA, Boy Scouts, church, and school sports.\n  As a boy, John did yard work, shoveled snow, fixed cars and did other \nodd jobs, contributing much of the money he earned to his parents to \nhelp make ends meet. His wife Sherry tells the story of a Christmas \nwhen a young John Rhyno surprised his parents by purchasing a tank full \nof heating oil from W.H. Riley & Co., a practice he continued over the \nyears. Even though it was for his own home, the experience planted the \nseed within John that those closest to those in need know best how to \nhelp them through tight times. I will talk more about this in a moment.\n  At a young age, John demonstrated that doing what is right often \nrequires as much courage and toughness as it does compassion. He would \nregularly stand up to bullies, even when they were picking on kids he \nhardly knew. John was also a talented athlete and excelled on North \nAttleboro High School's football field and in other varsity sports. As \nan adult, John coached local Catholic Youth Organization basketball \nteams.\n  After graduating from NAHS, he took night classes at Wentworth \nInstitute and Fisher College, earning college degrees in automotive \ntechnology and business while working full-time managing the repair \ngarage, motor pool, and snow removal for a local manufacturing plant. A \ndevoted employee, John quickly assumed a good deal of responsibility. \nAfter more than a decade on the job, new management took over. One day, \nhis new boss called him into his office and told John that to save \nmoney, John would have to lay off a subordinate. He refused. Taken \naback, his boss explained in not-so-subtle terms the finer points of \ninsubordination and its consequences. John got the message and did the \nonly thing that seemed right to him. He quit, saving his subordinates \njob.\n  Within a few weeks, John and a friend hung a shingle at 675 East \nWashington Street in North Attleboro. Thirty years later, ``John & Ed's \nGarage'' remains a successful local business.\n  John Rhyno saw local public office as an opportunity to advocate for \nhis friends and neighbors. He won his first race for North Attleboro \nSelectman in 2000. John and Sherry use the term ``office'' very \nbroadly. Open office hours take place at the couple's home, where they \nencourage constituents to share their concern and ideas for making \ntheir community a better place to live, learn, work and play.\n  During the unusually hot summer of 2005, many local seniors on fixed \nincomes expressed concern over how they would afford the rising energy \ncosts. John recalled how he was able to help his own parents decades \nearlier with much needed home heating oil and together with Sherry, a \nprofessional artist who retired from UMass Boston after 30 years in \nsenior management, founded Neighbors Helping Neighbors. In the 6 years \nsince they started the 501(c)(3) community assistance fund, it has \nraised and donated over $100,000 by and for the people of North \nAttleboro to help pay for home heating or just make ends meet until \nthey get their feet on the ground. One hundred percent of all donations \ngo directly to those in need through a voucher system--no red tape, \nbureaucracy, delays, overhead or excuses. There's no better proof than \nNeighbors Helping Neighbors that those closest to a problem are often \nin the best position to devise solutions.\n  The Rhynos still open their home for office hours, though local \nresidents also know they can always just drop by John & Ed's Garage \nwhen they have got a concern. About to begin his twelfth year on the \ntown's Board of Selectmen, John is known as an accessible commonsense \nproblem solver who always seeks citizen input, often taking out \nnewspaper surveys to gauge local opinion.\n  Residents are so accustomed to his sincerity it seems only his \nclosest friends can tell when he is joking. One Easter Sunday, John and \nSherry drove to inspect a local family's historic stone wall that the \ntown had slated for removal. With the homeowner at a town board meeting \non the issue a few weeks later, John decided to have a little fun. \nDoing his best to keep a straight face, John passionately told \ncolleagues and residents of how as a boy visiting the town's historic \nWoodcock Garrison House, he heard the story of how townspeople stood on \na stone wall with buckets of water for Paul Revere's horse on his \nhistoric midnight ride. John expected that his obvious tall tale would \nbring a few much needed laughs to the otherwise dry meeting. Instead, \nthe board bought it hook, line and sinker and gave unanimous consent to \nsave the wall.\n  On March 21, 2011, John Rhyno will receive the North Attleboro/\nPlainville Rotary Club's top honors: the Distinguished Service Award \nfor Outstanding Citizen for his lifetime of advocacy for his community. \nI join them in honoring John and extend my own heartfelt thanks for his \nfriendship counsel and his selfless dedication to his community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/17/senate-section/article/S1821-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1821-S1822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO TOM COURTNEY\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, today I join my colleague Senator \nJim Risch as well as our colleague from the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, Congressman Mike Simpson, to recognize and pay tribute \nto the exceptional leadership and dedication of a great Idaho public \nservant, Mr. Tom Courtney, city manager of Twin Falls, ID. Tom has \nserved the citizens of Twin Falls with distinction for almost 34 years. \nInitially hired as assistant city manager in 1977, he was promoted to \ncity manager in 1980 where he continues to serve until his upcoming \nretirement on March 31, 2011. During Tom's tenure, the city saw \ntremendous growth and expansion as it transited from a predominantly \nagriculture-based economy to a manufacturing-based economy. Foreseeing \nthese changes, Tom was instrumental in restructuring city government \nroles and functions to better serve the individual and the greater good \nof the community. Originally from California, Tom received his master's \nand bachelor degree from Utah State University and briefly worked for \nthe city of Tracey, CA, and Stockton, CA, before coming to Idaho.\n  Tom's management and leadership style closely reflects the motto of \nthe city of Twin Falls: ``People serving People.'' Tom has proven his \nleadership through his philosophy and actions. As a 40-year member of \nthe International City/County Managers Association he has mentored many \nyoung leaders. Tom embodies the philosophy of servant leadership: Truly \neffective leaders go one step further and focus on service to those in \ntheir own organization, ensuring they are prepared, confident and \nempowered to reach their goals. These leaders create caring communities \ncharacterized by collaboration, trust and teamwork. Through his \nleadership, the city of Twin Falls has been managed with fiscal \nresponsibility and an unwavering sense of ethics and integrity.\n  Tom's commitment to the city should not be overshadowed by his love \nand dedication to his wife Mary and three children, Mike, Amy and Ryan, \nand six grandchildren, Mathew, Courtney, Hailey, Jack, Nathan and \nQuinn. While very much engaged in his family's lives and activities, \nTom's retirement will give Mary and him more opportunities to be full-\ntime grandparents.\n  It is hard to live in Idaho for so many years and not develop a \npassion for its beauty and outdoors. True to his commitment to enjoy \nlife to its fullest extent, Tom is an avid backpacker and fisherman. We \nhope he is planning on many more days of hiking in the Sawtooth \nMountains and fishing for steelhead in the Salmon River. Besides a \ndedicated outdoor enthusiast, Tom is a devoted runner who has completed \nnumerous marathons in Idaho and\n\n[[Page S1822]]\n\nthroughout the West. His dedication to running provided the opportunity \nto achieve a personal highlight, serving as a torch bearer for the 2002 \nSalt Lake City Olympic Winter Games.\n  It is with great pride and admiration that I, Senator Risch, and \nCongressman Simpson thank Tom Courtney for his unselfish service and \ndedication to the city of Twin Falls and the great State of Idaho. We \nwish him a happy and productive retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/17/senate-section/article/S1822-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO GENERAL STEVEN R. DOOHEN\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam President, today I pay \ntribute to MG Steven R. Doohen, who will be retiring at the end of the \nmonth as adjutant general for the South Dakota National Guard.\n  General Doohen joined the South Dakota Air National Guard in January \n1971, later receiving his commission from the Academy of Military \nSciences at McGhee Tyson, TN. He graduated from the University of Sioux \nFalls in 1987 with a bachelor of arts in organizational behavior \nmanagement. Over the course of his distinguished 40-year career, \nGeneral Doohen has become highly decorated and amassed more than 4,500 \nhours of tactical flight time.\n  General Doohen was appointed adjutant general of the South Dakota \nNational Guard on September 16, 2007, by then-Governor M. Michael \nRounds. In this role, General Doohen oversees 4,400 Air and Army \nNational Guard citizen soldiers and airmen, in addition to 950 Federal \nand State employees. General Doohen has also served in the Governor's \ncabinet as the Secretary of Military and Veteran Affairs.\n  South Dakota's Army National Guard ranks No. 2 in the Nation in \nrecruiting and retention of soldiers, largely due to General Doohen's \ndrive and eagerness to serve our State. The South Dakota Army and Air \nNational Guard have always produced and provided highly skilled, \nprofessional, and dedicated citizen soldiers and airmen. Their skills \nand expertise have complemented our Nation's military efforts, both \noverseas and on the homefront, and assisted South Dakota's efforts when \nfighting natural disasters. Another result of producing such great \nsoldiers and airmen has been the ongoing development of great leaders \nfor both the Army and Air National Guard, and that has been reflected \nin the expert oversight and leadership of General Doohen.\n  Under General Doohen's leadership, the South Dakota Army National \nGuard has deployed over 3,000 soldiers in support of military \noperations in the Middle East. General Doohen and I share a commitment \nto the family members of our military and know how deployments impact \nthe entire family. He ensures that mobilizations, as well as welcome-\nhome ceremonies, are the best possible, bringing the Governor, \ncongressional delegation, and community members together to honor our \nNational Guard. General Doohen also makes sure all soldiers and airmen \nhave access to the best chaplains and family readiness professionals. \nHis leadership in these areas has meant a lot to the men and women of \nour National Guard and their families.\n  In addition to the contributions General Doohen has made to the State \nof South Dakota, his wife Gloria has also played a vital role in \nsupporting our service men and women and their families. She has \nspearheaded efforts to send thousands of care packages to deployed \nSouth Dakotans over the past decade and led efforts to recognize and \nhonor the greatest sacrifice of our South Dakota men and women through \nthe Fallen Heroes Banner project. I thank her for her advocacy and work \nalongside General Doohen.\n  I commend General Doohen for the work and many years of service he \nhas given the State of South Dakota and our Nation. General Doohen \nclearly cares deeply about each member of the South Dakota National \nGuard, and it shows in his every action. His dedicated service to our \ngrateful Nation will not be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/17/senate-section/article/S1822-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MARY JO MAY\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam President, today I wish to \npublicly commend Mary Jo May of Kyle, SD, on her impressive research \nand dedication to the preservation of Native American service members' \nhistory.\n  Mary Jo May, a student at Black Hills State University, was a proud \nparticipant in the prestigious Washington Internship for Native \nStudents, WINS, program. While in Washington, DC, Mary Jo worked at the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs to preserve the great history of Native \nAmerican service members through detailed research and analysis. She \nconducted research at the Library of Congress, the National Archives, \nthe Women's Memorial Archives, and many other museums.\n  Through her research, the VA produced an exhibit detailing the \nstories and groundbreaking actions of several Native American service \nwomen, including the challenges and hardships the women overcame to \nachieve greatness in their military careers. Mary Jo's exhibit was \nselected for display at the Women's Memorial at Arlington National \nCemetery and soon will be displayed at the Smithsonian Institute's \nNational Museum of the American Indian.\n  Mary Jo was awarded the Gates Millennium Scholarship for her academic \nachievement, community involvement, and leadership ability. Mary Jo's \ngoal is to bring her exhibit and research to South Dakota and have it \nbe displayed at the VA Black Hills Health Care System in Hot Springs \nand Sturgis. She hopes to someday share her passion for learning as a \nteacher.\n  It is with great honor that I share her impressive accomplishments \nwith my colleagues.

She has provided oversight for numerous changes at the \nfacility, and she and her staff have provided great service to veterans \nand their families as well as South Dakota veterans organizations. She \nhas initiated many opportunities to recognize veterans, including the \ntraditional Memorial Day and Four Chaplains Services. She also oversaw \nthe Unaccompanied Veterans Memorial Service, in which veterans with no \nsurviving family members are honored in a special service.\n  Sara's greatest efforts have been overseeing the daily tasks of \nmaintaining the grounds and gravesites of the thousands of veterans and \nfamily members interred at the Black Hills National Cemetery, as well \nas counseling family members in times of grief and working to \nfacilitate the burials of veterans when issues arise with discharge and \neligibility.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for the coverage of marriage and family therapist services and \nmental health counselor services under part B of the Medicare program, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President. I am honored to join my colleague from \nWyoming, Senator John Barrasso, in introducing a bill essential to \nenhancing the delivery of mental health services to our senior \ncitizens, The Seniors Mental Health Access Improvement Act of 2011. We \nare pleased to be joined by Sens. Sherrod Brown, Inouye, Tim Johnson, \nBegich, and Durbin in this effort.\n  Currently, there are limitations on the types of mental health \npractitioners who may be reimbursed for services in the Medicare \nprogram. Our legislation permits mental health counselors and marriage \nand family therapists to bill Medicare for their services, and it pays \nthem at the rate of clinical social workers. With this legislation, \nseniors will have more opportunities as part of their Medicare benefit \nto access professional mental health counseling assistance.\n  Throughout the United States there are approximately 77 million older \nadults living in 3,000 so-called ``mental health profession shortage \nareas.'' Moreover, 50 percent of rural counties have no practicing \npsychiatrists or psychologists. Seniors living in these areas will be \nthe primary beneficiaries of our efforts.\n  Mental health counselors and marriage and family therapists are often \nthe only mental health providers in some communities, and yet presently \nthey are not recognized within the Medicare program appropriately. \nThese therapists have equivalent or greater training, education and \npractice rights as some existing provider groups that can bill for \ntheir services through Medicare.\n  Additionally, other government agencies, including The National \nHealth Service Corp, the Veteran's Administration and TRICARE, already\n\n[[Page S1830]]\n\nrecognize these mental health professionals and reimburse for their \nservices. We need to utilize the skills of these providers and ensure \nthat seniors have access to them. These professionals play a critical \nrole in the delivery of our nation's mental health care.\n  In Oregon, the passage of this legislation will focus the talents of \nover 2,000 additional, qualified providers on the mental health issues \nof one of our most vulnerable populations. This represents a common \nsense approach to relieving a persistent and chronic healthcare \nworkforce shortage.\n  I would also like to take a moment to recognize the contributions of \none of our former colleagues in the Senate who led our efforts in the \nlast Congress to pass similar legislation. Sen. Blanche Lincoln was a \nstrong advocate for health policies that benefited seniors and those in \nrural areas. This bill is a testament to her decade long commitment to \nthese issues and her unflagging support for those in need of mental \nhealth care in underserved areas.\n  Finally, I commend our mental health professionals nationwide, for \ntheir dedicated work and efforts, and I encourage passage of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I am honored to join my colleague from \nOregon, Senator Ron Wyden, to introduce the Seniors Mental Health \nAccess Improvement Act. For over a decade, Senator Wyden has been a \nstrong voice advocating for rural specific health care policies here in \nthe United States Senate. I am proud to join him as we fight to ensure \nMedicare patients living in rural and frontier states have access to \nand choice of mental health professionals.\n  The Seniors Mental Health Access Improvement Act would permit \nMarriage and Family Therapists and Licensed Professional Counselors to \nbill Medicare directly for services. These providers would receive 75 \npercent of the psychiatrist and psychologist rate for the same \nservices. I want my colleagues to know that this legislation does not \nexpand covered Medicare services. It would simply give Medicare \npatients living in isolated, frontier States like Wyoming more mental \nhealth provider choices.\n  Today, approximately 75 percent of the over 3,000 nationally \ndesignated Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas are located in \nrural areas. Over half of all rural counties have no mental health \nservices of any kind. Frontier counties have even more drastic numbers \nas 95 percent do not have a psychiatrist, 68 percent do not have a \npsychologist and 78 percent do not have a social worker.\n  Virtually all of Wyoming is designated a mental health professional \nshortage area. Wyoming has approximately 215 psychologists, 37 \npsychiatrists and 418 clinical social workers for a total of 670 \nMedicare eligible mental health providers. Enactment of the Seniors \nMental Health Access Improvement Act would almost double the number of \nmental health providers available to treat seniors in my State--with \nthe addition of 659 licensed professional counselors and 83 marriage \nand family therapists currently licensed to practice.\n  Medicare patients in Wyoming are often forced to travel long \ndistances to see mental health providers currently recognized by the \nMedicare program. To make matters worse, rural and frontier communities \nhave extreme difficulty recruiting and retaining providers, especially \nmental health providers. In many small towns, a Licensed Professional \nCounselor or a Marriage and Family Therapist is the only mental health \ncare provider in the area. Medicare law--as it exists today--only \ncompounds the situation because psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, \nclinical social workers, and clinical nurse specialists are the only \nproviders able to bill Medicare for mental health services.\n  It is time the Medicare program recognized the qualifications of \nLicensed Professional Counselors and Marriage and Family Therapists. \nThey play a critical role in the Nation's mental health care delivery \nsystem. These providers go through rigorous training, similar to the \ncurriculum of a masters level social worker, and yet are excluded from \nthe Medicare program.\n  I believe this bill is critically important to the health and well-\nbeing of our nation's seniors, and I strongly urge all my colleagues to \nbecome a cosponsor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Hatch, Ms. \n        Klobuchar, Mr. Manchin, Mrs. Hagan, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 605. A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act to place \nsynthetic drugs in Schedule I; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, all too often we learn of new and \nemerging drug threats to our communities that often have a huge \nnegative impact on our youth. When these drug threats emerge it is \ncrucial that we unite to halt the spread of the problem before it \nconsumes families and communities.\n  Today we are confronted with new and very dangerous substances \npackaged as innocent products. Specifically, more and more kids are \nable to go online or to the nearest novelty store at the local shopping \nmall and purchase incense laced with compounds that seriously alter the \nmind. These products are commonly referred to as ``K2''or ``Spice'' \namong other names. Although these products contain a label that states \nthat the product is not for human consumption, kids and drug users are \nsmoking these products in order to obtain a ``legal high.''\n  It is believed that these products emerged on the scene beginning \nabout 4 or 5 years ago and their use spread quickly throughout Europe. \nAccording to a study conducted by the European Centre for Drugs and \nDrug Addiction, most of the chemical compounds found in ``K2'' are not \nreported on the label. This study concluded that the compounds are not \nlisted because there is a deliberate marketing strategy to represent \nthis product as a natural substance.\n  However, these products are anything but natural. Most of the \nchemical compounds the Drug Enforcement Administration has identified \nwithin K2 products were invented by Dr. John W. Huffman of Clemson \nUniversity in the 1990's for research purposes. These compounds were \nnever intended to be used for any other purpose than research. Dr. \nHuffman developed these compounds to further understand endocannabinoid \nreceptors in the body. They were only tested on mice and never tested \non humans. No long term effects of their use are currently known.\n  As more and more people are experimenting with K2 it is becoming \ncompletely evident that their use is anything but safe. The American \nAssociation of Poison Control Centers reports significant increases in \nthe amount of calls concerning these products. There were only 13 calls \nrelated to K2 use reported for 2009, but there were over 1,000 calls \nconcerning K2 use in 2010. Common effects reported by emergency room \ndoctors include: increased agitation, elevated heart rate and blood \npressure, hallucinations, and seizures. Effects from the highs from \nthese synthetic drugs are reported to last as few as several hours and \nas long as one week. Dr. Huffman stated that since so little research \nhas been conducted on these compounds that using any one of them would \nbe like, ``playing Russian roulette.''\n  In fact, Dr. Anthony Scalzo, a professor of emergency medicine at St. \nLouis University, reports that the compounds are significantly more \npotent than the active ingredients of marijuana. Dr. Scalzo states that \nwhat is troubling is the fact that the amount of compounds varies from \nproduct to product so no one can be sure exactly the amount of the drug \nthey are putting in their body. Dr. Scalzo states that this can lead to \nsignificant problems such as altering of mind, addiction, injury, and \neven death.\n  According to various news articles across the nation, K2 can cause \nserious erratic and criminal behavior. In Mooresville, Indiana police \narrested a group of teens after they were connected to a string of \nburglaries while high on K2. Another case in Honolulu, Hawaii shows \npolice arrested a 23-year-old man after he tried to throw his \ngirlfriend off an 11th floor balcony after smoking K2. A 14-year-old \nboy in Missouri nearly threw himself out of a 5th story window after \nsmoking K2. Once the teen got over his high he denied having any \nsuicidal intentions. Doctors believe he was hallucinating at the time \nof this incident.\n  K2 use is also causing serious health problems and increased visits \nto the\n\n[[Page S1831]]\n\nemergency room. A Louisiana teen said he became very ill after trying \nK2. The teen said he experienced numbness starting at his feet and \ntraveling to his head. He was nauseous, light-headed and was having \nhallucinations. This teen stated that K2 is being passed around at \nschool and that many people were trying it without fear, assuming it \nwas safe because it was legal. A 21-year-old man, from Greenfield, \nIndiana repeatedly stabbed himself in the neck while hallucinating on \nK2.\n  Regrettably, K2 use also has deadly consequences. On June 6, 2010, \nDavid Rozga, a recent 18-year-old Indianola, Iowa high school graduate \nsmoked a package of K2 along with his friends before going to a concert \nthinking it was harmless fun. According to his parents, David and his \nfriends purchased this product at a mall in Des Moines after hearing \nabout it from some college students who were home for the summer. After \nsmoking this product, David's friends reported that David became highly \nagitated and terrified. When he got home, he found a family shotgun and \ncommitted suicide approximately 90 minutes after smoking K2. The \nIndianola police believe David was under the influence of K2 at the \ntime of his death. David's parents and many in the community who knew \nDavid were completely shocked and saddened by this event. David was \nlooking forward to starting his college career at the University of \nNorthern Iowa in the fall. As a result, the Iowa Pharmacy Board placed \nan emergency ban on K2 products in Iowa beginning on July 21, 2010. A \npermanent ban is currently being considered in the legislature.\n  David's tragic death may have been the first case in the United \nStates of synthetic drug use leading to someone's death, but sadly it \nwas only the beginning. A month after David's tragic death, police \nreport that a 28-year-old Middletown, Indiana mother of two passed away \nafter smoking a lethal dose of K2. This woman's godson reported that \nanyone could get K2 easily because it can be sold to anybody at any \nprice at any time. This last August, a recent 19-year-old Lake \nHighlands High School graduate in Dallas, TX, passed away after smoking \nK2. The medical examiner confirmed that this boy had K2 in his system \nat the time of his death. Even more disturbing is the involvement of \nsynthetic drugs in a recent school shooting that occurred in Omaha, \nNebraska in January of 2011. Robert Butler, Jr. shot and killed himself \nand Dr. Vicki Kaspar, the assistant principal at the school. Doctors \nhave confirmed that Robert Butler had K2 in his system at the time of \nthe shooting.\n  These incidents throughout the country give me great concern that \nsynthetic drug use, especially K2 use, is a dangerous and growing \nproblem. Many states, including Iowa, have acted to ban the sale and \npossession of the chemical compounds found in these products. Many more \nstates, counties and communities throughout the country have proposed \nbans or are in the process of banning these products. The DEA has \nadministratively scheduled five chemicals found in K2. However, this \nban will only last for one year with an option to extend the ban for an \nadditional 6 months. There is no guarantee that the chemicals will be \npermanently banned in the timeframe allowed.\n  It is time to stop the use and trafficking of these products before \nmore tragedies occur. This is why I am pleased that my colleague, \nSenator Feinstein, is joining me in introducing the David Mitchell \nRozga Act. Although David Rozga is one victim of many from these \nterrible drugs, his tragic death highlights the damaging nature of \nthese substances and the great loss that they incur to our society. \nThis legislation will take the chemicals the DEA has identified within \nK2 products and places them as Schedule I narcotics with other deadly \ndrugs like meth and cocaine. The legislation will also amend the \nControlled Substances Act, doubling the timeframe the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration and the Department of Health and Human Services have to \nemergency schedule substances from 18 months to 36 months. This will \nallow for dangerous substances to be quickly removed from the market \nwhile being studied for permanent scheduling. I am grateful that the \nCommunity Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, a group that represents more \nthan 5,000 local community anti-drug coalitions throughout the nation, \nis endorsing this legislation to ban these dangerous synthetic drugs \nfrom our society.\n  It is clear that the sale and use of synthetic drugs is a growing \nproblem. People believe, like David Rozga believed, these products are \nsafe because they can buy them online or at the nearest shopping mall. \nWe need to do a better job at educating the public and our communities \nabout the dangers these products present and nip this problem in the \nbud before it grows and leads to more tragedy. I urge my colleagues to \njoin us in supporting this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Merkley):\n  S. 607. A bill to designate certain land in the State of Oregon as \nwilderness, to provide for the exchange of certain Federal land and \nnon-Federal land and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Recources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce Wilderness \nlegislation to protect two of Oregon's natural treasures. This bill is \na reintroduction of legislation that I introduced in the last Congress \nand I am pleased that Senator Merkley is again joining me in \ncosponsoring this legislation. Significant progress was made in the \nlast Congress in moving the bill towards passage, but unfortunately it \nfailed to get passed before the Congress ended. The legislation I \nintroduce today reflects the work I undertook with the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee and the Bureau of Land Management to \nprepare the bill for markup in the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee.\n  The Cathedral Rock and Horse Heaven Wilderness Act of 2011 will do \nmore than simply protect these areas. It will also help Oregon's \neconomy, because visitors from all over the world come to my State to \nexperience first-hand the unique scenic beauty of place like the lands \npreserved by this bill.\n  This legislation will consolidate what is currently a splintered \nownership of land in this area and protect 17,340 acres of new \nWilderness along the Lower John Day River. This is even more Wilderness \nthan originally in the legislation I introduced in the last Congress. \nThanks to an additional land exchange it was possible to add additional \nlands to the Wilderness proposal. The fractured land ownership in this \narea makes it difficult for visitors to fully appreciate these areas \nwhen they hike, fish or hunt there because of the scattered and \nmisunderstood lines of private and public ownership. This bill will \nsolve that problem and make these lands more inviting to visitors while \ngiving the landowners more contiguous property to call home.\n  The area in question is stunning. The Cathedral Rock and Horse Heaven \nWilderness proposals encompass dramatic basalt cliffs and rolling hills \nof juniper, sagebrush and native grasses. These new areas build on the \ndesert Spring Basin Wilderness that was established last Congress as a \nresult of legislation I introduced, and are located directly across the \nJohn Day River from Spring Basin.\n  With 500 miles of undammed waters, the John Day River is the second-\nlongest free-flowing river in the continental United States and is a \nplace that is cherished by Oregonians. The Lower John Day Wild and \nScenic River offers world-class opportunities for outdoor recreation as \nwell as crucial wildlife habitat for elk, mule deer, bighorn sheep and \nnative fish such as salmon and steelhead trout. Through land \nconsolidation between public and private landowners, this bill will \nallow for better management and easier public access for this important \nnatural treasure. With the current fragmentation of public and private \nland ownership in the area, river campsites are limited. Many Federal \nlands among them can't be reached by the hikers, campers and other \noutdoors recreationists who could most appreciate them. With the equal-\nvalue land exchanges included in this bill, public lands would be \nconsolidated into two new Wilderness areas. This would enhance public \nsafety, improve land management, and increase public access and \nrecreational opportunities. This solution will create an incredible, \nnew heritage for public lands recreationists\n\n[[Page S1832]]\n\nwho are an important factor in keeping Oregon's economy healthy and \nthriving.\n  Rafters of the John Day River can attest to the need for more \ncampsites and public access to the Cathedral Rock area. Backcountry \nhunters will be able to scan the hillsides for elk, deer and game-birds \nwithout having to worry about accidentally trespassing on someone's \nprivate land. Anglers will be able to access nearly 5 miles of the John \nDay River that today are only reachable from privately owned lands. \nLikewise, such a solution ensures that local landowners can manage \ntheir lands effectively without running across unwitting trespassers.\n  One good example of the value of these land swaps is Young Life's \nWashington Family Ranch. This Ranch is home to a Christian youth camp \nthat welcomes over 20,000 kids to the lower John Day area each year. \nThis bill sets out private and public land boundaries that on the \nground and these boundaries create a safer area for campers on the \nRanch; this serves the children who visit the area well and ensures the \ncontinued viability of the Ranch, which, in turn, provides big economic \ndividends to the local community.\n  The Cathedral Rock and Horse Heaven Wilderness proposal is described \nas ``win-win-win'' by many stakeholders--nearly 5 miles of new river \naccess for the public and protected land for outdoor enthusiasts; \nbetter management for private landowners and public agencies; and \nimportant habitat protections for sensitive and endangered species. \nThis proposal is an example of the positive solutions that can result \nwhen varied, bipartisan interests in a community come together to craft \nsolutions that will work for everyone. All three of the counties \ninvolved in this legislation, Wheeler, Wasco and Jefferson, have \nendorsed this proposal as well as a number of user and recreation \ngroups. I especially want to thank the Oregon Natural Desert \nAssociation, Young Life and Forrest Reinhardt, and Matt Smith for their \nrole in developing this collaborative solution that will benefit all \nOregonians.\n  Oregon's wildlands play an increasingly important role in the \neconomic development of our state, especially in traditionally rural \nareas east of the Cascades. Visitors come from thousands of miles away \nto hike, fish, raft and hunt in Oregon's desert Wilderness. Beyond \ntourism, the rich quality of life and the diverse natural amenities \nthat we enjoy as Oregonians are key to attracting new businesses to \nOregon. The Cathedral Rock and Horse Heaven Wilderness areas will help \nmake sure that this rural area will enjoy the benefits that permanently \nconnecting these disparate pieces of natural landscape will bring for \ngenerations to come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 610. A bill to provide for the conveyance of approximately 140 \nacres of land in the Ouachita National Forest in Oklahoma to the Indian \nNations Council, Inc., of the Boy Scouts of America, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the Senate's \nattention H.R. 473. This is the HALE Scouts Act, and the House author \nis Congressman Dan Boren, D-Okla. I am announcing today introduction of \na companion measure in the Senate, and I look forward to working \ntowards its enactment into law in the 112th Congress.\n  This bill authorizes the U.S. Forest Service to sell, at fair-market \nvalue, 140 acres of land in Southeast Oklahoma to an Oklahoma Boy \nScouts group, the Indian Nations Council of Boy Scouts, which has a \ncamp site adjacent to this land. This campsite hosts 6,500 campers \nevery year and urgently needs the new expansion.\n  In the 110th Congress, this same bill passed the House by a vote of \n370-2 in the form of H.R. 2675. The bill gained even more support in \nthe 111th Congress passing through the House by a vote of 388-0 as H.R. \n310. CBO has written that it has no cost, and the U.S. Forest Service \ntestified before the relevant House subcommittee that it does not \noppose the bill. Much work has gone into this bill to get it to this \npoint, including hearings and House floor consideration. Senate passage \nrepresents final action necessary for its completion.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 611. A bill to provide greater technical resources to FCC \nCommissioners; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Warner, to \nreintroduce legislation that provides greater technical resources to \nthe Commissioners of the Federal Communications Commission. Such \nresources are essential to making sound regulatory decisions and being \na more effective technical agency--especially in this era of rapid \ninnovation in the industries under the Commission's jurisdiction.\n  Specifically, the FCC Technical Expertise Capacity Heightening or \n``FCC TECH'' Act would allow Commissioners'' to appoint a staff \nmember--an electrical engineer or computer scientist--to provide in-\ndepth technical consultation, and commission a study by the National \nAcademy of Sciences on the technical policy decision-making process and \nthe availability of technical personnel at FCC. The study would include \nan examination of the FCC's technical policy decision-making, current \ntechnical personnel staffing levels, and agency recruiting and hiring \nprocesses of technical staff and engineers, and make specific \nrecommendations to improve these areas.\n  Over the past several years, I have shared the concerns voiced by the \ntechnical community and even some Commissioners themselves about the \nlack of technical resources and expertise at the FCC. Such concern is \nwarranted. In 1948, the FCC had 720 engineers on staff; today, it has \nfewer than 270--an astonishing 63 percent reduction--even though the \nFCC now must face more technical issues concerning the Internet, \nadvanced wireless communications, commercial cable & satellite \nindustries, and broadband. It should be noted that engineering staff \ncurrently only accounts for a dismally low 14 percent of the FCC's \nworkforce--in 1948 that figure was more than 50 percent.\n  A December 2009 report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO-\n10-79) provides additional evidence of the need for this legislation. \nThe GAO concluded that ``weaknesses in FCC's processes for collecting \nand using information also raise concerns regarding the transparency \nand informed nature of FCC's decision-making process.'' Furthermore, \nthe report found the ``FCC faces challenges in ensuring it has the \nexpertise needed to adapt to a changing market place.''\n  So in a time when citizens are demanding more effective and efficient \ngovernment and zero government waste, taking such steps as prescribed \nby this legislation will ensure the FCC is adequately equipped legally \nand technically to properly craft policy. It should be noted this \nlegislation does not require new staff--it just makes better use of \nthem. In addition, streamlining FCC processes and rulemakings will make \nsure the Commission keeps pace with the dynamics of the industry it \noversees, which is important in order for U.S. companies to continue to \nbe competitive in this global economy.\n  In a letter I wrote to Chairman Genachowski last year, I highlighted \nseveral outstanding spectrum proceedings that I urged the Commission to \nconclude. The proceedings I mentioned had a common characteristic that \nconcerned me--all of them had been open for three years or longer, and \nanother related proceeding had been pending for well over a decade. \nThis regulatory delay and uncertainty due to the Commission's inaction \nadversely affects American businesses, which request technical waivers \nor file petitions to better compete domestically and internationally, \nand suppresses innovation and the jobs associated with it. We must make \nsure the Commission is a catalyst to innovation and jobs, not an \ninhibitor.\n\n  Even the general public is aware of the significant technical deficit \nthat exists at the Commission and the importance of increasing its \ntechnical aptitude--one of the top public recommendations on the FCC's \nreform website, reboot.fcc.gov, is to ``require at least one FCC \nCommissioner to be an engineer.''\n  This Administration has stressed the importance of innovation being a \nvital component in our economic recovery, so allowing a shortage of \ntechnical\n\n[[Page S1833]]\n\nstaff to exist at an agency responsible for regulating very technical \nindustries that will be the main drivers for innovation is \ncounterintuitive. The President has also placed a major emphasis on \nscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics, STEM, education in \norder to enhance our nation's competitiveness and economic wellbeing in \nthe global economy yet, engineers only constitute 14 percent of the \nFCC's workforce and, it is my understanding, there is only one engineer \nin a senior management role at the Commission today--the government's \ntechnical expert agency.\n  This legislation enhances technical resources at the FCC so it will \nbe better equipped and more agile to address the ever-changing \ntechnical landscape from a regulatory perspective. If it isn't, our \nnation's technical leadership in this area will continue to erode and \nit will be even more difficult to lay the proper policy foundation \nnecessary to meet future telecommunications needs. It is also an \nessential component to execute the FCC's recently released National \nBroadband Plan, which includes several technically complex initiatives.\n  Last Congress, several technical organizations expressed support for \nthe legislation--the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, \nSociety of Broadcast Engineers, Association for Computing Machinery, \nand the Association of Federal Communications Consulting Engineers. \nAlso, prominent individuals in this field, such as Vint Cerf, and \nformer Senior FCC Technical Officials Dale Hatfield, Dave Farber, and \nRobert Powers support the legislation.\n  In the past, Chairman Genachowski has stated ``the country expects \nthe FCC to be an expert agency.'' Being an expert agency starts with \nhaving the technical expertise to comprehensively understand and \nexamine the issues that are within its jurisdiction and also acting on \nthose issues in a timely manner. If it doesn't, our nation's technical \nleadership in telecommunications could continue to erode due to \nregulatory bottlenecks that are created at the Commission from \nunresolved proceedings and petitions. Removing the bottlenecks that \nexist through streamlining processes and removing bureaucracy will \nreduce government expenses and waste over the long term.\n  This bill takes steps toward properly addressing glaring technical \ndeficiencies at the Commission, which left unaddressed could continue \nto hamper American innovation and competitiveness. This is absolutely \ncritical given how rapidly technologies are changing and the \nimplications that regulation could have on the underlying technical \ncatalysts of innovation. That is why I sincerely hope that my \ncolleagues join Senator Warner and me in supporting this critical \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Merkley):\n  S. 612. A bill to amend the Energy Policy and Confirmation Act to \nrequire the Secretary of Energy to develop and implement a strategic \npetroleum demand response plan to reduce the consumption of petroleum \nproducts by the Federal Government; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation with \nSenator Merkley that will provide the President of the United States \nwith emergency powers to aggressively reduce the Federal Government's \ndemand for energy.\n  The Strategic Petroleum Demand Response Act will be an additional \ntool to address rapidly rising energy prices by reducing our country's \ndemand for oil. The political instability in the Middle East reminds us \nthat this region, which holds the largest reserves of oil in the world, \nhas had profound implications on our country's economy by dramatically \naffecting the price of oil. Although the attention has been on \npotential supply disruption, our country also consumes nearly 17 \nmillion barrels of oil per day and through aggressive measures the \nFederal Government can lead our country in reducing its energy bill, \ncurtailing its consumption of oil, and reducing the price of oil for \nconsumers.\n  As we encounter these price spikes, some have called for a release of \noil from our country's strategic petroleum reserve. The fact is prior \nto releasing our country's strategic reserves we must develop policies \nthat prioritize the Federal Government's consumption of these critical \noil supplies. The Federal Government can reduce nonemergency travel, \nreduce congestion on the roads by providing flexible work hours, \ndecrease the use of oil in heating and cooling buildings, and work with \nlocal and state governments to cut consumption as well. We must develop \na strategic petroleum strategy that reflects the fact that prices are \ndictated by both supply and demand and the Strategic Petroleum Demand \nResponse Act will address the demand side of the equation.\n  Since the start of the year the price for West Texas Intermediate has \nincreased by 16 percent and the week of February 28 encountered the \nsecond highest net increase in gasoline prices in our country's \nhistory. While I strongly believe that we need to develop specific \nlong-term strategies that build on the success of fuel economy \nstandards and reduce our consumption of oil, this legislation will \nallow the President to take immediate and decisive action to address \nany energy crisis through both supply and demand.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. Sanders):\n  S. 613. A bill to amend the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct to permit a prevailing party in an action or proceeding brought to \nenforce the Act to be awarded expert witness fees and certain other \nexpenses; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, ensuring that all students, regardless of \nbackground or ability, receive an education that gives them the \nopportunity to live a successful and fulfilling life has always been a \nmajor focus of my career in public service. To achieve this goal, I \nhave fought especially hard for students with disabilities to have \naccess to the general education curriculum and the services and \nsupports they need to succeed, and to safeguard their rights under the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA. That is why I am \npleased to introduce the IDEA Fairness Restoration Act, which my \ncolleague Rep. Van Hollen will also be introducing in the House today. \nThis critical legislation will remove the financial barrier that \nfamilies, especially low- and middle-income families, face as they \npursue their children's rights to the free, appropriate public \neducation they deserve and are entitled to under the Fourteenth \nAmendment.\n  When Congress originally passed IDEA, we recognized the vital \nimportance of parent and school collaboration in special education and \nrequired they jointly develop an Individualized Education Plan, IEP, to \nidentify goals to promote the academic achievement of students with \ndisabilities. In general, this partnership has served students well. \nThere are, however, times when schools have not fulfilled their \nresponsibilities to provide an appropriate education. In these cases, \nIDEA provides parents the right to challenge the schools through \nmediation and due process. To make their argument, families often need \naccess to expert witnesses who can assess the student's needs and \ntestify about whether the current IEP meets those needs. These expert \nwitnesses are a resource that many families cannot afford, but without \naccess to them, families may be unable to make their case.\n  When Congress amended IDEA in 1986, it recognized the financial \nbarriers that parents face in pursuing due process to resolve \ndisagreements with their school and specified in the Conference \nCommittee Report that when the court finds in favor of the parents a \njudge could award attorney's fees, including ``reasonable expenses and \nfees of expert witnesses and the reasonable costs of any test or \nevaluation which is found to be necessary for the preparation of the \nparent or guardian's case.'' For years, parents who prevailed in \njudicial proceedings were awarded these fees, as Congress intended. But \nin 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Arlington Central School \nDistrict v. Murphy that courts could no longer award these fees because \nCongress made its intention explicit in the Conference Report rather \nthan in statute. As a result, many parents are discouraged and even \nprevented from pursuing meritorious cases to secure the rights of their \nchildren. Low- and middle-income families are particularly hard hit.\n\n[[Page S1834]]\n\n  This IDEA Fairness Restoration Act clarifies Congress' express intent \nthat parents should recover expert witness fees, as they currently can \ndo with attorneys' fees, if they prove that the school system has \nwrongfully denied their child an appropriate education as defined by \nIDEA. By including ``reasonable expenses and fees of expert witnesses \nand the reasonable costs of any test or evaluation which is found to be \nnecessary for the preparation of the parent or guardian's case'' and \nreestablishing the right of judges to award such fees to parents who \nprevail in IDEA cases, as Congress intended, this legislation will \nlevel the playing field and restore the ability of low- and middle-\nincome parents to be effective advocates for their children's \neducational needs.\n  This legislation is an essential step for protecting the rights of \nstudents with disabilities and ensuring that all families, regardless \nof their financial resources, can advocate for and protect their \nchildren's rights through due process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 614. A bill to require the Attorney General to consult with \nappropriate officials within the executive branch prior to making the \ndecision to try an unprivileged enemy belligerent in Federal Court; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with Senator \nLieberman the Securing Terrorist Intelligence Act. Last Congress, the \nSenate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee heard \ntestimony from the three top U.S. intelligence officials about the \nerrors the Federal Government made in handling the unsuccessful 2009 \nChristmas Day terrorist plot. We dodged a bullet that day when Umar \nFarouk Abdulmutallab, a Nigerian-born terrorist, failed to detonate a \nbomb on Northwest flight 253 in the skies above Detroit.\n  While critical information was not shared prior to Abdulmatallab \nboarding that plane, a significant error also was committed by U.S. \nofficials after that foreign terrorist had already been detained in \nDetroit, an error that may well have prevented the collection of \nvaluable intelligence about future terrorist threats to our country. \nThe error became clear during my questioning of the top intelligence \nofficials at the committee's hearing held in response to this failed \nattack.\n  I was stunned to learn that the decision had been made to place this \ncaptured terrorist into the U.S. civilian criminal court system after \njust 50 minutes of interrogation--and without any consultation with the \nDirector of National Intelligence, the Director of the National \nCounterterrorism Center, or the Secretary Homeland Security. That \ndecision was critical. The determination to charge Abdulmutallab in \ncivilian court likely foreclosed the collection of additional \nintelligence information. We know that the interrogation of captured \nterrorists can provide critical intelligence and save American lives, \nbut our civil justice system, as opposed to the military detention and \ntribunal system established by Congress and the President, encourages \nterrorists to ``lawyer up'' and to stop answering questions.\n  Indeed, that was what happened in the case of Abdulmutallab. He had \nprovided some valuable information to law enforcement officials \nimmediately after his capture, and we likely would have obtained more \ninformation if we had treated this foreign terrorist as an enemy \nbelligerent and had placed him in the military tribunal system. \nUnfortunately, once he was read his Miranda rights and given a lawyer \nat our expense, he was advised to cease answering questions, and that \nis exactly what he did.\n  That poor decision-making may well have prevented us from finding out \nmore of the plot's organizers, planners, financiers, logistics support, \nand other key players. In addition, we may have found out more about \nfuture plots originating in Yemen targeting American citizens--possibly \neven the thwarted October 2010 printer cartridge attacks. Good \nintelligence is critical to our ability to stop terrorist plots before \nthey are executed. We know that lawful interrogations of terrorist \nsuspects can provide valuable intelligence. Deciding to charge \nAbdulmutallab in the civilian criminal system without even consulting \nthree of our nation's top intelligence officials simply defies common \nsense.\n  It has been over a year since the arrest, and we are all very \nthankful that there has not been a successful terrorist attack in \nAmerica since then. We all know, however, the threat persists. That is \nwhy we must redouble our efforts and ensure that when the next \nterrorist is captured, proper action is taken so we do not miss another \nopportunity to gain valuable intelligence that could save American \nlives.\n  To correct this failure and to ensure that our nation's senior \nintelligence officials are consulted before making the decision to try \nfuture foreign terrorists in civilian court, I am reintroducing a bill \nthat would require this crucial consultation. I am very pleased to be \njoined by the Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Senator \nLieberman, who has been such a leader in this area.\n  Specifically, our bill would require the Attorney General to consult \nwith the Director of National Intelligence, the Director of the \nNational Counterterrorism Center, the Secretary of Homeland Security, \nand the Secretary of Defense before initiating a custodial \ninterrogation of foreign terrorists or filing civilian criminal charges \nagainst them. These officials are in the best position to know what \nother threats the United States is facing from terrorists and to assess \nthe need to gather more intelligence on those threats.\n  If there is a disagreement among the Attorney General and these \nintelligence officials regarding the appropriate approach to the \ndetention and interrogation of foreign terrorists, then the bill would \nrequire the President to resolve the disagreement. Only the President \nwould be permitted to direct the initiation of civilian law enforcement \nactions--balancing his constitutional responsibilities as Commander in \nChief and as the nation's chief law enforcement officer.\n  To be clear, this legislation would not deprive the President of any \ninvestigative or prosecutorial tool. It would not preclude a decision \nto charge a foreign terrorist in our military tribunal system or in our \ncivilian criminal justice system. It would simply require that the \nAttorney General coordinate and consult with our top intelligence \nofficials before making a decision that could foreclose the collection \nof critical additional intelligence information.\n  This consultation requirement is not unprecedented. Section 811 of \nthe Counterintelligence and Security Enhancements Act of 1994 requires \nthe Director of the FBI and the head of a department or agency with a \npotential spy in its ranks to consult and periodically reassess any \ndecision to leave the suspected spy in place so that additional \nintelligence can be gathered on his activities.\n  As the Senate Intelligence Committee noted in its report on the \nlegislation that added the espionage consultation requirement:\n\n       While prosecutorial discretion ultimately rests with the \n     Department of Justice officials, it stands to reason that in \n     cases designed to protect our national security--such as \n     espionage and terrorism cases--prosecutors should ensure that \n     they do not make decisions that, in fact, end up harming the \n     national security.\n\n  The committee got it right. The committee went on to explain:\n\n       [T]he determination of whether to leave a subject in place \n     should be retained by the host agency.\n\n  The history of the espionage consultation requirement is eerily \nreminiscent of the lack of consultation that occurred in the case of \nAbdulmutallab. In espionage cases, Congress has already recognized that \nwhen valuable intelligence is at stake, our national security should \ntrump decisions based solely on prosecutorial equities. This \nrequirement must be extended to the most significant security threat \nfacing our Nation--terrorism.\n  I encourage the Senate to act quickly on this important legislation. \nThe changes proposed are modest. They make common sense. But the \nconsequences of a failure to act could be a matter of life and death.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 617. A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to convey \ncertain Federal land to Elko County, Nevada, and\n\n[[Page S1835]]\n\nto take land into trust for the Te-moak Tribe of Western Shoshone \nIndians of Nevada, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Elko \nMotocross and Tribal Conveyance Act of 2011. This bill would transfer \ntwo small parcels of public land to Elko County and the Elko Indian \nColony and provide an important economic development opportunity to the \npeople of Elko County.\n  In my home State of Nevada, the Federal Government manages more than \n87 percent of the land--more than 61 million acres in all. As a result, \nour communities come to their congressional delegation for help \nremedying problems that are often handled on the state or local level \nin other parts of the country.\n  The first part of our legislation would convey approximately 300 \nacres of public land managed by the Bureau of Land Management's, BLM, \nElko Field Office to Elko County. This proposal is strongly supported \nby the local community as a way to provide for a variety of motorized \nrecreational opportunities for both residents and visitors of Elko. \nOff-highway vehicles are a popular form of recreation throughout Nevada \nand our citizens enthusiastically support safe and sustainable \nmotorized outdoor activities.\n  This legislation will help Elko County develop a centralized, \nmultipurpose recreational facility on the western edge of the City of \nElko with easy access to Interstate 80. The new park will draw OHV \nenthusiasts from across northeastern Nevada and beyond, providing a \nmuch needed economic boost to local businesses. Beyond the convenient \nlocation, economic benefits, and potential for diverse recreational \nopportunities at the proposed Elko Motocross Park site, this new \nfacility will serve as a place for people to learn responsible use and \nenjoyment of these recreational vehicles.\n  Title two of our bill would direct the Secretary of the Interior to \nexpand the Elko Indian Colony by taking approximately 373 acres of land \ninto trust for the Elko Band to address their compelling need for \nadditional land. The Elko Band is one of four constituent bands that \nmake up the Te-Moak Tribe of Western Shoshone Indians of Nevada. Each \nBand has a separate reservation or colony in northeastern Nevada. While \nthe Elko Band's population has steadily grown, their land base has \nremained the same for over 75 years.\n  The Elko Indian Colony has always been a thriving part of the greater \nElko community. When Elko was established as a railroad town in 1868, \nShoshone families lived nearby, working on the railroad as well as in \nthe nearby mines and on local ranches. Despite government efforts to \nrelocate the Elko Band in the late nineteenth century, these families \npersevered and remained in the Elko area. In 1918, President Woodrow \nWilson created the Elko Indian Colony when he reserved 160 acres for \nthe Shoshone Indians near Elko by executive order.\n  While more than half of the Te-Moak's Tribe's enrolled members \ncontinue to live and work in Elko, it is the unfortunate truth that \nover 350 tribal members must live outside of the colony. The Elko \nColony has one of the smallest land bases of the four constituent bands \nand it lacks adequate land for housing and community development. Our \nlegislation would address this need by making land available for \nresidential development and for traditional uses, such as ceremonial \ngatherings, hunting and plant collecting.\n  It is always encouraging when communities come together to support \nprojects like these and we are grateful for their collective work on \nthis effort. This bill is vital to the growing communities we serve. We \nlook forward to working with Chairman Bingaman, Ranking Member \nMurkowski and the other distinguished members of the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee to move this bill through their process.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 617\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this title.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of New Mexico:\n  S. 619. A bill to assist in the coordination among science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics efforts in the States, to \nstrengthen the capacity of elementary schools, middle schools, and \nsecondary schools to prepare students in science, technology, \nengineering, and mathematics, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, who will develop a computer \nsmall enough to fit into our eyeglasses? Who will build the first \nfully-automated, completely sustainable house or hospital? Which \ncountry will successfully test time travel?\n  I hope that it will be the United States, but I am not confident. \nWhen we compare the science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, \nsuccess of students globally, we are not in the lead.\n  The President, Congress and our business community all agree that we \nmust do better in order to compete and excel in STEM fields globally. \nIf we are going to remain competitive, we must develop and retain high-\nquality math and science teachers. We must provide those teachers with \nstrong professional development so they can develop higher-order \nthinking in their students. We must encourage higher education leaders \nto strengthen K-8 teacher education programs to provide a deeper \nunderstanding of the content knowledge necessary to teach math and \nscience. We must engage students earlier about possible careers in STEM \nfields.\n  Our economic growth and our national security depend on a workforce \nskilled in STEM fields. The demand for scientists and engineers is \nexpected to increase at four times the rate of other occupations. But \nour students just aren't performing well enough in math and science, \nand too few of them are pursuing careers in these technical fields.\n  The biggest problems we face as a global society--including problems \nwith food and water supply, safe housing, economic prosperity and \nenergy efficiency--require excellence in STEM fields. But students are \nentering our high schools without a strong foundation in STEM. And \ncolleges are not sufficiently preparing a diverse group of STEM \ngraduates to excel in graduate school and STEM careers.\n  According to the National Center for Education Statistics, about one-\nthird of fourth graders and one-fifth of eighth graders cannot perform \nbasic math computations. And U.S. high school seniors recently tested \nbelow the international average for 21 countries in mathematics and \nscience. For example, only 34 percent of fourth graders, 30 percent of \neighth graders, and 21 percent of 12th graders test ``proficient'' in \nscience on the national assessment of educational progress, or NAEP. We \nmust invest in our teachers, students and leaders to surpass students \nin the major European and Asian countries that we currently lag behind.\n  That is why today I am introducing the STEM Act, or STEM Support for \nTeachers in Education and Mentoring Act, will help us accomplish this \ngoal.\n  The STEM Act would identify best teaching practices. It would \nstrengthen networks of teachers, colleges and businesses for STEM \ncollaboration. It would create meaningful opportunities for teacher \ntraining and mentoring. The STEM Act also would establish a planning \ngrant program for states to identify STEM skills needed by the \nworkforce, and develop effective State STEM networks for communication \nand collaboration among businesses, schools teachers and \nadministrators, institutions of higher education, and nonprofit \norganizations.\n  Middle school is an important time in a student's career to be \ninspired by STEM possibilities. Our middle and high school teachers \nwant more professional development to spark this interest. To give \nteachers and schools the tools they need to encourage and prepare \nstudents for STEM careers, the STEM Act would create training programs \nusing best practice models of STEM master teachers, and provide summer \ninstitutes for current teachers and administrators to strengthen \nteacher effectiveness.\n  There are programs in my home state of New Mexico that are piloting \nsome of these initiatives. These efforts demonstrate how to increase \nteacher effectiveness to help students learn STEM subjects, and create \nopportunities for students to be inspired to pursue a STEM field.\n  The Institute for Math and Science Education, IMSE, and the STEM \nOutreach Center at New Mexico State University help coordinate Pre K-20 \nSTEM education efforts across the state and region. Faculty and staff \nin the College of Education created a network of mathematicians, \nscientists, educational researchers, and business and community leaders \nto facilitate research and outreach grants.\n  MC \\2\\--Mathematically Connected Communities is building a statewide \nlearning community of mathematics educators, mathematicians, and public \nschool leaders. MC \\2\\ offers summer mathematics academies to provide \nteachers with in-depth study of mathematics. It provides continuous \nprofessional development during the school year, helps create school \ndistrict leadership teams, and develops web-based math resources. There \nis a similar program for science, called Scientifically Connected \nCommunities, SC \\2\\.\n  The Southern New Mexico Science, Engineering, Math and Aerospace \nAcademy, SNM SEMAA, is a NASA-sponsored, after-school program for K-12 \nthat helps students who are traditionally under-represented in the \nScience, Engineering, Math, Aerospace, and Technology, SEMAT, fields. \nSEMAA engages students and their parents in inquiry-based learning and \nresearch through innovative, hands-on experience with new technologies.\n  The Chemical Olympics organizes competitions in chemistry \nexperimentation to increase interest in chemistry and the other \nsciences among secondary school students.\n  NASA Summer of Innovation is a collaboration between the New Mexico \nSpace Grant Consortium and STEM Outreach Center to prepare educators \nfrom across my state to coordinate a month-long summer camp in their \nhometowns that are designed to introduce students to inquiry-based \nscience.\n  Innovate-Educate encourages states to develop statewide networks that \nhelp create relationships and programs to advance STEM policies and \nbest practices, aligned with industry needs.\n  As a Nation, we cannot afford to lag behind other countries in \npreparing our students to succeed in science, technology, engineering \nand math. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting these STEM \ninitiatives, and preparing our teachers and students to take us into \nthe future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL:\n  S. 623. A bill to amend chapter 111 of title 28, United States Code, \nrelating to protective orders, sealing of cases, disclosures of \ndiscovery information in civil actions, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Graham to \nintroduce the Sunshine in Litigation Act of 2011, a bill that will curb \nthe ongoing abuse of secrecy orders in Federal courts. The result of \nthis abuse, which often comes in the form of sealed settlement \nagreements, is to keep important health and safety information hidden \nfrom the public. As we recognize Sunshine Week, this bipartisan, \ncommonsense measure is an important step to improving transparency in \nour\n\n[[Page S1837]]\n\ncourthouses by requiring judges to consider public health and safety \nbefore permitting secrecy agreements.\n  This problem of court secrecy has been occurring for decades, and \nmost often arises in product liability cases. Typically, an individual \nbrings a cause of action against a manufacturer for an injury or death \nthat has resulted from a defect in one of its products. The injured \nparty often faces a large corporation that can spend a virtually \nunlimited amount of money defending the lawsuit, prolonging the time it \ntakes to reach resolution. Facing a formidable opponent and mounting \nmedical bills, a plaintiff often has no choice but to settle the \nlitigation. In exchange for the award he or she was seeking, the victim \nis forced to agree to a provision that prohibits him or her from \nrevealing information disclosed during the litigation.\n  Plaintiffs get a respectable award, and the defendant is able to keep \ndamaging information from getting out. But the American public incurs \nthe loss because they remain unaware of critical public health and \nsafety information that could potentially save lives.\n  This concern about excessive secrecy is warranted by the long history \nof tobacco companies, automobile manufacturers, pharmaceutical \ncompanies, medical device manufacturers, and others settling with \nvictims and using the legal system to hide information which, if it \nbecame public, could protect the American people from future health and \nsafety harms. Surely, there are appropriate uses for such orders, like \nprotecting trade secrets and other truly confidential company \ninformation, as well as personal identifying and classified \ninformation. This legislation makes sure such information is protected. \nBut, protective orders are certainly not supposed to be used for the \nsole purpose of hiding damaging information from the public, to protect \na company's reputation or profit margin.\n  One of the most famous cases of abuse of secrecy orders involved \nBridgestone/Firestone tires. From 1992 to 2000, tread separations of \nvarious Bridgestone and Firestone tires caused accidents across the \ncountry, many resulting in serious injuries and even fatalities. \nInstead of owning up to their mistakes and acting responsibly, \nBridgestone/Firestone quietly settled dozens of lawsuits, most of which \nincluded secrecy agreements. It wasn't until 1999, when a Houston \npublic television station broke the story, that the company \nacknowledged its wrongdoing and recalled 6.5 million tires. By then, it \nwas too late. More than 250 people had died and more than 800 were \ninjured as a result of the defective tires.\n  If the story ended there, and the Bridgestone/Firestone cases were \njust an aberration, one might argue that there is no urgent need for \nlegislation. But, unfortunately, the list of abuses goes on. There is \nthe case of General Motors. Although an internal memo demonstrated that \nGM was aware of the risk of fire deaths from crashes of pickup trucks \nwith ``side saddle'' fuel tanks, an estimated 750 people were killed in \nfires involving trucks with these fuel tanks. When victims sued, GM \ndisclosed documents only under protective orders, and settled these \ncases on the condition that the information in these documents remained \nsecret. This type of fuel tank was installed for 15 years before being \ndiscontinued.\n  More recently, the world's largest automaker, Toyota, has faced a \nbarrage of litigation relating to its recall of over 8 million cars due \nto sudden unintended acceleration problems, causing more than eighty \ndeaths. After years of lawsuits, Congressional oversight hearings, and \nToyota's efforts to keep settlements and product information secret, a \nCalifornia Federal judge finally made public thousands of previously \nsealed documents, noting that ``the business of this litigation should \nbe in the public domain.'' Had a judge been required to weigh the \npublic's interest in health and safety, as this legislation would \nrequire, perhaps we would have known more about the risks sooner and \nsome of those lives could have been saved. Until we put the public \ninterest on par with the interests of private litigants, public health \nand safety will remain at risk.\n  This very issue is currently before a Federal judge in Orlando, FL. \nThere, the court is faced with deciding whether AstraZeneca can keep \nunder seal clinical studies about the harmful side effects of an \nantipsychotic drug, Seroquel. Plaintiffs' lawyers and Bloomberg News \nsued to force AstraZeneca to make public documents discovered in \ndismissed lawsuits. In 2009, the court unsealed some of the documents \nat question, but denied requests to release AstraZeneca's submissions \nto foreign regulators and sales representatives' notes on doctors' \nmeetings. Despite a recent $68.5 million settlement, continued efforts \nto unseal crucial documents proved unsuccessful. This is exactly the \nsort of case where we need judges to consider public health and safety \nwhen deciding whether to allow a secrecy order.\n  We are mindful of the risks to public health and safety that court \nsecrecy orders can pose in the wake of last year's horrific BP oil \nspill in the Gulf of Mexico. As the parties continue to fight over \ncrucial documents, injured parties continue to accept secret \nsettlements. We can only hope that information vital to public health \nand safety, which could protect against the next disaster, is not being \nshielded from us as well.\n  The examples go on and on. At a 2007 hearing before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and \nConsumer Rights, Johnny Bradley Jr. described his tragic personal story \nthat demonstrates the implications of court endorsed secrecy. In 2002, \nMr. Bradley's wife was killed in a rollover accident allegedly caused \nby tread separation in his Cooper tires. While litigating the case, his \nattorney uncovered documented evidence of Cooper tire design defects. \nThrough aggressive litigation of protective orders and confidential \nsettlements in cases prior to the Bradleys' accident, Cooper had \nmanaged to keep the design defect documents confidential. Prior to the \nend of Mr. Bradley's trial, Cooper Tires settled with him on the \ncondition that almost all litigation documents would be kept \nconfidential under a broad protective order. With no access to \ndocumented evidence of design defects, consumers continue to remain in \nthe dark about this life-threatening defect.\n  In 2005, the drug company Eli Lilly settled 8,000 cases related to \nharmful side effects of its drug Zyprexa. All of those settlements \nrequired plaintiffs to agree ``not to communicate, publish or cause to \nbe published . . . any statement . . . concerning the specific events, \nfacts or circumstances giving rise to [their] claims.'' In those cases, \nthe plaintiffs uncovered documents which showed that, through its own \nresearch, Lilly knew about the harmful side effects as early as 1999. \nWhile the plaintiffs kept quiet, Lilly continued to sell Zyprexa and \ngenerated $4.2 billion in sales in 2005. More than a year later, \ninformation about the case was leaked to the New York Times and another \n18,000 cases settled. Had the first settlement not included a secrecy \nagreement, consumers would have been able to make informed choices and \navoid the harmful side effects, including enormous weight gain, \ndangerously elevated blood sugar levels, and diabetes.\n  There are no records kept of the number of confidentiality orders \naccepted by State or Federal courts. However, anecdotal evidence \nsuggests that court secrecy and confidential settlements are prevalent. \nBeyond Bridgestone/Firestone, General Motors, Toyota, Seroquel, BP, \nCooper Tire, and Zyprexa, secrecy agreements have also had real life \nconsequences by allowing Dalkon Shield, Bjork-Shiley heart valves, and \nnumerous other dangerous products and drugs to remain in the market. \nAnd those are only the ones we know about.\n  While some judges have already begun to move in the right direction \nby giving serious weight to public health and safety, we still have a \nlong way to go. The Sunshine in Litigation Act is a modest proposal \nthat would require Federal judges to perform a simple balancing test to \nensure that in any proposed secrecy order in a case pleading facts \nrelevant to public health and safety, the defendant's interest in \nsecrecy truly outweighs the public interest in information related to \npublic health and safety.\n  Specifically, prior to making any portion of a case confidential or \nsealed, a judge would have to determine--by making a particularized \nfinding of\n\n[[Page S1838]]\n\nfact--that doing so would not restrict the disclosure of information \nrelevant to public health and safety. Moreover, all courts, both \nFederal and State, would be prohibited from issuing protective orders \nthat prevent disclosure to relevant regulatory agencies.\n  This legislation does not prohibit secrecy agreements across the \nboard, and it does not place an undue burden on judges or on our \ncourts. It simply states that where the public interest in disclosure \noutweighs legitimate interests in secrecy, courts should not shield \nimportant health and safety information from the public. Since last \nCongress, we have made changes to make absolutely clear that this would \napply only to those cases with facts relevant to public health and \nsafety, and to ensure that there is no undue burden on judges or our \ncourts. The time to focus some sunshine on public hazards to prevent \nfuture harm is now.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 623\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe shipping investment withdrawal rules in section 955 and to provide \nan incentive to reinvest foreign shipping earnings in the United \nStates; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \nSenators Vitter, Carper, Cochran, Inouye, Landrieu, and Murray to \nintroduce the American Shipping Reinvestment Act of 2011. This \nlegislation will build on work Congress started in 2004 to strengthen \nthe U.S. merchant marine, create needed jobs in U.S. ship building, and \nstimulate economic activity in our maritime sector.\n  Since our Nation's founding, the maritime sector has been integral to \nU.S. national security and economic security. American companies own \nand operate both U.S. flag ships and a significant number of vessels \nunder international registries. The U.S. flag fleets of these companies \ngenerally are built in the United States and are manned with U.S. \nseafarers. These U.S. flag fleets support not only the shipbuilding \nindustrial base in this country and the pool of qualified seafarers, \nbut they also create the shipping assets that are needed for military \nsealift in time of war or national emergency.\n  Most people understand commercial shipping and understand that we \nmaintain a fleet of ships for military purposes. What may not be as \nwell known is that the international ships of some American-owned \ncompanies are part of what is called the effective U.S.-controlled \nfleet, EUSC fleet. The EUSC is the fleet of merchant vessels registered \nin certain foreign nations that are available for requisition, use, or \ncharter by the U.S. Government in the event of war or national \nemergency.\n  For example, U.S. flag commercial vessels and their American crews \ntransported the majority of the cargo, more than 25 million measurement \ntons of cargo, in support of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi \nFreedom during the period of 2002-2008.\n  What people also may not know is that the EUSC fleet has been in \ndecline for the past quarter century, largely because of U.S. tax \npolicy. Following enactment of certain 1986 tax law changes, there was \na precipitous decline in American-owned international shipping assets. \nTo remain competitive, many American-owned shipping companies either \nbecame foreign companies or simply divested themselves of their foreign \nassets.\n  A 2002 study commissioned by the Department of Defense and performed \nby professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that \nthe EUSC fleet dropped by 38 percent in terms of numbers of ships and \nnearly 55 percent in terms of deadweight tonnage between 1986 and 2000. \nPerhaps more importantly, these declines have been largely experienced \nin militarily-useful\n\n[[Page S1839]]\n\nvessel types. For example, the results of a 2002 DOD study found that \nif the EUSC fleet continues its present decline, DOD's ability to \nsupport U.S. military tanker requirements will diminish over time.\n  Fortunately, Congress recognized this problem in 2004 and addressed \nit by enacting the tonnage tax regime as part of the American Jobs \nCreation Act. Our legislation today builds on that policy by correcting \nan oversight in the 2004 act that has continued to stymie the ability \nof U.S. shipbuilding companies to invest in new ships in the United \nStates.\n  We have very strong economic and national security reasons to support \nU.S. owned shipowning companies and to maintain a vibrant maritime \nindustry in this country. We also have to continue to support needed \nchanges in our tax code so that we provide operators of U.S. flag \nvessels in international trade the opportunity to be competitive with \ntheir tax-advantaged foreign competitors.\n  Notwithstanding the significant competitive disadvantages between \n1986 and 2004 for American companies operating international ships, \nthere continues to be several U.S. owned shipping companies with \nforeign operations, and our legislation is directed at helping them \nsustain and grow their U.S. flag fleets and to maintain their EUSC \nfleets. This bill will help these companies make needed investment in \nthe U.S. economy, and create jobs in a way that also will enhance \nnational security.\n  Specifically, the American Shipping Reinvestment Act of 2011 would \nrepeal an outdated section of the Internal Revenue Code and allow U.S. \nshipping companies with foreign income earned prior to 1986 to reinvest \nit into the U.S. for the purpose of growing their U.S. flag operations.\n  Congress first included foreign shipping income in Subpart F in 1975, \nwhich meant that all shipping income was taxable at the full U.S. \ncorporate tax rate no matter whether it was invested abroad or in the \nUnited States. However, a temporary rule, applicable to foreign \nshipping income earned from 1975 to 1986, continued to allow for \ndeferral in cases where this income was reinvested in qualifying \nshipping activities. Section 955 of the Internal Revenue Code provided \nthat this income would be included in gross income, i.e., taxed, \nimmediately under Subpart F in the event of any net decrease in \nqualified shipping investments.\n  The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 restored for shipping income \nthe normal tax rule under which non-Subpart F income of foreign \nsubsidiaries is not taxed by the United States until it is repatriated, \ngenerally as a dividend. In restoring the potential for deferral for \ncertain shipping income, Congress in 2004 returned the treatment of \nshipping income to where it was prior to 1975.\n  Unfortunately, Congress did not address the rules under IRC Section \n955 that apply to income earned between 1975 and 1986, thus creating a \nsituation that this income is permanently stranded offshore. Our bill \nwould repeal IRC Section 955 and will allow these stranded assets to be \nreinvested in the United States under the favorable tax terms that were \nin effect for other companies and industries in 2004. Specifically, the \nlegislation provides a one-time opportunity for American-owned shipping \ncompanies to bring foreign source income back into the United States at \na discounted tax rate for the purpose of expanding and growing our \ndomestic maritime industry. Without the commonsense change in our \nlegislation, these old, stranded assets will never return to the United \nStates and never be subject to U.S. taxation.\n  The bill is guaranteed to create jobs for American workers with the \nfunds being brought back into the U.S. economy--on the ships, in the \nshipyards building the ships, and in supporting businesses. The bill \ncontains a provision that would recapture any tax benefits if a \nshipping company reduces its full-time U.S. employment levels.\n  This bill also would enhance U.S. national security interests by \nsupporting shipyards that are vital to our defense industrial base, by \nenabling new U.S. flag tanker capacity to transport our Nation's energy \nproducts, and by providing DOD with critical assets--manpower and \nships--necessary to help sustain military sealift.\n  The bill is strongly supported by maritime labor, shipyards, and ship \nowners and operators and can provide a boost to the U.S. maritime \nindustry at a time when the U.S. is struggling to find its economic \nfooting. The jobs created by this legislation are well-paying, long-\nterm jobs in a crucial sector of our Nation's economy. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me and my other original cosponsors in supporting \nthis bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 626\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

                               \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. \n        Tester):\n  S. 627. A bill to establish the Commission on Freedom of Information \nAct Processing Delays; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this week, the Nation commemorates Sunshine \nWeek, a time to educate the public about the importance of open \ngovernment. In recognition of Sunshine Week 2011, I am pleased to join \nwith Senator Cornyn to reintroduce the Faster FOIA Act of 2011, a bill \nto improve the implementation of the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA.\n  Senator Cornyn and I first introduced this bill in 2005 to address \nthe growing problem of excessive FOIA delays within our Federal \nagencies. We reintroduced this bill in 2010, and the Senate unanimously \npassed it last year. This bill is the most recent product of our \nbipartisan work to help reinvigorate FOIA.\n  This bill will establish a bipartisan commission to examine the root \ncauses of agency FOIA delays and to recommend to the Congress and the \nPresident steps to help eliminate FOIA backlogs.\n  While the Obama administration has made significant progress in \nimproving the FOIA process, large backlogs remain a major roadblock to \npublic access to information. A report released earlier this week by \nthe National Security Archive found that only about half of the Federal \nagencies surveyed have taken concrete steps to update their FOIA \npolicies in light of these reforms. In addition, twelve of the agencies \nsurveyed by the National Security Archive had pending FOIA requests \nthat were more than 6 years old, according to the report.\n  Senator Cornyn and I believe that these delays are simply \nunacceptable. And that is why we are introducing this bill.\n  The commission created by the Faster FOIA Act will make key \nrecommendations to Congress and the President for reducing impediments \nto the efficient processing of FOIA requests. The commission will also \nstudy why Federal agencies are more and more relying on FOIA exemptions \nto withhold information from the public. In addition, the commission \nwill examine whether the current system for charging fees and granting \nfee waivers under FOIA should be modified. The commission will be made \nup of government and non-governmental representatives with a broad \nrange of experience related to handling FOIA requests.\n  Thomas Jefferson once wisely observed that ``information is the \ncurrency of democracy.'' I share this view. Indeed, we need look no \nfurther than the unfolding and historic events in the Middle East and \nNorth Africa for evidence of the truth of these words. The Faster FOIA \nAct will help ensure the dissemination of government information to the \nAmerican people, so that our democracy remains vibrant and free.\n  I have said many times that open government is neither a Democratic \nissue, nor a Republican issue it is truly an American value and virtue \nthat we all must uphold. As we celebrate Sunshine Week, it is in this \nbipartisan spirit that I join Americans from across the Nation in \ncelebrating an open and transparent government. I thank Senator Cornyn \nfor his work on this bill and for his leadership on this issue. I also \nthank Senator Whitehouse who has cosponsored this bill. I urge all \nSenators to support the Faster FOIA Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Begich):\n  S. 628. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to convey a \nrailroad right of way between North Pole, Alaska, and Delta Junction, \nAlaska, to the Alaska Railroad Corporation; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat really has been 97 years in the making, legislation to authorize \nthe land conveyances needed to permit the Alaska Railroad to be \nextended another 80 miles southeastward.\n  On March 12, 1914, Congress originally approved the Alaska Railroad \nOrganic Act that authorized the construction of up to 1,000 miles of \nmainline track in Alaska, an effort to tie coastal Alaska with the \nInterior of my State. During the past century 470 miles of mainline \ntrack has been built tying Seward, Whittier and Anchorage located on \neither Prince William Sound or Cook Inlet with Fairbanks and Eielson \nAir Force base that is located just south of Fairbanks in the Interior \nof Alaska. Since 1923 when the current mainline track was finished \nbeing installed, there has been a dream by many to extend the railroad \nfurther, perhaps all the way to the Canadian border 270 miles away so \nthe railroad could eventually be tied into North America's trans-\ncontinental rail network.\n  Today, joined by my colleague, Senator Mark Begich of Alaska, I \nintroduce legislation to only authorize the land conveyances from the \nFederal Government to permit the railroad to reach Delta Junction, \nAlaska.\n  The reasons for the extension are many.\n  One reason is that the Department of Defense has large military \ntraining areas south of the Tanana River between Fairbanks and Delta \nJunction--some of the best areas for joint Army and Air Force training \nin the nation. Access to the Joint Pacific Area Range Complex, JPARC, \nis currently limited to ice roads in winter, but a railroad extension \nwould permit vehicles to travel by low-cost rail to a staging area for \njoint military exercises that could be built immediately south of the \nriver, reducing the time and cost of military exercises and permitting \nyear-round training to occur more readily.\n  Delta Junction, the home of Ft. Greely, is also the site of an anti-\nmissile defense installation that could also benefit from access to \nrail transportation.\n  Rail service to the area also would permit existing agricultural, \nmining and petrochemical industries to obtain supplies, reducing wear \nand tear on the Richardson Highway, currently the only means of access \nto the region. It would improve the economics for several mining \ndeposits located along the 80-mile rail extension right of way, and \nshould the railroad ever be extended further toward the border, it \nwould open more than a dozen other known mineralized areas to potential \neconomic development. A railroad would provide safer all-weather \ntransportation than highways given Alaska's severe winter weather \ndriving conditions.\n  Planning for such a rail extension has been underway for a number of \nyears. In January 2010 the Surface Transportation Board approved the \nEnvironmental Impact Statement for the\n\n[[Page S1841]]\n\nrail extension. That means that a route already has been identified. \nThis means that the estimate that this extension will require only \nroughly 950 acres of land to be purchased/conveyed to the railroad is a \nfirm requirement based on an approved rail route and corridor.\n  The bill I introduce requires the railroad to pay the full appraised \nvalue for the land--an appraisal performed by an appraiser mutually \nacceptable to the Secretary of the Interior and the railroad--unless \nthe government accepts railroad replacement property in lieu of cash \npayment. It requires the railroad to pay all surveying costs of the \nland transfer--surveying the largest likely cost of any land conveyance \nby the Federal Government. The bill models the transfer on the 1982 \nlegislation that conveyed the railroad from Federal ownership to the \nState-based Alaska Railroad Corp., since there are now nearly 30 years \nof precedent and practice that should make the land conveyance issues \ninvolved in a rail extension clearer and easier to resolve.\n  This bill since it allows the secretary only to clear a right of way \ncorridor does not impact the lone controversy that I am aware of \ninvolving the extension. That is the exact location of a bridge needed \nfor the rail line to cross the Tanana River near Salcha. It is \ncertainly my hope that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers early this \nspring will follow the route approved in January 2010 and locate the \nbridge near Salcha, where it was cleared to go by the Surface \nTransportation Board after a four-year environmental review of the \nproject. But whether the Corps approves the route, or whether EPA \npresses its concerns about the bridge, the bill will still be needed to \nauthorize the right-of-way corridor over whatever final route wins \napproval.\n  For a host of reasons, it makes sense for the Alaska Railroad to be \npermitted to advance this extension, the first major extension of the \nrailroad's track bed in Alaska since lines were run to Whittier during \nWorld War II in 1943. My hope is that this bill will receive a \nthoughtful review by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nand be approved by Congress during the 112th Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Mr. Begich, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. \n        Cantwell, Mr. Crapo, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Risch, Mr. Whitehouse, \n        and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 629. A bill to improve hydropower, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce three pieces \nof legislation aimed at increasing the production of our hardest \nworking renewable resource, one that often gets overlooked in the clean \nenergy debate--hydropower. The first bill I would like to introduce \ntoday is the Hydropower Improvement Act of 2011, cosponsored by my \ncolleagues Senators Bingaman, Risch, Cantwell, Crapo, Wyden, Murray, \nBegich, and Whitehouse, true hydropower advocates. The Hydropower \nImprovement Act of 2011 seeks to substantially increase the capacity \nand generation of our clean, renewable hydropower resources that will \nimprove environmental quality and support local job creation and \neconomic investment across the Nation.\n  There is no question that hydropower is, and must continue to be, \npart of our energy solution. It is the largest source of renewable \nelectricity in the United States. The 100,000 megawatts of \nhydroelectric capacity we now have today provide about seven percent of \nthe Nation's electricity needs. Hydro-electric generation is carbon-\nfree baseload power that allows us to avoid approximately 200 million \nmetric ton of carbon emissions each year. Hydropower is clean, \nefficient, and inexpensive. Yet, despite its tremendous benefits I am \nconstantly amazed at how some undervalue this important resource.\n  Perhaps it is because conventional wisdom dismisses our Nation's \nhydropower capacity as tapped out. That is simply not the case. If \nanything, hydropower is really an under-developed resource--something \nwe certainly understand in my home State of Alaska where hydro already \nsupplies 24 percent of the State's electricity needs and over 200 \npromising sites for further hydropower development have been \nidentified. There is great potential for additional hydropower \ndevelopment in every state, not just Alaska.\n  According to the Obama administration, conventional hydropower \nfacilities have the capacity to generate an additional 75,000 megawatts \nof power--a staggering amount of clean, inexpensive power. Now that \ndoesn't seem possible until you realize that only three percent of the \ncountry's 80,000 existing dams are even electrified. Significant \namounts of new capacity--anywhere between 20,000 and 60,000 megawatts--\ncan be derived from simple efficiency improvements or capacity \nadditions at existing facilities. Additional hydropower can be captured \nin existing man-made conduits and hydroelectric pumped storage projects \ncan help reliably integrate other renewable resources that are \nintermittent, such as wind, onto our grid.\n  The Hydropower Improvement Act of 2011 seeks to substantially \nincrease our Nation's hydropower capacity in an effort to expand clean \npower generation and create domestic jobs. The legislation establishes \na competitive grants program and directs the Energy Department to \nproduce and implement a plan for the research, development and \ndemonstration of increased hydropower capacity. The bill provides the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission with the authority to extend \npreliminary permit terms; to work with federal resource agencies and \nstakeholders to make the review process for conduit and small \nhydropower projects more efficient; and to explore a possible two-year \nlicensing process for hydropower development at non-powered dams and \nclosed loop pumped storage projects. The act also calls for studies on \nthe resource development at Bureau of Reclamation facilities and in \nconduit projects, as well as on suitable pumped storage locations. \nImportantly, by utilizing existing authorizations, the bill does not \nrepresent new funding.\n  It is my hope that as the Senate considers our Nation's long-term \nenergy policy, we can finally recognize the important contribution the \nrenewable resource of hydropower makes, and will continue to make, to \nour clean energy goals. This legislation is supported by the National \nHydropower Association, the American Public Power Association, the \nFamily Farm Alliance, the National Rural Electric Cooperative \nAssociation, the Edison Electric Institute, and the National Water \nResources Association. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the \nHydropower Improvement Act of 2011 to promote the further development \nof our most cost-effective, clean energy option.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Begich):\n  S. 630. A bill to promote marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy \nresearch and development, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that is \ndesigned to speed up the development of renewable ocean energy--wave, \ncurrent and tidal energy--across the nation and also in my home State \nof Alaska. The Hydrokinetic Renewable Energy Promotion Act of 2011 is \ncosponsored by my colleague from Alaska, Senator Begich.\n  Since 2004 I have had a strong interest in working to promote the \nresearch and development of marine hydrokinetic energy--the effort to \nproduce electricity from waves, current and tidal energy--all of which \nis indirectly driven by the sun. With 70 percent of our planet covered \nwith water, marine hydrokinetic energy has the potential to be a major \nsource of the world's clean, non-carbon emitting power in the future.\n  The Electric Power Research Institute has estimated that our Nation's \nocean resources could generate 252 million megawatt hours of \nelectricity--63 percent of our entire electricity generation--if ocean \nenergy gained the same financial and research incentives currently \nenjoyed by other forms of renewable energy.\n  In the 2005 Energy Policy Act, we started the process of leveling the \nplaying field. In that bill, Congress authorized Federal research and \nincluded ocean energy in both the federal renewable energy purchase \nrequirements and the federal production incentives. In the 2007 Energy \nIndependence and Security Act, we authorized ocean energy research and \ndemonstration centers. In 2008, we finally qualified ocean energy\n\n[[Page S1842]]\n\nto receive a renewable energy Production Tax Credit, although \nunfortunately at a lower rate than some other renewable energy \nresources receive.\n  The Hydrokinetic Renewable Energy Promotion Act of 2011, along with a \nrelated tax measure that I will discuss next, seeks to increase the \nindustry's growth through additional federal aid. Specifically, the \nbill authorizes the Department of Energy to expand its research and \ndevelopment efforts on marine hydrokinetic energy via advanced \nengineering and integration systems. It further authorizes the \nDepartment to transfer environmental data throughout the industry in \norder to expedite environmental assessments and demonstration project \napprovals. The legislation calls for the creation of three testing \nfacilities to be developed by states, universities, or non-profit \nentities to test marine hydrokinetic technology.\n  Importantly, the legislation directs the development of a Federal \nMarine-Based Energy Device Verification program. Through this program, \nthe government will be able to certify the performance of new marine \ntechnologies in order to reduce market risks for utilities purchasing \npower from new devices. The bill also authorizes the Federal government \nto set up an adaptive management program and a fund to help pay for the \nregulatory permitting and development of new marine technologies. This \nprogram should help demonstration projects to win permitting approvals.\n  This bill further amends Section 803 from the Energy Independence and \nSecurity Act. This was a provision I had authored in that 2007 energy \nbill to create a renewable energy deployment grants program for all \nforms of renewable energy. That program has never been funded because \nit has been inaccurately perceived as an Alaska-only program. The \namendments make clear that the renewable energy grants program is \nnational in scope and is available to assist projects in high-cost \nareas, where power costs exceed 125 percent of the national average.\n  The Hydrokinetic Renewable Energy Promotion Act of 2011 is very \nsimilar to marine and hydrokinetic provisions that won the approval of \nthe Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee last Congress and \nwere included in S. 1462, the American Clean Energy Leadership Act. \nThis bill, however, is far less expensive, authorizing up to $225 \nmillion in aid over 3 years to jump start marine hydrokinetic power--\nsubstantially less than the $3.25 billion authorized by the original \nlegislation. Moreover, the spending authorized in this legislation is \noffset via the reprogramming of previously un-utilized Congressional \nauthorizations.\n  Coming from Alaska where there are more than 80 large communities \nlocated along the State's 34,000 miles of coastline and major river \nsystems, it is clear that perfecting marine energy could be of immense \nbenefit to the Nation. It simply makes good sense to harness the power \nof the sun, wind, waves, and river and ocean currents to make \nelectricity. When the fuel is free, it's obviously economic to harness \nits power.\n  This legislation is designed to aid development nationally, but also \nin Alaska where several companies already have proposed test projects \nin the Yukon and Tanana Rivers and in Cook Inlet, along with Kachemak \nBay and Inside Passage waters. Projects are under consideration at \nEagle, Galena, Ruby, Tanana, in addition to near Anchorage, with others \nbeing considered near Homer and in Southeast.\n  This bill would allow the marine industry to be on a level playing \nfield with other renewables such as wind, solar and geothermal power, \nall of which have received large budget increases in the President's \nfiscal year 2012 budget proposal. It would truly help the industry \nprove whether the technology can achieve the technical success and the \neconomies of scale needed for it to become a major component of the \nnation's energy mix. I hope that Congress will give real consideration \nto the Hydrokinetic Renewable Energy Promotion Act of 2011, as well as \nthe other bills that I am introducing today to aid hydroelectric \ndevelopment throughout the country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Begich):\n  S. 631. A bill to extend certain Federal benefits and income tax \nprovisions to energy generated by hydropower resources; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Hydropower \nRenewable Energy Development Act of 2011, legislation to extend certain \nbenefits and income tax provisions to energy generated by hydropower \nresources. This legislation is co-sponsored by my colleague from \nAlaska, Senator Begich.\n  We have an incredible amount of hydropower potential in my home State \nof Alaska. To date, we have almost 50 hydropower projects--in a range \nof sizes from the 126 megawatt Bradley Lake project to the 7 kilowatt \nWalsh Creek project--that produce about 24 percent of the State's \nelectricity needs. Alaska is proof that the hydropower resource is not \ntapped out--not even close. Currently, there are 32 additional \nhydropower projects, just in Southeast, that are either under \nconstruction or on the drawing boards. Statewide there are another 200 \nareas that have been identified as promising sites for lake taps, run \nof river, pumped storage and even new hydroelectric reservoirs. With \nthe proper financing, we could keep a dozen hydro construction \ncompanies fully employed in the State for a decade or even longer. That \nis just in Alaska. There are tremendous opportunities in each and every \nState to further develop this clean energy alternative.\n  Hydropower, by definition, is a renewable resource. It produces no \ncarbon emissions and through rainfall and melting snowpacks it is able \nto be replenished. Yet there are some who would deny this important \nclassification to the hydropower resource. The Hydropower Renewable \nEnergy Development Act of 2011 directs that the generation of \nhydroelectric power be treated as a ``renewable'' resource for purposes \nof any Federal program or standard. This reclassification of \nhydroelectric generation should help to incent the further production \nof this important and often undervalued resource.\n  Next, the bill provides parity treatment for hydropower resources in \nthe Production Tax Credit, PTC. Currently, companies that generate \nwind, solar, geothermal, and closed-loop biomass systems are eligible \nfor the PTC which provides a 2.1 cent per kilowatt-hour, kWh, benefit \nfor the first 10 years of a renewable energy facility's operation. \nOther technologies, such as incremental hydropower, certain generation \nat non-powered facilities, and wave and tidal receive a lesser value \ntax credit of 1.1 cent per kWh. The Hydropower Renewable Energy \nDevelopment Act of 2011 eliminates the distinction between the two \ncategories so that all qualified hydropower resources receive the full \nPTC credit. The bill further expands upon the types of hydropower \nresources that can qualify for the PTC, allowing new hydro generation, \nsmall hydropower under 50 megawatts, lake taps, and pumped storage \nfacilities to qualify as well.\n  The Hydropower Renewable Energy Development Act of 2011 also carries \nthis expanded qualification of hydropower to the Clean Renewable Energy \nBonds, CREBS, program.\n  Because non-profits like rural electric cooperatives and public power \nproviders are not eligible for the PTC due to their tax-exempt status, \nCREBS was created to encourage these entities to undertake renewable \nenergy development as well. This program has been wildly popular and \nhas been oversubscribed since its inception. There are endless \npossibilities for increased hydropower production by electric \ncooperatives and public power providers and they should be given the \nproper financial incentive to do so.\n  Finally, the bill provides for a 5-year accelerated depreciation \nperiod for equipment which produces electricity from marine and \nhydrokinetic energy, as well as conventional hydropower resources.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this hydropower tax legislation. The \nfurther development of this untapped renewable resource will help us \nmeet our clean energy goals through the generation of carbon-free, \nbaseload power. At a time of record unemployment, the addition of \nhydropower capacity throughout the nation will lead to hundreds of \nthousands of good paying, domestic jobs.\n\n[[Page S1843]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Brown of \n        Massachusetts, Mr. Merkley, and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 633. A bill to prevent fraud in small business contracting, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation along with Senators Landrieu, Merkley, Brown of \nMassachusetts, and Enzi, titled the Small Business Contracting Fraud \nPrevention Act of 2011.\n  In the past year, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, has \nidentified vulnerabilities and abuses in virtually all of the SBA's \ncontracting programs, including the 8(a) Business Development Program, \nthe Historically Underutilized Business Zone, HUBZone, program, and the \nService-Disabled Veteran-Owned small business, SDVOSB, program. Our \nlegislation attempts to remedy the spate of illegitimate firms \nsiphoning away contracts from the rightful businesses trying to compete \nwithin the SBA's contracting programs.\n  As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I take very seriously our responsibility of vigorous \noversight. That is why, last December, Senator Landrieu and I sent a \nletter to the SBA highlighting the recent press headlines and GAO \nreports of fraud and abuse that have plagued the Agency's contracting \nprograms. That letter stated unequivocally that our Committee's first \npriority this Congress is ensuring that ALL of the SBA's contracting \nprograms are running efficiently, effectively, and free of \nexploitation. Adopting this critical small business legislation is an \neffective first step at ensuring all small businesses are competing \nfairly and honestly within the Federal marketplace.\n  As recently as Saturday March 12, the Washington Post, as part of an \nongoing investigation, published an article titled, ``DC insiders can \nreap fortunes from federal programs for small businesses.'' This \narticle states ``Government officials were not monitoring contracts for \ncompliance with rules.'' The report exposes a glaring deficiency in \ncontract oversight. Moreover, an SBA spokesperson is quoted as saying \nthe SBA ``long ago transferred that authority to the Pentagon and other \nagencies.'' This hands-off attitude is unacceptable, and as I told the \nSBA Deputy Administrator at a recent Small Business Committee hearing, \nthe ultimate authority for monitoring fraud lies with the SBA.\n  This legislation contains recommendations both from the SBA Inspector \nGeneral and the GAO for combating these reports of fraud and addresses \nvulnerabilities in the Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small business \nprogram, the HUBZone program, and the 8(a) program. Additionally, the \nbill will work to change the culture at SBA to make the process of \nsuspensions and debarments more transparent.\n  In order to effectively execute the small business contracting \nprograms, the SBA needs a comprehensive framework to provide effective \ncertification, continued surveillance and monitoring, and robust \nenforcement throughout the SBA's contracting portfolio. This bill aims \nto increase criminal prosecutions as well as suspension and debarments \nfor businesses found to have attained contracts through fraudulent \nmeans, and requires the SBA to submit a report to Congress annually \ndetailing the specific data on all suspensions, debarments, and cases \nreferred to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecutions.\n  To that end, the SBIR bill we are now debating on the Senate floor, \nincludes stringent oversight and fraud prevention measures, requiring \nInspectors General of participating Federal agencies to establish fraud \ndetection measures, coordinate fraud-related information sharing \nbetween agencies, and provide fraud prevention related education and \ntraining to agencies administering the programs, among other \ninitiatives.\n  As a senior member of the Senate Commerce Committee, I worked with \nthe Chairman, Senator Rockefeller, in developing this language \nfollowing a 2009 committee investigation and hearing on the subject of \nfraud in the SBIR program. My amendment goes even further and provides \nthe SBA more stringent oversight capacity across all the SBA \ncontracting programs. It is SBA's duty to utilize every fraud \nprevention measure at its disposal and this amendment puts the tools in \nplace to punish the bad actors that have infiltrated the SBA \ncontracting programs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 633\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Contracting \n     Fraud Prevention Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to establish a program to provide guarantees for debt \nissued by or on behalf of State catastrophe insurance programs to \nassist in the financial recovery from earthquakes, earthquake-induced \nlandslides, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nEarthquake Insurance Affordability Act. This bill makes important \nchanges that will increase availability and reduce cost of catastrophic \ninsurance for homeowners in California and other earthquake-prone \nSstates.\n  The tragedy and devastation of the recent 9.0 earthquake in Japan was \na real wakeup call for many of us. You see, the people of Japan are \nkeenly aware of the risks of earthquakes. Every year, thousands of \npeople participate in earthquake drills, and their building codes are \nthe most advanced in the world. Japanese seismologists have the most \nsophisticated technology and monitoring systems. But all of this did \nlittle to protect them from an earthquake of this magnitude.\n  The people of California and much of the West Coast face a similar \nrisk. The United States Geological Survey predicts a 99.7 percent \nchance that a magnitude 6.7 earthquake will strike in California in the \nnext 30 years. The agency also predicts a 46 percent chance that a \nmagnitude 7.5 percent or higher earthquake will strike California in \nthe next 30 years.\n  The 2008 ShakeOut Scenario conducted by the US Geological Survey and \nFEMA modeled a 7.8 earthquake on the southern San Andres Fault. Though \nthat quake was only 1/10th the size of the recent event in Honshu, \nJapan, FEMA estimated that a 7.8 earthquake in Los Angeles would result \nin 2,000 deaths and an economic loss of $213.3 billion.\n  The simple fact is that we cannot prevent earthquakes, so we must be \nprepared in the event one does occur. That is the only way we will be \nable to respond and recover quickly.\n  That is why I am introducing the Earthquake Insurance Affordability \nAct. This legislation allows non-profit state-run disaster insurance \nprograms to receive federal guarantees if they need access to credit in \nthe aftermath of a catastrophic disaster. Access to credit is critical \nin the immediate aftermath of disasters because the market will likely \nbe disrupted and private institutions will be reluctant to lend the \nlarge sums necessary to facilitate a quick and meaningful recovery.\n  This Federal guarantee will be limited. The Secretary of Treasury \nmust certify that recipients of each of the loan guarantee are able to \nrepay debts within a reasonable timeframe. Moreover, my legislation \nensures that the cost of the program is born by state programs, not the \nfederal taxpayer. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that my \nbill comes at no cost to the taxpayer.\n  But this legislation is about more than just access to credit--it \nwill guarantee homeowners have access to affordable earthquake \ninsurance coverage. This means homeowners will be able to quickly \nrebuild in the aftermath of an earthquake.\n  This legislation is necessary because most homeowner insurance \npolicies do not cover earthquakes. In California, for instance, most \nhomeowner insurance policies cover fire damage but not damage caused by \nearthquakes.\n  As a result, homeowners are often put in the position of either \nhaving to purchase expensive supplemental insurance or leaving their \nhomes uninsured against these risks.\n  In order to help promote coverage for these risks, many states and \nthe Federal Government have set up supplemental insurance programs that \noffer this coverage at affordable rates.\n  At the Federal level, the National Flood Insurance Program offers \nflood insurance to residents living in flood plains where private \ninsurance is unavailable or too expensive.\n  Similar State-level programs exist in California, Florida, Texas, and \nother states to help residents protect their homes against catastrophic \ndisasters. In my state, The California Earthquake Authority, CEA, was \nset up after the devastating 1994 Northridge earthquake to make \nearthquake insurance more affordable.\n  Unfortunately, many of these programs are not fully utilized. The \nCalifornia Earthquake Authority insures 70 percent of homeowners who \npurchase earthquake insurance in my state, but only 770,000 homeowners \nin California opted to buy such insurance. That means only 12 percent \nof Californians will be covered up if an earthquake hits.\n  The reason for such low use in that premiums and deductibles remain \ntoo high for the average consumer. A policy covering a $400,000 home \nand $60,000 of its contents costs an additional $1,105 per year, and \nthat's on top of normal homeowners insurance. Even worse, with such \nhigh deductibles, policyholders must suffer near total collapse before \nthey receive any payout. For most, this just isn't a good deal.\n  The reason for high-cost, high-deductible policies is that the CEA is \nforced to spend nearly $200 million each year to purchase reinsurance. \nThis ensures that in the event of a major catastrophe, the CEA will \nstill be able to pay out all of its claims. It is good policy for the \nCEA to incur this expense, and I commend their responsible business \npractices.\n  However, since 1994 the California Earthquake Authority has paid $2.5 \nbillion in reinsurance premiums and only received back $250,000 in \nclaims. It doesn't take a savvy businessman to see this isn't a good \ninvestment. But with minimal changes to federal law, the CEA and other \nstate-run insurance programs can drastically reduce the\n\n[[Page S1846]]\n\nneed for expensive reinsurance and substantially decrease the cost of \ntheir products.\n  The Earthquake Insurance Affordability Act makes these changes, \nallowing programs like the California Earthquake Authority to access \nsufficient capital following a disaster.\n  Let me be clear: this is not a bailout or a handout for states. The \nCalifornia Earthquake Authority is independent from the state and \nfinancially stable.\n  This bill would increase insurance coverage in California and the \nrest of the country and help consumers deal with losses that will occur \nwhen the next major disaster strikes.\n  Over the first 5 years this legislation is in effect, nearly half a \nbillion dollars in reinsurance costs would be saved and passed along to \nconsumers.\n  The California Earthquake Authority could cut premiums by 30 percent \nor deductibles by 50 percent.\n  This could result in at least 700,000 new California homeowners \npurchasing earthquake insurance.\n  Following major disasters, the federal government spends millions of \ndollars, and often billions, cleaning up the mess.\n  Katrina cost FEMA $7.2 billion.\n  The Northridge earthquake cost FEMA $7 billion.\n  Hurricane Andrew cost FEMA $1.8 billion.\n  By enacting the Earthquake Insurance Affordability Act and increasing \nthe number of individuals with insurance, the cost of disaster recovery \nto the Federal Government could be substantially lower.\n  This is because FEMA cannot make payments to individuals who have \ninsurance coverage. Therefore, every family that purchases earthquake \ninsurance as a result of this bill, is one less family that FEMA may \nhave to support when disaster strikes.\n  The bottom line is this: the next big earthquake is coming and we are \nnot prepared for it. Families need to make sure they have earthquake \npreparedness plans, and homeowners need to evaluate the best ways to \nprotect their homes. Structures need to be strengthened and all new \nbuildings must be built to the highest standards. The Federal \nGovernment must also do its part, to help facilitate this preparedness.\n  The Earthquake Insurance Affordability Act will make great strides to \nhelp our country prepare for a major earthquake, and it does so without \nburdening the federal taxpayer. I urge my colleagues to quickly adopt \nthis critical piece of legislation and help us better prepare for \ntragedy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Kyl, Mr. McCain, Mr. Schumer, \n        Mrs. Boxer, and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 638. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nprovide for compensation to States incarcerating undocumented aliens \ncharged with a felony or two or more misdemeanors; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today Senator Kyl and I are \nintroducing two bills that will assist with alleviating the costs of \nillegal immigration for State and local governments--the SCAAP \nReauthorization Act and the SCAAP Reimbursement Protection Act of 2011.\n  We are joined by Senators McCain, Schumer, Boxer, and Hutchison. \n  Immigration is a federal responsibility, as is securing the Nation's \nborders. When the Federal Government fails to prevent illegal \nimmigration, as it has for some time now, it needs to take \nresponsibility for the consequences of this failure.\n  However, the burden of incarcerating illegal aliens who commit crimes \nin our country has fallen largely to the States, and it weighs heavily \non them, especially during this time of economic uncertainty. Last \nyear, the State of California spent an estimated $1 billion to \nincarcerate criminal aliens.\n  Understanding the expenses that States and localities bear, Congress \nenacted the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, SCAAP, in 1994 as \npart of the Violent Crime Control Act. The program was designed to help \nreimburse States and local governments for the costs of incarcerating \ncriminal aliens, and was last reauthorized in 2006 as part of a \nDepartment of Justice Reauthorization bill. The SCAAP Reauthorization \nbill that I am introducing today will reauthorize the program for an \nadditional four years, until fiscal year 2015.\n  The second bill that we are introducing today is necessary to fix a \nswitch in interpretation by the Justice Department.\n  Prior to 2003, the Department of Justice interpreted the SCAAP \nstatute to include reimbursement to States and localities for \nincarcerating undocumented criminal aliens who have been accused or \nconvicted of State and local offenses, and have been incarcerated for a \nminimum of 72 hours. However, in 2003, DOJ changed its interpretation, \nand began limiting reimbursement to the amount States and localities \nspend incarcerating convicted criminal aliens for at least 4 \nconsecutive days.\n  Reimbursing States and localities only for the costs when a criminal \nalien is convicted and incarcerated for 4 consecutive days \nsignificantly undermines the goal of SCAAP that States and localities \nshould not bear the burden of a broken Federal immigration system. The \nactual costs of this failed Federal system begin when these aliens are \ncharged with a crime, transported, and incarcerated for any length of \ntime.\n  This narrow interpretation by the Justice Department is even more \ndevastating because SCAAP is consistently under-funded. The President's \nfiscal year 2012 budget request for SCAAP represents a 59 percent \nreduction below the fiscal year 2010 level and is far short of meeting \nthe actual reimbursement costs of most States. As a result, SCAAP only \nreimburses States for a fraction of the costs of incarcerating criminal \naliens. In 2009, Los Angeles County alone spent $116.6 million to house \nundocumented felons and received only $15.4 million in reimbursement \npayments.\n  The SCAAP Reimbursement Protection Act of 2011 will fix this problem \nby making it clear that States can be reimbursed for the full costs of \nincarcerating aliens who are either charged with or convicted of a \nfelony or two misdemeanors.\n  When the Federal Government does not reimburse States and local \ngovernments for the costs of incarcerating criminal aliens, it is at \nthe expense of local services and law enforcement. American communities \nsimply cannot afford to shoulder the weight of our immigration \npolicies.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 638\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to underscore the importance of international nuclear \nsafety\n\n[[Page S1847]]\n\ncooperation for operating power reactors, encouraging the efforts of \nthe Convention on Nuclear Safety, supporting progress in improving \nnuclear safety, and enhancing the pubic availability of nuclear safety \ninformation; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Furthering \nInternational Nuclear Safety Act of 2011 to enhance the implementation \nof the Convention on Nuclear Safety by taking a more systematic \napproach to improving civilian nuclear power safety. This legislation \nis cosponsored by Senator Carper, and Representative Fortenberry is \nintroducing a House companion bill.\n  The still unfolding nuclear emergency in Japan serves as a powerful \nreminder that the United States as a Nation, and as an influential \nmember of the international community, must continually seek methods to \nenhance the safety posture of nuclear facilities worldwide.\n  This year, April 26 will provide us with another sobering reminder: \nthe 26th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine. The \nChernobyl disaster was the worst nuclear power accident in history and \nmade clear the need for international nuclear safety norms. According \nto a report commissioned by United Nations agencies, millions of people \nwere exposed to high doses of radiation, and approximately 350,000 \npeople were displaced from their homes. The countries most directly \naffected by the disaster suffered estimated economic damages on the \norder of hundreds of billions of dollars, while thousands of square \nmiles of agricultural and forest lands were removed from service.\n  In the aftermath of this accident, over 50 countries, led by the \nUnited States, worked together to develop the Convention on Nuclear \nSafety. This convention was formally established in 1994, and the \nUnited States joined in 1999. Through the cooperative nature of the \nconvention, which relies on peer-reviewed national reports and the \nsharing of best practices, countries that are party to the treaty work \nto improve their nuclear safety.\n  Although civilian nuclear power programs have become safer since \nChernobyl, the unfolding disaster in Japan makes clear that we must not \nbecome complacent. In future months, Japan and the international \ncommunity will assess the damage and how to prevent its recurrence. \nThis bill will provide a stronger framework for United States \nengagement in that process.\n  Currently, there are nearly 450 civilian nuclear power reactors \noperating in 31 countries around the world, and at least 65 more are \nunder construction. Countries such as Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, \nThailand, and Vietnam have started or expressed interest in civilian \nnuclear power programs. The global expansion of nuclear power should be \naccompanied by greater attention to nuclear safety.\n  Last year, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, completed a \nreview of the Convention on Nuclear Safety in which GAO obtained the \nviews of 40 parties to the Convention while carefully protecting \nindividual respondent information. GAO found that the Convention has \nbeen very successful in improving nuclear safety but made \nrecommendations to the United States Government that would enhance the \nConvention's effectiveness.\n  The bill I am introducing today will implement GAO's recommendations \nand additional steps to improve nuclear safety worldwide. This bill \nurges the United States delegate to the Convention to take certain \nactions to enhance international nuclear safety. This includes the \nUnited States advocating that parties to the Convention more \nsystematically assess their own progress through the broader use of \nperformance metrics. Additionally, to increase access to information \nabout nuclear safety, the delegate to the Convention will encourage \nparties to post their annual reports and answers to questions from \nother parties on the International Atomic Energy Agency's, IAEA, public \nwebsite. IAEA will be encouraged to offer additional support, such as \nproviding additional technical support; assistance as needed for \nparties' national reports; and support for Convention meetings, \nincluding language translation services. Further, the United States \ndelegate will encourage all countries that have or are considering \nestablishing a civilian nuclear power program to join the Convention. \nFinally, this bill calls for the Secretary of State to lead the \ndevelopment of a United States Government strategic plan for \ninternational nuclear safety cooperation for operating nuclear power \nreactors and to report on progress made in implementing this bill.\n  International nuclear safety deserves our Nation's ongoing attention. \nAs we continue to support Japan's efforts to prevent further \ndeterioration at the damaged nuclear facilities, and as we approach the \n25th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, we should be mindful that \nthe use and expansion of nuclear power needs to be combined with \nsupreme vigilance and concern for safety.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 640\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide 100,000,000 people with first-time access \nto safe drinking water and sanitation on a sustainable basis within six \nyears by improving the capacity of the United States Government to \nfully implement the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005; \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on March 22, countries around the world \nwill celebrate World Water Day--a day to mark the progress we have made \nprotecting this most important resource and to reflect on the many \nchallenges we still face in providing clean, safe water to the world's \npoor.\n  In 2005, Congress in a bipartisan effort, passed the Senator Paul \nSimon Water for the Poor Act to establish American leadership on this \nissue. The bill had the support of then-Majority Leader Bill Frist and \nthen-Congressman Henry Hyde in the House. President George W. Bush \nsigned the bill into law.\n  The bill was appropriately named after my predecessor in the Senate, \nPaul Simon, who was years ahead of many others recognizing the \nimportance of water.\n  This act has already done a great deal to help bring clean water and \nsanitation to the world's poor. But we can do more.\n  That is why today Senators Corker, Reid, Roberts, Cardin, Isakson, \nLeahy, and I are reintroducing the Senator Paul Simon Water for the \nWorld Act. This bill would improve the original Water for the Poor \nAct--by strengthening America's ability to provide clean water and \nsanitation to 100 million of the world's poor within six years of \nenactment.\n  Tragically, today nearly 1 billion people still lack access to safe \ndrinking water, and more than 2 billion still lack basic sanitation. \nLack of access to stable supplies of water is reaching critical \nproportions, particularly for agricultural purposes. And the problem \nwill only worsen with rapid urbanization worldwide. Experts suggest \nthat another 1.2 billion people will lack access to clean water and \nsanitation within 20 years.\n  The overall economic loss in Africa alone due to lack of access to \nsafe water and basic sanitation is estimated at $28.4 billion a year. \nIn many poor nations, women and girls walk 2 or 3 hours or more each \nway, every day, to collect water that is often dirty and unsafe.\n  The United Nations estimates that women and girls in sub-Saharan \nAfrica spend a total of 40 billion working hours each year collecting \nwater. That is equivalent to all of the hours worked in France in a \nyear. Clearly, the world needs to do more to help with such a basic \nhuman need.\n  Last year, the Senate passed the Water for the World Act with 33 \ncosponsors representing the broad political spectrum of the Senate. You \nsee, American leadership in providing the world's poor with this most \nbasic of human needs has always been bipartisan in the past--and it \nshould be today.\n  As we celebrate World Water Day next week, let's renew our commitment \nto making sure the world's poor have access to water and sanitation \nneed by sending this critical piece of legislation to the President's \ndesk.\n  The Water for the World Act is not an effort to create vast new \nprograms, but rather to focus our foreign assistance on a \ncomprehensive, strategic series of investments related to water and \nsanitation. These are simple, common-sense steps that will make a real \ndifference in people's lives.\n  Our legislation would make the United States a leader in trying to \nmeet Millennium Development Goals for drinking water and sanitation, \nwhich is to reduce by half the proportion of people without safe water \nand sanitation by 2015. The bill targets aid to areas with the greatest \nneed and helps build the capacity of poor nations to meet their own \nwater and sanitation challenges.\n  The Water for the World Act also supports research of clean water \ntechnologies and regional partnerships to find solutions to shared \nwater challenges. The bill provides technical assistance--best \npractices, credit authorities, and training--to help countries expand \naccess to clean water and sanitation. Our development experts will \ndesign the assistance based on local needs.\n  The bill also would strengthen the capacity of USAID and the State \nDepartment to implement development assistance efforts related to water \nand ramp up U.S. developmental and diplomatic leadership.\n  And lastly, the bill includes a 25 percent cost share for these water \nand sanitation programs--requiring USAID to partner with universities, \nphilanthropies, and other donors in meeting the key goals.\n  USAID's sustained commitment to addressing water and sanitation \nissues has been invaluable in combating poverty and disease worldwide. \nIn fact, USAID recently announced the position of a Senior Water \nCoordinator, Chris Holmes, whom I had the pleasure of meeting this \nweek. I applaud USAID Administrator Shah for taking this important step \nthat will save lives.\n  Not only is helping people access clean water and sanitation the \nright thing to do, it is the smart thing to do. For example, research \nshows that for every dollar put into clean water and sanitation, $8 in \nreturns are gained in health, education and economic productivity.\n  Water scarcity can also be a source of conflict and economic \ncalamity. Without reliable supplies of water, farmers struggle to grow \ncrops, and areas once abundant with water are slowly becoming barren. \nQuite simply, no other issue is more important to human health, peace \nand security than access to sustainable supplies of water.\n  Helping other nations is in our national interest. Some say that now \nis not the time to invest in poor nations half a world away, when our \neconomy is in crisis and so many Americans are hurting. That view is \nunderstandable. Recovering from this recession and rebuilding our \neconomy for the long term must be, and is, our government's top \npriority.\n  But investing in clean water for the world is a smart strategy that \nwill make our foreign assistance dollars achieve more--something we \nneed in these hard economic times.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 641\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Senator Paul Simon Water for \n     the World Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005 \n     (Public Law 109-121)--\n       (A) makes access to safe water and sanitation for \n     developing countries a specific policy objective of United \n     States foreign assistance programs;\n\n[[Page S1849]]\n\n       (B) requires the Secretary of State to--\n       (i) develop a strategy to elevate the role of water and \n     sanitation policy; and\n       (ii) improve the effectiveness of United States assistance \n     programs undertaken in support of that strategy;\n       (C) codifies Target 10 of the United Nations Millennium \n     Development Goals; and\n       (D) seeks to reduce by half between 1990 (the baseline \n     year) and 2015--\n       (i) the proportion of people who are unable to reach or \n     afford safe drinking water; and\n       (ii) the proportion of people without access to basic \n     sanitation.\n       (2) On December 20, 2006, the United Nations General \n     Assembly, in GA Resolution 61/192, declared 2008 as the \n     International Year of Sanitation, in recognition of the \n     impact of sanitation on public health, poverty reduction, \n     economic and social development, and the environment.\n       (3) On August 1, 2008, Congress passed H. Con. Res. 318, \n     which--\n       (A) supports the goals and ideals of the International Year \n     of Sanitation; and\n       (B) recognizes the importance of sanitation on public \n     health, poverty reduction, economic and social development, \n     and the environment.\n       (4) While progress is being made on safe water and \n     sanitation efforts--\n       (A) more than 884,000,000 people throughout the world lack \n     access to safe drinking water; and\n       (B) 2 of every 5 people in the world do not have access to \n     basic sanitation services.\n       (5) The health consequences of unsafe drinking water and \n     poor sanitation are significant, accounting for--\n       (A) nearly 10 percent of the global burden of disease; and\n       (B) more than 2,000,000 deaths each year.\n       (6) Water scarcity has negative consequences for \n     agricultural productivity and food security for the \n     1,200,000,000 people who, as of 2010, suffer from chronic \n     hunger and seriously threatens the ability of the world to \n     more than double food production to meet the demands of a \n     projected population of 9,000,000,000 people by 2050.\n       (7) According to the November 2008 report entitled, \n     ``Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World'', the National \n     Intelligence Council expects rapid urbanization and future \n     population growth to exacerbate already limited access to \n     water, particularly in agriculture-based economies.\n       (8) According to the 2005 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, \n     commissioned by the United Nations, more than \\1/5\\ of the \n     world population relies on freshwater that is either polluted \n     or excessively withdrawn.\n       (9) The impact of water scarcity on conflict and \n     instability is evident in many parts of the world, including \n     the Darfur region of Sudan, where demand for water resources \n     has contributed to armed conflict between nomadic ethnic \n     groups and local farming communities.\n       (10) In order to further the United States contribution to \n     safe water and sanitation efforts, it is necessary to--\n       (A) expand foreign assistance capacity to address the \n     challenges described in this section; and\n       (B) represent issues related to water and sanitation at the \n     highest levels of United States foreign assistance and \n     diplomatic deliberations, including those related to issues \n     of global health, food security, the environment, global \n     warming, and maternal and child mortality.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the United States should \n     help undertake a global effort to bring sustainable access to \n     clean water and sanitation to poor people throughout the \n     world.\n\n     SEC. 4. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is--\n       (1) to enable first-time access to safe water and \n     sanitation, on a sustainable basis, for 100,000,000 people in \n     high priority countries (as designated under section 6(f) of \n     the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005 (22 \n     U.S.C. 2152h note) within 6 years of the date of enactment of \n     this Act through direct funding, development activities, and \n     partnerships; and\n       (2) to enhance the capacity of the United States Government \n     to fully implement the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor \n     Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-121).\n\n     SEC. 5.

A bill to permanently reauthorize the EB-E Regional Center \nProgram; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Creating \nAmerican Jobs Through Foreign Capital Investment Act. This bill does \none simple thing: It makes the EB-5 regional center program permanent. \nThe EB-5 Regional Center Program has been highly successful since its \ninception in 1992, but it has always lacked the security of assured \ncontinuity. Extending the program by a few years at a time hampers the \ngrowth of the program and creates a disincentive for immigrant \ninvestors to bring their capital investments to the United States. EB-5 \nregional center programs have drawn jobs and millions of investment \ndollars to struggling communities and regions of our country. We can \nexpand these job-creating\n\n[[Page S1851]]\n\nprograms and allow new regional centers to compete for investments with \nquality projects--if the EB-5 authorization is made permanent in law.\n  The State of Vermont and Vermont entrepreneurs recognized the \npotential of this program early on, and Vermont gained regional center \nstatus in 1997. Our State and the Vermont entrepreneurs who took \nadvantage of the regional center planned their projects with great \ncare. As a result, both the State and our entrepreneurs have \nsuccessfully attracted investors and created jobs. Other states have \ntaken note of Vermont's success, and today there are now about 135 \ndesignated regional center programs across the country, which are \ncreating jobs in States like Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, \nIowa, and New York, to name just a few.\n  A regional center program is an economic engine for the state or \nregion in which it is located. In a small state like Vermont, the \neconomic activity generated by EB-5 projects at resorts like Jay Peak \nand Sugarbush has created direct jobs in those communities. Some of \nthose jobs are for the construction and expansion phase, and others are \nfor long-term employees of the resorts. These resort expansions bring \nmore tourists to Vermont to enjoy skiing and summertime activities. \nThen there are the multiplier effects of these projects. Our visitors \nspend money while skiing and touring Vermont, supporting other Vermont \nbusinesses with every purchase they make. The economic activity is not \nlimited to tourism, and there are other innovative projects in the \npipeline in Vermont--projects like biotechnology; water purification; \nand manufacturing. Because the entire State of Vermont is a designated \nregional center, there is great potential for diversity both in terms \nof projects and geographic location.\n  The Regional Center program attracts foreign investors seeking legal \npermanent residency and a chance to invest in the American economy. \nInvestors must pledge a minimum of $500,000 to a project within a \nRegional Center, and they independently apply for EB-5 visas. If \napproved by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration, USCIS, foreign investors \nare granted conditional 2-year green cards. After 2 years, these \ninvestors must provide proof that they have created at least 10 jobs as \na result of their investments, and that they have met additional \ninvestment requirements set by USCIS.\n  The Federal Government authorizes approximately 388,000 green cards \neach year. Out of that number, only 10,000 annually are reserved for \nthe EB-5 program. The vast majority of the green cards issued by our \nGovernment are family-based and available to anyone who meets the \nadmissibility criteria, irrespective of personal wealth. It is true \nthat this program requires a significant up-front investment from a \nprospective immigrant, but that does not disadvantage others who wish \nto become permanent residents. Most importantly, that investment \ndirectly benefits American communities and workers at no cost to \nAmerican taxpayers. Similar programs have long yielded extraordinary \neconomic benefits for the people of Canada, Australia and other \ncountries.\n  There is virtually no substantive opposition to the EB-5 program. \nMost elected officials will agree that creating jobs and capital \ninvestment is a good, bipartisan goal.\n  The bill I introduce today makes the program permanent, but I am also \nworking on a broader package of improvements to the EB-5 program to \nmodernize it and ensure it operates efficiently, and as Congress \nintended. We must make sure that the immigration agency has the tools \nit needs to keep the program free from fraud and abuse. We must offer \nstakeholders an efficient process with fair standards so that they have \nconfidence in the program. I am developing legislation in consultation \nwith stakeholders and agency officials to make changes that will bring \nabout lasting improvements for everyone involved.\n  The EB-5 regional center program is one small corner of our overall \nimmigration system--and it is one that generates tangible, ongoing \neconomic benefits for Americans in the form of jobs and capital \ninvestment in local communities. It is an American success story, and \nwe can build on its success with a continuing charter, with careful \ncultivation, and with appropriate oversight.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 642\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 105\n\n       Whereas the people of Belarus have lived under the brutal \n     dictatorship of Alexander Lukashenko for almost 2 decades;\n\n[[Page S1852]]\n\n       Whereas, under Mr. Lukashenko's rule, Belarus--which is \n     known as ``the last dictatorship of Europe''--has defied the \n     post-Soviet democratic transformation that swept eastern and \n     central Europe by maintaining an abhorrent human and \n     political rights record and denying its citizens fundamental \n     freedoms;\n       Whereas, according to the United States Department of State \n     2009 Human Rights Country Report on Belarus, elections in \n     Belarus are consistently unfair and undemocratic; politically \n     motivated arrests and detentions are ongoing; Belarus' \n     judiciary is not independent; beatings, poor treatment, and \n     disease are widespread in prisons in Belarus, where detainees \n     lack access to food, proper clothing, and medical treatment; \n     and the Government of Belarus has severely and systematically \n     restricted basic freedoms of press, speech, assembly, \n     association, and religion;\n       Whereas Mr. Lukashenko had an opportunity to move Belarus \n     closer to the community of democracies by holding free and \n     fair presidential elections on December 19, 2010, and \n     allowing for multiple opposition candidates to run for \n     president;\n       Whereas the Lukashenko regime squandered this opportunity \n     for the people of Belarus by orchestrating a fraudulent \n     election that failed to meet minimal international standards;\n       Whereas, following the elections, the Lukashenko regime \n     arrested 5 of the 6 opposition presidential candidates, \n     severely beating one candidate, Uladzimir Niakliayeu, and \n     arbitrarily beating many of the thousands of Belarusians who \n     were peacefully protesting the stolen election in the largest \n     public demonstration the country had seen in over 5 years;\n       Whereas, during the course of election day and its \n     aftermath, Lukashenko's security forces, the State Security \n     Agency (KGB), detained or arrested over 600 additional \n     people, including journalists, civil society representatives, \n     political activists, and ordinary Belarusians who were \n     peacefully seeking to exercise their fundamental human rights \n     to free assembly and expression;\n       Whereas the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe's Election Observation Mission, which monitored the \n     election in Belarus, issued a statement of preliminary \n     findings and conclusions on December 20, 2010, that \n     criticized the election's campaign environment as \n     ``characterized by the lack of a level-playing field'' and \n     reported that international observers assessed the vote count \n     as ``non-transparent'' and ``bad or very bad in almost half \n     of all observed polling stations'';\n       Whereas, according to Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe observers, prominent international \n     websites, including Gmail and Hotmail, and Belarusian \n     websites including Charter97.org, euroradio.by, gazetaby.com, \n     and zapraudu.info were rendered inaccessible on election day;\n       Whereas, on February 22, 2011, the Organization for \n     Security and Cooperation in Europe stated in its final report \n     on the December 19, 2010, election that the final vote count \n     was ``flawed and lacked transparency'';\n       Whereas Department of State spokesperson Philip J. Crowley \n     said on December 20, 2010, ``We cannot consider the election \n     results as legitimate.'';\n       Whereas, on December 20, 2010, the Obama Administration \n     called for the release of all detained presidential \n     candidates and protestors arrested around the election and \n     strongly condemned the violence used by the Lukashenko regime \n     to ``undermine the democratic process'';\n       Whereas on December 23, 2010, Secretary of State Hillary \n     Clinton and European Union High Representative for Foreign \n     Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton strongly \n     condemned the Lukashenko regime's disproportionate use of \n     violence and called for ``the immediate release of the \n     presidential candidates and the over 600 demonstrators who \n     have been taken into custody in the wake of the presidential \n     elections in Belarus'';\n       Whereas the heads of the foreign affairs committees of the \n     German and Polish parliaments issued a joint statement on \n     December 31, 2010, stating that the presidential election in \n     Belarus showed ``a complete lack of respect for European \n     values and standards'';\n       Whereas, on January 20, 2011, the European Parliament \n     adopted a resolution that condemns the December 19, 2010, \n     elections in Belarus and their violent aftermath; demands the \n     immediate and unconditional release of political prisoners; \n     and calls for ``new elections to be held'' in Belarus under \n     ``free and democratic conditions'' and ``according to OSCE \n     standards'';\n       Whereas, on December 31, 2010, the Government of Belarus \n     refused to extend the mandate of the Organization for \n     Security and Cooperation in Europe office in Minsk, thereby \n     shuttering the democratic institution building efforts of the \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in \n     Belarus;\n       Whereas, on January 4, 2011, Department of State \n     spokesperson Philip J. Crowley and Darren Ennis, Spokesperson \n     for European Union High Representative Catherine Ashton, \n     issued a joint statement expressing regret over the closure \n     of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \n     Office in Belarus and calling on authorities in Belarus ``to \n     fulfill their commitments to the OSCE by reforming the \n     election process and providing greater respect for human \n     rights'';\n       Whereas the Belarusian KGB continues to detain at least 32 \n     political opposition leaders and activists associated with \n     the December 19, 2010, elections who face dubious charges \n     that carry prison sentences up to 15 years;\n       Whereas, on February 28, 2011, Ales Mikhalevich, a \n     presidential candidate who was arrested following the \n     December 19, 2010, elections and released on January 19, \n     2011, issued a statement detailing the abuse and torture that \n     he endured during his 2-month detention by the Belarusian \n     KGB, in violation of existing Belarusian laws as well as \n     international agreements, including the Convention against \n     Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \n     Punishment, done at New York December 10, 1984, to which \n     Belarus has been a signatory since December 1985;\n       Whereas families of presidential candidates and political \n     opposition leaders and their lawyers face continued \n     harassment and intimidation by Lukashenko's KGB, including \n     repeated interrogations, raids, pressure, and threats of \n     dismissal from places of employment and schools;\n       Whereas the detained presidential candidates and political \n     opposition leaders are being denied regular access to family, \n     lawyers, medical treatment, and open legal proceedings;\n       Whereas authorities in Belarus continue to carry out \n     searches and seizures across the country, including the \n     offices and homes of journalists, political activists, civil \n     society representatives, former presidential candidates and \n     their advisers, and ordinary Belarusians with tenuous \n     connections to members of the political opposition;\n       Whereas, according to the Stockholm International Peace \n     Research Institute, an internationally reputable source on \n     global arms trade, the Lukashenko regime delivered a shipment \n     of military equipment to the Qaddafi regime in Libya in \n     February 2011, just before Qaddafi prepared to initiate the \n     widely condemned bloody crackdown undertaken against the \n     people of Libya;\n       Whereas, on January 31, 2011, the United States and the \n     European Union imposed targeted travel and financial \n     sanctions on an expanded list of officials of the Government \n     of Belarus, including Alexander Lukashenko and those helping \n     prop up his regime;\n       Whereas, on January 31, 2011, the United States Government \n     also restricted economic transactions with Lakokraska OAO and \n     Polotsk Steklovolokno OAO, 2 subsidiaries of Belarus's \n     largest state-owned petroleum and chemical conglomerate, \n     Belneftekhim;\n       Whereas, on February 2, 2011, the United States Government \n     pledged to supplement its democracy assistance to Belarus by \n     $4,000,000 in fiscal year 2011;\n       Whereas, on March 2, 2011, Lukashenko's regime sentenced 3 \n     of the political detainees, Alyaksandr Atroshchankau, \n     Zmitster Novik, and Alyaksandr Malchanau, to between 3 and 4 \n     years in a top-security prison;\n       Whereas on March 4, 2011, Department of State Spokesman \n     P.J. Crowley said, ``The United States remains gravely \n     concerned over the continuing post-election crackdown by the \n     Government of Belarus on civil society, independent media, \n     and the political opposition. Through its ongoing detentions, \n     trials, and harsh prison sentences, the government is \n     creating new political prisoners. We urge the unconditional \n     release of those detained in the crackdown without trials, \n     and the creation of space for the free expression of \n     political views, the development of civil society, and the \n     ability of citizens to expand their contact with open \n     societies.''; and\n       Whereas Congress passed the Belarus Democracy Act of 2004 \n     (Public Law 108-347) and the Belarus Democracy \n     Reauthorization Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-480) as \n     expressions of support consistent with these aims: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the December 19, 2010, election in Belarus as \n     illegitimate, fraudulent, and not representative of the will \n     or the aspirations of the voters in Belarus, and joins the \n     European Parliament in calling for new elections to be held \n     in Belarus that meet international standards;\n       (2) condemns the beating, arrest, fining, and imprisonment \n     of presidential candidates, opposition leaders, and activists \n     by Alexander Lukashenko's KGB in the wake of the December 19, \n     2010, election;\n       (3) condemns the Lukashenko regime's systematic efforts to \n     prevent freedom of expression and association in Belarus, \n     including its efforts to censor the Internet and stifle \n     freedom of the press;\n       (4) stands in solidarity with the people of Belarus, those \n     political prisoners being unjustly detained, and those who \n     continue to fight for peaceful democratic change and their \n     fundamental human rights in Belarus;\n       (5) applauds the pledges of the United States Government \n     and the European Union to impose targeted sanctions, \n     including visa bans and asset freezes, on Belarusian \n     officials and their associates responsible for the recent \n     crackdown and human rights abuses against the people of \n     Belarus;\n       (6) applauds the decisions of the United States Government, \n     the European Union, and other democratic allies to expand \n     assistance to civil society in Belarus;\n       (7) calls on the Lukashenko regime--\n       (A) to immediately and unconditionally release all \n     political prisoners in Belarus who were arrested in \n     association with the December 19, 2010, election, including 3 \n     presidential candidates, Andrei Sannikov, Nikolai\n\n[[Page S1853]]\n\n     Statkevich, and Uladzimir Nyaklyaeu, who are still in prison \n     or under house arrest;\n       (B) to immediately cease the harassment of the families, \n     friends, and lawyers of political prisoners in Belarus;\n       (C) to authorize the extension of the mandate of the \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Office in \n     Belarus;\n       (D) to hold new presidential and parliamentary elections in \n     Belarus that are free, fair, inclusive, and meet \n     international standards; and\n       (E) to meet its international obligations and cease any \n     illegal efforts related to the provision of arms to rogue \n     regimes;\n       (8) urges the President and the Secretary of State--\n       (A) to continue to closely coordinate United States and \n     European Union policies towards Belarus;\n       (B) to resume direct technical and material support to the \n     opposition and civil society in Belarus, including political \n     parties, civic groups, and independent media outlets;\n       (C) to ensure that the United States list includes any \n     other officials of the Government of Belarus responsible for \n     the crackdown following the December 19, 2010, election in \n     Belarus, associated human rights abuses, and the continued \n     detention, prosecution, and mistreatment of all political \n     prisoners, and to impose targeted sanctions on those \n     individuals and their family members where warranted; and\n       (D) to identify any other entities that enrich Mr. \n     Lukashenko and his regime at the expense of the people of \n     Belarus and prohibit business with and freeze the assets of \n     such entities;\n       (9) urges the European Union--\n       (A) to join the United States in prohibiting business with, \n     and freezing the assets of, the Belarusian state-owned oil \n     and petrochemicals company Belneftekhim and its subsidiaries \n     Lakokraska OAO and Polotsk Steklovolokno OAO, as well as \n     other entities that enrich Mr. Lukashenko and his regime at \n     the expense of the people of Belarus;\n       (B) to cut all European projects linked to the authorities \n     in Belarus responsible for the crackdown and associated human \n     rights abuses and to exclude officials of the Government of \n     Belarus from meetings under the European Union's Eastern \n     Partnership policy--including the planned European Union \n     summit with post-Soviet countries scheduled to take place in \n     Budapest in May 2011--but to ensure that this suspension not \n     apply to nongovernmental and civil society organizations in \n     Belarus;\n       (C) to ensure that the European Union list includes any \n     other officials of the Government of Belarus responsible for \n     the crackdown following the December 19, 2010, election in \n     Belarus, associated human rights abuses, and the continued \n     detention, prosecution, and mistreatment of political \n     prisoners, and to impose targeted sanctions on those \n     officials and their family members where warranted;

Res. 51\n\n       Whereas the ancient Greeks developed the concept of \n     democracy, in which the supreme power to govern was vested in \n     the people;\n       Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States, many of \n     whom read Greek political philosophy in the original Greek, \n     drew heavily on the political experience and philosophy of \n     ancient Greece in forming our representative democracy;\n       Whereas Greek Commander in Chief Petros Mavromichalis, a \n     founder of the modern Greek state, said to the citizens of \n     the United States in 1821 that ``it is in your land that \n     liberty has fixed her abode and . . . in imitating you, we \n     shall imitate our ancestors and be thought worthy of them if \n     we succeed in resembling you'';\n       Whereas the Greek national anthem, the ``Hymn to Liberty'', \n     includes the words, ``Most heartily was gladdened George \n     Washington's brave land'';\n\n[[Page S1875]]\n\n       Whereas the people of the United States generously offered \n     humanitarian assistance to the Greek people during their \n     struggle for independence;\n       Whereas Greece played a major role in the World War II \n     struggle to protect freedom and democracy through such \n     bravery as was shown in the historic Battle of Crete, which \n     provided the Axis land war with its first major setback, \n     setting off a chain of events that significantly affected the \n     outcome of World War II;\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of Greek civilians were \n     killed in Greece during World War II in defense of the values \n     of the Allies;\n       Whereas, throughout the 20th century, Greece was one of a \n     few countries that allied with the United States in every \n     major international conflict;\n       Whereas Greece is a strategic partner and ally of the \n     United States in bringing political stability and economic \n     development to the volatile Balkan region, having invested \n     more than $20,000,000,000 in the countries of the region, \n     thereby helping to create more than 200,000 new jobs, and \n     having contributed more than $750,000,000 in development aid \n     for the region;\n       Whereas Greece actively participates in peacekeeping and \n     peace-building operations conducted by international \n     organizations including the United Nations, the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization, the European Union, and the \n     Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe;\n       Whereas Greece received worldwide praise for its \n     extraordinary handling during the 2004 Olympic Games of more \n     than 14,000 athletes and more than 2,000,000 spectators and \n     journalists, a feat Greece handled efficiently, securely, and \n     with hospitality;\n       Whereas Greece, located in a region where Christianity \n     meets Islam and Judaism, maintains excellent relations with \n     Muslim nations and Israel;\n       Whereas the Government of Greece has taken important steps \n     in recent years to further cross-cultural understanding and \n     rapprochement with Turkey, as seen by Prime Minister of \n     Greece George Papandreou's trip to Turkey, just days after \n     being elected and the Prime Minister of Turkey Recep Tayyip \n     Erdogan's visit to Greece in May 2010, during which Greece \n     and Turkey established a Joint Ministerial Council, made up \n     of 10 ministers from each country, to discuss tangible ways \n     to enhance cooperation in various fields of interest;\n       Whereas Greece and the United States are at the forefront \n     of the effort for freedom, democracy, peace, stability, and \n     human rights;\n       Whereas those and similar ideals have forged a close bond \n     between Greece and the United States;

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of S. Res. 105.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 105) to condemn the December 19, \n     2010, elections in Belarus, and to call for the immediate \n     release of all political prisoners and for new elections that \n     meet international standards.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, much of the world's recent attention has \nunderstandably been on the Middle East--and of course this week on the \nterrible situation with one of America's closest allies--Japan. I \nunderstand that USAID has sent disaster relief teams to help in the \nearthquake and tsunami devastated cities and that the U.S. aircraft \ncarrier USS Ronald Reagan is off the coast to help with relief \noperations.\n  Events there are truly heartbreaking and we stand in solidarity with \nour Japanese friends during this time of continued crisis and \nrebuilding.\n  Amid these major global events I want to make sure we don't lose \nsight of the continuing political repression in the last dictatorship \nof Europe--Belarus.\n  You see, despite the transformations that swept through eastern and \ncentral Europe following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Belarus \nremains stuck in time under the tyranny of Alexander Lukashenko, who \nhas ruled the country with an iron fist for most of the last two \ndecades.\n  Lukashenko's security forces that help prop up his illegitimate \nregime are actually still called the KGB--and they have the same \ndespicable tactics as the old Soviet KGB.\n  Under Lukashenko's regime, those who dare to speak up against the \ngovernment or attempt to participate in any semblance of democratic \nactivity find themselves arrested, beaten, or worse.\n  In December, six of the seven candidates who chose to run against \nLukashenko were arrested on election day when protesting the sham \nelectoral process. Some were beaten and one, Vladimir Nekliaev, was \neven yanked out of a hospital and taken for interrogation by \nLukashenko's KGB henchmen.\n  Over 600 other protesters were also arrested.\n  I had the opportunity to visit Belarus some weeks after the election \nand meet with the family members of these brave candidates and \nactivists and I must tell you, it was a very moving experience.\n  I want to tell you about Milana Mikhalevich a 34-year-old mother of \ntwo, whose husband Ales was a Presidential candidate.\n  She told me of her harassment by Belarusian officials since her \nhusband's arrest; how they denied her access to see him or even \nexchange letters. Any attorneys brave enough to defend him faced \ndisbarment or criminal charges.\n  As she described this Lukashenka nightmare, Milana's 14-month-old \ndaughter Alena scrambled around her feet--her father held somewhere in \na Lukashenka KGB nightmare.\n  Just a few weeks ago Ales was finally released from detention. He \npromptly issued a statement detailing the abuse and torture that he \nendured in his 2-month KGB detention, including being beaten, stripped \nnaked, and hung by his hands.\n  He said that following his torture he was forced to sign a document \nin which he pledged to cooperate, noting ``after my joints crunched I \ndid all they wanted.''\n  Madam President, can anyone believe this kind of barbarism is still \nhappening in Europe?\n  At the end of January, following repeated condemnations of the \nDecember election and demands for the release of all political \nprisoners, the United States and the European Union imposed targeted \ntravel and financial sanctions on Lukashenko and his group of enablers.\n  Tragically, since then, Lukashenko's KGB has continued daily raids on \nthe homes and offices of those suspected of ties to the democratic \nopposition, human rights organizations, or independent media.\n  Lukashenko has ignored election monitor reports questioning the \ncredibility of the election and international demands to release all \npolitical prisoners. He has pulled his country even further into \nisolation and made it the subject of international scorn.\n  Following the old Soviet playbook, his government has tried to blame \noutside forces and other countries--everyone but Lukashenko himself--\nfor the shameful political mess he has created.\n  You may have read his very troubling interview recently in the \nWashington Post in which he brazenly claimed ``We told you clearly that \nthere is no less democracy in Belarus than there is in the United \nStates'' and that despite the international condemnation and sanctions, \nhe would order the same arrests and repression on election night all \nover again given the chance.\n  Just last week his government formally sentenced a number of \nprotesters to terms of between 3-4 years in a high security prison. \nOthers still face trials and possible 15 year sentences.\n  That is why last week, Senators Lieberman, McCain, Cardin, Shaheen, \nGraham, Kyl, Barrasso, Mark Udall, Kirk, Lautenberg and I submitted a \nSenate resolution on Belarus that, among other things:\n  Condemns the December election as illegitimate and fraudulent and \ncalls for new elections that are genuinely democratic; calls for the \nimmediate release of all political prisoners in\n\n[[Page S1876]]\n\nBelarus and an end to the harassment of their families and lawyers; and \nurges the U.S. and the EU to expand the list of Belarussian officials \nand their families responsible for maintaining Lukashenko's rein of \ntyranny to be subject to travel and asset sanctions.\n  The resolution also calls on the International Ice Hockey Federation \nto suspend its 2014 International World Ice Hockey championship to be \nhosted in Minsk, Belarus until all political prisoners are released.\n  No such distinguished international sport championship should be \nawarded to Lukashenko's dictatorship while political prisoners are \nrotting away and being tortured in his secret KGB prisons.\n  Madam President, the people of Belarus only want the same basic \nfreedoms that so many of us take for granted--and that so many are \nprotesting for in the Middle East--the freedom to choose one's own \ngovernment, to be free from indiscriminate arrest and torture, and to \nspeak and debate issues freely within a democratic process.\n  We in the Senate owe the Belarusian people nothing less than to stand \nin solidarity with them as they continue their struggle.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements related \nto the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 105) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 105\n\n       Whereas the people of Belarus have lived under the brutal \n     dictatorship of Alexander Lukashenko for almost 2 decades;\n       Whereas, under Mr. Lukashenko's rule, Belarus--which is \n     known as ``the last dictatorship of Europe''--has defied the \n     post-Soviet democratic transformation that swept eastern and \n     central Europe by maintaining an abhorrent human and \n     political rights record and denying its citizens fundamental \n     freedoms;\n       Whereas, according to the United States Department of State \n     2009 Human Rights Country Report on Belarus, elections in \n     Belarus are consistently unfair and undemocratic; politically \n     motivated arrests and detentions are ongoing; Belarus' \n     judiciary is not independent; beatings, poor treatment, and \n     disease are widespread in prisons in Belarus, where detainees \n     lack access to food, proper clothing, and medical treatment; \n     and the Government of Belarus has severely and systematically \n     restricted basic freedoms of press, speech, assembly, \n     association, and religion;\n       Whereas Mr. Lukashenko had an opportunity to move Belarus \n     closer to the community of democracies by holding free and \n     fair presidential elections on December 19, 2010, and \n     allowing for multiple opposition candidates to run for \n     president;\n       Whereas the Lukashenko regime squandered this opportunity \n     for the people of Belarus by orchestrating a fraudulent \n     election that failed to meet minimal international standards;\n       Whereas, following the elections, the Lukashenko regime \n     arrested 5 of the 6 opposition presidential candidates, \n     severely beating one candidate, Uladzimir Niakliayeu, and \n     arbitrarily beating many of the thousands of Belarusians who \n     were peacefully protesting the stolen election in the largest \n     public demonstration the country had seen in over 5 years;\n       Whereas, during the course of election day and its \n     aftermath, Lukashenko's security forces, the State Security \n     Agency (KGB), detained or arrested over 600 additional \n     people, including journalists, civil society representatives, \n     political activists, and ordinary Belarusians who were \n     peacefully seeking to exercise their fundamental human rights \n     to free assembly and expression;\n       Whereas the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe's Election Observation Mission, which monitored the \n     election in Belarus, issued a statement of preliminary \n     findings and conclusions on December 20, 2010, that \n     criticized the election's campaign environment as \n     ``characterized by the lack of a level-playing field'' and \n     reported that international observers assessed the vote count \n     as ``non-transparent'' and ``bad or very bad in almost half \n     of all observed polling stations'';\n       Whereas, according to Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe observers, prominent international \n     websites, including Gmail and Hotmail, and Belarusian \n     websites including Charter97.org, euroradio.by, gazetaby.com, \n     and zapraudu.info were rendered inaccessible on election day;\n       Whereas, on February 22, 2011, the Organization for \n     Security and Cooperation in Europe stated in its final report \n     on the December 19, 2010, election that the final vote count \n     was ``flawed and lacked transparency'';\n       Whereas Department of State spokesperson Philip J. Crowley \n     said on December 20, 2010, ``We cannot consider the election \n     results as legitimate.'';\n       Whereas, on December 20, 2010, the Obama Administration \n     called for the release of all detained presidential \n     candidates and protestors arrested around the election and \n     strongly condemned the violence used by the Lukashenko regime \n     to ``undermine the democratic process'';\n       Whereas on December 23, 2010, Secretary of State Hillary \n     Clinton and European Union High Representative for Foreign \n     Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton strongly \n     condemned the Lukashenko regime's disproportionate use of \n     violence and called for ``the immediate release of the \n     presidential candidates and the over 600 demonstrators who \n     have been taken into custody in the wake of the presidential \n     elections in Belarus'';\n       Whereas the heads of the foreign affairs committees of the \n     German and Polish parliaments issued a joint statement on \n     December 31, 2010, stating that the presidential election in \n     Belarus showed ``a complete lack of respect for European \n     values and standards'';\n       Whereas, on January 20, 2011, the European Parliament \n     adopted a resolution that condemns the December 19, 2010, \n     elections in Belarus and their violent aftermath; demands the \n     immediate and unconditional release of political prisoners; \n     and calls for ``new elections to be held'' in Belarus under \n     ``free and democratic conditions'' and ``according to OSCE \n     standards'';\n       Whereas, on December 31, 2010, the Government of Belarus \n     refused to extend the mandate of the Organization for \n     Security and Cooperation in Europe office in Minsk, thereby \n     shuttering the democratic institution building efforts of the \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in \n     Belarus;\n       Whereas, on January 4, 2011, Department of State \n     spokesperson Philip J. Crowley and Darren Ennis, Spokesperson \n     for European Union High Representative Catherine Ashton, \n     issued a joint statement expressing regret over the closure \n     of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \n     Office in Belarus and calling on authorities in Belarus ``to \n     fulfill their commitments to the OSCE by reforming the \n     election process and providing greater respect for human \n     rights'';\n       Whereas the Belarusian KGB continues to detain at least 32 \n     political opposition leaders and activists associated with \n     the December 19, 2010, elections who face dubious charges \n     that carry prison sentences up to 15 years;\n       Whereas, on February 28, 2011, Ales Mikhalevich, a \n     presidential candidate who was arrested following the \n     December 19, 2010, elections and released on January 19, \n     2011, issued a statement detailing the abuse and torture that \n     he endured during his 2-month detention by the Belarusian \n     KGB, in violation of existing Belarusian laws as well as \n     international agreements, including the Convention against \n     Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \n     Punishment, done at New York December 10, 1984, to which \n     Belarus has been a signatory since December 1985;\n       Whereas families of presidential candidates and political \n     opposition leaders and their lawyers face continued \n     harassment and intimidation by Lukashenko's KGB, including \n     repeated interrogations, raids, pressure, and threats of \n     dismissal from places of employment and schools;\n       Whereas the detained presidential candidates and political \n     opposition leaders are being denied regular access to family, \n     lawyers, medical treatment, and open legal proceedings;\n       Whereas authorities in Belarus continue to carry out \n     searches and seizures across the country, including the \n     offices and homes of journalists, political activists, civil \n     society representatives, former presidential candidates and \n     their advisers, and ordinary Belarusians with tenuous \n     connections to members of the political opposition;\n       Whereas, according to the Stockholm International Peace \n     Research Institute, an internationally reputable source on \n     global arms trade, the Lukashenko regime delivered a shipment \n     of military equipment to the Qaddafi regime in Libya in \n     February 2011, just before Qaddafi prepared to initiate the \n     widely condemned bloody crackdown undertaken against the \n     people of Libya;\n       Whereas, on January 31, 2011, the United States and the \n     European Union imposed targeted travel and financial \n     sanctions on an expanded list of officials of the Government \n     of Belarus, including Alexander Lukashenko and those helping \n     prop up his regime;\n       Whereas, on January 31, 2011, the United States Government \n     also restricted economic transactions with Lakokraska OAO and \n     Polotsk Steklovolokno OAO, 2 subsidiaries of Belarus's \n     largest state-owned petroleum and chemical conglomerate, \n     Belneftekhim;\n       Whereas, on February 2, 2011, the United States Government \n     pledged to supplement its democracy assistance to Belarus by \n     $4,000,000 in fiscal year 2011;\n       Whereas, on March 2, 2011, Lukashenko's regime sentenced 3 \n     of the political detainees, Alyaksandr Atroshchankau, \n     Zmitster Novik, and Alyaksandr Malchanau, to between 3 and 4 \n     years in a top-security prison;\n       Whereas on March 4, 2011, Department of State Spokesman \n     P.J. Crowley said, ``The United States remains gravely \n     concerned over the continuing post-election crackdown\n\n[[Page S1877]]\n\n     by the Government of Belarus on civil society, independent \n     media, and the political opposition. Through its ongoing \n     detentions, trials, and harsh prison sentences, the \n     government is creating new political prisoners. We urge the \n     unconditional release of those detained in the crackdown \n     without trials, and the creation of space for the free \n     expression of political views, the development of civil \n     society, and the ability of citizens to expand their contact \n     with open societies.''; and\n       Whereas Congress passed the Belarus Democracy Act of 2004 \n     (Public Law 108-347) and the Belarus Democracy \n     Reauthorization Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-480) as \n     expressions of support consistent with these aims: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the December 19, 2010, election in Belarus as \n     illegitimate, fraudulent, and not representative of the will \n     or the aspirations of the voters in Belarus, and joins the \n     European Parliament in calling for new elections to be held \n     in Belarus that meet international standards;\n       (2) condemns the beating, arrest, fining, and imprisonment \n     of presidential candidates, opposition leaders, and activists \n     by Alexander Lukashenko's KGB in the wake of the December 19, \n     2010, election;\n       (3) condemns the Lukashenko regime's systematic efforts to \n     prevent freedom of expression and association in Belarus, \n     including its efforts to censor the Internet and stifle \n     freedom of the press;\n       (4) stands in solidarity with the people of Belarus, those \n     political prisoners being unjustly detained, and those who \n     continue to fight for peaceful democratic change and their \n     fundamental human rights in Belarus;\n       (5) applauds the pledges of the United States Government \n     and the European Union to impose targeted sanctions, \n     including visa bans and asset freezes, on Belarusian \n     officials and their associates responsible for the recent \n     crackdown and human rights abuses against the people of \n     Belarus;\n       (6) applauds the decisions of the United States Government, \n     the European Union, and other democratic allies to expand \n     assistance to civil society in Belarus;\n       (7) calls on the Lukashenko regime--\n       (A) to immediately and unconditionally release all \n     political prisoners in Belarus who were arrested in \n     association with the December 19, 2010, election, including 3 \n     presidential candidates, Andrei Sannikov, Nikolai Statkevich, \n     and Uladzimir Nyaklyaeu, who are still in prison or under \n     house arrest;\n       (B) to immediately cease the harassment of the families, \n     friends, and lawyers of political prisoners in Belarus;\n       (C) to authorize the extension of the mandate of the \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Office in \n     Belarus;\n       (D) to hold new presidential and parliamentary elections in \n     Belarus that are free, fair, inclusive, and meet \n     international standards;

and\n       (D) to identify any other entities that enrich Mr. \n     Lukashenko and his regime at the expense of the people of \n     Belarus and prohibit business with and freeze the assets of \n     such entities;\n       (9) urges the European Union--\n       (A) to join the United States in prohibiting business with, \n     and freezing the assets of, the Belarusian state-owned oil \n     and petrochemicals company Belneftekhim and its subsidiaries \n     Lakokraska OAO and Polotsk Steklovolokno OAO, as well as \n     other entities that enrich Mr. Lukashenko and his regime at \n     the expense of the people of Belarus;\n       (B) to cut all European projects linked to the authorities \n     in Belarus responsible for the crackdown and associated human \n     rights abuses and to exclude officials of the Government of \n     Belarus from meetings under the European Union's Eastern \n     Partnership policy--including the planned European Union \n     summit with post-Soviet countries scheduled to take place in \n     Budapest in May 2011--but to ensure that this suspension not \n     apply to nongovernmental and civil society organizations in \n     Belarus;\n       (C) to ensure that the European Union list includes any \n     other officials of the Government of Belarus responsible for \n     the crackdown following the December 19, 2010, election in \n     Belarus, associated human rights abuses, and the continued \n     detention, prosecution, and mistreatment of political \n     prisoners, and to impose targeted sanctions on those \n     officials and their family members where warranted;
