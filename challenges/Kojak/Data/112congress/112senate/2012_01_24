Mr. President, for generations this was the American \npromise: If you worked hard and played by the rules, success would be \nwithin your reach. We call that success the American dream--to earn a \ndecent wage, buy a home, put your children through school, and retire \ncomfortably. For many people in this country, that dream has drifted \nfurther and further from reality. The recession cost many Americans \ntheir jobs, homes, savings, and basic economic security. Many are still \nstruggling. Although the economy has made slow progress toward \nrecovery, there is still much more work to be done before every \nAmerican who wants to work can find a job.\n  But the terrible recession is only part of the problem. The same Wall \nStreet greed that caused the financial collapse is fueling the greatest \nincome disparity since the Great Depression. In the last few decades, \nthe average CEO's income has multiplied 250 times. Meanwhile, CEO's \nemployees have watched their incomes creep up barely at all.\n  So America is at a crossroads. As President Lyndon Johnson said in \n1965--and it is time to ask that now--and I quote:\n\n       . . . not only how to create wealth but how to use it; not \n     only how fast we are going, but where we are headed.\n\n  That is what he said. And the path we choose will determine what kind \nof a country we will be. We can choose to be the kind of nation where \nthe hard work of many pays off only for the richest few or we can be \nthe kind of nation where every man and woman shoulders a fair share of \nthe burden and reaps a fair share of the reward. We can be the kind of \ncountry where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer or we can be \nthe kind of country where middle-class families share in the \nopportunity and the prosperity.\n  President Obama has called this choice a ``make or break moment'' for \nthe middle class, and tonight he will lay out a roadmap that sets us on \nthe path to fairness instead of inequality. I look forward to hearing \nPresident Obama's vision this evening. It begins with an economy that \nworks for every American--regardless of the size of his or her \ncheckbook. I expect the President to lay out commonsense ideas to spur \nAmerican manufacturing, create jobs, and help small businesses compete \nand grow. His vision is fueled by homegrown, renewable energy. It is \ntime to stop spending American dollars on foreign oil. It is time to \nhire American workers to build wind turbines and next-generation \nvehicles. The President will propose a new plan to make sure that \ntoday's students are ready for tomorrow's jobs and that today's workers \nremain competitive in our global economy.\n\n[[Page S52]]\n\n  I expect the President to include ideas from Democrats and from \nRepublicans. For 3 years, the President has reached out to Republicans. \nNow is the time to work with him on common ideas to produce \nlegislation, not stalemate. I ask my Republican colleagues to give his \nbipartisan vision the consideration it deserves.\n  In 1947, President Truman delivered the first televised State of the \nUnion Message. Truman was the 20th President to govern alongside a \nCongress controlled by the opposing party. The first was George \nWashington. He said Democrats in the executive branch and Republicans \nin the legislative branch could and should work hand in hand to shape \nthe Nation. This is what he said:\n\n       There are ways of disagreeing; men who differ can still \n     work together sincerely for the common good.\n\n  I hope Republicans in Congress will keep those words in mind tonight. \nDespite all our differences, together we can build an economy that \nworks for the common good of all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/24/senate-section/article/S52-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S52]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, tonight the President of the United \nStates will come to the Capitol to give us his sense of the state of \nthe Union. This is a venerable tradition, and we welcome him. Yet it is \nhard not to feel a sense of disappointment even before tonight's speech \nis delivered because while we do not yet know all the specifics, we do \nknow the goal. Based on what the President's aides have been telling \nreporters, the goal is not to conquer the Nation's problems, it is to \nconquer Republicans. The goal is not to prevent gridlock but to \nguarantee it.\n  Here is how the New York Times summed up the President's election-\nyear strategy in a recent article entitled ``Obama to Turn Up Attacks \non Congress in Campaign.'' Here is the quote:\n\n       In terms of the president's relationship with Congress in \n     2012 . . . the president is no longer tied to Washington, \n     D.C.\n\n  According to the story, winning a full-year extension of the cut in \npayroll taxes is the last--the last--``must do'' piece of legislation \nfor the White House.\n  Here is how a White House aide described the President's election-\nyear strategy just a couple of weeks ago, presumably just as tonight's \nspeech was being drafted. Referring to past displays of bipartisanship, \nhe said:\n\n       [Then] we were in a position of legislative compromise by \n     necessity. That phase is behind us. . . .\n\n  So, as I see it, the message from the White House is that the \nPresident has basically given up. He got nearly everything he wanted \nfrom Congress for the first 2 years of his Presidency. The results are \nin. It is not good. So he has decided to spend the rest of the year \ntrying to convince folks that the results of the economic policies he \nput in place are somehow Congress's fault and not his.\n  Well, my message is this: This debate is not about what Congress may \nor may not do in the future, it is about what this President has \nalready done. The President's policies are now firmly in place. It is \nhis economy now. We are living under the Obama economy. The President \nmay want to come here tonight and make it sound as if he just somehow \nwalked in the door. A better approach is to admit that his 3-year \nexperiment in big government has made our economy worse and our \nNation's future more uncertain and it is time for a different approach. \nThat is the message the American people delivered to the President in \nNovember of 2010, and they are still waiting.\n  The President will tell the American people tonight that he has a \nblueprint for the economy. What he will fail to mention is that we have \nbeen working off the President's blueprint now for 3 years--for 3 \nyears. And what has it gotten us? Millions still looking for work, \ntrillions in debt, and the first credit downgrade in U.S. history.\n  The President will propose ideas tonight that sound good and have \nbipartisan support. If he is serious about these proposals, if he \nreally wants to enact them, he will encourage Democrats who run the \nSenate to keep them free from poison pills such as tax hikes on job \ncreators that we know from past experience turn bipartisan support into \nbipartisan opposition.\n  If the President wants someone to blame for this economy, he should \nstart with himself. The fact is, any CEO in America with a record like \nthis after 3 years on the job would be graciously shown the door. This \nPresident blames the managers instead. He blames the folks on the shop \nfloor. He blames the weather.\n  Well, you are certainly within your rights to walk away from the \nlegislative process if you like, Mr. President. You can point the \nfinger all you like. But you cannot walk away from your record.\n  I saw a survey the other day that contained a number of sobering \nfindings. It was a poll of small business leaders. It said that more \nthan 8 out of 10 of them now believe the U.S. economy is on the wrong \ntrack. Eight in ten said they would rather have Washington stay out of \nthe way than try to help them. Nearly 9 out of 10 said they would \nrather have more certainty from Washington than assistance. And it said \nthat nearly one-third of all those surveyed said they are not hiring on \naccount of the health care bill. One-third of them said they were not \nhiring on account of the health care bill. What this survey says to me \nis that the policies of this administration are literally crushing--\ncrushing--the private sector. They are stifling job creation, and they \nare holding the economy back.\n  Americans want Washington to get out of the way. Yet this President \ncontinues to have the same two-word answer he has always had for \nseemingly every single problem we face: more government. And this is \nthe economy we have to show for it.\n  Last week, the President had an opportunity to do something on his \nown about the ongoing jobs crisis. The only thing that stood in the way \nof the single biggest shovel-ready infrastructure project in America \nwas him. The Keystone Pipeline was just the kind of project he had been \ncalling for in speeches for months, and he said no; that one could \nwait. Here is a project he knew would create thousands of jobs \ninstantly. He said no. A project that would not have cost taxpayers a \ndime. He said no. That would have brought more energy from our ally \nCanada and less from the Middle East. He said no. It all came down to \none question: Was the Keystone Pipeline in the national interest? He \nsaid no.\n  As one columnist put it, his own standard was not the national \ninterest, it was his own political interest. Americans want jobs, and \nthe President is studying an election that took place 60 years ago to \nsee how he can save his own job.\n  He sided with the liberal environmental base over the energy and \nsecurity interests of the American people. That is exactly what we are \nnow being told we can expect for the rest of the year.\n\n  In last year's State of the Union, the President talked about how we \nneed to win the future--win the future. This year he just wants to win \nthe next campaign. The President can decide he is not interested in \nworking with Congress if his party only controls one-half of it. That \nis his prerogative. He can give up on bipartisanship, but we will not; \nour problems are too urgent. The economy is too weak. The future is too \nuncertain.\n  The President knows as well as I do that when he has called for \naction on things for which there exists bipartisan support, Republicans \nhave been his strongest allies. Last year in the State of the Union, he \ncalled for free-trade agreements. We worked hard to get them done and \nwe did. Since then he called for an extension of the highway and FAA \nbills and the jobs that come with them. We did both with strong \nbipartisan support. The President asked\n\n[[Page S53]]\n\nfor patent reform. We got that done too.\n  The President knows as well as we do we are happy to work with him \nwhenever he is willing to work with us. If he turns his back on that \ngood-faith offer, as we expect he will this year, we will remind people \nthe problems we face are not about what Congress may or may not do in \nthe future but what this President has already done--what has already \nhappened.\n  Let the President turn his back on bipartisanship, let the press \ncover every futile speech and every staged event, but we intend to do \nour jobs. We invite him to join us.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/24/senate-section/article/S53-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S53]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I listened to the speech just given by the \nRepublican leader of the Senate. He expresses a sentiment Americans \nshare; that it is time for us to work together in the Senate and the \nHouse, across the board in Washington, and solve the problems which \nAmerican families face every single day.\n  I agree with him completely. Unfortunately, the record does not \nreflect the level of cooperation which the American people are \nexpecting. It was hardly a month or two into the Obama administration \nwhen the Republican leader announced that his highest priority was to \nmake certain Barack Obama was a one-term President.\n  It is difficult to establish a working relationship when the first \nwords out of a Republican leader's mouth are: We are going to defeat \nyou. Then, as we addressed the largest issues of the day, time and \nagain, we found little or no bipartisan cooperation. I think back to \nthe important, historic debate on health care. If there was ever a \nmoment when we should have come together with a bipartisan solution, it \nwas that moment.\n  Despite the best efforts of Senator Baucus, the Democratic Finance \nchair and others, we were unable to even get a core group of \nRepublicans to join us in this conversation about containing the \noverwhelming increase in the cost of health care. At the end of the \nday, after one of the most painfully long and rancorous debates in \nSenate history, not one single Republican Senator would vote for health \ncare reform--not one.\n  The same thing held true when it came to Wall Street reform. Many of \nus felt the recession we are currently coming out of was created by \nmismanagement and greed at the highest levels of our financial \ninstitutions. Many of us were angered by the fact that we were called \non, with a political gun to our heads, and told, if we do not pass a \nbailout program for the biggest banks in America, our economy will \ncrater and the weakest, poorest people in America will suffer the most.\n  That was our choice, our Faustian choice given at that moment. Many \nof us were determined to never let that happen again. So we put \ntogether a Wall Street reform bill. Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut, \nnow retired, led the effort on the Democratic side, and we tried to \ncome up with a bipartisan bill. We worked to do it. He was masterful in \nhis day and did everything in his power to make it a bipartisan bill. \nYet at the end of the day, not one single Republican would vote for \nWall Street reform--not one.\n  Now, on the campaign trial, we hear from Republican candidates that \nthey are going to repeal Wall Street reform. They are going to repeal \nhealth care reform. They are not creating an environment that is \nconducive to the level of cooperation of which Senator McConnell \nearlier spoke.\n  I hope he is right; that even in this Presidential election year, we \ncan find some common ground. There are several items which are \nimmediately before us which require it: First, the extension of the \npayroll tax cut. This is a cut that helps working families across \nAmerica and helps the economy. It will expire at the end of February if \nwe do not reach a bipartisan agreement to extend it, along with \nunemployment benefits.\n  Secondly, postal reform. Many of the suggestions that have been made \nby the Postmaster General about saving money at the post office create \nreal hardship in States such as Illinois, where some nine different \nmail processing facilities would be closed, closed in areas where I, \nfrankly, could never justify it because they do a volume of work, do it \nwell, and perform a valuable function. We have a chance. By May 15, the \ndeadline which the Postmaster General agreed to in my office--by May \n15, if we enact legislation signed by the President to save money and \nkeep the post office running in the right direction, then we can avoid \nsome of these onerous cuts and choices we have heard about.\n  But the burden falls on Congress, Democrats and Republicans, to \nachieve it. I hope we can.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/24/senate-section/article/S53-4", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S53-S56]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CUBA AND HAITI\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last week, I had the opportunity to visit \ntwo island nations near our shores, Cuba and Haiti. Each is facing \nenormous problems--in Cuba, how to reform a Communist dictatorship of \nover half a century into a modern democratic member of the community of \nnations, and in Haiti how to rebuild from a devastating earthquake of 2 \nyears ago in a nation already one of the poorest on Earth.\n  I concluded the trip more optimistic about Haiti, despite all its \nchallenges, than Cuba, which quite simply appeared frozen in time in an \nideology which should be cast aside for a more modern view of how to \nprogress in the 21st century.\n  Let me start with Cuba. I am no fan of the Castro regime, but I am \nalso no fan of the foreign policy of the United States. When I look \nback at what we tried to achieve for over 50 years in Cuba, any honest, \nobjective analysis will have to tell you we did not achieve our goal. \nFidel Castro is not a casualty of our own foreign policy; he is a \ncasualty of old age. He is still there, and his brother now reins as \nhis successor in Cuba.\n  Despite some notable achievement in this nation of Cuba, in areas \nsuch as health and education--and I saw firsthand as I traveled around \nsome of these achievements--the government has maintained a grip on \nthis island which is unfair to many of the people who live there.\n  Political opposition is swiftly and harshly repressed, often with \nsevere prison sentences and deeply troubling harassment. Those pursuing \ngreater political freedom of government accountability at times even \nfind their young children threatened, as was sadly noted in the New \nYork Times on Sunday.\n  In this most recent incident, Maritza Pelegrino Cabrales found \nherself repeatedly harassed by government officials for associating \nwith the Ladies in White, a group of wives, mothers, and daughters, of \npolitical prisoners. Incredibly, state security officers threatened to \ntake away her 5- and 7-year-old daughters.\n  Other brave Cubans, such as Oswaldo Paya, who collected thousands of \nsignatures on a petition calling for modest political change, found \nhimself and his colleagues harassed and in some cases jailed. \nTragically, the petition process for change was actually called for in \nthe Cuban Constitution. He was only following the Constitution of his \ncountry, and he ended up being harassed and many who supported him \narrested.\n  Nonetheless, under President Raul Castro, there has been some modest \nreform, the conditional release of some political prisoners, and some \neconomic reform. There has also been some serious oil exploration \nunderway off the coast of Cuba. I wanted to go to Cuba for the first \ntime to visit that part of\n\n[[Page S54]]\n\nCuba, other than Guantanamo, to see what changes had taken place, to \nsee what preparations the Cuban Government had made for offshore oil \ndrilling within 50 miles of the State of Florida's coast, to see if the \nUnited States and Cuba could work together on potential environmental \nconcerns related to such offshore drilling, to see if the 50-plus years \nof U.S. isolation were having the intended affect of creating a climate \nof political and economic reform.\n  Most important, I wished to talk to the Cuban Government about a 62-\nyear-old American development worker, Alan Gross of Maryland, who has \nbeen imprisoned by the Cuban regime for more than 2 years. Gross was \nsentenced to 15 years for bringing Internet equipment to Cuba for the \nisland's small Jewish community--15 years for bringing equipment to \nCuba which any American could purchase at Radio Shack.\n  Fifteen years in prison, can anyone imagine that in today's world? \nThat is a fact in Cuba. I sat for 2 hours with Mr. Gross. I am grateful \nthe government let me do that. I did not know him in advance. I had \nheard a lot about him, but I took the measure of a man who is living \nunder the most trying circumstances during that 2-hour meeting.\n  Alan Gross is no spy. He is no terrorist. He is no threat to Cuba or \nits future. He is a humble and kind man. He was not trying to overthrow \ntheir government. He was simply trying to expand communications and \nopenness in Cuba. Now, while his family suffers in his absence back \nhome, he languishes in a Cuban military hospital, a prisonlike \natmosphere.\n  He told me what happened when he came to Cuba. He said: Understand, I \nused my American passport with my name and flew in on a Cuban-owned \nairline, landed in Havana and took every piece of equipment I was \nbringing in through Customs and stood there while they took each piece \nout of the box and inspected it. At one point, the Customs official \nsaid to him: What is this?\n  He said: It is a router.\n  He said: I am not sure you can bring it in.\n  At which point, Gross said: Then keep it. Just give me your name. I \nwill come back and claim it as I leave the country.\n  The man said: No, wait a minute. Maybe if I charge you a duty you can \nbring it in.\n  Gross said: How much is the duty?\n  The man said: How much did it cost? Because it is 100 percent we are \ngoing to charge you.\n  He said: It cost $100.\n  The duty is $100 then.\n  He paid the $100 and all the equipment passed through Customs, right \non the table, inspected piece by piece. He brought it into the country. \nHe stayed at a Cuban hotel. They knew where he was and his travels were \nwell known, as most travels are, to the Cuban Government. Then they \narrested him and said he was guilty of trying to overthrow the \ngovernment. It is hard to say with a straight face that Alan Gross was \nsome agent of a government trying to overthrow the Cuban Government.\n  He languishes now over 2 years because of these accusations. They \nhave taken away his shoes. He said at one point he could not have \nshoestrings because he might try to hang himself. It took him 7 months \nto convince them to allow his wife to bring him dental floss. He uses \nthe dental floss for shoestrings. They took away his iPod. He has no \naccess to music, and he sits there day after weary day. He told me his \nroutine. It is a routine which I would find hard to imagine for any \nlong period of time. He gets up at 6 o'clock. He is in a room with two \nother prisoners. He has mapped out a course on the floor he has \nmeasured that he walks every morning, back and forth and back and \nforth, for an hour and a half.\n  He says: If I do that route 500 times, it is the equivalent of 5 \nmiles. So I walk that back and forth every morning when I get up. Then \nI get a little breakfast and listen to Cuban news. Finally, in the \nafternoon, they get a chance to go outside--1 hour outside. He says: \nThey have some rebar hanging over a patio, and I do pullups to try to \nkeep myself in decent physical condition.\n  He is suffering from a deteriorating back problem, which causes \npartial paralysis in his right leg. They wanted to treat him with \nchemotherapy, but he refused. I find it hard to imagine how \nchemotherapy could apply to that situation. He is a man who has other \nmedical issues of arthritis and other problems, gout and other \nconditions, which do not make for a very comfortable life and, of \ncourse, the wear and tear on his mind from being separated from his \nfamily for so long.\n  I was very moved by my discussion with Alan Gross--his bravery and \nparticularly his warmth toward the Cuban people. I said to one of the \nministers of the government afterwards: You ought to sit down and talk \nto this man. He doesn't hate Cuba or the people of Cuba. He certainly \nwasn't coming in to overthrow your government. He would come back to \nAmerica and say we need a better, stronger relationship between our two \nnations. Much different than some might expect.\n  I appealed to the Cuban Government when I was there--twice, three \ntimes, in fact--to consider a humanitarian release of Alan Gross, to \nshow some compassion for this man, to show a gesture that could help \nimprove relations between our two countries that have seen enough \ndivision and animosity.\n  I know our Interests Section under the Chief of Mission, John \nCaulfield, has worked tirelessly on this issue as well. Sadly, the \nCuban Government seems determined to keep Alan Gross as a pawn, an \ninnocent hostage in the endless and dated standoff between our two \nnations. I hope I am wrong in that conclusion, but I left Cuba feeling \nthis poor man was a victim of international horse trading which has \nbeen going on for five decades. I hope the government will show \ncompassion and mercy to Mr. Gross and let him come home after 2 years \nof imprisonment.\n  Recently, President Raul Castro released over 290 political \nprisoners, including some Americans. Alan Gross was not included. He \nshould have been. There is still a chance--a chance for the Cuban \nGovernment to do the right thing for Alan Gross and do something that \nwill allow us to say there is real progress when it comes to dealing, \nat least in this instance, with a man who I believe has been falsely \naccused.\n  I hope there are some in the Cuban leadership who are tired of the \nold way of doing things--tired of decades of isolation and worn-out \nslogans blaming the superpower United States for every problem in Cuba, \ntired of a system of political and economic isolation that has nothing \nto do with the United States anymore and a system that keeps its people \nfrom joining the community of nations and sharing the many impressive \ntalents of the Cuban people.\n  Nonetheless, while deeply troubled by Cuba's political repression and \nthe impasse on Alan Gross, I continue to believe we should look for new \nways to establish a relationship with Cuba. I believe that dramatically \nopening Cuba to the world at large, and America in particular--the \nideas and the energy of the American people--is the best way to bring \nreal and lasting change to that island. We have tried isolation for \nmore than 50 years with, at best, mixed results.\n  It became clear to me during my visit that some of the hard-liners \nwho were part of that revolution back in the 1950s are still in power \nand still clinging to their old ideology. It is time for something new \nin Cuba, and it is time for something new in our policy--a new \ndiplomacy with Cuba. There are a lot of people who disagree with me on \nthis issue in this Chamber and on the outside, including many of my \nclose friends. But ultimately we have the same goal: We want real \nfreedom in Cuba and we want to work to make sure the United States has \na friend 90 miles off our shore. I hope that day is near.\n  Mr. President, I then visited Haiti. It was my third trip to that \npoor country. It is the poorest nation on our side of the globe. And, \nof course, the poverty preceded an earthquake of a little over 2 years \nago. It is a flight of about 90 minutes from Miami, but in many ways it \nis a world apart. Its proud and kind people have suffered unimaginable \nmisfortune, both at the hands of repressive dictators and from Mother \nNature.\n  The history of Haiti is fascinating. They overthrew slavery, took \ncontrol of their nation, and for almost 50 years waited for the U.S. \nGovernment to recognize them as a nation. Because we\n\n[[Page S55]]\n\nwere divided in our country over the issue of slavery, it was too hot \nto handle. It was an issue we wouldn't touch until the Civil War began. \nAbraham Lincoln was President, and he recognized the Republic of Haiti \nfor the first time as a sovereign nation.\n  Two years ago, the world showed an outpouring of generosity and \nhumanity to help this country when it was devastated by an earthquake. \nAs you travel around Port au Prince, as we did last week, you can still \nsee the rubble, you can still see the pancaked buildings where so many \npeople died. Thousands responded, donating time and endless efforts, \nand they still do.\n  The plane from Miami to Port au Prince was loaded with Americans--\nmany of them wearing crosses around their necks, tee shirts advertising \nthe charitable causes they were supporting--headed to Haiti to help. \nThat spirit of giving has sustained the Haitian people through a very \ndifficult time. Former Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush helped \nraise money for those efforts and the rebuilding efforts that followed.\n  Today, more than half of the 1 million displaced persons have left \nthe camps in Port au Prince and around the Island of Haiti and found \nhomes. Believe me, their homes are modest by American standards. To \nwalk into an 8-foot-by-8-foot room and have the woman there tell me \ntime and again that four or five people live in that room is hard for \nmany Americans to imagine, but for these Haitians it is an improvement \nover where they were before.\n  Many of the changes in Haiti are fragile and there is a great deal of \nwork to be done, but improvements are real. I recommend to those who go \nto Port au Prince to visit one project--several, actually, but one in \nparticular--a group called GHESKIO, in partnership with the Centers for \nDisease Control. This group is showing what can happen with a modest, \nsmall investment by the United States.\n  Many years ago, I worked to pass legislation known as the Paul Simon \nWater for the Poor Act. It was not funded at any great level, but it \nwas an opportunity to have some money available for developing nations \naround the world to find portable, clean, safe drinking water. How \nimportant is that? Right now, Haiti faces the threat of a cholera \nepidemic, which literally kills innocent people, and it is because they \ndo not have safe drinking water.\n  But smack dab in the middle of Port au Prince, at this GHESKIO \nproject, Dr. Deschamps--an amazing woman, who took me on a tour--\npointed to the ground to a little piece of equipment and said: This is \nour well, and you built it with the Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act.\n  She said: We had to drill down 600 feet, but we found crystal clear \nwater, and we bring it up, put it in a holding tank, treat it with \nchlorine, and we provide water for 100,000 people.\n  I asked her: How much did it cost to build the project? She said \n$25,000. Imagine, $25,000. Think of the cost in human terms, not to \nmention economic terms, of a cholera epidemic and the suffering that \nwould follow.\n\n  This is a lesson for us in America, to learn that small contributions \nin the right places can dramatically change lives in the poorest places \non Earth. The people in that camp and those who are served know the \nAmerican people cared enough to let them drill a well which gives them \nsafe water for their children and families. We can and should do more, \neven with our limited means.\n  We witnessed a group called Partners in Health led by a fellow by the \nname of Dr. Paul Farmer, an inspiring man whom I read about and have \ncome to know personally. He continues to extend the reach of care and \nhealth care to the poorest people on that Haitian island. We visited \none of his camps, where literally the day after the earthquake they \nwent into a hospital and found 40 children in a hospital ward \nunattended. Because of the earthquake, people fled and died in the \nprocess, but these kids survived. It was Dr. Paul Farmer of Partners in \nHealth who brought them in.\n  About one-fourth of these children are special needs children who \ncould not survive were it not for his leadership. They are there being \nfed and cared for and clothed because of the kindness of this man and \nthe wonderful volunteers who are part of his organization.\n  We went back to a project I visited years ago with Senator Mike \nDeWine from the State of Ohio. He and his wife Fran invited me down to \nmeet Father Tom Hagan of Philadelphia, who in 1985 went down to Haiti \nwith a group of students from Lafayette College and decided this was \nwhere he needed to spend the rest of his life. He created a group \ncalled Hands Together, and now that organization literally educates and \nfeeds hundreds of poor children and elderly people in Haiti.\n  It is refreshing and rewarding to go see this work and to realize \nthat amidst all the storm and fury of our political debate there are \ngood people, many from our own country, who do such amazing things with \nlittle or no recognition. Father Tom Hagan of Hands Together in Port au \nPrince, in one of the poorest sections, is a living example of that.\n  I wanted to thank our own embassy staff, our Ambassador Ken Merten in \nPort au Prince. This is his third or fourth assignment in Haiti. He and \nhis wife love Haiti. They speak Creole. He is a wonderful \nrepresentative of the United States and works tirelessly to help these \npoor people.\n  We had a meeting with the new President of Haiti, President Martelly. \nI didn't know what to expect, Mr. President. Here is a man who made his \nname as a punk Reggae rap star and got elected President. So I didn't \nknow what I was going to find when I walked in the room. But what I \nfound was a bundle of energy leaping off the couch and saying: Let's \nget these things done. Cut through the redtape. My people need it and \nthey need it now. What a dramatic, positive change over some of his \npredecessors, and I was happy to meet with him.\n  Then, Prime Minister Conille, a medical doctor from Haiti who was \nworking in the United Nations in New York making over $200,000 a year \nas Chief of Staff to former President Clinton in his role as envoy from \nthe United Nations to Haiti, gave up that post in New York to take the \njob of Prime Minister in Haiti for $35,000 a year. This is a medical \ndoctor and a wonderful man who clearly has no separate personal agenda. \nHe just wants to help the people of this island.\n  I left Haiti very heartened by my meetings with those two \nindividuals. Their energy, determination, and thoughtfulness give me \nhope for Haiti--a nation that needs so much more. They recognize Haiti \nwill never be on the full path to recovery and long-term stability \nwithout educating its people and employing them and bringing the kind \nof leadership and foreign investment so that their nation can grow. We \nin the United States should support that effort.\n  I am going to urge Chairman John Kerry of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee--a committee on which the Presiding Officer and I serve--to \nadvance the Haiti Reforestation Act. That is an issue which was brought \nup by many of the leaders we met with. I introduced it originally with \nSenator Susan Collins and Senator Kerry some months ago. We want to \ntackle one of Haiti's most entrenched, long-term problems, which has a \nspillover effect on a lot of key issues such as agriculture and the \nflooding that can hit this poor nation.\n  The last night we were in Haiti, in our room, there was a violent \nthunderstorm. The lady who ran our gathering place in the inn came to \nme and said: I will guarantee you in the morning there will be press \nreports that two or three people drowned and died because of this \nrainstorm. It is not uncommon in Haiti. That is why reforestation is \npart of the solution to that terrible problem.\n  I want to make sure my colleagues understand how important our \ninvolvement is. I asked how many groups had come down recently from \nCongress to visit Haiti. I was told that my colleague, Senator Mark \nRubio from the State of Florida, had been there a few days before. I \nknow Senator Bill Nelson has spent time there with his wife making the \nright contacts and stopping in this nation. But for those in the Senate \nand House, of both political parties, who are looking for an \nopportunity to see where a small amount of American taxpayer dollars is \nmaking a huge difference in the lives of some of the poorest people in \nthe Western Hemisphere, that hour-and-a-half trip\n\n[[Page S56]]\n\nfrom Miami to Haiti is worth your time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/24/senate-section/article/S56-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S56]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              AUTHORIZING APPOINTMENT OF ESCORT COMMITTEE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

We are back. Tonight, I understand, the Presiding \nOfficer and I will be sitting together at the State of the Union event, \nwhich I am pleased to do. It is always a historic and seminal moment in \nour legislative process when the President of the United States talks \nabout and lays out his plans for the future.\n  From watching this morning on television and from reading some of the \naccounts of what is thought will be said tonight--I don't know what is \ngoing to be said yet--one of the overriding themes is going to be that \nof fairness. I think that is an important point for us to focus on in a \nsecond, particularly with regard to our spending, our debt, and our \ndeficit, about what is fair to the American people.\n  Last night--and I brought some notes--I did a telephone townhall \nmeeting back to Georgia. We had thousands of people listening in on the \ncall. I was able to take 17 questions in the course of an hour and one \nof the questions was from Fred in Barnesville, GA. Fred is a small \nbusinessperson. He asked this question: Senator, you were a small \nbusinessman; I am a small businessman. We had to operate within a \nbudget. Why is it the U.S. Government doesn't have a budget? I think \ntoday is the 1,000th day we have been operating without a budget.\n  That was a fair question. So if we want to talk about fairness for a \nminute, my contribution to fairness is going to be: What is fair to the \nAmerican people, the American businessman, the American employer, the \nAmerican employee? Let's think about it for a second.\n  A budget is a guide by which we try to live under. It is an \nappropriation of our priorities for the future based on what we think \nwe will need to accomplish our goals. But if we are without a budget, \nthen we have the tendency to do what America has done over the last 3 \nyears; that is, exponentially increase its debt and its deficit. What \nthat has done is put a pall on the recovery and a pall on the economy.\n  I would suggest the fairest thing we can do in the Congress and the \nfairest thing the administration can do is to see to it that we have a \nbudget submitted, that it come to the floor of the House and Senate, \nthat it be adopted, and then, more important, that we change our pace \naround here and live within that budget.\n  I have some suggestions as to how we do that, but first and foremost \nI urge the White House to submit a budget this year. I understand, from \nthis morning's announcements, it will be delayed until February 13. \nThat is fine with me. But the quicker we get it to us, the better we \nare. Then, let the Budget Committees of the House and Senate act, and \nlet us end up with a framework--not just for 1 year but, as the \nPresiding Officer knows, for 10 years--because we forecast out those \nbudgets and those complications of those budgets for 10 years.\n  But we have a broken system. We also have a broken will to do what is \nmost important for the American people when it comes to spending their \nmoney. I wish to suggest how we change our habits and become a fairer \nlegislative body and a fairer governing body for the American people.\n  Senator Jeanne Shaheen and I introduced a bill 1 year ago called the \nbiennial budget. It amends the Budget Control Act of the United States \nof America and changes the way we do business. It portends that, in the \nfuture, instead of appropriating and budgeting for 1 year, we will do \nit in 2-year cycles, and we will always do our appropriating and our \nbudgeting in the odd-numbered years so, in the even-numbered year of \nreelection, we are doing oversight and fiscal responsibility.\n  I think everybody in this room will admit we make an effort at \noversight, to a certain extent, but practically speaking not near the \noversight the American people have to do.\n  It is ironic that our country, our people, our families, our \nretirees, our business folks, our employees the last 4 years of the \nrecession have sat around their kitchen table lots of times. They \nreprioritized what they could afford and what they couldn't. They \nreallocated their resources to take care of their family and their \nchildren and they have been frugal and they have been conservative \nbecause they have to. They can't deficit spend. They can't borrow \nthemselves into oblivion. They can't print the money and they can't \nwrite the checks. Don't you think the government of the people who are \nhaving to do that ought to have to at least live under the same set of \ncircumstances?\n  We need for this room to become a big kitchen table, big enough for \n100 people of good will to sit down together. We need a White House \nthat will submit a budget we can then argue about and set the \npriorities of this country and try and put a governor on what we are \nspending, try and put some type of accountability for where we are \ngoing, try and forecast into the future what it is the American people \ncan expect of all of us.\n  So when tonight the President talks about fairness, I hope one of his \nquotes will be: It is only fair to expect me, the President, to submit \na budget to the Congress, and it is only fair for me, the President, to \nexpect the Congress to act on that budget--because, after all, \neverything else flows from that. In the absence of budget \nresponsibility, budget restrictions, budget projections, and a calculus \nfor the future, we are spending without any governor or guide. It is \nakin to trying to drive from here to Alaska without a roadmap. I \ncouldn't get there. I would probably have a wreck. I would probably run \noff the road because we don't know where we are going and we don't know \nhow we are getting there.\n  Unfortunately, of all the institutions in America, there is only one \nthat doesn't know where it is going and how it is getting there, and \nthat happens to be the government of the United States of America.\n  So my message, this day of the State of the Union and this statement \nof fairness, let's be fair to the American people. Let's ask of \nourselves what they are having to ask of themselves because of high \ndeficits and high debt. Those living on fixed incomes are seeing \ninterest rates of 0.25 percent--almost negligible. Markets have been \nflat in terms of investment. Real estate values are down 33 percent \nnationwide. I saw last night in Tampa, where the Presidential debate \nwas, it is 52 percent. The worst it got post-1929 was 31 percent.\n\n  We have the most significant, serious financial crisis in the history \nof the United States of America, and it is impacting our families and \nour people.\n  So let's ask of ourselves, let's ask of our President what every \nAmerican family has had to ask of itself--sit around our kitchen table \nand budget and prioritize. I would submit Senator Shaheen and I have a \nroadmap that works for process. It says do it in 2-year cycles, so we \nare committed to spending in 1 year and we are committed to savings, \nefficiency, accountability, and repealing out-of-date programs the \nother year.\n  Wouldn't it be a great change in the body of politics for you and for \nI to be\n\n[[Page S57]]\n\ncampaigning in even-numbered years, talking about what we are looking \nto save and cut, rather than what we are going to do to bring home the \nbacon?\n  I think the day of bacon coming home reckoning is here, and it is \ntime for the next bacon to be brought home to be a sound budget and \nfiscal policy for the people of the United States of America.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to, similar to all my colleagues, \nexpress our sympathy and support and prayers for our colleague, Senator \nKirk.\n  Senator Kirk is someone who is new to the Senate but served for a \ngood number of years in the House of Representatives and has already \nmade a tremendous impact in coming to the Senate--incredibly smart, \nhard-working, thoughtful, knowledgeable on so many different subjects. \nSo obviously we will miss his presence in the near term but hope and \npray for a full, quick, complete recovery and hope to have him back \nwith us soon. I know I speak for many of my colleagues, but I certainly \nwish to express my and my family's prayers and support for Senator Kirk \nand for his family as he tries to get back on his feet. We wish him all \nthe best as he does that and hope he will return soon and be able to \nget involved in many of the issues he was involved with and has been \ninvolved with since he has come to the Senate.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  If he were here, I think he would be very involved in the debates we \nare going to be having in the coming days about the budget. Today marks \nthe 1,000th day since we have actually acted on a budget in the United \nStates. That is something many people here who are interested in fiscal \npolicy are very concerned about. Senator Kirk is one of those. I \nconsider myself to be one of those. We have a lot of people in the \nSenate who are very concerned about where we are as a nation, about the \namount of spending, the amount of debt we have racked up and continue \nto pile up on an annual basis. It all starts with a budget.\n  We spend $3.6 trillion of the American people's money on an annual \nbasis. Yet we have not had a budget in the Senate for 1,000 days, \nliterally now for 3 years, essentially, since the Senate last passed a \nbudget.\n  We cannot continue with a straight face to go to the American people \nand say we are being good stewards of their tax dollars when, in fact, \nwe don't even go through the exercise annually of determining and \nprioritizing how we are going to spend their hard-earned tax dollars. \nThis is something that cries out for reform.\n  My colleague Senator Isakson, who just spoke, has some proposals for \nbudget reform that I think we ought to take up and we ought to vote on \nin the Senate. I have some ideas about budget reform. There is so much \nwe need to do to change the budget process in the Congress because we \nhave failed to pass a budget resolution, not just for the past 1,000 \ndays but also for 5 of the last 7 election years, and we have only \ncompleted all the annual appropriations bills on time in 4 of the last \n34 years. We clearly have a problem. I don't think there is anybody \nhere who can't say this system is broken and needs to be fixed.\n  It strikes me, at least, that as we went through the 2012 budget \nprocess, we failed again to complete the appropriations work on time, \nand so we had to go through this annual exercise of doing a nearly $1 \ntrillion omnibus spending bill at the eleventh hour yet again. During \nthe past 3 years, we have consistently had record deficits of $1.3 \ntrillion or more.\n  Clearly, what we have in place is not working, and the American \npeople are the ones who are paying the price for that because the debt \nper person is now over $48,700. That is an increase of nearly $14,000 \non an individual basis since President Obama took office.\n  If we think about it on a per household basis, it represents $126,000 \nper American family, per household that is their share of our Federal \ndebt. That is a massive amount of money we pile onto people in this \ncountry.\n  If we add in the unfunded liabilities for Social Security and \nMedicare, which exceed $40 trillion, then we start talking about over \n$\\1/2\\ million in liability for every family in this country.\n\n  The national debt is now more than $15 trillion, which is literally \nover 100 percent of our gross domestic product. To put that into \nperspective, 1 year ago, Greece was at 143 percent. We are not far \nbehind. We are now 1 to 1, 100 percent debt to GDP. We are seeing the \neffect of high levels of sovereign debt on the economies of European \ncountries such as Greece, and if we fail to get spending in our country \non a sustainable path, we are going to face a similar crisis in the \nnot-too-distant future. If we continue to see an economy that is \nstruggling and growing at a very slow rate, we cannot grow that economy \nby making the Federal Government larger. If that is the case, the $1 \ntrillion stimulus bill that passed in 2009 would have brought \nunemployment down. But, as we know, the unemployment rate in this \ncountry is still at 8.5 percent.\n  So we have to unleash the economy. We need to cut spending in \nWashington, DC. We have to make the Federal Government smaller, not \nlarger, and get Federal spending as a percentage of our gross domestic \nproduct, as a percentage of our entire economy, back to more of a \nhistorical average.\n  Today, the spending as a percentage of our GDP is about 25 percent. \nIf we go over the last 40 years of American history, the average has \nbeen 20 to 21 percent. Ironically, there have only been five times \nsince 1969 where the budget has actually been balanced. In those cases \nwhere the budget was balanced, spending as a percentage of GDP was 18.7 \npercent, on average.\n  So it can be done. But we have to get spending back to a more \nhistoric and reasonable level relative to our entire economy.\n  The debt to GDP, as I mentioned earlier, is also historic because we \nhaven't seen debt-to-GDP levels such as this literally since the end of \nWorld War II. We would have to go back over half a century to find a \ntime when we were carrying debt to GDP that was literally 1 to 1, where \nthe amount of debt we have in this country is 100 percent of our entire \neconomic output in a given year. That is a staggering number and one \nthat should make us all very concerned about our future if we don't \ntake steps to correct it.\n  I think that point was driven home by the former Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, ADM Mike Mullen, who has said in testifying \nbefore congressional committees that the greatest threat to America's \nnational security is our national debt.\n  Think about that. He didn't say the Iranian nuclear program. He \ndidn't say China. He didn't say North Korea. He didn't say al-Qaida. He \nsaid the greatest threat to America's national security is our national \ndebt--that coming from the person who used to be the highest ranking \nmilitary official in this country.\n  I think that speaks volumes about what we need to be focused on and \nwhy it is so important we start getting our budgetary, our fiscal house \nin order and why it is so important, frankly, that we pass a budget. \nOne thousand days without a budget, and we spend $3.6 trillion every \nsingle year of the American people's money.\n  I think, again, in order to get our fiscal house in order, in order \nto get our economy back on track, we have to cut spending. We have to \nreduce the amount we spend. That means we have to take on some of the \nbig challenges before us, such as entitlement reform.\n  We all know about three-fifths of all Federal spending is what we \ncall mandatory spending, and that represents programs such as Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid that are not annually appropriated for \nby Congress but are a function of the law. If a person is eligible for \na particular program they are going to get a benefit under that \nprogram. That type of spending in our budget represents about three-\nfifths of all Federal spending. If we add interest on the debt, which \nis also mandatory spending, we get up to about 65\n\n[[Page S58]]\n\ncents out of every dollar spent right now is mandatory spending.\n  If we have programs such as Medicaid growing at three times the rate \nof inflation, and Medicare growing at two times the rate of inflation, \nit is pretty clear that is not sustainable over time. We have to figure \nout a way to get these programs where they are not growing at 12 \npercent a year or 8 percent a year--closer to the rate of inflation. \nThat means we have to reform these programs if they are going to be \nsustainable and if they are going to be there for future generations of \nAmericans. That can be done without impacting the benefits that people \nwho are on those programs today receive and those who are nearing \nretirement age receive.\n  There is a real concern, there is a lot of hot political rhetoric \nabout Republicans just want to cut benefits for seniors across this \ncountry. I think most of my colleagues know there have been several \nproposals put forward that would address the long-term challenges we \nface with regard to Medicare and Medicaid and for that matter Social \nSecurity, all of which would not impact people who are retired today \nnor those who are nearing retirement age but simply put in place some \nreforms that would impact younger Americans who, today, are working \nhard, putting money into these programs, but if we do not take steps to \nfix these programs they are not going to be around when those people \nretire.\n  Entitlement reform is so important in terms of getting Federal \nspending under control. That is why, notwithstanding the fact it is an \nelection year, I hope there will be the political will in the Congress \nand with the President. Frankly, it is going to take Presidential \nleadership to do these types of things. We cannot do big things, we \ncannot conquer big challenges and big problems in this country absent \nPresidential leadership. There are 535 Members of Congress and there is \nonly one President, one person who can sign a bill into law, one person \nwho can engage the Congress and work toward a solution to some of these \nbig problems.\n  So far this President has demonstrated no willingness to take on the \nchallenges we face with regard to our budget. It was demonstrated last \nyear when he submitted his budget. It was ultimately voted on in the \nSenate, voted down by a vote of 97 to 0. I think that tells us they \nhave not been serious about taking on the major drivers of Federal \nspending in this country.\n  With regard to the other part of the budget, the discretionary part, \nwe saw spending increase in that part of our budget by about 24 percent \nbetween 2008 and 2010. It literally grew at about 8 to 10 times the \nrate of inflation. So we need to get that side of our spending under \ncontrol as well. Many of us supported legislative efforts that would \nroll back discretionary spending to 2008 levels to get us back into a \nplace where we can defend the things we are doing to the American \npeople at a time when they are seeing their family budgets shrink, that \nthey are seeing their personal assets shrink, and many of them are \nhaving a very hard time finding work. Cutting spending, reducing \nspending, reforming entitlement programs, getting our fiscal house in \norder, is just essential, absolutely essential if we want to put our \ncountry on a path and a track that will prevent us from heading for the \ntrain wreck that many of our allies, many of the countries in Europe, \nare facing right now simply because they made promises to their people \nthey just could not keep.\n  We have to get our spending under control in this country and rein it \nin or that is our future. I hope for the sake of our children and \ngrandchildren in this country we are willing to make the hard political \ndecisions that will enable that to happen.\n  The second thing we have to do if we are going to get out of this \nsort of morass we are in right now, in addition to reducing spending, \nis we have to get the economy growing again. We have to expand this \neconomy, grow this economy. It has been said the rising tide lifts all \nthe boats. We need to get a tide that starts lifting all Americans. \nInstead of talking about how we are going to redistribute the pie, we \nneed to make the pie bigger. The way we do that is to grow and expand \nthe economy. If we start growing and expanding the economy we will get \nmore Americans back to work, more people making money, more people \ninvesting. When more people are working, there are more people paying \ntaxes and that gets revenue going up and that makes these other issues \nmanageable. But we have to have economic growth and we have to have \npolicies in place that promote economic growth.\n  Regrettably, the policies of the current administration have had the \nopposite effect. They have made it more difficult, more expensive to \ncreate jobs in this country. We need to put policies in place that will \nmake it less expensive, less difficult to create jobs, and that will \nencourage people and provide the kind of economic certainty that gets \npeople to invest their money, to put their capital to work, and to get \nAmericans back to work in this country.\n  I think there are several things, obviously, that need to be done. \nNo. 1, of course, is to reform the Tax Code. In my view, right now that \nis a roadblock, if you will, an obstacle, an impediment to economic \ngrowth. We are not competitive in the world marketplace because of our \ntax policies. What we need today is a clear, fair, simple tax code that \ndoes away with a lot of the special interest loopholes that exist \ntoday, one that broadens the tax base in this country but at the same \ntime one that lowers rates so that businesses want to invest in America \nas opposed to moving their headquarters and taking their jobs overseas. \nWe want to encourage investment. That means we have to reform our Tax \nCode and, as I said, we have to do away with a lot of the Tax Code that \nis riddled with loopholes. We have to do away with those loopholes and \nget our tax rates down to where they are competitive with countries \naround the world that are stealing business from us and taking jobs \noverseas.\n  Tax reform is, in my view, an essential element of an economic growth \nstrategy that will get us on a path where the economy is growing and \nexpanding and we are creating jobs in this country. That is going to \ntake Presidential leadership just as entitlement reform is going to \ntake Presidential leadership. We cannot do big things in this country \nabsent Presidential leadership. This is another area where we have not \nseen that from this President.\n  I hope he will engage the Congress--again, notwithstanding the fact \nthat this is an election year--in a debate and perhaps more than a \ndebate, a solution to the problems in the Tax Code in this country that \nwill get us on a competitive footing and make us more competitive in \nthe world marketplace. The President is going to have to be involved in \nthat debate or it is not going to happen, particularly in a political \nyear.\n  We also have to get our arms around these overreaching, excessive \nregulations that are strangling small businesses in this country. I \ncannot tell you how many times, when I travel my State of South Dakota \nor anyplace else for that matter, that I hear from small businesses \nthat the No. 1 obstacle right now to us creating jobs is this massive \namount of regulation coming out of Washington, DC. In fact, there have \nliterally been thousands and thousands of pages of new regulations that \nhave been promulgated and issued since this President took office. They \naffect every sector of our economy.\n  The one we hear about the most probably is the EPA, but we have the \nDepartment of Labor, we have other agencies of government that are \nconstantly putting forward new regulations which make it more \ndifficult, more complicated to get people in this country back to work.\n  Just as a point of fact, regarding a recent set of regulations \nproposed by the Department of Labor--by the way, there was no complaint \nabout this that there was no consultation with the people who would be \nimpacted by this--there was really no reason we can come up with for \nwhy these regulations were put forward. But the Department of Labor, in \ntheir infinite wisdom, decided they knew better about how to run a \nfarming operation or a ranching operation in this country, better than \nthe people who are involved in those endeavors, and they have basically \nput forward some regulations that would put all kinds of new \nrestrictions on young people working in family farming or ranching \noperations--incredibly prescriptive regulations, I might add,\n\n[[Page S59]]\n\ndetailed regulations that are going to change the culture and the \neconomic fabric of ranching and farming in this country more than \nanything we have seen before.\n  Anybody who has been around a farming operation or enterprise in my \npart of the country realizes they are inherently family operations. \nYoung people are involved in those operations. When the Department of \nLabor comes out and says young people cannot operate certain types of \nequipment or young people cannot work with farm animals that are older \nthan 6 months or cannot be at an elevation that is any more than 6 \nfeet, it is a complete contradiction to the way that work gets done in \nrural parts of this country. But that is what we have. We have a \nmassive amount of new regulation coming out of the Department of Labor \nthat will forever change the way farming operations are carried out and \nthe way work gets done on a family farm.\n  That is the kind of thing I am talking about. It is overreaching. It \nis excessive. It goes beyond the pale in terms of what we need by way \nof regulation in this country. We need smart regulation. There are \npublic health and safety reasons why we need that. But this kind of \noverreaching and excessive regulation is making it that much more \ndifficult for people to get jobs in this country.\n  The final thing I will mention in regard to an economic agenda that I \nthink will create jobs is the issue of energy security. We need an \nenergy policy in this country that promotes domestic production, that \nrecognizes that we have enormous amounts of resources at home, that we \nshould not have to continue to import a lot of our energy from outside \nthe United States. The Keystone Pipeline, which was just recently \nvetoed by the administration--turned down--is an example of that. It \nwas studied 3 years extensively by many agencies of the government. At \nthe EPA there were serious environmental impact statements done. They \nall cleared, they all teed this up to be done, and just this last week \nthe President said: No, it is not in the national interest.\n  I, and I think a lot of people on both sides in the Senate, would \nargue this is in the national interest. It is a lot better for us to \nget 700,000 barrels of oil a day from a friendly neighbor such as \nCanada as opposed to a country such as Venezuela. We can continue to \nbuy oil from Hugo Chavez or we can get the same, the equivalent amount \nof oil from a friendly neighbor such as Canada, bring it into this \ncountry where it is refined and creates jobs, puts people back to work, \nputs capital to work in this country, and gets investment in the United \nStates. Instead, we are going to see that energy source go in the other \ndirection. It is going to Asia, it is going to go to China, if we are \nnot able to get projects like this approved.\n  Interestingly enough, there was a pipeline just like this that was \nbuilt a few years ago, and it goes right through the eastern part of my \nState and other States. This pipeline would go through the western part \nof my State of South Dakota as well as other States, but it would bring \nmuch of that energy resource into this country, create jobs, and help \ncreate economic growth in America as opposed to sending that energy \noverseas and making us even more dependent upon foreign sources of \nenergy at home. It makes absolutely no sense.\n  If the President of the United States is serious in his rhetoric \nabout focusing every morning on creating jobs, one would think the \nfirst thing he would want to do is support projects that create shovel-\nready jobs, in this case 20,000 shovel-ready jobs and an investment of \n$7 billion, and bring energy into this country that will make us more \nenergy independent. That is absolutely right in the wheelhouse of what \nwe ought to be looking for in terms of getting this country's economy \nback on track. Yet last week the President turned thumbs down on this \nproposal.\n  I would say again, in closing, in my view, if we are going to get our \ncountry back on track, we have to get our fiscal house in order, which \nmeans we have to reduce spending, get our spending as a percentage of \nour entire economy back into a form of historical norm of revenues. As \nI said, for the past 40 years that has been 18 percent of our economy. \nToday we are spending 25 percent, and we are on a trajectory such that \nnot too far from now we are spending our entire economy on the Federal \nGovernment, not to mention State and local control. We have to get \npolicies in place that will promote long-term economic growth and \nreverse the decline we have seen, the massive amount of debt we racked \nup over the past 3 years, and the huge job losses we have seen at the \nsame time. If we can do that, we will at least be doing the people's \nwork in terms of trying to address the major problems I think face most \nAmericans and the things they are most concerned about every single \nday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin).

Mr. President, democracy; that is, government of the \npeople, by the people and for the people, does not thrive or even \nsurvive unless we have a well-informed and well-educated public who are \nthinking about, discussing and debating the important issues facing our \ncountry.\n  In order to stimulate that goal, I have, for the last 2 years, \nsponsored an essay-contest asking Vermont's high school students what \nthey think the United States should be doing to address the major \nproblems we face as a nation. In other words, while tonight we hear the \nPresident's views about the State of the Union, the essays these \nstudents wrote reflect Vermont students' views about the State of the \nUnion.\n  I am delighted that 308 students, from 30 different schools \nthroughout Vermont, thought about these challenges as they wrote their \nown State of the Union essay. And I want to thank each and every one of \nthem for their participation in the contest and the time and effort \nthey put into it. I also want to thank the five teachers who acted as \njudges for these contests. They are Brian Burgess of Hazen Union High \nSchool; Liz Lebrun of Poultney High School, Lois Little of Canaan \nMemorial High School; Joe Maley of South Burlington High School and \nTerri Vest of Twinfield Union High School.\n  The winner, selected by a panel of five Vermont teachers, is Jennifer \nSikorski, a senior at Winooski High School. In addition to Jennifer, 18 \nstudents were named as finalists. The four runners-up were: Monica \nAllard, Milton High School; Kayleigh Ehler-Vock, South Burlington High \nSchool; Kate Raszka, Champlain Valley Union High School; Karolina \nSowulewska, Burr and Burton Academy.\n  Because of the excellent quality of the essays, we also honored 14 \nother students with an honorable mention.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the winning essay be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Jennifer Sikorski, Winookski High School (Winner)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       Ever since the Declaration of Independence was signed, the \n     United States has constantly paved the way to peace and \n     prosperity both for itself and the rest of the world. \n     However, as the world economy rapidly disintegrates, new \n     issues have emerged, from unemployment to the environment to \n     gay rights, and in the midst of it all, America stands still, \n     seemingly oblivious to the fact that its future is crumbling \n     in front of it. It is time to pave the way to prosperity once \n     again through these issues in order to ensure that someday we \n     can thrive again.\n       Perhaps the biggest problem we face as a nation is \n     unemployment. As of 2011, 8.5 percent of people in the U.S.--\n     over 26 million Americans--are jobless. While it may seem as \n     if putting such a large amount of people to work cannot \n     happen, there is a chance that it can be done. As \n     unemployment has been rising, the condition of our \n     environment has been deteriorating due to deforestation and \n     the emissions of greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide given \n     off by the use of fossil fuels. Renewable energy such as \n     solar and wind power, on the other hand, has remained a topic \n     of interest, yet it is still somehow largely unavailable to \n     the public. However, the environment can be preserved, if not \n     improved, by phasing out fossil fuels in favor of solar and \n     wind energy, while millions of Americans can return to work \n     to plant trees to restore our forests and to build, \n     distribute, and repair solar panels, wind turbines, and other \n     renewable energy products. We are actually lucky in a way to \n     have to face both of these issues at once, as they can both \n     be improved simultaneously.\n       America has also had a long-standing tradition of leading \n     the way in human rights,\n\n[[Page S60]]\n\n     with such important movements such as women's suffrage and \n     civil rights abolishing discrimination based on gender and \n     race. There is no reason why this tradition should not \n     continue with gay rights as well. Currently, only seven \n     states in the entire country allow same-sex marriage, and I \n     am proud to live in one of the few states that has begun to \n     lead the way. I have many friends and relatives that consider \n     themselves gay or bisexual and are actively involved in the \n     LGBT community, and I have witnessed their struggles as they \n     have realized that many are intolerant of their lifestyles. \n     The entire country should follow Vermont's example and \n     legalize same-sex marriage to continue to encourage not only \n     the rights of certain groups of people, but the rights of \n     everyone.\n       In conclusion, the challenges that we face with \n     unemployment, the environment, and gay rights are just some \n     of the challenges that, when dealt with appropriately, will \n     make our country stronger and greater than before.

Mr. President, in listening to some of our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle--both in speeches here and in press \nstatements they have made--I repeatedly hear them saying we have not \nhad a budget for 1,000 days. That is just wrong. That is absolutely \nwrong. Sometimes I wonder if our colleagues are paying attention to \nwhat goes on here on the floor of the Senate. Have they already \nforgotten the Budget Control Act? Here it is. On August 2nd of last \nyear, the Budget Control Act passed this body 74 to 26. More than half \nof our Republican colleagues voted for it. Didn't they know what they \nwere voting on? The Budget Control Act contains the budget for this \nyear and for next year. Weren't they paying attention? Don't they know \nwhat they voted on?\n  In many ways, the Budget Control Act is stronger than a typical \nbudget resolution, and it is stronger in these ways: No. 1, it is more \nextensive than a traditional budget resolution. No. 2, it has the force \nof law. Unlike a budget resolution that is not signed by the President, \nthe Budget Control Act that we passed last August, that provides the \nbudget for this year and for next year, is a law passed by the House of \nRepresentatives, passed by the Senate, signed by the President of the \nUnited States--the Budget Control Act. It also set discretionary caps \non spending for 10 years instead of the 1 year normally set in a budget \nresolution.\n  So when our colleagues come out here and say we have not had a budget \nin 1,000 days, wow, can they really have missed the vote, the debate, \nthe consideration of the Budget Control Act? Did they really miss all \nthat or--or--are they saying something they know to be untrue, because \nreally those are the only choices you are left with. Either they do not \nknow what they did or they are misrepresenting what we all did.\n  Not only does the Budget Control Act set discretionary caps for 10 \nyears, it also provided enforcement mechanisms, including a 2-year \n``deeming'' resolution, allowing budget points of order to be enforced. \nThat is what a budget does. It sets the spending levels, it creates \nspending caps, and it provides enforcement mechanisms. All of that is \nin the Budget Control Act we passed on August 2nd of last year with a \nvote of 74 to 26. Not only did we pass it, but the Republican-\ncontrolled House passed it, and the President signed it. It is the law \nof the land. It sets the budget for this year. It sets the budget for \nnext year. It provides enforcement mechanisms. It sets 10 years of \nspending caps. And it created a reconciliation-like supercommittee to \naddress entitlement and tax reforms. That supercommittee did not come \nup with a result, but they were established in the Budget Control Act, \nand they were given the authority--just like a reconciliation provision \nwould--to come back with a package that could not be filibustered and \ncould not be altered and could pass with a simple majority. That is the \nfact.\n  So if we hear colleagues come out and say one more time that we have \nnot had a budget for 1,000 days, I hope somebody will have the sense to \nstand up and say: Really? What was the Budget Control Act about? What \nwas this legislation that passed not only the Senate on a vote of 74 to \n26 but passed the House of Representatives, which is controlled by the \nother party, and was signed by the President of the United States?\n  Republican rhetoric aside, Congress did pass a budget--not through \nthe normal way of a budget resolution but through an actual law. The \nRepublican-controlled House passed it, the Democratic Senate passed it, \nand the President signed it.\n  The Budget Control Act set 10 years of spending caps, established a \n2-year ``deeming'' resolution to enforce spending levels, and it \ncreated a reconciliation-like process to consider entitlement and tax \nreform.\n  I hope we have laid this issue to rest. So now if I hear colleagues \ncome out and say that we have not had a budget for 1,000 days--I will \nknow they have been put on fair notice. Maybe they missed somehow what \nthey were voting on back in August. Maybe they gapped out. Maybe they \nforgot. But you know what, they voted for it. Every Member of the \nSenate voted on the Budget Control Act. Seventy-four to twenty-six--add \nit up--that is 100. Everybody was here. And if they did not know what \nthey were voting on, now they do. So if I hear another assertion that \nthere has not been a budget for 1,000 days, I will know and the \nlisteners will know that somebody is not telling the truth.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I rise with a heavy heart to mourn the \nloss of Ogden police officer Jared Francom.\n  Earlier this month, on the evening of January 4, 2012, Agent Francom \nwas senselessly gunned down defending his fellow officers as they \nattempted to serve a search warrant in Ogden, UT. Five other officers--\nSean Grogan, Kasey Burrell, Michael Rounkles, Nate Hutchinson, and \nJason Venderwarf--were wounded in the gun battle.\n  A week later, a crowd of roughly 4,000 family members, friends, and \nsupporters, including more than 1,000 uniformed officers, gathered at a \npublic memorial for Jared to say goodbye to one of America's fallen \nheroes. The sentiment from all who knew him was the same: Jared was a \ndevoted family man, a dedicated father to his two young daughters, a \nfun-loving brother and son to his family.\n  At the funeral, which I attended, I heard Jared's brother Ben say \nthat he ``taught people to care for each other and taught others to \nchange the world like he was doing on the streets of Ogden.'' \nCommenting on the outpouring of support, Jared's brother Travis said: \n``I know my brother would be proud, because we all are his family.''\n  Achieving a goal he had set for himself as a young boy, Agent Francom \nbecame a member of the Ogden police force 7 years ago and was assigned \nto the Weber-Morgan Narcotics Strike Force.\n  Jared's sacrifice should be a reminder to us of the incredible risks \nour brave law enforcement officers all take as they protect the people \nthey serve. I have a deep and unwavering respect for the law \nenforcement community, and as a former assistant U.S. attorney I have \nseen up close how these men and women serve with honor, integrity, and \ndedication. Jared Francom was no exception. He will be remembered for \ngiving his life in service to the people and to the community he loved.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise because this week is going to \nbe a very important week for voting on the President's request to raise \nour debt ceiling.\n  Our debt is $15.2 trillion. The President is going to ask for a $1.2 \ntrillion increase in that debt. These are astronomical numbers. Anyone \nlooking at this can see we are spiraling out of control in very short \norder.\n  To put it in perspective, the gross domestic product ratio to debt \nhas been in the range of 40 percent debt to our gross domestic product. \nToday, we are surpassing 100 percent. We don't hear numbers such as \nthese except in certain places in Europe. This is untenable.\n  When President Obama was sworn into office, the Federal debt was \n$10.6 trillion. In just under 4 years, the United States has \naccumulated more than $5 trillion in new debt. Let's place the \nPresident's request in context.\n  The $1.2 trillion he is asking to increase the debt ceiling will not \neven cover last year's deficit, which was $1.3 trillion. We are in an \nuntenable situation and we must do something about it. I think most \npeople who are focusing on this believe that. But instead, attempts to \ncut the deficit are met with proposals to do--what? Increase taxes, \ntaxes to pay for current spending and even new spending on top of the \ncurrent levels.\n  In the coming weeks, the President will unveil his fiscal year 2013 \nbudget. Last year, the fiscal year 2012 budget the President put \nforward totaled $3.7 trillion, and he proposed over $1.6 trillion in \nnew taxes over a 10-year period.\n  These figures demonstrate the fundamental problem we have in this \ncountry, which any small businessperson looking at this can tell us; \nthat is, we have chronic deficit spending.\n  We must accept the fact that mandatory spending accounts for more \nthan half of all Federal spending, and the entitlement spending is \nopen-ended. The reality is, Social Security is currently operating in \nthe red. Benefits are exceeding payroll tax revenue. The programs that \nare in the entitlement section of our budget are in dire need of being \nupdated. We must gradually reform Social Security to meet current life \nexpectancy rates. I have introduced a bill to do that, along with \nSenator Kyl.\n  It is very important that the President take the lead on entitlement \nspending. Yet from all the things we have heard from the President \nabout what he is going to propose at the State of the Union address and \nwhat he is going to put in his budget, there is no entitlement reform \nincluded. Instead, it is more spending and more taxes to cover the \nspending.\n  The fact remains, we must change the course of this country. If we \nfail to do so, we are going to be at the same point later this year \nbecause that is when we could reach the new debt ceiling of $16.4 \ntrillion if the President's request is granted by Congress.\n  The precedent is vivid. Look how quickly the initial $900 billion \nrequest set forth under the Budget Control Act last August has been \nexhausted--$900 billion gone since August. This is January. That is a \nstunning figure. A coherent, comprehensive policy regarding our \nNation's debt ceiling is nonexistent.\n  In order to correct our current fiscal problems, we must align \nspending to match incoming revenues. American businesses and households \nknow this. They do it every month, every week. Why shouldn't our \ngovernment be held to the same standards?\n  We have not had a true debt limit set by this administration. The \nPresident continually requests increases in the debt ceiling without \naddressing the core problem, which is spending.\n  While the Budget Control Act included discretionary spending caps and \na 2013 sequestration, it did not go far enough. No targets were set \nforth for our debt limit or for our annual deficits.\n  We need to take our caps on spending further. Each year, the caps \nshould bring us closer to a balanced budget. We should have a target to \nbring, over 10 years, the debt down to a specific level. We should be \nable to set this with leadership from the President. This year, we must \nfocus on cutting our deficits and aligning spending with revenues.\n  We are going to have this vote on Thursday, we are told. We have the \ntime and the means to implement a sensible reform for our entitlement \nprograms. That is not going to happen in a vacuum, and it is not going \nto happen with just the President or with just the Republicans or with \njust the Democrats in Congress. We have to address entitlement issues \ntogether.\n  The Social Security bill I have introduced gradually increases the \nage at which Social Security would be available to retirees. We all \nknow people are living longer. They are working longer. They are \nhealthier longer. The actuarial tables don't match the Social Security \nprogram that was put in place 50 years ago. It does not work. We have \nto take the reins.\n  If the President would work with Congress to do that, my bill \nincreases the normal retirement age by 3 months per year. So it is a \nvery gradual increase. No one would be affected over the age of 58 \nunder my plan. But if one is 57, the normal retirement age would be 3 \nmonths later. So it is a plan that can work. With that minor \nadjustment, we could make 75 years of Social Security solvent, along \nwith a small decrease in the cost-of-living increase but nothing on the \ncore benefit. There would be no cut in the core benefit, only a 1-\npercent decrease in the cost-of-living increase. If inflation goes \nabove 1 percent, there would be a cost-of-living adjustment.\n  I think everyone would rather have a sound Social Security system and \nknow it is there for them as a cushion. As we know, Social Security was \nnot supposed to be a retirement plan. It was supposed to be a safety \nnet, and it is a safety net for many people in our country.\n  We are also trying to encourage more saving by people for security in \nretirement. That is why, when we are talking about the 15-percent tax \non capital gains and dividends, it is because we are encouraging people \nto save for their retirement security. We are a country, unfortunately, \nthat has a very low savings rate. Compared to most other countries in \nthe world, Americans save very little. The 15-percent capital gains and \ndividends rate is meant to encourage savings and helping people to plan \nand support their own retirement in addition to Social Security.\n  If we made Social Security solvent, it would also bring down the \ndeficit, and we could do it in a gradual way. If we and the President \ndon't take the reins now in a bipartisan way and we keep marching along \nthe same path, we are going to have drastic cuts in the actual benefit, \nin the core benefit going forward. That would be a tragedy. It would be \nwrong for our children. It would be wrong for the next generation for \nus not to be able to address this in a bipartisan way. I hope the \nPresident will mention this in the State of the Union address. I hope \nhe will make that a part of his efforts in this last year of his \nadministration before the election.\n  I haven't heard any talk of that. In the previews I have heard of the \nState of the Union address, we are not hearing anything about \nentitlement reform. Yet it is more than half of the federal budget. We \nknow that we have to cut spending if we are going to actually bring \ndown the deficits and start peeling away this cancerous debt we have \naccumulated in this country, $5\n\n[[Page S62]]\n\ntrillion in the last 3 years and $10 trillion accumulated up until 3 \nyears ago.\n  It is my hope we will start a leadership in the administration \ntonight at the State of the Union--a leadership that we haven't seen \nyet because all we have seen are the same old tax-and-spend proposals \nwe are used to seeing. It is nothing new and nothing fresh. But the \npeople of America know we have to change course. The people of America \nin the polls say, by huge numbers, we are going in the wrong direction \nin this country. Seventy percent of Americans have said in the latest \npolls of ``How do you feel about where we are now,'' 70 percent believe \nthis country is going in the wrong direction.\n  Only we can do something about it, along with the President, and I \nhope he will provide the leadership. But I don't think raising the debt \nceiling, with no plan in the future to cut spending is going to happen \nthis week. That is not leadership, and I hope there will be a change in \ndirection.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is good to be back at work here in \nWashington, DC. We have the big State of the Union tonight, which is \nkind of the beginning of the legislative year. I am looking forward to \nthe challenges and, hopefully, accomplishments we will have together \nboth in this Chamber and in this building in the coming year.\n  As we prepare for the State of the Union, I think it is always a good \ntime for us to reflect on where we are as a nation and where we have \nbeen. I think all of us can look back on the 20th century and say it \nwas truly the American century. I was blessed to be born in that \ncentury and to be a beneficiary of so much of America's greatness. \nThose of us who have been beneficiaries of America's past have an \nobligation--certainly those who serve here--to be defenders of \nAmerica's greatness in the future. At the core of everything we debate \ntoday are these issues about America's future and how we make the 21st \ncentury an American century as well.\n  If we examine some of what has really distinguished us from the rest \nof the world, that has made America and life in America different from \nlife in other countries, there are three things that come to mind. The \nfirst is this concept of fairness. We are a people who strongly believe \nin the concept of fairness. For Americans, fairness has meant equality \nof opportunity--in essence, the belief that it doesn't matter where you \ncome from, it doesn't matter if your parents are poor, it doesn't \nmatter if you grow up in a disadvantaged background, every single \nAmerican should have the equality of opportunity, the same opportunity \nto succeed and accomplish their hopes and dreams.\n  Maybe we take that for granted from time to time, but that is not a \nuniversal concept. In multiple societies and economies around the \nworld, I daresay that in the majority of them there is not a strong \nbelief in this notion. In fact, people believe that what you are going \nto be in life should be determined by the circumstances of your birth. \nNot in America. This Chamber, the membership here--basically everywhere \nyou go in America--is a testament to people who were born in a very \ndifferent place or into very different circumstances than the ones they \nlive in now and that which they have been able to achieve.\n  As Americans, we have always embraced the concept of prosperity, the \nability to accomplish your economic dreams and hopes. Sometimes that \nmeans people make billions of dollars, and sometimes that means you \nmake enough money to provide for your family and give them the \nopportunity to do even better than yourself, but we embrace the concept \nof prosperity.\n  Last but not least, we Americans have always embraced the concept of \nresponsibility, the responsibility that all of us have as individuals, \nas neighbors, as members of a community, as family members. Deep in \nthis concept of responsibility is the notion that while we want \nfairness and equality of opportunity and while we want prosperity, we \nare also a compassionate people who do not want to see others left \nbehind. In essence, we do not want the price of our prosperity to be \nleaving people behind. To that end, Americans, as I outlined in a \nspeech earlier last year, have always struggled and have fought for the \nnotion of balancing those two important goals--being a nation of \nprosperity and also a nation of responsibility.\n  These are the central things, these are at the core of our values as \na people that defined our greatness in the last century, and therefore \nthey must remain at the core of who we are as a nation if we want the \n21st century to be an American century as well. Let's examine some of \nthe challenges to those three principles that are so important to our \nfuture.\n  On the issue of fairness, on the issue of equality of opportunity, \nwhat are the things standing in the way of equality of opportunity in \nAmerica? In essence, what are the things keeping some people from \nclimbing the ladder, from doing better than their parents did, from \nbeing able to pursue and fulfill their dreams as they should in a \nnation so deeply committed to equality of opportunity?\n  In essence, there are a few things that are standing in the way. The \nfirst is skills. There are some Americans right now who do not have \naccess to the kind of training they need to build the skills they need, \nfor example, to create or to have a middle-class job. Part of that is \nour own doing as a nation. We have, for example, stigmatized career and \ntechnical education. For the life of me, I do not understand why we \nhave done that. Not every kid wants to go to a 4-year university. Not \nevery kid wants to graduate with a Ph.D. Some kids want to grow up and \nfix airplane engines or build things. That is good and important, \nnecessary work. Yet we do not train our kids to do that. A number of \njobs in America require more than a high school education but less than \na 4-year degree in college. Why can't kids graduate from high school \nwith a high school diploma and an industry certification and a career \nthat will employ them right away? That is one of the impediments that \nare standing in the way of growing middle-class jobs. If we are truly \ncommitted to the principle of fairness, we should invest in that, \nencourage that, particularly at the State level.\n  There is another thing standing in the way of fairness, equality of \nopportunity; that is, the playing field is not always even. And there \nare two things in particular that stand out: our regulations and our \nTax Code. It is not me saying that, it is the job creators, small \nbusinesspeople trying to make it. Let me tell you what I mean by that. \nWe have a complicated Tax Code, and it is broken. Here is the deal. If \nyou are a large, major, Fortune 500 company, you can afford the best \nlawyers and accountants in the world to navigate it. You may not like \nthe large, complicated Tax Code, but you can deal with it. The people \nwho cannot deal with a large, complicated Tax Code are the people who \nare trying to make it--the sole practitioner, the entrepreneur, the \nsmall businessperson starting out in the garage or spare bedroom of \ntheir home. They cannot deal with the taxes, and they cannot deal with \nthe regulations because they cannot hire the army of specialists it \ntakes to navigate these things.\n\n  In case you say somehow we are making this up or somehow this is \ncoming out of nowhere, let me tell you that the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce did a survey of small businesses earlier this year. They found \nthat 86 percent of small businesses--which are, by the way, not just \nthe backbone of America's economy, they are the backbone of America's \nprosperity--86 percent of them say they are worried that regulations, \nrestrictions, and taxes are hurting their ability to do business. This \nis a fact.\n  In terms of there not being a playing field that is even in America, \nin my\n\n[[Page S63]]\n\nopinion, the single greatest contributor to making it more difficult \nfor people who are trying to make it is some of the policies--as well-\nintentioned as they may be--that are being implemented at the \ngovernmental level. We need to invest and commit deeply to this notion \nof fairness, which is defined in America as equality of opportunity.\n  The second thing we need to continue to believe in is prosperity. \nProsperity in America has and must continue to mean private sector \neconomic growth. The private sector grows and creates private jobs \nwhich employ people and turn those people into parents who can send \ntheir kids on to college and consumers who can spend money in our \neconomy. The creation of middle-class jobs is not just the backbone of \nour economy, it is the backbone of our prosperity.\n  How are jobs created in the private sector? It is simple. Someone has \nan idea, they have a business or product they want to invest in, they \nhave access to money, whether it is their own money or someone else's \nmoney, and they use that money to put that idea into practice. They \nstart a business, it works, and as a result people get jobs, people are \nemployed, and the cycle repeats itself. The job for us in Washington is \nto make it easier for people to do that at every level. No. 1 is to \nmake it easier for people to have ideas, and that is the easiest one of \nall. Americans have not run out of good ideas, and Americans have not \nforgotten how to create jobs. There are plenty of great ideas. There \nare great business ideas for the 21st century. There are a bunch of \nthem that exist in the minds of hundreds of thousands of Americans who \nare waiting for the chance to put that dream into practice.\n\n  The second thing we have to do is make it easier for them to get \naccess to the money they need to start their businesses, and that means \nto encourage investment. I do not understand why we would punish or \ndiscourage investment. Why raise taxes on people who want to invest in \nbusinesses that allow these businesses to grow and hire more people? It \nis important we make that easier as well.\n  I would like to talk again about small businesses. The survey I \noutlined a minute ago showed that 78 percent of small businesses say \ntaxes and regulations coming from Washington also make it harder for \nthem to hire more employees. So in addition to making it easier for \npeople to make money available to investors to allow these ideas to go \ninto practice, we also have to lower the cost of doing business and the \nbarriers to entry, and the equation is pretty straightforward.\n  If you are an employee working for somebody and decide you can do a \nbetter job than your boss and want to start your own business and want \nto compete against him, well, the regulations that impact that industry \nand the tax code that applies to that industry are too complicated and \ntoo burdensome so you cannot do it. If you are a small business trying \nto grow, no matter how much money you have invested, you may not be \nable to deal with that as well.\n  By the way, there are two industries I hope we will look at as real \ngrowth opportunities and prosperity in America. We are an energy-rich \ncountry and advances in technology have made certain deposits of energy \nonce inaccessible to us accessible. Natural gas is a great example. We \nneed to stop punishing investment in the energy sector by raising \ntaxes. We need to stop passing regulations that put entire areas of \nthis country completely off limits and make it difficult to access our \nenergy deposits. I think energy is an area on which we should focus.\n  The other is manufacturing. As labor costs rise around the world, \nthere is no reason more and more manufacturing cannot return to the \nUnited States. But this is not going to happen if we regulate people \nlooking to do manufacturing in a way that they decide America is not \nthe place they should do business and if the tax treatment of America \nputs us at a competitive disadvantage.\n  Let me close by saying that the opportunity before us is real. The \n21st century holds promise, promise that holds no parallel in human \nhistory. I don't think it is an exaggeration to say we can see the kind \nof economic growth here and around the world that we have never seen \nbefore. That is how promising the 21st century is. It all comes down to \na choice. We have to make a choice. Are we prepared to abandon the \nprinciples and ideals that made us unique and special or are we going \nto reembrace those principles and ideals and in so doing make this new \ncentury an American century as well?\n  When I hear some of the talk in this building, it concerns me. When I \nhear people telling the American people that the way to protect their \njobs is to raise their bosses' taxes, I think that is \ncounterproductive. When I hear policymakers in Washington pitting the \nAmerican people against each other, telling people that the only way \nthey can do better is if someone else is worse off, I get concerned. \nNot only is it not true, that type of thought has never worked anywhere \nin the world. In fact, people flee from countries that think in that \nway.\n  The American experience has been something very important. The \nAmerican experience has been that this is a country where everybody can \ndo better, where the people who have made it can stay there, and the \npeople who are trying to make it can join them. We have never believed \nthat the way for us to do better is for other people to do worse. We \nhave never believed in order to climb the ladder, we have to pull \nsomebody else down. For me, it is not theory, it is the experience of \nmy life.\n  My parents raised me with middle-class jobs in the service sector. My \ndad, for example, was a bartender, and I thank God every night there \nwas someone out there willing to risk their money to build a hotel in \nMiami Beach and later in Las Vegas where he could later work. I thank \nGod there was enough prosperity in America so people could go on \nvacation and leave tips in my dad's tip jar. With the money he raised \nas a bartender, he gave me the opportunity to do what he never had a \nchance to do.\n  We had help along the way. I had student loans and grants from the \ngovernment to help me get my education. I went to a public school \nsystem, and that is an important role for government to play.\n  Let's not forget we cannot have more government than our economy can \nafford. That is why those of us who desperately want to see a country \nthat continues to have prosperity but also compassion believe safety \nnet programs should exist to help those who cannot help themselves and \nhelp those who have fallen to stand and try again. That is why we \nbelieve we have to have a strong and robust economy.\n  What is startling is that we, the largest and most prosperous Nation \nin human history, have built a government so massive that not even the \nrichest country in the history of the world can afford it, and we \ncannot continue on that road either.\n  I will close by saying that I hope this new year will be the \nbeginning of our work toward a new American century. I know it worked \nin the past. I know this is a nation where anyone from anywhere can \naccomplish anything. It is not just something I read about in a \nmagazine. I have seen it in my own life. There is no reason it cannot \ncontinue here if only we are creative.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 18 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today, state of the Union day, marks \n1,000 days since this Senate has fulfilled its statutory responsibility \nof passing a budget. This is not a little bitty matter, and it \nimplicates the leadership of the Democratically controlled Senate and \ntheir willingness to address the American people honestly and \neffectively concerning the very significant financial threats this \nNation faces.\n  Indeed, President Obama, on April 29, 2009, when we last had a \nbudget, said this:\n\n\n[[Page S64]]\n\n\n       A budget serves as an economic blueprint for the Nation's \n     future.\n\n  That is true. It is not an insignificant document that just has a \nbunch of numbers; it is a blueprint for the Nation's future. We either \nhave one or we don't. He went on to say a budget is necessary ``to lay \na new foundation for growth and to strengthen our economy.''\n  I believe that is certainly true because the whole world, our own \neconomy, U.S. businesses and investment, and the American people are \nconcerned that we don't have a plan for our future that gets us off of \nthe debt path--some would say an economic growth death path--that we \nare on. They want to see that we have a plan to do better.\n  We will have a speech tonight. I suspect it will be grand in sound \nand have some popular phrases. But the question is, when it is over \nwill we have a plan that can be examined? Will we have a plan that will \nlead us on an improved--dramatically improved--debt path or will we \nremain in business-as-usual mode, in denial?\n  A budget resolution is legally required by the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974. It was passed because Congress hadn't been passing budgets \neffectively. So the Congress passed a law and said we must do it. We \nare going to require ourselves to do it.\n  By law the President must submit a budget to the Congress by the \nfirst Monday in February. The President has submitted one for 2012. He \nsubmitted it to the Congress last year. It was not a good budget. It \nwas what I have called the most irresponsible budget ever submitted to \nCongress. I chose those words carefully because we have never been, as \na nation, in a more systemic danger from debt as we are today. Our \npopulation is aging. Our growth is not solid. The number of people on \nMedicare and Medicaid and Social Security has increased. We need growth \nand prosperity. We are in danger if we don't change it. That is why the \nworld is worried about the United States. That is also why Europe is \nhaving such a serious problem. So it is important that we have a budget \nand we lay this out.\n  So the law requires the President to submit the budget to the \nCongress by the first Monday in February. We did it last year. It was \nnot a good budget because it increased spending, it increased taxes, \nand it increased spending more than taxes. Over the 10-year budgetary \nwindow or plan, it increased the debt more than if we had not had the \nbudget, if we had just gone on automatic pilot for spending growth in \nour country. That is why it was a failed budget plan. When the Senate \nfinally voted on it--I brought it up after the majority leader brought \nup the House budget to try to defeat it. I brought up the President's \nbudget and asked my Democratic colleagues if they supported their \nPresident's budget. It failed 97 to 0. Not a single Senator voted for \nthat plan because it was irresponsible. It put us on a worse course \nthan we were already on, and nobody wanted to be on record as voting \nfor it.\n  Now, once the President's budget has come in, the Senate Budget \nCommittee, by law, is required to report a budget resolution to the \nSenate by April 1. Congress is required to complete action on a \nconcurrent resolution on the budget no later than April 15. It is a \nchallenge. In the past it has been a real challenge. People have worked \nhard to meet that goal.\n  Last year, while the Senate did not act, the Republican House met its \nrequirements under the Budget Act to consider and pass a budget \nresolution in both their Budget Committee--Congressman Paul Ryan's \ncommittee--and in the full House of Representatives. The chairman of \nthe Senate Budget Committee, however, did not even offer a budget for \nconsideration in committee, which precluded its consideration before \nthe full Senate.\n  The budget process exists in one respect to compel the President and \nCongress to set forth a plan for the disposition of the taxpayers' \nmoney for the upcoming fiscal year and a minimum of 4 fiscal years. The \nbudget has to be a 5-year budget. Often it is 10 years. The President \nsubmitted a 10-year budget which I think is preferable to a 5-year \nbudget, and most people agree. Setting forth such a plan requires \nsetting priorities; does it not? A household does a budget. A city, \ncounty, or State does a budget. They have to choose with their limited \nresources the priorities they can fund and determine how to use those \nscarce dollars, which in our case includes discretionary spending which \nis subject to the annual appropriation process, as well as the \nmandatory spending programs which are provided for under the rules set \nforth in permanent law. Those programs include food stamps, Medicaid, \nMedicare, Social Security, and a lot of other programs.\n  So mandatory spending programs currently comprise almost 60 percent \nof our spending. They are on automatic pilot. If a person reaches a \ncertain age or if a person loses their job or their income falls below \na certain level, they are entitled to certain benefits. A person can \nwalk into a government office and ask for food stamps or ask for \ngovernmental assistance, and if that person qualifies it must be given \nwhether the government has any money or not. If those programs are out \nof control and are growing too fast and are not properly managed, \nCongress has to change laws, not just change the budget to deal with \nit. So this is almost 60 percent of our budget today, the mandatory \npart.\n  So the budget process, through the use of reconciliation, is the only \nmechanism available to Congress to compel oversight and review of \nmandatory spending programs. Without the discipline provided by the \nbudget process, these programs proceed on automatic pilot. So, \nimportantly, the numbers that were deemed by the Budget Control Act, \nwhich was passed last summer in the wee hours of the morning just to \navoid a governmental shutdown, that Budget Control Act, not subject to \nany amendments and not brought up for debate, set spending levels. But \nit could only set the number for discretionary spending.\n  The Budget Control Act effectively told Chairman Conrad to provide \ndiscretionary spending at the levels of the Budget Control Act caps and \nfor mandatory--the 60 percent--to stay the same, and revenue policies--\ntaxing policies--at levels estimated in the Congressional Budget Office \nMarch 2011 baseline. So mandatory spending and tax increases and tax \npolicies would be controlled by the Congressional Budget Office \nbaseline, business as usual--the definition of business as usual for 60 \npercent of our budget.\n  So the so-called deemed budget is not a real budget, and the process \nused to adopt it is not the kind of process that is legitimate. It is \nnot the kind of process that is required. In the Budget Act, we must \nhave a committee markup. We must have 50 hours of guaranteed debate on \nthe floor of the Senate and an unlimited number of amendments can be \noffered--a public, open discussion about the dangers facing this \ncountry and how Senators are going to deal with them, and they have to \nvote and they have to vote multiple times. The Democratic leadership, \nsupported by Democratic Members, did not want to go through that \nprocess. That is why the Democratic leader, Senator Reid, said it is \nfoolish to have a budget. He did not mean it was foolish for America to \nhave a budget. He meant it was foolish for them to have to vote \npublicly and be accountable for the serious challenges facing this \ncountry. I think that was a big reason for the shellacking a lot of \nMembers of Congress took in the last election.\n\n  The American people want Congress to be accountable. Congress works \nfor them. We are not on our own up here to do whatever we want to. The \nAmerican people are watching us. Forty cents of every $1 we spend is \nborrowed. Are the American people not legitimately unhappy with us? Why \nshould they be satisfied with Congress? Why should we be looked up to \nas people who are leading the country effectively? We will not even \nbring up a budget.\n  I just want to say, the Republicans fought for a budget. I am the \nranking Republican member of the Budget Committee. We pleaded with the \nmajority. We protested. But the leadership in the Senate has the power \nto set the agenda, and a minority cannot call a budget hearing in the \nBudget Committee, nor can they require a real budget to be brought \nforth for full debate on the floor of the Senate.\n  So this is where we are, I just have to say, because our colleague, \nwhom I truly respect and like, Senator Conrad, was saying we do not \nneed a budget today. Apparently, they are not\n\n[[Page S65]]\n\ngoing to produce one again this year. That is not right. We do need a \nbudget, and we need to go through the process because the American \npeople need to know what the debt commission told us; which is, we do \nnot have the money to keep spending as we are spending today.\n  So a real budget would have required a weighing of the spending \ndemands placed on the Federal Government and the available revenues and \nreached a consensus on what activities the government would pursue and \nhow the government would pay for it, including the amount that would be \nadded to the debt--how much are we going to increase the debt and how \nmuch will be left to future generations.\n  So the failure of our Democratic leadership in the Senate is to not \nseriously and credibly address our mandatory spending programs, which \nall experts and observers tell us are on an unsustainable course. \nEveryone tells us that. What we are doing today is unsustainable. For \nexample, the budget the President submitted calls for deficits every \nsingle year for the next decade. It goes from about $1.3 trillion now--\nit was going to drop down, for the lowest single year, to a deficit of \n$740 billion, and in years 7, 8, 9, and 10, it would be going back \nagain to almost $1 trillion.\n  We spend this year $650 billion on Social Security. By the 10th year, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office analysis of the \nPresident's budget, the interest we would pay on the debt alone--just \nthe interest--would be $940 billion. Today it is $240 billion. This is \nhow we get into the European crisis. This is why experts and economists \nhave told us our spending and debt situation is unsustainable. That is \nnot a frivolous word. They mean it is unsustainable.\n  Contending that the creation of the supercommittee absolved the \nSenate of that responsibility to produce a budget is laughable and it \nis not credible and I reject that. Instead, we are told that the \ndeeming of a budget and spending caps--and only discretionary \nspending--determined in secret and brought out in the eleventh hour \nbefore the Senate for an up-or-down vote, without amendment, to avoid a \ngovernment shutdown--to contend that meets the requirements placed on \nthis Chamber for responsibility and fiscal rectitude just cannot be \nsustained. Nothing could be further from the truth. Passing a real \nbudget is indeed not easy, particularly now because we have such a \nserious financial crisis. Tough decisions are going to have to be made. \nPerhaps our Democratic leadership does not want to show Americans how \nmuch their big spending agenda truly costs. That is what a budget shows \nover 10 years: how much we plan to spend, how much we are going to cut, \nhow much we are going to tax. Maybe they do not want the people to know \nhow much they intend to raise taxes and how much of that falls not just \non the rich but on the middle class. I can show you the budget the \nPresident submitted. It goes beyond the rich. It was a big tax \nincrease.\n  The failure to propose and openly debate on the floor a detailed, \nlong-term fiscal plan may be considered by some to be smart. But it is \nsending our country toward the fiscal cliff. Our Democratic colleagues \nwish to pretend for the Nation that they have an actual budget plan. If \nthey want to do that, they must find in their files the secret document \nthey produced last year and finally, once and for all, make it public.\n  Senator Conrad said: I have a budget. He said: We are going to have a \ncommittee markup, and I am going to present to our conferences the \nmajority's budget plan to the Budget Committee. He was prepared to do \nthat. He was prepared to do that, I thought. I was ready to get \nprepared to have the hearing. So when we got ready, somehow it did not \nhappen. It got put off. It got put off again. Then, in the days that \nfollowed and we made a fuss, Senator Reid eventually said, basically: I \nmade that decision not to have a budget. It is foolish to have a \nbudget.\n  So we never saw this budget. He said publicly they had one. Are they \nashamed of it? Were they afraid to bring it out? Did no one want to see \nit? We were prepared with our little calculators to see how much taxes \nwere going to increase, how much spending was going to increase, how \nmuch debt was going to increase. When are we going to change our debt \ntrajectory and make the country better, put us on a sounder path? That \nis what we wanted to know, and we were told we were going to get it. We \ndid not.\n  So instead of an open, accountable process, where the public votes \nare taken, where our constituents can hold us responsible for the \nleadership we provide, we got, at the eleventh hour, deals, a month of \nsecret meetings, and political maneuvers. The primary aim of the \nprocess, it looks to me, was political advantage, not the advantage for \nthe people of the United States.\n  So I believe when the majority leader and his majority colleagues \nchose to block the lawfully mandated budget process and not bring up a \nbudget--not have committee hearings and actual votes, not have 50 hours \nof floor debate, not being able to allow amendments that deal with the \nbudget and spending--they put politics over the Nation's interest. They \nrejected a duty they have, by all just deserts in logic and also by \nlaw. They did so for their political convenience.\n  I think if they continue to fail to produce a budget, to allow it to \nbe discussed, to show what their plans are for the future, they have \nforfeited the leadership they have asked for in the Senate. If they \ncannot produce a budget and they do not have the gumption to lay out \ntheir plan for the future and have numbers that can be studied and \nexamined, added and subtracted--if they cannot do that, if they are not \nwilling to face up to that responsibility, they do not deserve to lead \nthe Senate because, at this point in history, I think it is the most \nsignificant matter we face.\n\n  Our economy is not doing well. Our debt is surging. This year, the \ndebt came in, as of September 30, another $1.3 trillion. Three \nconsecutive years of deficits over $1 trillion, averaging $1.3 \ntrillion. Can you imagine that? The highest deficit President Bush ever \nhad--and it was too high--was $450 billion. But for 3 years we have \naveraged $1.3 trillion.\n  The debt is surging out of control, and the Budget Control Act that \npurports to change that trajectory only reduced the projected deficit \nover 10 years by $2.1 trillion, when every expert--Democrats, \nRepublicans, liberals and conservatives--before our Budget Committee \ntold us we need to have $4 trillion over 10 years in reduced deficits.\n  Because under the projections we have from the Congressional Budget \nOffice, we are on track to add $13 trillion more to the debt in 10 \nyears--$13 trillion more--doubling the now over $13 trillion in debt we \nhave.\n  That is why we cannot continue. We need a plan to change that. \nInstead, we got a minimum reduction, I guess, from approximately $13 \ntrillion to $11 trillion out of the Budget Committee. So we will add \n$11 trillion to the debt over the next 10 years rather than $13 \ntrillion. That is not enough change. Mr. President, $4 trillion, in my \nopinion, based on the studies and the hearings and the testimony of the \nwitnesses I have heard, is not enough. We need to do a good bit more \nthan that. The House proposed a better plan by far. It would have \nchanged our debt course, but the Senate did not do its responsibility \nto meet that challenge or the position of the House.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to share these thoughts. We look forward \ntonight to the President's State of the Union. I hope he will do more \nthan do his normal eloquent processes and lay out a real plan, a plan \nthat can be studied, a plan that can be evaluated, to put this Nation \non a sound fiscal course. Because until we do that, jobs will not be \ncreated, and we will not see growth. There is a lack of confidence in \nour economy, and the greatest foundation of that lack of confidence is \nthe debt.\n  I will just add briefly, there are things we can do to create growth \nand jobs without an increase in spending and without increase in debt. \nHow do we do it? We eliminate every single regulation that is unwise. \nWe reform our Tax Code into a growth-oriented Tax Code as much as \npossible. We produce more American energy and stop making policies that \nprohibit the production of American energy, creating American jobs, \ncreating wealth in the United States, stopping the export of that \nwealth to Venezuela or\n\n[[Page S66]]\n\nSaudi Arabia or other places such as that.\n  We have to end this health care bill that was passed. Already, health \ncare premiums for average Americans have gone up--for a family of four: \n$2,400. Already? It was supposed to bring those costs down. That is a \nhammer blow to the middle class.\n  So we are talking about jobs, growth, progress. Those are the kinds \nof things we need. We can do it without more government debt and more \ngovernment spending. That is what I will be looking for tonight.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on January 28, 2012, privacy advocates, \nindustry leaders, and government officials from across our Nation will \ncelebrate Data Privacy Day 2012. I am pleased to join these \nstakeholders in calling attention to the need to better secure our \nprivacy and security in cyberspace.\n  In the digital age, our Nation faces the challenge of securing our \ncomputer networks from cyber threats and cyber crime, while at the same \ntime, encouraging innovation and protecting Americans' right to \nprivacy. Even as the Internet and other rapidly advancing technologies \nspur economic growth and expand opportunity, there is growing \nuncertainty and unease about how Americans' sensitive personal \ninformation is collected, shared, and stored. Data Privacy Day provides \nan important reminder about the importance of data privacy.\n  After a record year of high-profile data breaches in the private \nsector and throughout government, it is more important than ever that \nCongress step forward and enact meaningful data privacy legislation. As \nthe chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I continue to work \ntoward that goal.\n  Last year, I reintroduced comprehensive data privacy legislation that \nwill better protect Americans' sensitive personal data and reduce the \nrisk of data security breaches. The Personal Data Privacy and Security \nAct would establish a single nationwide standard for data breach \nnotification and require that companies that have databases with \nsensitive personal information establish and implement data privacy and \nsecurity programs. This bill would also help law enforcement better \ncombat cyber crime by strengthening and clarifying the penalties for \nviolations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and creating a new \ncriminal offense for cyber attacks involving government computers that \nmanage critical infrastructure information.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee favorably reported this bill in \nSeptember 2011. The committee has previously reported similar \nlegislation three times. I urge the 112th Congress to finally enact \nthis much needed legislation.\n  In the coming weeks, the Senate is expected to consider comprehensive \ncyber security legislation. Protecting our Nation's data from breaches \nis at the very core of a comprehensive strategy for improving cyber \nsecurity. That is why President Obama included a data breach proposal \nthat closely mirrors the Personal Data Privacy and Security Act in his \ncyber security proposal to Congress. That is why consumer and privacy \nadvocates, business leaders, and Members of Congress on both sides of \nthe aisle continue to call for the enactment of data privacy \nlegislation. And that is why I will continue work to ensure that \nmeaningful data privacy legislation is included in any cyber security \nlegislation the Senate considers this year.\n  I will also continue the important work that the Judiciary Committee \nbegan last year to update the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, \nECPA, so that our digital privacy laws keep pace with changes in \ntechnology. Updating this law to reflect the realities of our time is \nessential to keeping us safe from cyber threats.\n  Again, I thank and commend the many stakeholders and leaders from \nacross the Nation who are holding events to commemorate Data Privacy \nDay. I look forward to working with these stakeholders and with Members \nof Congress on both sides of the aisle and in both Chambers to ensure \nthat the right to privacy is ensured in the digital age.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/24/senate-section/article/S66-3", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S66-S67]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO PASTOR DAVID WOOD\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Chris Bohjalian is one of the treasures of \nVermont, as well as being a gifted writer. We Vermonters are fortunate \nto be able to read his weekly column. They almost always deal with some \naspect of life in the State he and I share.\n  Marcelle and I were especially touched by his column on Christmas Day \nabout Pastor David Wood, of the United Church of Lincoln, VT.\n  So many of us go to church on Christmas Day, shake hands with those \nofficiating at the service and thank them for what they have done, and \nthen go home to be with our families. What Chris has done is talk about \nthe Herculean tasks of Pastor David Wood. It reminds us that those who \ngive us spiritual guidance and consolation do far more than what we see \non holidays and holy days. I would ask unanimous consent that Chris \nBohjalian's column about the extraordinary David Wood be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From the Burlington Free Press]\n\n        Idyll Banter: Burning the Christmas Candle at Both Ends\n\n                          (By Chris Bohjalian)\n\n       Look, I know Santa just pulled an all-nighter, flew through \n     serious turbulence over Iceland, and had to put up with--yet \n     again--Prancer's ``attitude'' that no one has yet to write a \n     song about him. (You live on nothing but lichen between \n     Thanksgiving and Christmas, and watch what happens to your \n     temper.) But my great friend and the pastor of the United \n     Church of Lincoln, David Wood, just performed four church \n     services in 16 hours.\n       Yup. Four in 16. This is what happens when Christmas falls \n     on a Sunday.\n       ``From a spiritual point of view, I love it when Christmas \n     comes on a Sunday. From a practical point of view, it's \n     terrifying,'' David told me.\n       Specifically, last night there were three services at the \n     church here in Lincoln. There was a 7 p.m. pageant for \n     families--and this year the pageant was mighty impressive, \n     with St. Nicholas himself sharing the story of the Nativity. \n     Then there was an 8:30 p.m. service that was more \n     traditional, just as joyous, but at least marginally less \n     raucous. Finally, at 11:30 p.m., there was the quiet, \n     contemplative, communal service that ended shortly after \n     midnight--on Christmas Day. And while the church's youth \n     pastor, Todd Goodyear, did the heaviest lifting at that very \n     first service, David was still plenty involved.\n       In any case, after three services in five hours last night, \n     David finally collapsed into bed about quarter to 1 on \n     Christmas morning . . . and was back in the sanctuary today, \n     preaching, 10 hours later.\n       That workload might not daunt Santa, but it would most \n     mortals.\n       It has always seemed to me that the majority of priests and \n     ministers and rabbis and imams work incredibly hard. \n     Certainly David does. To wit: I will never forget when my \n     wife was in labor with our daughter a little over 18 years \n     ago. When Grace arrived--so did David. The labor was 22 \n     hours, but still he was there within 40 minutes of Grace's \n     arrival. Two months ago, my wife had six hours of kidney \n     surgery. I had told David about it the day before. Sure \n     enough, there he was the next day at the hospital. And it's \n     not like my wife gets preferential treatment. (Given the \n     number of Humane Society shelter cats she has tried to foist \n     on David's family, he should be giving her a very wide \n     berth.) He is always comforting someone or some family in \n     hospitals in two counties. And then there are the funerals. \n     And the christenings. And the baptisms. And the marriages. \n     And the meetings. And the counseling. And the Yankees. (We \n     all have our flaws.) David has been the pastor here in \n     Lincoln since 1979, so this is not the first time that \n     Christmas has fallen on a Sunday on his watch. He knows what \n     to expect: ``Everything speeds up. Nothing slows down.'' \n     Consequently, he had his sermons done weeks ahead of time. He \n     had a plan in place to get the props from the pageant removed\n\n[[Page S67]]\n\n     from the sanctuary in time for the 8:30 service. And, once \n     again, he made sure that all six church fire extinguishers \n     were distributed discretely to volunteer firefighters before \n     that first Christmas Eve service, since it would end with the \n     congregation--including the children--raising and lowering \n     lit candles while we all sang ``Silent Night.''\n       But despite the borderline bedlam that can mark this time \n     of the year for us all, he tries not to lose sight of the \n     blessings that come with that chaos. ``What is most special \n     for me every Sunday, but even more as we approach Christmas \n     and Easter, is the realization that I get to speak the good \n     news to people. Christian faith isn't about rules and \n     regulations, it is about our relationship with a God who \n     loves us enough to choose to be with us.''\n       Indeed. So, while I remain impressed as heck with what \n     Santa Claus and his reindeer just pulled off, I am mighty \n     grateful as well for the work of David Wood and his peers.\n       Merry Christmas. Happy Hanukkah. Peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/24/senate-section/article/S67-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S67]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  RECOGNIZING ELIOT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today, I commend Eliot Elementary \nSchool of Eliot, ME, on being named a 2011 National Blue Ribbon School \nof Excellence. This prestigious recognition of high accomplishment was \nbestowed by U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan.\n  Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools Award is considered the \nhighest honor an American school can obtain. Schools singled out for \nthis national recognition reflect the goals of our Nation's education \nreforms for high standards and accountability. Specifically, the Blue \nRibbon Schools Program is designed to honor public and private schools \nthat are either academically superior in their States or that \ndemonstrate dramatic gains in student achievement.\n  This award recognizes that Eliot Elementary students achieve at the \nhighest level academically. Eliot Elementary School is a top-performing \nschool on State-required assessments, and staff at the school use \nassessments throughout the academic year as a tool for improving and \ncustomizing instruction. The school works closely with families to \nforge a strong school community where students are connected and \nencouraged to pursue their interests.\n  I applaud not only the students but also the administrators, \nteachers, staff, and parents of Eliot Elementary School. Together, they \nare succeeding in their mission to generate excitement and momentum for \nlearning. They are making a difference in the lives of their students, \nhelping them reach their full potential as independent, responsible \nlearners and citizens.\n  I am pleased that the U.S. Department of Education has selected Eliot \nElementary School for this well-deserved honor, and I congratulate the \ncommunities of Eliot and South Berwick for this outstanding \nachievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/24/senate-section/article/S67-2", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S67]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            EVERYBODY WINS!\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize two individuals for their extraordinary service to the \nEverybody Wins! Program in Iowa.\n  As many of my colleagues know, Everybody Wins! is a literacy and \nmentoring program for elementary school students. The program gives \nadults the opportunity to spend one lunch hour a week reading with a \nchild in a public school.\n  Fourteen years ago, Senator Jim Jeffords recruited me to join him as \na volunteer for the Everybody Wins! Program in Washington, D.C. Since \nthen, I have been an Everybody Wins! volunteer at Brent Elementary \nSchool in Washington D.C. I have seen the tremendous impact this \nprogram has both on the adult volunteers and their young student \npartners.\n  I was very happy when Everybody Wins! was launched in my home State \nof Iowa in 2002. Two people I want to recognize today joined Everybody \nWins! as volunteer readers and founding board members in 2003. Both of \nthem retired in the last year after contributing to the solid \nfoundation on which the Iowa program rests today.\n  Mary Ann Nielsen joined the board of Everybody Wins! Iowa in the \nspring of 2003. She continued her service, including as president of \nthe board, until May of 2011. Her work on the board included serving on \nthree executive director search committees, as well as on the personnel \nand executive committees.\n  Amy Elbert also joined the board in the spring of 2003, and continued \nher service until May of 2011. She devoted substantial time and energy \nto fundraising, two executive director search committees, as secretary \nof the board, and as chair of the outreach committee. Amy also has \nenjoyed reading relationships through the program for the past 4 years.\n  For their commitment to our youth, to literacy, and their long-time \ncontributions to Everybody Wins! Iowa, I extend my sincere thanks to \nMary Ann and Amy and wish them all the best in their future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/24/senate-section/article/S67-3", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S67]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              REED COLLEGE\n\n Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, with great pride I wish to \ncongratulate Reed College in Portland, OR, on its 100 years of \ndelivering excellent higher education. Reed College has consistently \ndemonstrated its devotion to academia and to developing the \nintellectual spirit of its students through demanding curricula, \ninsightful research and stimulating classroom conversation. I am \ncertain that the next century will prove to be as fruitful as the last \nfor Reed and its students and that the strong academic tradition will \ncontinue to thrive in the Eastmoreland neighborhood of Portland.\n  Reed's story is much like the city of Portland's. The founders of \nReed wanted to approach higher education differently. They wanted to \nfocus on creating leaders who think outside the box and who know that \nthe answers of the past are not necessarily the answers of the future. \nReed has put an emphasis on the progress of the individual student, \nemphasizing intellectual development over the pursuit of grades.\n  Colleges and universities like Reed allow people to continue their \npursuit of knowledge, to debate problems and to develop ideas. Higher \neducation is also a driving force behind social mobility and has broken \ndown divisions of race, religion, gender and socio-economic class. Reed \nCollege embraces this mission, as reflected in the small class sizes \nfilled with diverse students.\n  One hundred years of commitment to liberal arts education has \nproduced 31 Rhodes Scholars, a great number of Fulbright grant \nrecipients and countless well-educated members of the Oregon community \nand our Nation. To Colin Diver, the President of Reed College, and to \nthe faculty and students of Reed: congratulations on a century of \nacademic excellence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/24/senate-section/article/S67-4", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S67-S68]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REMEMBERING JUDGE LIONEL ``RED'' NOONAN\n\n Mr. SESSIONS.

He knew it was all about service to others, and the courtesy, \nease, and empathy he displayed to all he came upon was noticed and \nappreciated and remembered. Many think good politicians are the smooth \nfolks, always ready with the right words, always thinking, always \nplotting, but Judge Noonan was a great politician because he served his \nconstituents with grace and it came back to him in respect and in \nvotes.\n  As a practicing lawyer in probate court, he always treated me the way \nhe treated everyone. I was a rock-ribbed young Republican and he a \nloyal Democrat, yet I couldn't have been more fairly treated by him. I \nhad always heard, from my Republican friends, what a good man he was. \nAs I have gotten older, I have come to see that in a place such as \nMobile, where people really know one another, those who have good \nreputations are invariably good people. Judge Noonan's good reputation \nwas justly earned over a lifetime of honest dealing.\n  The Republicans were always hoping that he would switch parties and \njoin them. That is in itself a high compliment to be courted by two \nparties. But to the Democrats he remained true.\n  Judge Noonan retired in 2001 after serving 18 years as the Mobile \nCounty probate judge.

Together, we offered a final, \nproud salute to the colors under which more than a million of our \nfellow citizens fought--and several thousand gave their lives.\n  We gather tonight knowing that this generation of heroes has made the \nUnited States safer and more respected around the world. For the first \ntime in nine years, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq. For the \nfirst time in two decades, Osama bin Laden is not a threat to this \ncountry. Most of al Qaeda's top lieutenants have been defeated. The \nTaliban's momentum has been broken, and some troops in Afghanistan have \nbegun to come home.\n  These achievements are a testament to the courage, selflessness, and \nteamwork of America's Armed Forces. At a time when too many of our \ninstitutions have let us down, they exceed all expectations. They're \nnot consumed with personal ambition. They don't obsess over their \ndifferences. They focus on the mission at hand. They work together.\n  Imagine what we could accomplish if we followed their example. Think \nabout the America within our reach: A country that leads the world in \neducating its people. An America that attracts a new generation of \nhigh-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs. A future where we're in \ncontrol of our own energy, and our security and prosperity aren't so \ntied to unstable parts of the world. An economy built to last, where \nhard work pays off, and responsibility is rewarded.\n  We can do this. I know we can, because we've done it before. At the \nend of World War II, when another generation of heroes returned home \nfrom combat, they built the strongest economy and middle class the \nworld has ever known. My grandfather, a veteran of Patton's Army, got \nthe chance to go to college on the GI Bill. My grandmother, who worked \non a bomber assembly line, was part of a workforce that turned out the \nbest products on Earth.\n  The two of them shared the optimism of a Nation that had triumphed \nover a Depression and fascism. They understood they were part of \nsomething larger; that they were contributing to a story of success \nthat every American had a chance to share--the basic American promise \nthat if you worked hard, you could do well enough to raise a family, \nown a home, send your kids to college, and put a little away for \nretirement.\n  The defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive. No \nchallenge is more urgent. No debate is more important. We can either \nsettle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well, \nwhile a growing number of Americans barely get by. Or we can restore an \neconomy where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair \nshare, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. What's at stake are \nnot Democratic values or Republican values, but American values. We \nhave to reclaim them.\n  Let's remember how we got here. Long before the recession, jobs and \nmanufacturing began leaving our shores. Technology made businesses more \nefficient, but also made some jobs obsolete. Folks at the top saw their \nincomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans \nstruggled with costs that were growing, paychecks that weren't, and \npersonal debt that kept piling up.\n  In 2008, the house of cards collapsed. We learned that mortgages had \nbeen sold to people who couldn't afford or understand them. Banks had \nmade huge bets and bonuses with other people's money. Regulators had \nlooked the other way, or didn't have the authority to stop the bad \nbehavior.\n\n  It was wrong. It was irresponsible. And it plunged our economy into a \ncrisis that put millions out of work, saddled us with more debt, and \nleft innocent, hard-working Americans holding the bag. In the six \nmonths before I took office, we lost nearly four million jobs. And we \nlost another four million before our policies were in full effect.\n  Those are the facts. But so are these. In the last 22 months, \nbusinesses have created more than three million jobs. Last year, they \ncreated the most jobs since 2005. American manufacturers are hiring \nagain, creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s. Together, \nwe've agreed to cut the deficit by more than $2 trillion. And we've put \nin place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable, so a crisis like \nthat never happens again.\n  The state of our Union is getting stronger. And we've come too far to \nturn back now. As long as I'm President, I will work with anyone in \nthis chamber to build on this momentum. But I intend to fight \nobstruction with action, and I will oppose any effort to return to the \nvery same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first \nplace.\n  No, we will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing, bad \ndebt, and phony financial profits. Tonight, I want to speak about how \nwe move forward, and lay out a blueprint for an economy that's built to \nlast--an economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, \nskills for American workers, and a renewal of American values.\n  This blueprint begins with American manufacturing.\n  On the day I took office, our auto industry was on the verge of \ncollapse. Some even said we should let it die. With a million jobs at \nstake, I refused to let that happen. In exchange for help, we demanded \nresponsibility. We got workers and automakers to settle their \ndifferences. We got the industry to retool and restructure. Today, \nGeneral Motors is back on top as the world's number one automaker. \nChrysler has grown faster in the U.S. than any major car company. Ford \nis investing billions in U.S. plants and factories. And together, the \nentire industry added nearly 160,000 jobs.\n  We bet on American workers. We bet on American ingenuity. And \ntonight, the American auto industry is back.\n  What's happening in Detroit can happen in other industries. It can \nhappen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh. We can't bring back \nevery job that's left our shores. But right now, it's getting more \nexpensive to do business in places like China. Meanwhile, America is \nmore productive. A few weeks ago, the CEO of Master Lock told me that \nit now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back home. Today, for \nthe first time in fifteen years, Master Lock's unionized plant in \nMilwaukee is running at full capacity.\n  So we have a huge opportunity, at this moment, to bring manufacturing\n\n[[Page S69]]\n\nback. But we have to seize it. Tonight, my message to business leaders \nis simple: ask yourselves what you can do to bring jobs back to your \ncountry, and your country will do everything we can to help you \nsucceed.\n  We should start with our tax code. Right now, companies get tax \nbreaks for moving jobs and profits overseas. Meanwhile, companies that \nchoose to stay in America get hit with one of the highest tax rates in \nthe world. It makes no sense, and everyone knows it.\n  So let's change it. First, if you're a business that wants to \noutsource jobs, you shouldn't get a tax deduction for doing it. That \nmoney should be used to cover moving expenses for companies like Master \nLock that decide to bring jobs home.\n  Second, no American company should be able to avoid paying its fair \nshare of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas. From now on, every \nmultinational company should have to pay a basic minimum tax. And every \npenny should go towards lowering taxes for companies that choose to \nstay here and hire here.\n  Third, if you're an American manufacturer, you should get a bigger \ntax cut. If you're a high-tech manufacturer, we should double the tax \ndeduction you get for making products here. And if you want to relocate \nin a community that was hit hard when a factory left town, you should \nget help financing a new plant, equipment, or training for new workers.\n  My message is simple. It's time to stop rewarding businesses that \nship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that create jobs \nright here in America. Send me these tax reforms and I'll sign them \nright away.\n  We're also making it easier for American businesses to sell products \nall over the world. Two years ago, I set a goal of doubling U.S. \nexports over five years. With the bipartisan trade agreements I signed \ninto law, we are on track to meet that goal--ahead of schedule. Soon, \nthere will be millions of new customers for American goods in Panama, \nColombia and South Korea. Soon, there will be new cars on the streets \nof Seoul imported from Detroit, and Toledo, and Chicago.\n  I will go anywhere in the world to open new markets for American \nproducts. And I will not stand by when our competitors don't play by \nthe rules. We've brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the \nrate as the last administration--and it's made a difference. Over a \nthousand Americans are working today because we stopped a surge in \nChinese tires. But we need to do more. It's not right when another \ncountry lets our movies, music, and software be pirated. It's not fair \nwhen foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only because they're \nheavily subsidized.\n\n  Tonight, I'm announcing the creation of a Trade Enforcement Unit that \nwill be charged with investigating unfair trade practices in countries \nlike China. There will be more inspections to prevent counterfeit or \nunsafe goods from crossing our borders. And this Congress should make \nsure that no foreign company has an advantage over American \nmanufacturing when it comes to accessing finance or new markets like \nRussia. Our workers are the most productive on Earth, and if the \nplaying field is level, I promise you--America will always win.\n  I also hear from many business leaders who want to hire in the United \nStates, but can't find workers with the right skills. Growing \nindustries in science and technology have twice as many openings as we \nhave workers who can do the job. Think about that--openings at a time \nwhen millions of Americans are looking for work.\n  That's inexcusable. And we know how to fix it.\n  Jackie Bray is a single mom from North Carolina who was laid off from \nher job as a mechanic. Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in \nCharlotte, and formed a partnership with Central Piedmont Community \nCollege. The company helped the college design courses in laser and \nrobotics training. It paid Jackie's tuition, then hired her to help \noperate their plant.\n  I want every American looking for work to have the same opportunity \nas Jackie did. Join me in a national commitment to train two million \nAmericans with skills that will lead directly to a job. My \nAdministration has already lined up more companies that want to help. \nModel partnerships between businesses like Siemens and community \ncolleges in places like Charlotte, Orlando and Louisville are up and \nrunning. Now you need to give more community colleges the resources \nthey need to become community career centers--places that teach people \nskills that local businesses are looking for right now, from data \nmanagement to high-tech manufacturing.\n  And I want to cut through the maze of confusing training programs, so \nthat from now on, people like Jackie have one program, one website, and \none place to go for all the information and help they need. It's time \nto turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system that puts \npeople to work.\n  These reforms will help people get jobs that are open today. But to \nprepare for the jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to skills and \neducation has to start earlier.\n  For less than one percent of what our Nation spends on education each \nyear, we've convinced nearly every State in the country to raise their \nstandards for teaching and learning--the first time that's happened in \na generation.\n  But challenges remain. And we know how to solve them.\n  At a time when other countries are doubling down on education, tight \nbudgets have forced States to lay off thousands of teachers. We know a \ngood teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over \n$250,000. A great teacher can offer an escape from poverty to the child \nwho dreams beyond his circumstance. Every person in this chamber can \npoint to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their lives. Most \nteachers work tirelessly, with modest pay, sometimes digging into their \nown pocket for school supplies--just to make a difference.\n  Teachers matter. So instead of bashing them, or defending the status \nquo, let's offer schools a deal. Give them the resources to keep good \nteachers on the job, and reward the best ones. In return, grant schools \nflexibility: to teach with creativity and passion, to stop teaching to \nthe test, and to replace teachers who just aren't helping kids learn.\n  We also know that when students aren't allowed to walk away from \ntheir education, more of them walk the stage to get their diploma. So \ntonight, I call on every State to require that all students stay in \nhigh school until they graduate or turn eighteen.\n  When kids do graduate, the most daunting challenge can be the cost of \ncollege. At a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt than credit \ncard debt, this Congress needs to stop the interest rates on student \nloans from doubling in July. Extend the tuition tax credit we started \nthat saves middle-class families thousands of dollars. And give more \nyoung people the chance to earn their way through college by doubling \nthe number of work-study jobs in the next five years.\n  Of course, it's not enough for us to increase student aid. We can't \njust keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we'll run out of money. \nStates also need to do their part, by making higher education a higher \npriority in their budgets. And colleges and universities have to do \ntheir part by working to keep costs down. Recently, I spoke with a \ngroup of college presidents who've done just that. Some schools re-\ndesign courses to help students finish more quickly. Some use better \ntechnology. The point is, it's possible. So let me put colleges and \nuniversities on notice: if you can't stop tuition from going up, the \nfunding you get from taxpayers will go down. Higher education can't be \na luxury--it's an economic imperative that every family in America \nshould be able to afford.\n  Let's also remember that hundreds of thousands of talented, \nhardworking students in this country face another challenge: the fact \nthat they aren't yet American citizens. Many were brought here as small \nchildren, are American through and through, yet they live every day \nwith the threat of deportation. Others came more recently, to study \nbusiness and science and engineering, but as soon as they get their \ndegree, we send them home to invent new products and create new jobs \nsomewhere else.\n\n  That doesn't make sense.\n  I believe as strongly as ever that we should take on illegal \nimmigration. That's why my Administration has put\n\n[[Page S70]]\n\nmore boots on the border than ever before. That's why there are fewer \nillegal crossings than when I took office.\n  The opponents of action are out of excuses. We should be working on \ncomprehensive immigration reform right now. But if election-year \npolitics keeps Congress from acting on a comprehensive plan, let's at \nleast agree to stop expelling responsible young people who want to \nstaff our labs, start new businesses, and defend this country. Send me \na law that gives them the chance to earn their citizenship. I will sign \nit right away.\n  You see, an economy built to last is one where we encourage the \ntalent and ingenuity of every person in this country. That means women \nshould earn equal pay for equal work. It means we should support \neveryone who's willing to work; and every risk-taker and entrepreneur \nwho aspires to become the next Steve Jobs.\n  After all, innovation is what America has always been about. Most new \njobs are created in start-ups and small businesses. So let's pass an \nagenda that helps them succeed. Tear down regulations that prevent \naspiring entrepreneurs from getting the financing to grow. Expand tax \nrelief to small businesses that are raising wages and creating good \njobs. Both parties agree on these ideas. So put them in a bill, and get \nit on my desk this year.\n  Innovation also demands basic research. Today, the discoveries taking \nplace in our federally-financed labs and universities could lead to new \ntreatments that kill cancer cells but leave healthy ones untouched. New \nlightweight vests for cops and soldiers that can stop any bullet. Don't \ngut these investments in our budget. Don't let other countries win the \nrace for the future. Support the same kind of research and innovation \nthat led to the computer chip and the Internet; to new American jobs \nand new American industries.\n  Nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in American-made \nenergy. Over the last three years, we've opened millions of new acres \nfor oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I'm directing my \nAdministration to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore \noil and gas resources. Right now, American oil production is the \nhighest that it's been in eight years. That's right--eight years. Not \nonly that--last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the \npast sixteen years.\n  But with only 2 percent of the world's oil reserves, oil isn't \nenough. This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that \ndevelops every available source of American energy--a strategy that's \ncleaner, cheaper, and full of new jobs.\n  We have a supply of natural gas that can last America nearly one \nhundred years, and my Administration will take every possible action to \nsafely develop this energy. Experts believe this will support more than \n600,000 jobs by the end of the decade. And I'm requiring all companies \nthat drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use. \nAmerica will develop this resource without putting the health and \nsafety of our citizens at risk.\n  The development of natural gas will create jobs and power trucks and \nfactories that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we don't have to \nchoose between our environment and our economy. And by the way, it was \npublic research dollars, over the course of thirty years, that helped \ndevelop the technologies to extract all this natural gas out of shale \nrock--reminding us that Government support is critical in helping \nbusinesses get new energy ideas off the ground.\n  What's true for natural gas is true for clean energy. In three years, \nour partnership with the private sector has already positioned America \nto be the world's leading manufacturer of high-tech batteries. Because \nof federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled. And \nthousands of Americans have jobs because of it.\n  When Bryan Ritterby was laid off from his job making furniture, he \nsaid he worried that at 55, no one would give him a second chance. But \nhe found work at Energetx, a wind turbine manufacturer in Michigan. \nBefore the recession, the factory only made luxury yachts. Today, it's \nhiring workers like Bryan, who said, ``I'm proud to be working in the \nindustry of the future.''\n  Our experience with shale gas shows us that the payoffs on these \npublic investments don't always come right away. Some technologies \ndon't pan out; some companies fail. But I will not walk away from the \npromise of clean energy. I will not walk away from workers like Bryan. \nI will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to China or \nGermany because we refuse to make the same commitment here. We have \nsubsidized oil companies for a century. That's long enough. It's time \nto end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that's rarely been more \nprofitable, and double-down on a clean energy industry that's never \nbeen more promising. Pass clean energy tax credits and create these \njobs.\n  We can also spur energy innovation with new incentives. The \ndifferences in this chamber may be too deep right now to pass a \ncomprehensive plan to fight climate change. But there's no reason why \nCongress shouldn't at least set a clean energy standard that creates a \nmarket for innovation. So far, you haven't acted. Well tonight, I will. \nI'm directing my Administration to allow the development of clean \nenergy on enough public land to power three million homes. And I'm \nproud to announce that the Department of Defense, the world's largest \nconsumer of energy, will make one of the largest commitments to clean \nenergy in history--with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to power a \nquarter of a million homes a year.\n  Of course, the easiest way to save money is to waste less energy. So \nhere's another proposal: help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in \ntheir factories and give businesses incentives to upgrade their \nbuildings. Their energy bills will be $100 billion lower over the next \ndecade, and America will have less pollution, more manufacturing, and \nmore jobs for construction workers who need them. Send me a bill that \ncreates these jobs.\n  Building this new energy future should be just one part of a broader \nagenda to repair America's infrastructure. So much of America needs to \nbe rebuilt. We've got crumbling roads and bridges. A power grid that \nwastes too much energy. An incomplete high-speed broadband network that \nprevents a small business owner in rural America from selling her \nproducts all over the world.\n  During the Great Depression, America built the Hoover Dam and the \nGolden Gate Bridge. After World War II, we connected our States with a \nsystem of highways. Democratic and Republican administrations invested \nin great projects that benefited everybody, from the workers who built \nthem to the businesses that still use them today.\n  In the next few weeks, I will sign an Executive Order clearing away \nthe red tape that slows down too many construction projects. But you \nneed to fund these projects. Take the money we're no longer spending at \nwar, use half of it to pay down our debt, and use the rest to do some \nnation-building right here at home.\n  There's never been a better time to build, especially since the \nconstruction industry was one of the hardest-hit when the housing \nbubble burst. Of course, construction workers weren't the only ones \nhurt. So were millions of innocent Americans who've seen their home \nvalues decline. And while Government can't fix the problem on its own, \nresponsible homeowners shouldn't have to sit and wait for the housing \nmarket to hit bottom to get some relief.\n  That's why I'm sending this Congress a plan that gives every \nresponsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their \nmortgage, by refinancing at historically low interest rates. No more \nred tape. No more runaround from the banks. A small fee on the largest \nfinancial institutions will ensure that it won't add to the deficit, \nand will give banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to repay a \ndeficit of trust.\n  Let's never forget: Millions of Americans who work hard and play by \nthe rules every day deserve a Government and a financial system that do \nthe same. It's time to apply the same rules from top to bottom: No \nbailouts, no handouts, and no copouts. An America built to last insists \non responsibility from everybody.\n  We've all paid the price for lenders who sold mortgages to people who \ncouldn't afford them, and buyers who knew they couldn't afford them. \nThat's why we need smart regulations to prevent irresponsible behavior. \nRules to\n\n[[Page S71]]\n\nprevent financial fraud, or toxic dumping, or faulty medical devices, \ndon't destroy the free market. They make the free market work better.\n  There is no question that some regulations are outdated, unnecessary, \nor too costly. In fact, I've approved fewer regulations in the first \nthree years of my presidency than my Republican predecessor did in his. \nI've ordered every federal agency to eliminate rules that don't make \nsense. We're revising over 500 more, just a fraction of reforms that \nwill save business and citizens more than $10 billion over the next \nfive years. We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have \nforced some dairy farmers to spend $10,000 a year proving that they \ncould contain a spill--because milk was somehow classified as an oil. \nWith a rule like that, I guess it was worth crying over spilled milk.\n  I'm confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a federal \nagency looking over his shoulder. But I will not back down from making \nsure an oil company can contain the kind of oil spill we saw in the \nGulf two years ago. I will not back down from protecting our kids from \nmercury pollution, or making sure that our food is safe and our water \nis clean. I will not go back to the days when health insurance \ncompanies had unchecked power to cancel your policy, deny you coverage, \nor charge women differently from men.\n  And I will not go back to the days when Wall Street was allowed to \nplay by its own set of rules. The new rules we passed restore what \nshould be any financial system's core purpose: getting funding to \nentrepreneurs with the best ideas, and getting loans to responsible \nfamilies who want to buy a home, start a business, or send a kid to \ncollege.\n  So if you're a big bank or financial institution, you are no longer \nallowed to make risky bets with your customers' deposits. You're \nrequired to write out a ``living will'' that details exactly how you'll \npay the bills if you fail--because the rest of us aren't bailing you \nout ever again. And if you're a mortgage lender or a payday lender or a \ncredit card company, the days of signing people up for products they \ncan't afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices are over. \nToday, American consumers finally have a watchdog in Richard Cordray \nwith one job: to look out for them.\n  We will also establish a Financial Crimes Unit of highly trained \ninvestigators to crack down on large-scale fraud and protect people's \ninvestments. Some financial firms violate major anti-fraud laws because \nthere's no real penalty for being a repeat offender. That's bad for \nconsumers, and it's bad for the vast majority of bankers and financial \nservice professionals who do the right thing. So pass legislation that \nmakes the penalties for fraud count.\n  And tonight, I am asking my Attorney General to create a special unit \nof federal prosecutors and leading state attorneys general to expand \nour investigations into the abusive lending and packaging of risky \nmortgages that led to the housing crisis. This new unit will hold \naccountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, \nand help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many \nAmericans.\n  A return to the American values of fair play and shared \nresponsibility will help us protect our people and our economy. But it \nshould also guide us as we look to pay down our debt and invest in our \nfuture.\n  Right now, our most immediate priority is stopping a tax hike on 160 \nmillion working Americans while the recovery is still fragile. People \ncannot afford losing $40 out of each paycheck this year. There are \nplenty of ways to get this done. So let's agree right here, right now: \nNo side issues. No drama. Pass the payroll tax cut without delay.\n  When it comes to the deficit, we've already agreed to more than $2 \ntrillion in cuts and savings. But we need to do more, and that means \nmaking choices. Right now, we're poised to spend nearly $1 trillion \nmore on what was supposed to be a temporary tax break for the \nwealthiest 2 percent of Americans. Right now, because of loopholes and \nshelters in the tax code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax \nrates than millions of middle-class households. Right now, Warren \nBuffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary.\n  Do we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? Or do \nwe want to keep our investments in everything else--like education and \nmedical research; a strong military and care for our veterans? Because \nif we're serious about paying down our debt, we can't do both.\n  The American people know what the right choice is. So do I. As I told \nthe Speaker this summer, I'm prepared to make more reforms that rein in \nthe long term costs of Medicare and Medicaid, and strengthen Social \nSecurity, so long as those programs remain a guarantee of security for \nseniors.\n  But in return, we need to change our tax code so that people like me, \nand an awful lot of Members of Congress, pay our fair share of taxes. \nTax reform should follow the Buffett rule: if you make more than $1 \nmillion a year, you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes. And \nmy Republican friend Tom Coburn is right: Washington should stop \nsubsidizing millionaires. In fact, if you're earning a million dollars \na year, you shouldn't get special tax subsidies or deductions. On the \nother hand, if you make under $250,000 a year, like 98 percent of \nAmerican families, your taxes shouldn't go up. You're the ones \nstruggling with rising costs and stagnant wages. You're the ones who \nneed relief.\n  Now, you can call this class warfare all you want. But asking a \nbillionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes? Most \nAmericans would call that common sense.\n  We don't begrudge financial success in this country. We admire it. \nWhen Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes, \nit's not because they envy the rich. It's because they understand that \nwhen I get tax breaks I don't need and the country can't afford, it \neither adds to the deficit, or somebody else has to make up the \ndifference--like a senior on a fixed income; or a student trying to get \nthrough school; or a family trying to make ends meet. That's not right. \nAmericans know it's not right. They know that this generation's success \nis only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each \nother, and to their country's future, and they know our way of life \nwill only endure if we feel that same sense of shared responsibility. \nThat's how we'll reduce our deficit. That's an America built to last.\n  I recognize that people watching tonight have differing views about \ntaxes and debt; energy and health care. But no matter what party they \nbelong to, I bet most Americans are thinking the same thing right now: \nnothing will get done this year, or next year, or maybe even the year \nafter that, because Washington is broken.\n  Can you blame them for feeling a little cynical?\n  The greatest blow to confidence in our economy last year didn't come \nfrom events beyond our control. It came from a debate in Washington \nover whether the United States would pay its bills or not. Who \nbenefited from that fiasco?\n  I've talked tonight about the deficit of trust between Main Street \nand Wall Street. But the divide between this city and the rest of the \ncountry is at least as bad--and it seems to get worse every year.\n\n  Some of this has to do with the corrosive influence of money in \npolitics. So together, let's take some steps to fix that. Send me a \nbill that bans insider trading by Members of Congress, and I will sign \nit tomorrow. Let's limit any elected official from owning stocks in \nindustries they impact. Let's make sure people who bundle campaign \ncontributions for Congress can't lobby Congress, and vice versa--an \nidea that has bipartisan support, at least outside of Washington.\n  Some of what's broken has to do with the way Congress does its \nbusiness these days. A simple majority is no longer enough to get \nanything--even routine business--passed through the Senate. Neither \nparty has been blameless in these tactics. Now both parties should put \nan end to it. For starters, I ask the Senate to pass a rule that all \njudicial and public service nominations receive a simple up or down \nvote within 90 days.\n  The executive branch also needs to change. Too often, it's \ninefficient, outdated and remote. That's why I've asked this Congress \nto grant me the authority to consolidate the federal bureaucracy so \nthat our Government is\n\n[[Page S72]]\n\nleaner, quicker, and more responsive to the needs of the American \npeople.\n  Finally, none of these reforms can happen unless we also lower the \ntemperature in this town. We need to end the notion that the two \nparties must be locked in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction; \nthat politics is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead of building \nconsensus around common sense ideas.\n  I'm a Democrat. But I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln \nbelieved: that Government should do for people only what they cannot do \nbetter by themselves, and no more. That's why my education reform \noffers more competition, and more control for schools and States. \nThat's why we're getting rid of regulations that don't work. That's why \nour health care law relies on a reformed private market, not a \nGovernment program.\n  On the other hand, even my Republican friends who complain the most \nabout Government spending have supported federally-financed roads, and \nclean energy projects, and federal offices for the folks back home.\n  The point is, we should all want a smarter, more effective \nGovernment. And while we may not be able to bridge our biggest \nphilosophical differences this year, we can make real progress. With or \nwithout this Congress, I will keep taking actions that help the economy \ngrow. But I can do a whole lot more with your help. Because when we act \ntogether, there is nothing the United States of America can't achieve.\n  That is the lesson we've learned from our actions abroad over the \nlast few years.\n  Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to strike decisive blows against \nour enemies. From Pakistan to Yemen, the al Qaeda operatives who remain \nare scrambling, knowing that they can't escape the reach of the United \nStates of America.\n  From this position of strength, we've begun to wind down the war in \nAfghanistan. Ten thousand of our troops have come home. Twenty-three \nthousand more will leave by the end of this summer. This transition to \nAfghan lead will continue, and we will build an enduring partnership \nwith Afghanistan, so that it is never again a source of attacks against \nAmerica.\n  As the tide of war recedes, a wave of change has washed across the \nMiddle East and North Africa, from Tunis to Cairo; from Sana'a to \nTripoli. A year ago, Qadhafi was one of the world's longest-serving \ndictators--a murderer with American blood on his hands. Today, he is \ngone. And in Syria, I have no doubt that the Assad regime will soon \ndiscover that the forces of change can't be reversed, and that human \ndignity can't be denied.\n  How this incredible transformation will end remains uncertain. But we \nhave a huge stake in the outcome. And while it is ultimately up to the \npeople of the region to decide their fate, we will advocate for those \nvalues that have served our own country so well. We will stand against \nviolence and intimidation. We will stand for the rights and dignity of \nall human beings--men and women; Christians, Muslims and Jews. We will \nsupport policies that lead to strong and stable democracies and open \nmarkets, because tyranny is no match for liberty.\n  And we will safeguard America's own security against those who \nthreaten our citizens, our friends, and our interests. Look at Iran. \nThrough the power of our diplomacy, a world that was once divided about \nhow to deal with Iran's nuclear program now stands as one. The regime \nis more isolated than ever before; its leaders are faced with crippling \nsanctions, and as long as they shirk their responsibilities, this \npressure will not relent. Let there be no doubt: America is determined \nto prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will take no \noptions off the table to achieve that goal. But a peaceful resolution \nof this issue is still possible, and far better, and if Iran changes \ncourse and meets its obligations, it can rejoin the community of \nnations.\n  The renewal of American leadership can be felt across the globe. Our \noldest alliances in Europe and Asia are stronger than ever. Our ties to \nthe Americas are deeper. Our iron-clad commitment to Israel's security \nhas meant the closest military cooperation between our two countries in \nhistory. We've made it clear that America is a Pacific power, and a new \nbeginning in Burma has lit a new hope. From the coalitions we've built \nto secure nuclear materials, to the missions we've led against hunger \nand disease; from the blows we've dealt to our enemies; to the enduring \npower of our moral example, America is back.\n\n  Anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you that America is \nin decline or that our influence has waned, doesn't know what they're \ntalking about. That's not the message we get from leaders around the \nworld, all of whom are eager to work with us. That's not how people \nfeel from Tokyo to Berlin; from Cape Town to Rio; where opinions of \nAmerica are higher than they've been in years. Yes, the world is \nchanging; no, we can't control every event. But America remains the one \nindispensable nation in world affairs--and as long as I'm President, I \nintend to keep it that way.\n  That's why, working with our military leaders, I have proposed a new \ndefense strategy that ensures we maintain the finest military in the \nworld, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our budget. To \nstay one step ahead of our adversaries, I have already sent this \nCongress legislation that will secure our country from the growing \ndanger of cyberthreats.\n  Above all, our freedom endures because of the men and women in \nuniform who defend it. As they come home, we must serve them as well as \nthey served us. That includes giving them the care and benefits they \nhave earned--which is why we've increased annual VA spending every year \nI've been President. And it means enlisting our veterans in the work of \nrebuilding our Nation.\n  With the bipartisan support of this Congress, we are providing new \ntax credits to companies that hire vets. Michelle and Jill Biden have \nworked with American businesses to secure a pledge of 135,000 jobs for \nveterans and their families. And tonight, I'm proposing a Veterans Job \nCorps that will help our communities hire veterans as cops and \nfirefighters, so that America is as strong as those who defend her.\n  Which brings me back to where I began. Those of us who've been sent \nhere to serve can learn from the service of our troops. When you put on \nthat uniform, it doesn't matter if you're black or white; Asian or \nLatino; conservative or liberal; rich or poor; gay or straight. When \nyou're marching into battle, you look out for the person next to you, \nor the mission fails. When you're in the thick of the fight, you rise \nor fall as one unit, serving one Nation, leaving no one behind.\n  One of my proudest possessions is the flag that the SEAL Team took \nwith them on the mission to kill bin Laden. On it are each of their \nnames. Some may be Democrats. Some may be Republicans. But that doesn't \nmatter. Just like it didn't matter that day in the Situation Room, when \nI sat next to Bob Gates--a man who was George Bush's defense secretary; \nand Hillary Clinton, a woman who ran against me for president.\n  All that mattered that day was the mission. No one thought about \npolitics. No one thought about themselves. One of the young men \ninvolved in the raid later told me that he didn't deserve credit for \nthe mission. It only succeeded, he said, because every single member of \nthat unit did their job--the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun \nout of control; the translator who kept others from entering the \ncompound; the troops who separated the women and children from the \nfight; the SEALs who charged up the stairs. More than that, the mission \nonly succeeded because every member of that unit trusted each other--\nbecause you can't charge up those stairs, into darkness and danger, \nunless you know that there's someone behind you, watching your back.\n  So it is with America. Each time I look at that flag, I'm reminded \nthat our destiny is stitched together like those fifty stars and those \nthirteen stripes. No one built this country on their own. This Nation \nis great because we built it together. This Nation is great because we \nworked as a team. This Nation is great because we get each other's \nbacks. And if we hold fast to that truth, in this moment of trial, \nthere is no challenge too great; no mission too hard. As long as we're \njoined in common purpose, as long as we\n\n[[Page S73]]\n\nmaintain our common resolve, our journey moves forward, our future is \nhopeful, and the state of our Union will always be strong.\n  Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless the United States of \nAmerica.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, January 24, 2012.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/24/senate-section/article/S73-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S73]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:54 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1141.
