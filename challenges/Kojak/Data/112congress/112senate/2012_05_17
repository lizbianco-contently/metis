Mr. President, I now move to proceed to Calendar No. 400.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 400, S. 3187, a bill to \n     amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to revise and \n     extend the user-fee programs for prescription drugs and \n     medical devices, to establish user-fee programs for generic \n     drugs and biosimilars, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are now on the motion to proceed to FDA \nuser-fees legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, the time until 10:30 a.m. be equally divided and \ncontrolled between the two leaders or their designees, with the \nRepublicans controlling the first half and the majority controlling the \nfinal half.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, at 10:30 a.m. today the Senate will proceed \nto executive session to consider the Stein and Powell nominations, both \nnominees to the Board of Governors at the Federal Reserve system. At \nnoon, there will be two votes on the confirmation of their nominations. \nAt this stage, there likely will be no more votes after that, but we \nwill keep everyone advised as to what is going to happen.\n  Mr. President, when someone we love gets sick, the only thing on your \nmind is how to help them get well, how to get them the care they need.\n  But before every miracle drug or innovative new device comes to \nmarket, there is a rigorous approval process to make sure that device \nor that medicine is going to be safe. To get lifesaving drugs and \ndevices to the patients who need them as quickly and efficiently as \npossible, Congress must give the Food and Drug Administration the tools \nit needs to review and approve these products. Today the Senate will \nbegin consideration of legislation which gives FDA the resources to \nensure medical devices, drugs, and treatments are safe and effective.\n  I applaud the work of my colleagues Senator Harkin and Senator Enzi \nto bring this legislation to the floor. These two fine Senators have \ndifferent political philosophies on things generally, but they work \nwell on this committee and I am very proud of each of them. I consider \nthem both friends. And bringing this bill to the floor in the manner \nthey did is indicative of the work that needs to be done around here \nmore often. So I hope to see the strong bipartisan effort these two \nSenators began continue as the Senate considers this important \nlegislation.\n  The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act authorizes \nthe FDA to charge manufacturers of new medical devices user fees. These \nfees are used to ensure their products are reviewed quickly and \nthoroughly before they are approved. But this legislation does more \nthan maintain the status quo; it also enacts crucial reforms that will \nprevent drug shortages\n\n[[Page S3244]]\n\nand bring the lifesaving medicines to market more quickly, it will save \nhigh-tech jobs in the medical field, make new treatments available to \npatients quickly, and preserve America's role as a global leader in \nbiomedical innovation.\n\n  The legislation will expedite the processes of approving new drugs \nand medical devices--including many designed for children--while \nensuring these products are safe for consumers. It will help spur the \ninnovations that bring the next groundbreaking cancer or Parkinson's \ndrug to market.\n  The bill will hold foreign manufacturers who sell drugs in the United \nStates to the same high standards met by American companies. This is \nextremely important because of all the misleading attempts by these \nmanufacturers to sell them on the Internet.\n  It will help prevent drug shortages by opening the lines of \ncommunication between manufacturers and the FDA. The Senator from \nMinnesota, Senator Klobuchar, and the junior Senator from Pennsylvania, \nSenator Casey, have been leaders in this drug shortage issue, and I \napplaud them. They are doing this to safeguard Americans' health. Every \nday hospitals across the country experience shortages of lifesaving \nFDA-approved drugs and treatments.\n  As most Senators know, my wife has been ill with cancer and she had \n20 weeks of chemotherapy. Every week, we were worried that the drugs \nwouldn't be there on that Monday morning at noon when she got those \ntreatments. Fortunately for us, they were. But that isn't the way it is \nwith everyone around the country. People who need these lifesaving \nmedications have found those medicines not available, and we have to do \neverything we can to stop that.\n  These shortages threaten public health and prevent patients from \ngetting the care they need. The shortage of one drug used to treat a \nrare form of childhood leukemia--a drug that is an effective cure in 90 \npercent of those cases--has literally put young lives at risk by not \nhaving those drugs. And when I say a 90-percent cure rate, it is \namazing. One of my high school buddies had a son who was playing Little \nLeague baseball. Running around the bases, he couldn't do it. This was \na macho family with all these tough boys in the family, and they were \nconcerned that he was not being as aggressive as he should be. He had \nleukemia, and this boy died. There was nothing they could do for him. \nHe died. Now 90 percent of these cases are cured.\n  I have spoken on the floor before--others have--there is one form of \nleukemia that has been almost stopped in its tracks by the scientists \ndiscovering a bush called periwinkle, and they use the products from \nthat little weed to cure cancer.\n  We need to do everything we can to make sure these lifesaving drugs \nare available. No mother or father should have to watch a child suffer \nas he waits for a lifesaving medicine. But as the number of drug \nshortages increases each year, more parents wait and worry; more \nhusbands and wives and daughters and sons wait and worry.\n  In 2005, the FDA reported shortages of 55 medications. Last year, the \nnumber jumped to 231, including the leukemia drug I mentioned and some \nchemotherapy medicines. These shortages are caused by a variety of \nfactors: problems with factories, limited manufacturing capacity, or \nlack of raw materials.\n  Another thing we have learned is the manufacturers of these products \nwant to be able to sell everything. They don't want to waste valuable \nmoney on storing medicines. One of the big businesses that used to be \nin America is warehouses storing things. In Reno, NV, we were a big \nwarehouse storage area because we had no tax on storage. But anymore, \nthere is not as much being stored because manufacturers determined that \nis a waste of money. That is one of the things that happened with these \npharmaceuticals.\n  Some, though, are caused by a lack of financial incentive--or profit \nmotive is what it is. There is nothing wrong with that, but companies \nsimply don't manufacture enough because they don't make enough money.\n  Public awareness and pressure have prompted drugmakers to voluntarily \nnotify the FDA of any impending shortages, preventing almost 200 more \nshortages last year than I just talked about. But Congress can, and \nmust, do more to improve communication with drugmakers, the FDA, and \nhospitals providing this crucial care.\n  Passing this legislation without delay will be a leap forward in that \nprocess. That is why last night I said--and I say today--I hope we \ndon't have to file cloture on a motion to proceed to this lifesaving \nlegislation. Let's get on this legislation. If we have to vote on \ncloture on this Monday, then we can't get on this until Wednesday and \nstart legislating. How foolish.\n  We will have amendments. I have had a number of Republican Senators \ncome to me and say, We want to be able to offer amendments, relevant \namendments. Good. Let's do it. If someone has a problem with this bill, \ndon't stop us from going to it; offer an amendment. If it is a worthy \ncause, we will vote with him or her and get rid of what is in that \nlegislation. But don't hold up the legislation.\n  I would hope my Republican colleagues talk to one of the Senators who \nis holding us up and say, Don't do that; it is making us, the \nRepublicans, look bad. And it does.\n  I hope we can get on this legislation and work to make the health \ncare delivery system in America more effective and efficient.\n  Would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 10:30 will be equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees, with the Republicans controlling the first half and the \nmajority controlling the second half.\n  The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as if in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    Second Amendment Sovereignty Act\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, our Nation's Founding Fathers amended the \nU.S. Constitution more than two centuries ago to guarantee a bill of \nrights for its citizens. Since then, our democracy has stood strong and \nAmericans have enjoyed liberties and freedoms unparalleled in the \nworld, including the fundamental right to keep and bear arms guaranteed \nby the second amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n  Today our freedoms and our country's sovereignty are in danger of \nbeing undermined by the United Nations. To ensure our liberties remain \nfor generations, today and for the future, I am offering legislation to \nprotect the rights of American gun owners from the effects of any U.N. \narms treaty.\n  In October of 2009, at the U.N. General Assembly, the Obama \nadministration voted for the United States to participate in \nnegotiating an arms trade treaty--a reversal of the previous \nadministration's position. This treaty is supposedly intended to \nestablish ``common international standards for the import, export and \ntransfer of conventional arms,'' including tanks, helicopters, and \nmissiles. However, by threatening to include civilian firearms within \nits scope, the arms trade treaty would restrict the lawful private \nownership of firearms in our country. Whether that is true depends upon \nwhat the treaty actually says.\n  Less than 2 months from now, the U.N. Conference on Arms Trade Treaty \nwill take place in New York, and that presumably will determine the \nlanguage that is ultimately included as the treaty will be finalized \nfor its adoption.\n  Given where the process stands today, I am concerned that this treaty \nwill infringe upon the second amendment rights of American gun owners. \nI am also concerned it will be used by other countries that do not \nshare our freedoms to wrongly place the burden of controlling \ninternational crime and terrorism on law-abiding American citizens.\n  Currently, proposals being considered by the preparatory committee at \nthe U.N. would adversely affect U.S. citizens. I have several concerns \nwith these proposals. First, there have been regular calls for bans or \nrestrictions on the civilian ownership of guns Americans use to hunt, \ntarget shoot and defend themselves.\n\n  Second, by requiring firearms to be accounted for throughout their \nlifespan, the Arms Trade Treaty could\n\n[[Page S3245]]\n\nlead to nationwide gun registration. This despite evidence that the \ncostly bureaucratic system has been a complete failure in solving any \ncrimes or stopping criminals from getting access to guns everywhere \nit's been tried.\n  Third, other proposals could require the marking and tracking of all \nammunition, including ammunition for civilian sale and use.\n  To make sure that our country's sovereignty and the rights of \nAmerican gun owners are protected as the administration negotiates this \ntreaty, I have sponsored S. 2205, the Second Amendment Sovereignty Act. \nThis legislation is simple.\n  First, it says that the administration cannot use the ``voice, vote \nand influence of the United States'' to negotiate a treaty that in any \nway restricts the second amendment rights of American citizens. This is \na commonsense requirement that even the Obama administration maintains.\n  In an August letter I received from the U.S. State Department, they \nwrote:\n\n       The Administration will not agree to a treaty that will \n     infringe on the constitutional rights of American citizens . \n     . . We will not agree to treaty provisions that would alter \n     or diminish existing rights of American citizens to \n     manufacture, assemble, possess, transfer, or purchase \n     firearms, ammunition, and related items.\n\n  This bill will hold them to that pledge.\n  Second, S. 2205 specifically prohibits the administration from \nseeking to negotiate a treaty that regulates the domestic manufacture, \npossession, or purchase of firearms and ammunition. In other words, \nthis bill seeks to maintain the sovereignty of our laws within our \nborders. U.N. member states regularly argue that no treaty controlling \nthe transfer of arms internationally can be effective without controls \non transfers inside a country's own borders. This is unacceptable.\n  Again, the administration claims to agree, saying it ``will oppose \nany effort to address internal transfers.'' Congress should hold them \nto this pledge. At stake is our country's autonomy and the rights of \nAmerican citizens protected under the Constitution.\n  More specifically, this legislation seeks to ensure that U.S. \ncitizens will not be subjected to restrictions on the use or possession \nof civilian firearms and ammunition. It prohibits the administration \nfrom negotiating a treaty that would result in domestic regulations on \ncivilian firearms like hunting rifles that are often mischaracterized \nas ``military weapons,'' ``small arms,'' or ``light arms.'' Civilian \nfirearms must be excluded from the Arms Trade Treaty.\n  Preparatory committee meetings have made it clear that many U.N. \nmember states aim to craft an extremely broad treaty that includes \ncivilian firearms within its scope. For example, Mexico and several \ncountries in Central and South America have called for the treaty to \ncover ``all types of conventional weapons (regardless of their \npurpose), including small arms and light weapons, ammunition, \ncomponents, parts, technology and related materials.''\n  If those provisions were included in a treaty, that treaty would be \nincredibly difficult to enforce, and would pose dangers to all U.S. \nbusinesses and individuals involved in any aspect of the firearms \nindustry, from manufacturers to dealers to consumers.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to adopt this commonsense \nlegislation. On July 22 of last year, 57 U.S. Senators joined me in \nreminding the Obama administration that our firearm freedoms are not \nnegotiable.\n  We notified President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton of our \nintent to oppose ratification of a treaty that in any way restricts \nAmericans' second amendment rights. Our opposition is strong enough to \nblock the treaty from passage, as treaties submitted to the U.S. Senate \nrequire two-thirds approval to be ratified.\n  As the treaty process continues, the Second Amendment Sovereignty Act \nseeks to further reinforce to the administration that our country's \nsovereignty and firearm freedoms must not be infringed upon by an \ninternational organization made up of many countries with little \nrespect for gun rights. America leads the world in export standards to \nensure arms are transferred for legitimate purposes and my bill will \nmake certain that law-abiding Americans are not wrongfully punished.\n  In the days ahead, I will continue to work with my colleagues to \nensure an Arms Trade Treaty--if negotiations result in one--that \nundermines the Constitutional rights of American gun owners is dead on \narrival in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            A Second Opinion\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today, as I have \nweek after week since the President's health care law was signed, to \ntalk as a doctor, someone who has taken care of patients all around \nWyoming, someone who has run the Wyoming health fairs, giving low-cost \nmedical screenings to thousands of citizens around our State, and \nsomeone who knows we need health care reform in a way that gives \npatients the care they need from the doctor they want at a cost they \ncan afford. There were so many promises made with this health care law \nthat I come week after week because there are so many broken promises.\n  Today I want to remind the body that the former Speaker of the House, \nNancy Pelosi, once predicted that the health care reform ``will create \n4 million jobs; 400,000 jobs almost immediately.'' It is now 2 years \nlater, and we know that actually the exact opposite is happening. We \ncontinue with high unemployment. We continue with people out of work, \nunemployed, underemployed, and the promise both from the President of \nnew jobs and of Nancy Pelosi of 4 million jobs is another broken \npromise. Instead of creating jobs, this new law is destroying jobs all \nacross the country. You say, how is it they can actually be destroying \njobs? That is exactly what we are seeing as a result of the health care \nlaw.\n  Recently, columnist George Will wrote about how the President's law \nwill impact Cook Medical. It is the world's largest family-owned \nmedical devices company. He explained in his column that the Democratic \nCongress ``included in the legislation''--and all the people on that \nside of the aisle voted for this--``included in the legislation a 2.3 \npercent tax on gross revenue''--that is not profits, that is gross \nrevenue--``which generally amounts to about a 15 percent tax on most \nmanufacturing profits--from U.S. sales in medical devices beginning in \n2013.'' So it is something that is happening very soon. ``This will be \npiled,'' as he said, ``on top of the 35 percent federal corporate tax, \nand state and local taxes.''\n  Mr. Will went on to say that this 2.3 percent tax will be a $20 \nbillion blow to an industry that employs more than 40,000 people, and \n$20 billion is almost double the industry's annual investment in \nresearch and development.\n  We want them to do research. We want development. We want new and \ninnovative treatments that will actually help people. Instead, this \nadministration--the Democrats in Congress in the House and the Senate \nand the President of the United States--put on a 2.3-percent tax, a $20 \nbillion blow to those who do the research and the development. This tax \nis going to lead to ``fewer jobs but also fewer pain-reducing and life-\nextending inventions--stents, implantable defibrillators--which all \nhave reduced health care costs.''\n  That is a quote from the article.\n  Cook Medical is not the only medical device company that is bracing \nfor the President's new penalty on jobs and innovation. In fact, let's \ntake a look at some of those.\n  Boston Scientific is planning for more than a $100 million charge \nagainst earnings in 2013. They recently built a $35 million research \nand development facility. This is called Boston Scientific--Boston. \nWhere did they build their research center? Ireland. And they are \nbuilding a $150 million factory called Boston Scientific in China. That \nis as a result of what we see with this health care law and the impact \nof what this administration is doing to jobs in America.\n  Stryker Corporation, based in Michigan, blames the tax for 1,000 \nlayoffs.\n\n[[Page S3246]]\n\n  Zimmer, based in Indiana, is laying off 450 and taking a $50 million \ncharge against earnings related to this tax.\n  These are companies that, as an orthopedic surgeon, I say have made \nnew advances in technologies, in artificial joints over the years I \nhave practiced in Wyoming. These are companies that have longstanding \nreputations. Yet they are laying off people because of the new Medicare \nlaw--American workers.\n  Medtronic expects an annual charge against earnings of $175 million.\n  Other companies--Covidien, now based in Ireland, has cited the tax in \nexplanation of 200 layoffs and a decision to move production to Costa \nRica and to Mexico.\n  Once again, the column by Mr. Will makes it clear that the \nPresident's health care law is destroying jobs and is having a \ndevastating impact on our economy.\n  In March, Senator Coburn and I released our third health care law \noversight report. We entitled the report ``Warning: Side Effects, A \nCheck-Up on the Federal Health Law.'' One chapter in our report is \ndedicated to the health care law's job-killing Medicare device tax. It \nis a tax the analyses predict will negatively impact job creation and \nalso--incredibly important for people around this country--will stifle \nmedical innovation.\n  As an orthopedic surgeon, I can tell you that I have seen firsthand \nhow cutting-edge technology saves lives and also supports jobs across \nthe country. Scientists have invented medical devices, such as \npacemakers, defibrillators, and artificial joints, that have improved \nthe quality of life for so many Americans. But now, today, because of \nthis health care law, the future of the medical device industry in \nAmerica is under attack. In September of 2011, the Manhattan Institute \nissued a report showing the devastating impact the President's device \ntax will have on industry. The Manhattan Institute's report shows the \nmedical device tax will eliminate at least 43,000 American jobs. This \nnumber represents more than 1 out of every 10 jobs in the device \nmanufacturing sector. It is not a record the Democrats should be proud \nof, but it is clearly a record caused by the other side of the aisle, \nthe Democrats, and specifically the President who signed this bill into \nlaw.\n\n  Not only will this tax kill 43,000 jobs, workers are going to lose \nabout $3.5 billion in wages. This is money these workers could have \nspent in their local communities to help the economy of those \ncommunities and, therefore, the Nation's economy.\n  So what does all this mean to U.S. device manufacturers? Well, these \ncompanies are more likely to close their plants in the United States. \nThey will close the plants here and do what others have done: replace \nthem with plants overseas. Foreign manufacturers will improve their \ncompetitiveness compared to American firms. This will severely threaten \nU.S. leadership in the device industry and in the world. Do we want to \nsee plants closing at high-tech medical device research facilities in \nStates such as Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, New Jersey, New \nYork, and Wisconsin?\n  Finally, the President's medical device tax is going to increase \ncosts to American consumers. These are the American consumers who said \nwhat they wanted with the health care law is care they need, the doctor \nthey want, at a price they can afford. Yet this health care law is \ngoing to increase costs to American consumers. The Congressional Budget \nOffice has warned that the health care law's tax imposed on medical \ndevice manufacturers and drug manufacturers and health insurance \nproviders would be passed through to the consumers in the form of \nhigher insurance premiums. Wasn't it the President who promised that \nunder his health care law insurance premiums would lower by $2,500 a \nyear? Is that a promise the President and Democrats in Congress have \nforgotten? The American people have not forgotten, which is why the \nhealth care law is even more unpopular today than the day it was signed \ninto law.\n  The administration's own Medicare Chief Actuary, Richard Foster, came \nto the same conclusion. He estimated these taxes could be passed \nthrough to health care consumers in the form of higher drug prices, \nhigher device prices, and higher insurance premiums.\n  If the administration wants to get serious--and I wonder if this \nadministration wants to get serious--about reducing regulatory burdens \nand creating good jobs, then the President should start today by \nrepealing his onerous medical device tax. Not only will this device tax \nsuppress job creation and limit economic growth, it will also slow, and \nperhaps even stop, research and development into new lifesaving medical \ndevices.\n  We must take action to repeal this anticompetitive, job-destroying \ndevice tax before it begins to take effect in 2013. If the White House \nwants to work with Republicans on progrowth policies, policies that \nsupport innovation, policies that get the Nation's economy moving \nagain, then President Obama would support repealing this device tax.\n  Senator Orrin Hatch has introduced legislation, S. 17, that would do \njust that. I am proud to be a cosponsor of that bill, and I believe the \nSenate should take up the Hatch bill and pass it.\n  As we are now 2 years after the passing and signing into law of the \nPresident's health care law, I will continue to come to the Senate \nfloor because this is a health care law that is bad for patients, it is \nbad for providers, the nurses and the doctors who take care of those \npatients, and it is terrible for the American taxpayers. We need to \nrepeal and replace this broken health care law.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The minority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                              Time to Act\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday in the Senate we got a vivid \nlook at why the challenges we face in this country are so difficult to \naddress. With a looming fiscal crisis some have called the most \npredictable in history, with a national debt at a level none of us ever \neven imagined, with millions unemployed and millions more \nunderemployed, with the biggest tax hike in history looming at the end \nof the year, and with entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social \nSecurity drawing ever closer to insolvency, here is what Senate \nDemocrats did yesterday: They ducked. They were presented with five \ndifferent options for dealing with these problems and they voted \nagainst every single one of them.\n  No one was particularly surprised to see Democrats reject the \nRepublican proposals. We hoped some of them would support them, but we \nweren't altogether surprised they didn't. But every American should be \nsurprised that Democrats didn't offer a single plan of their own, and \nthey didn't even support the plan offered by the President of their own \nparty. But, sadly, that is what passes for leadership in the \nDemocratic-led Senate these days: Oppose everybody else--including a \nPresident of your own party--and hope nobody notices you are not doing \nanything yourself. Most people would say it is the responsibility of \nthe party in power to propose solutions, and they would be right.\n  The problems we face are simply too serious and too urgent to avoid \nany longer, and yet Democrats continue to duck any responsibility for \naddressing them. We certainly saw that yesterday. I would imagine there \nare some Democrats this morning who are having second thoughts about \ntheir party's performance yesterday. And if I am right about that, I \nwould invite them to stand and work with us. Put aside what is \npolitically safe and do what is right. The problems we face are too \ngreat to put off for another day. It is time for all of us to come \ntogether and to act.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S3247]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Federal Reserve Nominations\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor to debate and \noppose the two Federal Reserve nominees President Obama has sent to the \nSenate. First, let me say I think it is very important, very good, very \nhealthy that we are having this debate and we are having these votes. \nThat is how the Senate should operate, particularly on very important \nPresidential nominations, and these certainly fit into that category.\n  The Federal Reserve is an extremely important body for all sorts of \nreasons, but I will mention three in particular. First of all, it sets \nmonetary policy, and that is a very important economic tool and set of \neconomic policies. Right now this Federal Reserve, under Chairman \nBernanke, has an unprecedented policy of zero-interest rates--easy \nmoney for an extended period of time--which is historically \nunprecedented.\n  Secondly, the Federal Reserve is the primary regulator of our \nNation's biggest banks, including Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells \nFargo, and another that has been in the news quite a bit in the last \nfew weeks, JPMorgan Chase. Obviously, all of these entities were \ninvolved in the recent economic crisis, so, again, the Federal Reserve \nis extremely important as those megabanks' primary regulator. We should \nbe talking about that.\n  Finally, the Federal Reserve has other important authority and \nresponsibilities, including in situations where they have taken action \nto bail out these megabanks. They have that authority. They also have \nauthority to issue regulations under Dodd-Frank. All of these points \nare reasons why these two nominations are extremely important. That is \nwhy I demanded this debate and these votes.\n  Fundamentally, I demanded this debate and these votes for two \nreasons. First of all, I oppose these nominations. I am voting no. \nThere was a UC promulgated, and that UC, had it been accepted, would \nhave meant a ``yes'' vote for me. I couldn't vote that way for the \nreasons I will explain.\n  Secondly, more broadly, I think it is important we have this debate \nand we have these votes, and this used to be the norm in the Senate. \nBetween 1994 and 2000, all but two nominations to the Federal Reserve \nBoard were voted on by the Senate. Yet since 2001 that has flipped, for \nsome reason. Since 2001, only two nominees have received votes and 10 \nnominees were confirmed to the Board of Governors without a recorded \nvote. I think that is unfortunate. I think this is the proper way for \nthe Senate to do its business, particularly when such important issues \nare at stake.\n\n  Now let's talk about those issues.\n  First of all, monetary policy. The Federal Reserve's primary \nresponsibility--one of its two huge mandates--is to set healthy, proper \nmonetary policy for the United States. Personally, I think that should \nbe its only mandate--there are efforts here in the Congress to move the \nlaw to that position--but it certainly is a major role of the Federal \nReserve and is extremely important.\n  Once more, this Federal Reserve, under Chairman Bernanke, in this \neconomy has set monetary policy in an unprecedented way, and that is \nnot editorializing. That is a factual assessment, a factual \ndescription. Because this Federal Reserve has set essentially a zero-\ninterest rate policy, an extremely easy money policy for an extended \nperiod of time, a very long period of time, without any end in sight, \nand that has never before happened.\n  There are many experts, economists, and commentators who think this \nis very dangerous policy, and I share their concerns. I do not pretend \nto be an expert, as they are. I do not pretend, quite frankly, to have \nthe economic training and background of Chairman Bernanke and others. \nBut many of those who do have grave concerns with this unprecedented \neasy money policy. Let me mention a few.\n  Dr. Allan Meltzer, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University, sees \nsigns of this building up future inflation and a weakening dollar and \nbelieves the Fed did great harm in these categories with its \nQuantitative Easing 2, so-called QE2. Dr. Meltzer has read Fed minutes \nfor years and has written the definitive ``History of the Federal \nReserve'' and says the central problem is there is a lack of discussion \nof alternatives and consequences of their policies.\n  Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City President Thomas Hoenig said the \nFed's plan to push down long-term interest rates may produce very \nadverse accidental outcomes and policymakers risk creating real \n``imbalances'' in the economy. He said:\n\n       I have real concerns about trying to fine-tune and micro-\n     manage the economy when monetary policy is a blunt tool.\n\n  Richard Fisher of Dallas said he believes the Federal Reserve's \nmonetary policy has yet to show evidence of working. He is the Federal \nReserve Bank of Dallas president. He says in particular, the Fed's plan \nto buy $400 billion of long-term bonds while selling the same amount of \nshort-term debt is benefiting financiers and not aiding job creation.\n  Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser, in a speech on economic \noutlook to the Business Leaders Forum at the Villanova School of \nBusiness, expressed extreme skepticism with that so-called Operation \nTwist, trading long-term debt for short-term debt, and he did not think \nit would encourage business investment or consumer spending. He said:\n\n       I dissented from these decisions because I believe that \n     they will do little to improve the near-term prospects for \n     economic growth or employment and they do pose risks.\n\n  So there are very legitimate, strong concerns which I share on the \ncurrent monetary policy of this Federal Reserve, and it is very clear \nfrom the statements of these two nominees that these two nominees will \nsupport that policy, will support that direction for the foreseeable \nfuture, will not provide dissent, will not provide alternative \nviewpoints.\n  In addition, let me mention three other things about the Fed. As I \nmentioned, the Fed in general is the primary regulator of the \nmegabanks, and, still, I believe we do not have adequate focus and \nadequate regulation in that category. I would only point to the recent \ndisastrous announcement of JPMorgan Chase.\n  Also, the Fed, with five affirmative votes, passes regulations under \nDodd-Frank under its authority. That process is ongoing right now.\n  Why are these two nominations significant in impacting the \ndevelopment of those Dodd-Frank regulations one way or the other? Well, \nit is pretty simple. Those Dodd-Frank regulations coming out of the Fed \nneed five affirmative votes. Right now, there are five members of the \nBoard of Governors, so they need to reach complete unanimity with \nregard to those regulations. When the possible negative impact of those \nregulations is such a threat, I think that required unanimity is \nactually very healthy and a real protection.\n  These two new members of the Fed change the map, change the \nrequirement from needing five out of five to needing five out of seven. \nI think that will significantly push these regulations to the left, if \nyou will, and require and therefore produce less consensus, which those \nwith economic viewpoints such as mine wish to see continued.\n  In the same vein, the Fed is certainly significant in not only \nregulating the megabanks but, in instances like 2 years ago, bailing \nout the megabanks. They have that authority and they have that role. \nJust as with Dodd-Frank regulations, that requires five affirmative \nvotes of the Fed Board. Again, right now, before these two \nconfirmations, that would need five out of five. It would require \nunanimity. I think that is healthy, actually, with regard to such an \nextreme measure as huge taxpayer-funded bailouts, as we have seen in \nthe last 3 years.\n  If these two new nominees to the Board are confirmed, that math, \nagain, would change in exactly the same way: The requirement would move \nfrom five out of five to five out of seven. It would shift the outcome \nto the left, if you will. It would make it much more likely that the \nFed would act sooner to bail out megabanks with taxpayer funds.\n  I have all of these concerns about these nominations. These two \nnominees are fine, decent men. They are smart. They are qualified in \nthe professional sense. However, they clearly also support the current \ndirection of Chairman Bernanke and the Fed. For that reason, I cannot \nsupport the nominations, and I have real concerns.\n\n[[Page S3248]]\n\n  But, in closing, let me say that at least I think it is positive we \nare having this debate and we are voting. As I cited, that used to be \nthe norm in the Senate, including with regard to Federal Reserve Board \nof Governors nominations. These are very important nominations because \nof monetary policy, because of their regulatory authority, because of \nbailouts, and Dodd-Frank, and all the rest. It is more important--now \nmore than ever--because of the unprecedented nature of Chairman \nBernanke's and the Fed's monetary policy and because of the history of \nthe last 3 years.\n  We need this debate. We need these votes. I do not think spending \nabout 2 hours on it on the floor of the Senate is too much to ask, so I \nam glad I asked for that. I am glad I demanded that. With that \nopportunity, I will be voting no.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Will the Senator withhold his \nrequest?\n  Mr. VITTER. I will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/17/senate-section/article/S3248-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3248-S3252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF JEREMY C.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I wanted to speak for a moment today about \nthe vote we are going to have this afternoon on the Federal Reserve \nBoard members who have been nominated. I have met both of these \nindividuals, and I plan to vote for them today at noon. But I want tell \nyou why I am going to do that. I am very concerned about the overly \naccommodative efforts that are taking place right now at the Federal \nReserve. I think these low interest rates over long periods of time \nwill create inflation in our country. I believe the Fed has been \nproactive in recent times in ways that make me nervous. As soon as QE2 \nwas announced, I immediately called the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve, and we had a meeting in our office to talk about the concerns \nhe had and the concerns we in our office have.\n  I would love to see the Federal Reserve have a single mandate like \nthe European Central Bank has and the Bank of England has, where their \nsole purpose is really price stability. I would also love to see \nCongress act responsibly and deal with many fiscal and other kinds of \nissues that are holding down our economy. I think sometimes the Federal \nReserve feels as though it is the only entity that is actually acting \nto try to stimulate our economy. I understand the position they are in, \nhaving a dual mandate, which I think is inappropriate and hopefully \nover time will change.\n  These two nominees, candidly, do not represent the kind of a more \nhawkish position I would like to see the Federal Reserve take where \nthey are concerned about price stability over the long haul. At the \nsame time, both of these gentlemen are qualified. I don't think there \nis any question that someone would say that these two individuals are \nqualified. We do have Fed Presidents from around the country who \ntypically, as far as monetary policy on the Federal Reserve Board, do \nact in more hawkish ways and probably more represent the way that I \nwould view things as they ought to be in some of the accommodations the \nFederal Reserve has continued to make.\n  I hope we do not get into a situation where we end up having--you can \nactually call it QE4. Some people might call it QE3. I hope that does \nnot happen and that we will continue to press the Federal Reserve \ntowards that end in any way we can.\n  I also know that there is going to be an election in November and \nthat whoever the next President is--obviously, as you would expect, I \nhope there is a change in occupancy at the White House this November, \nsomeone who will actually try to solve the problems our Nation has. But \nwhoever the next President is, they will have the opportunity to \nappoint the next Chairman of the Federal Reserve very soon and also the \nnext Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve.\n  So I guess what I would say in closing is that I am going to support \nthese nominees because they are qualified. I do hope they will press \nthe Chairman of the Federal Reserve to be more concerned about price \nstability, especially into the future. But I do not want to vote no \ntoday because I think it sets a precedent of saying that, look, these \nguys are qualified--I do not think there is any question about that. \nAnd I want the next President--who I hope, again, is someone different \nthan we have today--to have the opportunity with my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle--if a change is to occur and if the President \nhas the opportunity to appoint a new Federal Reserve Chairman and a new \nVice Chairman and he deems them qualified and this body deems them \nqualified, I hope we are going to have the opportunity to fill those \npositions.\n  So, again, I plan to vote for these nominees in an effort to continue \nto cause this place to focus in the way I think it should. They are not \nideal, from my perspective, but they are qualified.\n  I might remind friends on my side of the aisle that we did have \nsomeone who was nominated several months ago who was not in the \nmainstream. This person was not in the mainstream of thinking, and this \nperson did not become a member of the Federal Reserve Board. So we have \nended up having two nominees who are more middle of the road. They are \nnot as hawkish as I would like to see them be. They are not as \nfocused--they possibly will not be as focused on price stability as I \nwould like to see them be. But they are qualified. They are not out of \nthe mainstream. And I do plan to support them.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, at noon the Senate will be voting on \ntwo of President Obama's nominees to the Federal Reserve Board. These \nare important positions. They have long terms. They come at a time when \nour economy is in trouble and doing its best to recover. In these \nvotes, the Senate will be acting in the way it should, and let me say \nwhy I am saying that.\n  On Tuesday of this week, someone most of us know--Marty Paone, who \nwas the Democratic secretary in the Senate for 13 years, until 2008--\nwrote an article in the Hill, a Capitol Hill newspaper. The headline is \n``Senate rule changes come with risk,'' but all I want to refer to \ntoday is a description of the Senate that is on our Senate Web site. \nMarty describes our own Web site in the article and says:\n\n       . . . [t]he legislative process on the Senate Floor [as] a \n     balance between the rights guaranteed to Senators under the \n     standing rules and the need for Senators to forgo some of \n     these rights in order to expedite business.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe article I just referred to following my remarks.\n\n[[Page S3249]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, what is reflected on the Senate Web \nsite is the action the Senate is about to take at noon today.\n  There has been at least one vacancy--and sometimes two--on the \nFederal Reserve Board since 2006. That is 6 years ago. That is one \nwhole Senate term. The Federal Reserve Board has seven Governors \nnominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. So during that \nwhole 6 year-period, it has had one or two of those seven positions \nvacant. And this has been during a time--since 2008--of the greatest \neconomic crisis we have had since the Great Depression.\n  The President tried once to nominate someone to that position who \nwasn't accepted by the Senate. So in January the President took the \nunusual step of nominating a well-qualified Republican, Jay Powell, as \nwell as a well-qualified Democrat.\n  There is a good deal of unease in the Republican caucus--as I am sure \nwas reflected in some of the comments on the floor--about the response \nthe Federal Reserve Board has taken to the economic crisis since 2008. \nSenators on this side of the aisle who have those concerns have a \nperfect right to filibuster, to object, and perhaps to kill these two \nnominations. But the Republican Senators have realized that if we were \nto do that to President Obama's nominees today, then if there were a \nPresident Romney after the first of the year, the Democrats very likely \nwould say: We will object to President Romney's nominees, and there \nwould still be vacancies on the Federal Reserve Board at a time of \neconomic crisis.\n  Just as the President took a step toward making government work by \nnominating a well-qualified Republican to one of these two Federal \nReserve Governor positions, I want to acknowledge the fact that \nRepublican Senators who feel strongly about this issue have taken a \nstep forward and forgone--in the words of our Senate Web site--some of \ntheir rights so that we can move straight to a vote today, up or down, \nat 60-votes, on each of the two nominees.\n  The article to which I referred said that sometimes in the Senate, \neven though we all have many rights, we have to forgo some of those \nrights in order to make the place work. That has been happening more \nlately. Republican Senators in the minority have been occasionally \nforgoing some of our rights to slow down a bill coming to the floor or \nto insist on an amendment that is not relevant. The majority leader has \non some occasions forgone his right to block our amendments. We would \nlike for him to do that more often, but it has been happening more \nlately.\n  I think of the scheduling difficulty Senator Reid and Senator \nMcConnell had on district judges a few weeks ago. Instead of letting \nthat issue blow up the Senate, they met privately and agreed they would \nproceed at a schedule the two of them determined. As a result, we have \nbeen considering and confirming district judges at a regular rate.\n  Their agreement permitted us to move to a jobs bill, which benefitted \nstartup companies, to move ahead. The House Republicans had already \npassed the bill, then we passed it, and the President of the United \nStates then signed it into law.\n  The Senate moved forward on the FAA authorization bill after many \nefforts and failed attempts to do so.\n  We have a 2-year highway bill which the Senate has passed and which \nis now in conference. I would like for it to be a 7-year bill, but we \nhave made progress and passed a 2-year bill.\n  The Senate had a big debate on the Postal Service. I would have liked \nto have seen a stronger bill come out of the Senate, and I hope the \nHouse will send us back a stronger bill. But we had 39 relevant \namendments to that bill considered, we worked on it, and we are moving \ntoward dealing with the big debt the Postal Service has.\n  This week we considered an extension of the Ex-Im Bank and took up a \nbill passed by the Republican House. We offered and voted on five \nrelevant amendments to the Ex-Im Bank bill and disposed of the bill \nthat same day.\n  The majority leader says we have the FDA bill coming up--very \nimportant because it affects medicines that Americans everywhere depend \non. Senator Enzi and Senator Harkin have worked that bill through the \nHELP Committee. It has broad support on both sides of the aisle. The \nmajority leader may allow it to come up only with relevant amendments, \nand we may be able to consider it and pass it.\n  Earlier this year several of us came to the floor and complimented \nSenator Reid, the majority leader, and Senator McConnell, the \nRepublican leader, for saying that they want to do their best to pass \nall the appropriations bills this year. That is the basic work of the \nSenate--paying our bills and doing our oversight. Only twice since the \nyear 2000 has the Senate passed every single appropriations bill.\n  I don't want to make too much of this progress, but it is a little \nprogress, and it is an example of the Senate working the way the Senate \nis supposed to work.\n  Now, let's be honest about the fact that this is a more partisan \ncountry than it was even 10 years ago, and that partisanship is \nreflected in the Senate. By any definition there is a narrower range of \nviews on the Republican side of the aisle and a narrower range of views \non the Democratic side of the aisle. But we still have our job to do. \nOur job is not just to stand and express our views. If our job was to \nonly stand and express our views, each one of us would always be right \nand we wouldn't get anything done. The second part of the job is to \ntake our views, put them together, and see if we can get a result.\n  Some people say: Well, you are interested in bipartisanship.\n  I am not so interested in bipartisanship. That interests me very \nlittle, to tell you the truth. I am interested in results. I learned in \nthe Maryville city schools how to count, and I can count to 60. I know \nthat if it takes 60 votes to get anything done in this Senate, it is \ngoing to have to take some on that side and some on this side to get to \n60. And I know the American people are expecting results--results on \nthe debt, results on tax reform, results on fixing No Child Left \nBehind, results on finding a place to put used nuclear fuel. I want to \nbe a part of getting those results. We have too many problems to solve \nfor us to think we have finished our job simply by announcing our \npositions, stating our principles, and sitting down. We need to take \nthose principles and put them together and see whether they can mesh \nand get a result.\n  It is not easy to get elected to the Senate. It is very hard to get \nhere. Most candidates campaign for a long time, and their campaigns are \nintense for 2 years. They usually have terrific opposition, and people \nsay things about them that they don't like. We end up with some very \ntalented men and women among the hundred in the Senate.\n  It kind of reminds me of country music. A lot of the artists in \nNashville I know play in every bar they can find and every State fair \nthey can find for 20 years, and finally they might get invited to join \nthe Grand Ole Opry. Well, being in the Senate for a lot of the last \nyear was like being invited to join the Grand Ole Opry and not being \nallowed to sing. The majority leader would bring up a bill and block \nthe amendments because he would say the Republicans were keeping him \nfrom bringing up bills. Our side would say: Well, we are not going to \nlet you bring it up unless you let us have amendments. So we would be \nsitting around, twiddling our thumbs, and wasting time when there was a \nlot to do. That is why I am so glad to see some things changing here in \nthe Senate over the last few weeks.\n  We all have our wishes about what will happen in the November \nelection. I hope that after November we will see President Romney and \nthat we will see more desks on this side of the aisle, a Republican \nmajority. My friends on the other side expect and hope the President \nwill be reelected, and they would like to enlarge their majority on the \nother side of the aisle. We don't know whether there will be a \nRepublican or a Democratic President. We don't know whether there will \nbe 51 or 52 Republican Senators or 51 or 52 Democratic Senators. We do \nknow pretty well that there probably won't be many more than 51 or 52 \nor 53 Democratic Senators or 51 or 52 or 53 Republican Senators, and we \nall can count, and we all know that is not 60.\n\n[[Page S3250]]\n\n  We also know we are going to get to the end of the year and we are \ngoing to have taxes to reform, debt to reduce, highways to deal with, \nnuclear waste to do something about, the payroll tax credit expiration, \nand the biggest tax increase in history facing us. We know the \ncountry's lack of confidence in the future will be greatly relieved if \nit has more confidence in the ability of Washington, DC, to govern this \ncountry.\n  We see what is happening in Europe. We can look at ourselves, and we \nknow we have trillions of dollars sitting on the side lines of the \nUnited States. Part of the reason that money is sitting there is to \nwait to see whether the Senators can do our jobs. Well, doing our jobs \nmay require forgoing some of our rights. That is what it says on our \nWeb site--that we have the rights, that we can insist on them. And \nsometimes we will. But to get things done in the Senate, sometimes we \nwill forgo some of our minority rights and the majority leader, we \nhope, will forgo some of his rights. Then we will be able to move to a \nbill, amend it, vote on it, and get some results. That is what the \nAmerican people would like for us to do.\n  We are moving today to vote on a Democratic and a Republican \nnomination by the President. We are doing it without any obstruction by \nRepublicans in the minority, who are very well aware and hope there \nwill be a President Romney after January who will have a number of \nFederal Reserve appointments to make. And President Romney will hope \nhis nominees are entitled to the same respect President Obama's \nnominees are.\n  If these two nominees are confirmed today, the Federal Reserve Board \nwill have a full complement of seven for the first time since 2006. The \nFederal Reserve will have a full Board at a time of great economic \ncrisis for our country and as we come up on the end of the year when we \nwill have a fiscal cliff--according to the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve Board--that will cause Congressional action to take care of.\n  So I am here today only to say that I admire the nominees. I know one \nof them well, Jay Powell, who was Under Secretary of the Treasury for \nthe first President Bush, an administration in which I served. He has a \nfine reputation. He should be a fine member. I want to acknowledge the \nfact that the President chose to break the stalemate by nominating Mr. \nPowell, a Republican, as well as a Democrat. I want to acknowledge the \nfact that several of my Republican colleagues, who have deep concerns \nabout the actions of the Federal Reserve Board during this economic \ncrisis over the last few years, have forgone some of their rights and \nallowed us to have an up-or-down vote at noon.\n  That, taken with the other actions of the last few months, should \ngive a little bit of confidence to the American people that we in the \nSenate are perfectly able to assert our principles, to stand on our \nprinciples, not to give up on our principles. But then, after we have \nmade our speeches, to sit down and come to a result that may not be \nperfect, it may not be ideal to each of our principles, but will be \ngood for our country.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                     [From the Hill, May 15, 2012]\n\n                   Senate Rule Changes Come With Risk\n\n                          (By Martin P. Paone)\n\n       It's an election year, and the Senate can't agree on how to \n     keep the student loan interest rate from doubling on July 1 \n     from 3.4 percent to 6.8. While both sides agree that it \n     should be done, how to pay for it is the stumbling block. A \n     party-line cloture vote failure has once again brought calls \n     for changing the Senate's rules by majority vote at the \n     beginning of the next Congress, bypassing the two-thirds \n     cloture requirement if there's opposition.\n       The Senate's membership has changed considerably in the \n     last decade, but the Senate rules, with the exception of some \n     changes that were enacted in the Ethics in Government Act, \n     have not undergone any major changes since the Senate went on \n     TV in 1986. While the House has its Rules Committee, which \n     allows the majority to exert its will and control the flow of \n     legislation, the Senate has a tradition of protecting the \n     rights of the minority and of unfettered debate. Its own \n     website describes ``[t]he legislative process on the Senate \n     floor [as] a balance between the rights guaranteed to \n     Senators under the standing rules and the need for senators \n     to forgo some of these rights in order to expedite \n     business.''\n       The Senate has for centuries functioned by this compact of \n     selectively forgoing one's rights, but now that compact, to \n     some, seems to have broken down--hence the call to enact \n     rules changes at the beginning of the next Congress by \n     majority vote. These calls have come from Democrats, but they \n     are quick to admit that it should apply regardless of who is \n     in the majority at the time.\n       Such changes can certainly quicken the process and allow \n     for the majority to pass legislation and confirm presidential \n     nominees with little hindrance. While the initial rules \n     reforms will probably be limited to restricting debate on a \n     motion to proceed and other less dramatic changes, eventually \n     such majority rules changes at the beginning of a Congress \n     will result in a majority-controlled body similar to the \n     House. Once the Pandora's Box of granting the majority the \n     unfettered ability to change the rules every two years has \n     been opened, having seen how the current situation has \n     escalated, tit for tat over the last 30 years, it is \n     difficult to believe that strict majority rule would not be \n     the ultimate result. Thereafter, a member of the minority in \n     the Senate will be just as impotent as his or her House \n     counterparts.\n       Filibusters and the forcing of a cloture vote have been \n     repeatedly used to stop legislation and nominations and to \n     waste time. This is why the number of successful cloture \n     votes, many on noncontroversial nominations and on motions to \n     proceed to bills, has gone up dramatically in recent years. \n     By requiring the cloture vote and then voting for it, the \n     minority has been able to waste considerable time and thus \n     reduce the amount of time available to act on other items of \n     the president's agenda.\n       The call for changing the Senate's rules by majority vote \n     at the beginning of a Congress is not new; it was attempted \n     without success in 1953 and 1957 and in 1959. When faced with \n     such an effort, then-Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson \n     negotiated a cloture change back down to two-thirds of those \n     present and voting, but as part of the compromise he had to \n     add Paragraph 2 to Senate Rule V, which states ``The rules of \n     the Senate shall continue from one Congress to the next \n     Congress unless they are changed as provided in these \n     rules.''\n       So is it time to ignore the existing rules and change them \n     at the beginning of the next Congress by a majority vote? \n     Perhaps it is time--so many other changes have occurred in \n     our lives in the recent past, why shouldn't the Senate change \n     the way it does business? However, should that occur, one \n     must be prepared to live with the eventual outcome of a \n     Senate where the majority rules and the rights of the \n     minority have been severely curtailed.\n       While I can sympathize with those demanding such changes, \n     it's the manner of their implementation that keeps reminding \n     me of the exchange between Sir Thomas Moore and his son-in-\n     law, William Roper, in the movie ``A Man For All Seasons'':\n       Roper: ``So, now you give the devil the benefit of law!''\n       Moore: ``Yes! What would you do? Cut a great road through \n     the law to get after the devil?''\n       Roper: ``Yes, I'd cut down every law in England to do \n     that!''\n       Moore: ``Oh? And when the last law was down, and the devil \n     turned 'round on you, where would you hide, Roper, the laws \n     all being flat? . . . Yes, I'd give the devil benefit of law, \n     for my own safety's sake!''\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today with gratitude to thank and \nhonor my good friends and esteemed colleagues Senator Alexander and \nSenator Johanns. The willingness to vote on two of the President's \nnominees to serve as members of the Board of Governors of the Federal \nReserve that they have expressed today is exactly the sort of \nbipartisan approach that has historically made the Senate work. I would \nlike to honor their efforts to get us back to that proud tradition and \nthank them for their efforts to bring these two distinguished men to a \nvote.\n  Serving on the Banking Committee together, I know Senator Johanns to \nalways do his due diligence when reviewing any proposed legislation or \nin this case nominees. I am grateful for it. I am also grateful my good \nfriend Senator Alexander is the ranking member of the Rules Committee. \nHis hard work and insight were invaluable as we worked together to \nstreamline presidential appointments and to pass a bill in the Senate \nto reduce the number of positions requiring Senate confirmation last \nyear. He has always worked for the betterment of this body. Today is \nanother example.\n  Yet despite our work last year, we face a backlog of nominations \nwhich\n\n[[Page S3251]]\n\ngridlocks other important legislative business. That is not how the \nprocess should work.\n  The Senate was designed to be a thoughtful and deliberative body. But \nthe American public is harmed when we are not able to get qualified \npeople confirmed to positions in a timely manner. Nominees of \nimpeccable qualifications and indisputable support have been frozen out \nof the confirmation process. Thankfully that will not be the case \ntoday.\n  At a time when our economy is struggling to maintain forward \nmomentum, and the Federal Reserve is faced with difficult decisions \nabout how to help the recovery now without creating problems in the \nfuture, it is absolutely critical that we not leave the Fed \nundermanned. For months now, the Fed has been operating with only 5 of \nits 7 board members, while nominees languish in the Senate confirmation \nprocess. There is no real question that both of our nominees are \nqualified and bipartisan.\n  Jeremy Stein is a well-known Harvard economist, with strong expertise \nin monetary policy and financial regulation. In between two stints at \nHarvard, Stein was on the finance faculty at M.I.T.'s Sloan School of \nManagement for 10 years. Stein's research has covered such topics as: \nthe behavior of stock prices; corporate investment and financing \ndecisions; risk management; capital allocation inside firms; banking; \nfinancial regulation; and monetary policy.\n  He is currently a coeditor of the Quarterly Journal of Economics, and \nwas previously a coeditor of the Journal of Economic Perspectives. He \nis a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a research \nassociate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, and a member of \nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Financial Advisory Roundtable. \nFrom February to July of 2009, he served in the Obama administration, \nas a senior advisor to the Treasury Secretary and on the staff of the \nNational Economic Council.\n  Jerome Powell is a visiting scholar at the Bipartisan Policy Center \nhere in Washington, where he focuses on Federal and State fiscal \nissues. He is also a former lawyer, with experience in investment \nbanking and private equity who will bring valuable and broad private \nsector expertise to the Board. From 1997 through 2005, Powell was a \npartner at The Carlyle Group, where he founded and led the Industrial \nGroup within the U.S. Buyout Fund. So he has broad experience working \nwith manufacturing companies and other industries at the heart of the \nU.S. economy.\n  Powell has served on the boards of several charitable and educational \ninstitutions. He is currently a member of the board of directors of \nD.C. Prep, a charter school operator in Washington, DC; the Bendheim \nCenter for Finance at Princeton University; and The Nature Conservancy \nof Washington, DC and Maryland.\n  There is no requirement that the President nominate governors from \nthe other party, but Mr. Powell is also a Republican who served as \nUndersecretary of the Treasury for Finance under President George H.W. \nBush, with responsibility for policy on financial institutions, the \ntreasury debt market, and related areas. So this is not a partisan \nissue or ideological battle. We have one nominee who served in the \nObama administration, one nominee who served in the Bush \nadministration.\n\n  It is very good that we have come to an agreement. We hope it can set \nthe tone for agreements well into the future, this year and in 2013 as \nwell.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Jeremy C. Stein, of Massachusetts, to be a member of the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have spoken before about the importance \nof the FDA bill. It is something we have to get done. Literally, \npeople's lives depend upon it. It addresses so many things with the FDA \nto make it a better organization. We have to get this done. As I said \nbefore, if my Republican colleagues don't like the bill, offer an \namendment--offer an amendment. Take that out. Put something in if you \ndon't like it. But I hope we don't have to go through voting on cloture \non this Monday night. We should be legislating on this on Monday. So I \nam stunned that once again, on a motion to proceed, when there has been \nan agreement that we would proceed to this with relevant amendments--\neverybody says that is what they want to do. It is not germane \namendments, which is very narrow, it is relevant amendments. It gives \npeople a lot of opportunity to change this legislation in many \ndifferent ways. So I hope we do not have to have that cloture vote \nMonday night.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 1905\n\n  Mr. REID.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I would just \nnote that this is a matter--and I appreciate the majority leader's \ndesire to bring this to conclusion. It has been worked on now for quite \nsome time. Unfortunately, the language that has just been presented to \nour side has not been widely shared. I have not actually read it yet. \nIt was apparently brought over at 10:38 this morning. When I came to \nthe floor, it was described to me. As described, it would be weaker \nthan President Obama's policy.\n  Given the fact that this is a matter on which Democrats and \nRepublicans and the administration and the Senate have been in pretty \nclose accord in dealing with the country of Iran and its nuclear \nambitions, I would hope we could ensure that the language is agreed to \nby all. There seems to be an important piece missing, and we certainly \nneed the time to talk to folks to see why that is so, whether it can be \nput back in or, if it cannot, then to be able to discuss it because we \ncertainly do not want something that is weaker than the \nadministration's current policy.\n  So I would hope we could have some time over the weekend and perhaps \non Monday, when enough of the Members can be apprised of what has \nactually been proposed here, and see if our colleagues on the other \nside would be willing to make the accommodation that we may need to \nhave made here.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I \nappreciate the leader's desire to get this done. I would like to get it \ndone too. In fact, the original Iran sanctions language was drafted in \nmy office when I was in the other body.\n  This is an issue I have been involved in for a long time. This \nmorning I have had a chance to look at it only within the last half \nhour. I suppose I could have been here at 10:38, but even 10:38, for an \nissue such as this--and my view also is that it is not as strong as the \nPresidents's policy. It is not as strong as any other resolution on \nthis topic we have ever passed. And the question that would logically \nbe asked is, Why not? I would like to think that is an oversight in \ndrafting, that we can work this out over the weekend and make this \nreflective of our national policy and the President's policy. But I \nwould be very concerned about moving to this language today and would \nhope that we could work with the leader to have language that we could \nbring up as early as Monday and pass and send the message to the world \nthat the Senate supports the stated policy of our government on this \ncritical issue. Nobody wants Iran to be able to move forward and attain \nnuclear capacity, and I would be very concerned about moving forward on \nthis language as it currently appears to me to be stated.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, is there an objection by either Senator Kyl \nor Senator Blunt?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, for the reasons noted, I would hope we could \nwork with our colleagues to fix the problem. Until we do, I would have \nto object.\n\n[[Page S3253]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin.) Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. This is such an interesting conversation here on the floor \nthis afternoon. I did not have the papers. Now, I do not blame my \nfriend from Arizona for not having the documents. I do not blame my \nfriend from Missouri for only having a half hour to look at this. This \nwas given to the Republican leader yesterday, midday. The language they \nare objecting to was in the base bill, so unless they did not read the \nbase bill, they have a problem here. Now, they said they want to get it \ndone--strange way of showing they want to get it done.\n  This has been a classic example of rope-a-dope. I try to be a patient \nman. I have been very patient with my staff working with Senator Kirk's \nstaff, the minority leader's staff. I have tried to be as patient as I \ncan be.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would my friend yield?\n  Mr. REID. No, not right now. This is absolutely untoward, what is \nhappening here. We have tried to get this done every day. Oh, it is \njust we have to do a little bit more. We have this agreement that was \nagreed to by all of the parties, but, of course, now there is no \nagreement.\n  I am deeply disappointed that my Republican colleagues are preventing \nthe Senate from passing additional critical sanctions against Iran. If \nthey want to embarrass the President, this is a strange way to do it. \nTwo months ago I came to the Senate floor and said we needed to pass \nthese sanctions immediately. The fastest way forward was to pass the \nbipartisan bill sponsored by Senators Johnson and Shelby, which passed \nout of the Banking Committee unanimously. But Republicans then said no, \nas they are saying today. Republicans said they wanted to include ideas \nfrom Senator Kirk, Senator Paul, and wished to move forward with S. \nRes. 380 on containment.\n  We heard their objections. We have tried mightily to address them, \nwith the goal of getting this bill passed and protecting our own \nnational security and that of our ally Israel. This deal includes a \nbipartisan managers' package sponsored by Senators Shelby and Johnson, \nwith items of importance to Senators Menendez, Kirk, Paul, and Johnson.\n  The American Israel Public Affairs Committee has expressed strong \nsupport for this package to Senator McConnell and to me. In a letter \ntoday, AIPAC urged us to move forward with this package as quickly as \npossible. I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                               The American Israel\n\n\n                                     Public Affairs Committee,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 17, 2012.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Reid and McConnell: We understand that you \n     are bringing the Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Human \n     Rights Act of 2012 (S. 2101) to the floor for consideration. \n     On behalf of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, we \n     would like to express our support for this critically \n     important bipartisan legislation. We also want to take this \n     opportunity to thank you for your ongoing strong efforts to \n     thwart Iran's nuclear program, and for your overall \n     leadership on behalf of a vibrant U.S.-Israel relationship.\n       In our view, this legislation has been further strengthened \n     in important ways by a managers' amendment that reflects the \n     views of a number of senators. We appreciate your leadership, \n     together with that of Senators Johnson, Shelby, Menendez and \n     Kirk in enabling this legislation to move forward to the \n     floor and ultimately to conference with the House.\n       We understand that Senators Menendez and Kirk have \n     additional valuable ideas to improve the bill being \n     considered by the Senate but have graciously agreed to defer \n     their amendments at this time to enable the bill to move \n     forward as rapidly as possible. We applaud their efforts and, \n     like them, want to see the strongest possible legislation \n     enacted. We believe that their amendments fall within the \n     scope of the conference committee, and urge you to ensure \n     that they will be given appropriate consideration during the \n     course of the conference deliberations.\n       We are deeply appreciative of the role played by the Senate \n     under your leadership to do everything possible to stop Iran \n     from using its nuclear program to further destabilize the \n     Middle East. By its legislation and oversight, Congress has \n     kept this issue in the forefront and forced Iran's leaders to \n     face the choice between compliance with its international \n     obligations and international opprobrium.\n       We look forward to working in support of your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n     Howard Kohr,\n       Executive Director.\n     Marvin Feuer,\n       Director, Policy & Government Affairs.\n     Brad Gordon,\n       Director, Policy & Government Affairs.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Democrats are ready to move forward and vote \non an amended S. Res. 380, the bipartisan Graham-Casey-Lieberman \nlegislation. This amendment would put the Senate on record, along with \nPresident Obama, ruling out a policy of containment on Iran. Yet \nRepublicans have objected again. We cannot afford to delay these \nsanctions and slow them down any longer. On May 23 there is a round of \ninternational negotiations taking place with the Iranians on subjects \nrelated to this resolution we have.\n  Democrats are ready to move forward. We are ready to pass both the \nIran sanctions bill and the containment resolution now--not later, now. \nWe cannot afford any more delays. Sanctions are a key tool in our work \nto stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, threatening Israel, and \njeopardizing the national security of the United States.\n  I am to the end of my patience. I usually never raise my voice with a \nSenator. I apologize to my friend from Arizona. I did a few minutes \nago. The conversation was between him and me. But I am really upset \nabout this. I feel that I have been jerked around--that is a pretty \ngood understanding of the language people have--because we can never \nquite get there. The Republicans have kept us from moving forward on \nthis for 2 months. We should have done what Shelby and Johnson told us \nto do. So I hope something will happen on this in the near future, but \nI have to be honest with you, I do not have much faith that it will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Do I have the floor now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You do.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my good friend the majority leader, \nthis is an outrage I do not understand. My staff tells me we did not \nreceive the draft amendment until late last night, and this morning we \nwere told it was final. We got the draft late last night, and this \nmorning we were told it was final.\n  Now, look, we have debates around here about a lot of things, but one \nof the things we have typically not been unable to reach an agreement \non is the Iran issue. I do not know what the problem is here. A little \ncommunication ought to be able to bring us together behind something we \ncan speak to unanimously, with a goal that I think we all have in this \nbody--virtually everyone--which is to do everything we can to prevent \nIran from becoming a nuclear-armed country.\n  So there is no reason in the world why we cannot resolve whatever \nminor differences we have and move forward. We certainly do not want to \ntake a step backward. And there are Members on my side of the aisle who \nare concerned that the way the measure is currently crafted could \nactually be a step in the wrong direction. It could have been a \ndrafting error. But what is wrong with sitting down on a bipartisan \nbasis, looking at the language, and making sure we get it right and \nachieve the goals that I think virtually everybody in the room would \nlike to achieve? There is nothing to get angry about. A proper response \nwould be to work out our differences and to go forward.\n\n  Timeliness is an issue. We need to do this quickly. We can all agree \nto that on both sides of the aisle. I say to my friend, I don't think \nthere is anything to be outraged about. Why don't we work out the \ndifferences and pass the resolution?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when my friend indicates, why is there any \nproblem, and that they agree--it is just like the issue of student \nloans when they\n\n[[Page S3254]]\n\nsay they agree, except they will not let us legislate on that bill. \nThey think this is a great thing to do, but we cannot do it. They say \nthey need more communication. How about 2 months? How much more do they \nneed?\n  I will not get into getting anyone in trouble, but the Republicans \nwere given this in mid-afternoon. Maybe they were busy, but that \ndoesn't matter. The point is we have tried to get something done, and \nwe cannot get it done.\n  I think it is too bad for this institution. I am not outraged; I am \nupset because I feel I have been used as a tool to try to adversely \naffect the President in some way. I will continue to keep an open mind, \nbut I have to say that I am terribly disappointed. It looks as though \nwe are going to arrive at May 23--and the Iranians have people around \nwho are watching this. They are laughing at us. We cannot even come up \nwith a simple resolution. It has no force of law--I should not say \nthat; it does have some. But they are laughing at us.\n  Here is the U.S. Senate quibbling over a sentence that has been in \nthis resolution since it was drafted.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, most people in America work 5 days a \nweek. It is 1 o'clock on a Thursday. What is the problem? We have broad \nbipartisan agreement about the approach we ought to take with regard to \nthe Iran sanctions issue. The leaders on my side are all standing on \nthe floor of the Senate and are anxious to be involved in working out \nthe language.\n  I say to my friend, he said it is a sentence in the resolution. A \nsentence can sometimes change the entire meaning. How this is crafted \nis not irrelevant. Rather than us standing out here on the Senate floor \npointing fingers, it is only 1 p.m. on a Thursday afternoon; let's sit \ndown and work out the differences and pass something we can agree on \nand try to make a difference.\n  Mr. REID. No matter how many times you say it, the language we are \ntold they are complaining about was in the initial bill.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate my friend saying most people work 5 days \na week. I work more than 5 days a week, and I have been working the \nlast 2 months trying to get this done. Every time we tried to do it in \nthe last few weeks--and Senator Kirk is ill, and I gave him every \nbenefit of the doubt. Let's try to do what Senator Kirk thinks is a \ngood idea. If we can agree, we will do it.\n  Mr. President, we have been trying to get this done for a long time. \nIt is not just today at 1 o'clock; I wanted to move forward on this a \nlong time ago. They say: Let's just give it another day or so and we \nwill take care of this. But that is not how it has worked.\n  I yield to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I thank the leader for yielding. I want \nto applaud him for asking to bring the legislation that passed \nunanimously out of the Banking Committee to the floor because there is \nno one in this Chamber who has been stronger on pursuing sanctions on \nIran and trying to defer Iran from achieving nuclear weapons. I support \nand am on Senator Lieberman's resolution.\n  But time is of the essence. We must send to the Iranians a clear \nmessage that they cannot just forestall negotiations and have \nnegotiations thinking that they are buying time. We must show them that \nnotwithstanding their intentions to buy time, there are consequences.\n  The consequences of those sanctions on the Central Bank of Iran that \nare already moving forward and that the administration is fully seeking \nto enforce, and the continued perfecting sanctions that the Banking \nCommittee sent out unanimously is incredibly important to send the \nIranians a message.\n  I look at what the legislation will do in part. It, in essence, \ncloses loopholes that the Iranians have figured out. It creates \nsanctions on the national Iranian oil company and the national Iranian \ntanker company, making them agents of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard \nand imposes sanctions on financial institutions that would facilitate \ntransactions.\n  This is important. The Iranians are using this as a way to get around \nit. It has sanctions on satellite companies that impose human rights \nsanctions on those companies that provide satellite services to the \nIranian regime but fail to prevent jamming by Iran of transmissions by \nothers of the same satellite service company. It has sanctions on \nfinancial messaging services, and even though Swift, the largest of \nthem, already pulled the plug on the Iranians, we don't want any other \nmessaging service to fill that void. We want to make sure that noose is \nas tight as possible.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if my friend will yield, I want to make sure \nthe record is clear. When I talked about it having no force of law, we \nwere talking about the containment resolution.\n  I ask this question to my friend from New Jersey: What does he think \nthe Iranians are doing watching this performance today? How does he \nthink they are feeling about what we are doing today--that we cannot \npass this resolution?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Originally, when we sent a 100-to-0 vote out of here, \nthey said: We are in trouble. But now they are saying to themselves: \nWell, buying time seems to succeed.\n  We cannot allow the Iranians to believe, as they head into these \nnegotiations next week, that there is anything but a foot on the head \nof the snake and that we will continue to do that and drive every \npossible sanction and close every possible loophole, which is largely \nwhat the legislation the leader was seeking to pass accomplishes. That \nis why it passed unanimously out of the Banking Committee.\n  Even as we talk about the resolution, there is no reason to stop the \nvery essence of what would send a message to the Iranians--that it will \nhurt them in their economy and undermine their ability to continue in \nIran as a government, and that it is going to be the very strongest set \nof sanctions we can levy from one government to another. It will have a \nmultilateral effect, which is when sanctions take place the best.\n\n  I am beside myself. Are there amendments that I might want to offer? \nOf course. But I find it far more important to move now and get passage \nand send this strong set of sanctions so that the Iranians will get the \nmessage rather than to linger and ultimately have those negotiations \ntake place and not send a message.\n  I appreciate the majority leader's efforts. I applaud them. I am \ncertainly for Senator Lieberman's resolution. I don't believe in \ncontainment as a policy, but moving the set of sanctions to ensure that \nthe Iranians don't do anything but come to the table and say they are \nready to follow a course of disarmament in terms of their nuclear \nproduction is incredibly important.\n  Sometimes things can wait. This is not one of those times in which \nwaiting produces the desired result. On the contrary, it produces a \nnegative result because they believe we will not continue to pursue \ntightening the noose and closing every loophole and being of one mind. \nI hope we can achieve that before we leave.\n  Mr. REID. Before my friend leaves, I direct a question to him. Is it \ntrue that he is a member of the Banking Committee?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. It is true that this resolution came from the Banking \nCommittee?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Yes, the legislation came from the Banking Committee.\n  Mr. REID. The matter about which we talk, the Iranian sanctions \nlegislation, came from the Banking Committee. It was reported \nunanimously from the committee, right?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. During the last 2 months, the Senator from New Jersey and \nhis staff have been heavily involved in what is going on during the \nnegotiations that have taken place; is that fair?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. It is.\n  Mr. REID. Jessica Lewis, who is seated by me, my foreign policy \nadviser--is it true that she worked for the Senator from New Jersey?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. She did until the majority leader took her from me.\n  Mr. REID. And it is true that we have worked over this period of \ntime--our staffs, working with Republicans--very hard to try to get \nsomething done. I say to my friend, is it true that each time we were \nthere, were not there the next few minutes, the next day--it has taken \nforever, 2 months, right?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. We have thought at various times that we would be on \nthe Senate floor and have it passed, and\n\n[[Page S3255]]\n\nthere has always been an additional desire or objection. I just think \nwhat we have before us, especially in timing, doesn't mean we cannot \ncontinue to perfect it as we move to the future, as we are doing in \nthis legislation.\n  But this legislation, now passed unanimously out of committee, is \nsupported by the major advocates of those who share our vision that we \ncannot have a nuclear-powered Iran and an Iran with nuclear weapons, \nand believe that it is important to move now so we can achieve that \ngoal and send a message to the Iranians.\n  So I think time, in this case, is of the essence. That is why I came \nto the floor to support the leader's efforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this is a classic moment--\nunfortunately, too typical--where we all agree on the goal, but we want \nto pass another tier of sanctions against the Iranians to deter them \nfrom developing nuclear weapons. Our goal has been to get this done \nbefore the P5+1--five permanent members of the Security Council of the \nU.N., plus Germany--meet again with Iran in Baghdad this time, which is \nnext Tuesday.\n  I understand the frustration of the majority leader. First, nobody \nhas been more consistent and steadfast and sincere in their effort than \nthe majority leader to have this body make very clear to everybody in \nthe world--particularly the Iranians--that we will not accept them \nbecoming a nuclear power, and we are prepared to use economic sanctions \nand, if necessary, certainly now the credible threat of force.\n  I also know the majority leader has been pushed and pulled back and \nforth over the last several weeks to get to a point where we can get \nthis done before May 23. So I understand his frustration at this \nmoment.\n  I hear my Republican colleagues, and I have looked at the language \nthey are concerned about. They are concerned that in listing the \neconomic sanctions as one way that can be used to stop Iran from \ndeveloping nuclear weapons and not listing the credible threat, the \noption of military force, as President Obama and others have said, that \nsomehow we are sending a message of weakness.\n  Frankly, my original hope was that the more important thing to do is \nto get this done and passed in the Senate by next Tuesday when all \nparties come to Baghdad. But the difference is not only small, it is \nnonexistent. We all agree we ought to try the sanctions, that we ought \nto make them tough, that they ought not be watered down before the \nIranians agree to stop their nuclear weapons program. And we all agree \nwe have to have the credible threat of force being used against the \nIranian nuclear program if there is any real hope of the sanctions \nworking.\n  I know the majority leader has to leave the Senate floor. Ideally, I \nwish we could agree on that sentence and get it done and passed today \nby consent, if we can. If we can't, I hope we can do it by Monday so we \ndo send a message of unity, which we have, but the words, the \nprocedures, the mood is standing in the way of us sending a unified \nmessage from the Senate to the rest of the world, and particularly to \nthe Islamic Republic of Iran in Tehran, that we mean business. Right \nnow we are not speaking with one voice.\n\n  I appeal to my colleagues. Let us step back, take a breath. Can we do \nit this afternoon? Maybe. I hope so. If we can't, let us get it done \nover the weekend and adopt it by Monday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I wish to echo what my friend from Connecticut, Senator \nLieberman, has said. I wish to get this done so we can vote and send \nthe appropriate signal. It is not so much we act before Tuesday, even \nthough that is important, but that we let the Iranians and the world \nknow what we mean when we speak.\n  I hope they are watching in Tehran. I don't know if they get C SPAN. \nThey will probably find it odd that Lindsey Graham is now being easy on \nIran. Trust me, I am not. Senator Menendez has been a champion, along \nwith Senator Kirk, of creating legislation we could all buy into 100 to \n0. We can't agree we should take Sunday off 100 to 0. But what they \nachieved was remarkable.\n  I understand Senator Reid has been pulled and torn. I appreciate it. \nI enjoy working with him. He thinks maybe somebody is doing him wrong. \nWe are not. He should ask himself this question: Why would Senator \nGraham be on the floor concerned about what we say if he genuinely did \nnot believe we are making a mistake? I don't want to embarrass the \nPresident. I would say to the President: Keep it up with Iran. I hope \nsanctions work. And if you need to use military force to protect this \nNation, if sanctions fail, I will be your strongest advocate.\n  But a couple of things have been said that need to be corrected. The \nmanagers' amendment is not what was in the base bill or we wouldn't \nneed a managers' amendment. Section 102 in the base bill is \napproximately three paragraphs. Section 102 here is approximately 10 \npages. The bottom line for me is that this section was added in the \nmanagers' amendment that didn't exist in the base bill:\n\n       Nothing in this act or this amendment or the amendments \n     made by this act shall be construed as a declaration of war \n     or an authorization of the use of force against Iran or \n     Syria.\n\n  That wasn't in the base bill. Where the hell did that come from? This \nis not a declaration of war. But when this sentence is in there, and \nthe new amendment doesn't say one thing about the use of force to \ncontrol the Iranian behavior--the President's own words are ``all \noptions on the table.'' And the reason I am exercised is we are now \nproducing a product that backs away from where the President has been \nregarding all options on the table. We end the new managers' package \nwith the statement ``nothing here authorizes the use of force against \nIran or Syria.''\n  It is all about sanctions in the bill, and the only time we mention \nforce is to say we won't do it or we won't authorize it. All I am \nasking is what Senator Lieberman mentioned. These sanctions are great. \nI hope they will change Iranian behavior. They haven't yet, and I don't \nthink they ever will, but I am willing to go down this road. All I am \nasking is when we include in the legislation ideas or concepts that \nwill change Iranian behavior that we include ``all options are on the \ntable'' in the bill. Because this would be the first piece of \nlegislation where that is ominously omitted.\n  To end, the whole concept of what we are trying to do with the \ndeclarative statement ``this is not a declaration of war or the use of \nforce against Iran or Syria'' would make the Iranians believe, quite \nfrankly, we are all about sanctions and that is it. I am all for \nsanctions, but if you are listening, Tehran, I want more on the table \nto make you change your behavior.\n  This summer is going to be tough for the world. The Iranians talk and \nenrich. There is nothing credible I have seen to make me believe they \nare not pursuing a nuclear weapons capability. I hope the talks next \nTuesday will change their behavior.\n  I appreciate what Senator Menendez has done, along with his \ncolleagues on the Banking Committee, to give this President more tools, \nto make them even tougher than they are today. But the worst thing we \ncould do before next Tuesday is to leave any doubt to anybody who is \nwatching this debate that there is nothing more on the table than just \nsanctions; that on the table--and we hope to God we never have to use \nit to stop the Iranian nuclear program--is the use of force, if that is \nrequired.\n  That is all I want to say. I hope we never get there.\n  I agree with this last statement--I am not asking for a declaration \nof war against Tehran or Syria--but I will not vote for a document at \nthis critical time in our Nation's history, with the existential threat \nwe are facing from a rogue regime that denies the right of Israel to \nexist, that has killed over 2,000 Americans in Iraq, that has been a \nproxy for evil throughout the planet, whose own President doesn't \nbelieve the Holocaust existed. And to my friends at APACS, whom I agree \nwith most of the time, if they think this is the right answer, I \ncouldn't disagree with you more.\n  Add one simple line, that in addition to all the fine work of the \nBanking Committee, and my dear friend Senator Menendez, that we in the \nSenate recognize what the President has been saying for months--that \nmilitary force is also an option.\n\n[[Page S3256]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. First of all, we have two things on the floor that are \nbeing discussed right now, and I know this is confusing probably to the \npeople in Tehran, but the fact is I agree that Senator Menendez and \nSenator Kirk have done a great job. I am on the Banking Committee, and \nwe voted this out unanimously. I do hope, with this managers' package \nbeing added, that we can work out the details here.\n  My sense, by the way, is that we will do that. My sense is we will do \nthat by the end of the day. So on the sanctions bill, I hope it goes \nforward.\n  Now I wish to move to something called a resolution. As we saw a \nminute ago, Senator Reid talked about something not having the force of \nlaw. We are not talking about the sanctions bill. It has the force of \nlaw and, hopefully, will become law soon. What doesn't have the force \nof law is S. Res. 380, and I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy, if I may, Mr. President, with the Senator from Connecticut \nand the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Sometimes what happens around here, Mr. President--and it \nhappened in Libya, when we passed a resolution at 9 o'clock one night \nby unanimous consent and somebody over at the State Department decided \nthat was an authorization for force. That was not the intent of that \nresolution. Again, we are talking now about the resolution, not about \nthe sanctions bill.\n  I wish to engage in a colloquy with the cosponsors of S. Res. 380, \nbecause there is a clause 6 in here that says:\n\n       . . . strongly supports United States policy to prevent the \n     government of the Islamic Republic of Iran from acquiring \n     nuclear weapons capability.\n\n  There are some wise people over at the State Department who could use \nthat statement as a declaration of war, and I think they acknowledge \nthat. But I don't think the authors of this resolution want that to be \nthe case. So I wish to clarify that in the resolution--not in the \nsanctions bill--none of the language included in S. Res. 380 may be \ninterpreted as congressional support for military operations in Iran.\n  I hope that should the administration decide kinetic activities are \nthe only avenue available--we all hope that doesn't happen, but believe \nit can--that if kinetic activities are the only option available to \nachieve our policy objectives, they will come to Congress for \nauthorization. This is not intended as an authorization of war.\n  I think these two cosponsors of the resolution agree, and if the \nPresident does want to go to war with Iran, it is his responsibility to \ncome to Congress. Is that the agreement, I ask my colleagues?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to respond to my friend \nfrom Tennessee. I am actually very glad he raises the question, because \nI know at least one other Member of the Senate has similar concerns.\n  The interpretation of my friend from Tennessee of our intention in \nthis resolution is exactly right, which is that there is nothing in \nthis resolution that is intended to be an authorization for the use of \nmilitary force in Iran by the President or government, military, of the \nUnited States of America.\n  This resolution's main focus is to essentially back up with a \ncongressional statement the position President Obama has articulated; \nthat no matter what happens, containment of a nuclear Iran is not an \nacceptable policy from the point of view of the security of the United \nStates; that our policy is to prevent the government of the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability. That is \nexactly why clause 6 was put in there, to say we do not accept \ncontainment; that our policy is prevention of the Islamic Republic of \nIran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability.\n  But I want to be clear there is nothing in that language that Senator \nGraham or I or Senator Casey see as the authorization of the use of \nmilitary force. If at any point circumstances in Iran require, in the \njudgment of the Commander in Chief, military action, then I expect--\nparticularly if it lasts a period of time that would bring it within \nthe purview of the war powers understandings--the President would come \nto Congress seeking explicit authorization for the use of military \nforce.\n  This resolution supports the negotiations going on now between the \nP5+1 and Iran. It expresses our hope that it succeed so that the option \nof military force is not necessary. It is very significant in that it \nessentially says--and I will paraphrase it--we ought not to dial down \nthe economic sanctions against Iran just because they have come to the \ntable and maybe accepted one part of what we want them to do. They have \ngot to show they have made a commitment for a verifiable end of their \nnuclear weapons program before we lift the economic sanctions. That is \nthe real goal. And if they do not, they will face our policy of \nprevention, not containment. But this is not the authorization of the \nuse of military force.\n  I thank my friend from Tennessee for raising the question and giving \nus the opportunity to respond, and I hope it reassures anyone else in \nthe Senate who may have had that same concern.\n  With that, I yield for my friend from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Senator Corker asked a very good question, and I will \nanswer it directly, as Senator Lieberman did. The resolution is not \ndesigned to authorize the use of force where anybody in the State \nDepartment administration could say, we have the green light to go into \nIran from Congress. That is not what we are intending to do. We are \nintending to echo a policy statement made by President Obama that the \npolicy of the United States will be--if you are listening in Tehran--\nnot to contain Iran if they obtain a nuclear capability.\n  I want to lodge an objection to my own resolution by my colleague \nRand Paul, who could not be here, so I am going to object on his \nbehalf. He wants to strike two provisions of the resolution, although I \ndon't think we can get there from here.\n  But in response to Senator Corker, if he wanted to add a line into \nthis resolution that it is not an authorization to use force, I will \ngladly do that so that nobody can mistake that. But here is what \nSenator Paul suggested to me. What if they get a nuclear weapon. You \nknow, we don't want to contain them. That is our policy. But what if we \nwake up one day and they explode a bomb out in the desert and they have \nalready got it? What would we do then? Does that mean we would go after \ntheir nuclear program or would we try to contain them? It means, from \nmy point of view, we should go after their program. So we have a \ndifference.\n  If the Iranians think they can sneak through and get a nuclear \nweapon, and then we are going to contain them, it doesn't work that \nway. They need to know their regime survival is at stake if they go \ndown this road. If by some accident of our intelligence being wrong--if \nthat could be even conceivable, which I think it could be given this \nclosed environment--they need to know we are not going to allow a \nnuclear-capable Iran, period.\n  But to this resolution not being an authorization to use force, I \nwould say to Senator Menendez that this last statement--which wasn't in \nthe base bill--I don't object to that. This is not a declaration of \nwar. I don't know why someone added Syria. We are not talking about \nSyria, but there are some people out there who want to limit the \nability of the United States sometimes to defend itself. I want to put \na sentence in your sanctions bill that all options are on the table, as \nthey have been for months, if not years.\n  Mr. CORKER. To sort of end this colloquy--and I know Senator McCain \nand Senator Menendez wish to speak--I fully support every comment that \nhas been made by the Senators from Connecticut and South Carolina. I am \nnot associating myself with the comments of the Senator from Kentucky, \nwhich the Senator from South Carolina alluded to.\n  I would love for the Senator from South Carolina to insert that \nlanguage into it, regarding the fact this is not an authorization for \nthe use of force. But I want to say that is not because I don't support \nexactly the sentiments being laid out here. I do. I just want us to \ncontinue. I want the Senate to be a part of any action that might take \nplace. Hopefully it won't. But if we end\n\n[[Page S3257]]\n\nup with kinetic activity, I want us involved in that so as a Nation we \ngo forward--if that occurs--in a unified way. What I don't want is for \nus to end up where we have in the past, having partisan disputes.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Isn't it true that the President of the United States \nsaid that it was ``unacceptable'' for the Iranians to have a nuclear \nweapon?\n  I have a series of questions.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So doesn't that mean the United States of America would \nreserve all options in case of an unacceptable situation where the \nIranians continued--and we have seen no deviation from that path--\ntoward the acquisition of a nuclear weapon?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Senator is correct.\n  Here is what President Obama said: All options are on the table when \nit comes to the Iranian nuclear program. Israel, I have your back. \nContainment is not an option.\n  I agree with the President. I think he has made the right statements, \nand I am just trying to reinforce them.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So isn't it true that we are having this debate about \nwhether this amendment or this legislation could be construed as an \nauthorization or opening the door for military action; that the \nadministration's policy is already very clear that it is unacceptable \nfor Iran to have a nuclear weapon? And I am sure that, over time, the \nthree of us could talk for a long time about the implications for the \nentire region of Iran, not just the threat to Israel but the entire \nregion of an Iranian government which is, quote, going to wipe Israel \noff the map, which then, of course, would force other nations in the \nregion to develop nuclear weapons.\n  Isn't it true that it has been a matter of national policy--both \nRepublican and Democratic--that it is unacceptable? And that does not \nmean we automatically would use military force, but it does mean we \nwould have to react to the development on the part of the Iranians of a \nnuclear weapon.\n  So this resolution we are considering is no different in any way--in \nfact, it is less specific than what the President of the United States \nhas said and what I believe most every Member of the U.S. Senate is on \nrecord one way or the other saying: that the development of a nuclear \nweapon by Iran would be an unacceptable situation.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Well, let me try to answer that.\n  Senator Menendez and a group of us--Senators Lieberman and Casey and \nHoeven and myself--did the resolution in question today to echo the \nPresident's statement that we are not going to have containment as a \npolicy.\n  There are some people--even Republicans, I might add, some very \nprominent Republicans--who believe you could contain a nuclear-armed \nIran if you told them: If you ever use a nuclear weapon, we would wipe \nyou off the face of the Earth.\n  President Clinton gave a very good answer to that situation. He said \nthat the biggest fear he has is not that the Iranians would put a \nnuclear weapon on the top of a missile and hit Jerusalem and Tel-Aviv. \nThat is a concern. His biggest fear is that they would share the \ntechnology with a terrorist organization. So that is why you can't ever \nlet them get this capability.\n  So the resolution is basically echoing the statement of the President \nthat containment is not an option. And it has 78 cosponsors.\n  Senator Paul has the right to object, and he did. I don't think we \ncan get there from here. I think he has a different view of what we are \ntrying to do--honestly held, a good man, just an honest difference of \nopinion.\n  Back to the sanctions bill. Senator Menendez did a great job, as he \nalways does on things like this. The reason I found out about this and \ngot so concerned is that section 603 is something that wasn't in the \nbase bill. Again, it says: Nothing in this act or the amendments made \nby this act shall be construed as a declaration of war or an \nauthorization for use of force against Iran or Syria.\n  One, nothing in here has anything to do with Syria, and I am OK with \nsaying that. I don't want this to be a declaration of war or an \nauthorization to use force; I want it to be a good sanctions bill. But \nif you don't have the other means available to stop the Iranian \nprograms--as the President has indicated, all options on the table--\nthat has to be said because we would be leaving a gap in our policy.\n  So to Senator Menendez and Senator Reid, all I am asking is that we \ninsert a provision that basically echoes what the policy of this \ncountry is--all options are on the table, not just sanctions. And we \nwill get a lot of votes for this.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S3257, May 17, 2012, the Record reads: . . . So to \nSenator Menendez and Senator Reed, all I am . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . So to \nSenator Menendez and Senator Reid, all I am . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I know our friend Senator Menendez is going to speak, but \nthis is not any change in American policy toward Iran, both Republican \nand Democratic, and that is that there is an existential threat to the \nState of Israel and other countries in the region, other Arab countries \nin the region, that would be posed if the Iranians continued on their \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons.\n  So this resolution is an important statement on the part of the \nSenate and Congress, but to somehow say this is a major change in \npolicy of any kind obviously flies in the face of the record of this \nPresident and previous Presidents as regards this issue.\n  I also would like to thank the Senator from New Jersey for his \ncontinued contributions to these national security issues.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would just close and yield the floor to Senator \nMenendez. The Senator is right about the resolution. We are not coming \nup with a new idea; we are just reinforcing an idea put on the table by \nour own President--we are not going to contain a nuclear-capable Iran \nas a policy. It is not a declaration of war. It is not authorization of \nforce. It is restating the policy at a time when it may matter.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And if there were a need for military action, it is the \nview of all of us that we would come back to the Congress of the United \nStates before any such action were contemplated.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Well, here is my view about that. I think the President \nwould be wise to include the Congress.\n  I am a conservative who thinks the War Powers Act is \nunconstitutional. I find it odd that our party for all of these years \nhas railed against the War Powers Act until President Obama is in \noffice, and all of a sudden we are great champions of the War Powers \nAct.\n  But what I would say is that it would be wise for the President to \nconsult with the Congress and for us to be united. And if you do \nbelieve in the War Powers Act, he has to, within a period of time, come \nback to get our approval to continue. I think whatever the President \nneeds to do to defend us against a nuclear-capable Iran is best made by \nthe Commander in Chief consulting with the Congress. But you can't have \n535 commanders in chief.\n  Back to the sanctions bill. The problem I have is that it is silent \non a concept on which we all agree, and I don't want to create a \ndocument before the negotiations Tuesday that doesn't include something \nbeyond sanctions to change the Iranian behavior that we all want to \navoid. And this says: It is the sense of the Congress that the goal of \ncompelling Iran to abandon efforts to acquire nuclear weapons \ncapability and other threatening activities can be effectively achieved \nthrough--it goes through 10 pages talking about sanctions, and not once \ndoes it mention the possibility of military force, and that is what I \nwant to add, that concept.\n  With that, I will yield the floor. I hope we can work this out.\n  To the Senator from New Jersey, I think he is a great guy, and I am \nsorry we are having this problem. But it is very important to me that \nwe get this part of it right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of both my \ncolleague from South Carolina and my colleague from Arizona. They are \nleaders in this regard in terms of the national defense. And if I ever \nhad a case, I would want Senator Graham to argue it for me because he \nis a fine lawyer. I have seen that on the floor and I have seen it in \nhis role as a reservist in part of, as I understand, the Judge Advocate \nGeneral program. So he does a fantastic job.\n  Let me make some observations that I think are critically important.\n\n[[Page S3258]]\n\n  No. 1 is that I share Senator Graham's and Senator Lieberman's \nconcern and the desire to have the Senate on record as saying we do not \nand cannot accept an Iran that has nuclear power and nuclear weapons. \nThat is why I signed on to their resolution. And I think their \nresolution moving exactly in tandem, parallel with the sanctions \nlegislation that I played a significant role with the chairman of the \nBanking Committee, Chairman Johnson, and others to bring to the floor \nis incredibly important.\n  But let me make some observations.\n  First of all, in the committee itself, when it passed unanimously, \nall of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle had the opportunity to \noffer an amendment and/or language that would have done exactly what \nthe Senator wants, and no one on either side of the aisle sought to do \nit because the focus was on the jurisdiction of the committee, which is \neconomic sanctions--economic sanctions that have proven in their first \niteration to begin to have real consequences to the Iranians: devaluing \nthe rial by over 50 percent; creating challenges in their economy; \nclosing the financial institutions they can deal with in the world; \nlooking at their oil, having major discounts on their oil and finding \nit increasingly difficult to sell. And we have the opportunity to \nperfect that, to make it even stronger, even more viable before they \nhead into negotiations and think they can buy time.\n  Now, it was silent when it came out of the Banking Committee. And, \nyes, in the managers' amendment there is that provision because, in \nfact, in order to deal with one of the objections of our colleague on \nthe other side of the aisle, Senator Paul, provisions saying that this \nwas not a direct military authorization were included so that we could \nultimately find the opportunity to pass it on the floor with unanimous \nconsent--the same unanimity the Banking Committee had, the same \nunanimity we had when we passed the sanctions on the Central Bank of \nIran. That unanimity sends an incredibly strong and powerful message to \nthe Iranians.\n  So it was in the process of accommodating that Senator Reid talked \nabout over the last 2 months to try to get us to a point that we could \npass legislation, that in the process of accommodating that, that \nlanguage comes forward.\n  The concern is ultimately taken care of by Senator Lieberman and \nSenator Graham's resolution; that, in fact, the President has said, as \nthe Commander in Chief of the country, that a nuclear-armed Iran is not \nan option; that containment of a nuclear-powered Iran is not an option.\n  This President has put all of the military assets that are necessary \nthat did not exist before in the Persian Gulf to both respond to any \nincident or to initiate any action he thinks may be necessary. \nTherefore, those actions more than any words have made it very clear to \nthe Iranians that is a real possibility if the national interests and \nsecurity of the United States are ultimately challenged.\n  So I really think that insisting on the sanctions part of the \nlegislation, that has the full force and effect of law and real \nconsequences to the Iranians in their economy--which is the most \nsignificant way that we undermine their march toward nuclear weapons--\nis important to move, while you move independently the legislation that \nSenator Lieberman and Senator Graham have talked about, which is making \nthe intentions or amplifying the intentions of the President crystal \nclear. But you should not hold hostage the sanctions legislation in \norder to accomplish a goal that should be taken care of by the \nLieberman-Graham resolution, and you shouldn't hold it hostage when, in \nfact, you have a powerful tool to exercise before the next round of \nnegotiations.\n  The Iranians must know that we are one of purpose, and that oneness \ncomes by passing the sanctions unanimously through this Chamber and \nachieving, ultimately, their effects.\n  So that is the only point of disagreement with us. Don't hold the \nsanctions legislation hostage. None of our colleagues sought to include \nthat language. And the language that is included is in response to a \ncolleague from the other side of the aisle in order to be able to move \nthe legislation. So you can't have your cake and eat it too. But we do \nneed to have our ability to move the sanction before the Senate \nadjourns this week, and I think that will meet our collective interests \nas a nation.\n  There is only one piece of turf we should be fighting for; that is, \nthe collective turf that is our country. That is what we can do by \npassing the sanctions legislation.\n  I hope Senator Reid will have the opportunity to clear the way and to \nmove it by unanimous consent and in doing so send a very powerful \nmessage on behalf of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask consent the Senator from \nDelaware, Senator Coons, and I could have a colloquy for up to 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Student Immigration\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senator from Delaware is not yet on the floor but \nI know he is coming. Because I know other Senators wish to speak at 2 \no'clock, I am going to go ahead with my remarks. When he comes I will \nlet him go ahead with his.\n  Each year, approximately 50,000 foreign students receive advanced \ndegrees from universities in this country in the areas of science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics. We call those in shorthand \nSTEM degrees--science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.\n  Of those 50,000 students, at least 17,000 go home to other parts of \nthe world. These are some of the brightest men and women in the world. \nThey are attracted to the best universities in the world. I always say \nour universities, our great research universities especially, are our \nsecret weapons for job growth. Since World War II, many estimates by \nthe National Academy of Sciences suggest that more than half of our new \njobs have come from increases in technology. It is very hard to think \nof any important new innovation in biology or in the sciences that has \nnot had some sort of government-sponsored research over that time. So \nour research universities are job factories and our advanced degree \nholders are the ones who come up with the great ideas.\n  As a former president of the University of Tennessee, which is a fine \nresearch university, I know that increasingly in the science, \ntechnology, engineering, and math programs in those universities many \nof the students are from other countries. These students line up in \nIndia and compete, hoping they will get a chance to come to the United \nStates. They have done the same in China. They do this everywhere in \nthe world. About 17,000 of those 50,000 who come for advanced degrees \ngo home each year.\n  Yesterday, Senator Coons and I introduced legislation that would help \nthose 17,000 students, and we hope more who may come, to come to the \nUnited States, get their advanced degrees in science, technology, \nengineering, and math, and then stay here and create jobs in our \ncountry instead of going home and creating them in other countries.\n  I will have to admit there is a value to students who go home. It is \nprobably our best foreign diplomacy, to have someone come from another \ncountry, live here, learn our values, go home and explain those at \nhome. But we want the next Google to be created here, not in China. We \nwant the brightest people in the world. If we are going to attract them \nhere and provide education for them, we want to give them every \nopportunity to come here. And today we make them go home because of our \nimmigration policy.\n  The legislation Senator Coons and I introduced yesterday now has the \nsupport already of at least two other Senators, Senator Lugar and \nSenator Isakson, who have asked to cosponsor. It would, No. 1, create a \nnew student visa for citizens of other nations who want to come here \nand pursue a master's or doctoral degree in science, technology, \nengineering, and math. No. 2, once they get that degree, the new visa \ncreated in this bill would allow them to remain here for 12 months, to \nlook for a job. And, No. 3, once they are employed, the bill \nestablishes a procedure to allow students to change their immigration \nstatus and to receive a green card. Finally, these new green cards \nwould not count toward any existing green card limit.\n\n[[Page S3259]]\n\n  This idea is not new. It has as much support outside of the Senate \nChamber as any idea I know about--from companies such as Microsoft, \nwhich tells us they have 2,600 jobs available that require computer \nscience degrees that start at $104,000 a year. They would like to have \nthese students work here and create jobs for us. We know from our own \nexperience the importance of these green-card holders.\n  The Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, TN, is probably the \ngreatest engineering laboratory in the world. Who runs it? Dr. Jeffrey \nWadsworth ran it. He had a green card from the United Kingdom. Dr. Thom \nMason, who is there now, had a green card from Canada. Thomas Zacharia, \nthe current Deputy Director at ORNL and the father of supercomputing, \nhas a green card from India.\n  We want them here, not in India, not in the United Kingdom, not in \nCanada.\n  I greatly appreciate the leadership of Senator Coons of Delaware on \nthis issue. He has worked hard on it. He has been a leader on it.\n  I only have one more thing to say about it before I step aside and \nlet him talk about his ideas. In 2005, we began to work on something \ncalled the America COMPETES Act in this body. In 2007 we passed it. It \nwas sponsored by the Democratic leader and the Republican leader. It \nhad 35 Democratic sponsors and 35 Republican sponsors. It passed the \nHouse. It was reauthorized last year. We asked the best minds in our \nNation to tell us what would be the 20 things we could do as a Congress \nto make sure we are competitive in the future so that we can keep this \nhigh standard of living we have come to enjoy. It is a very high \nstandard of living. We have about 5 percent of all the people in the \nworld. We have about 25 percent of all the wealth in the world that we \nproduce each year. How can we keep doing that?\n  They gave us these 20 ideas and we passed many of them. It is one of \nthe great successes of our Congress over the last several years, \nworking together. One piece of unfinished business from the America \nCOMPETES Act of 2005 and 2007 was to pin a green card on the foreign \nstudent who gets a graduate degree in science, math, technology,or \nengineering.\n  The legislation Senator Coons and I offered yesterday would do that. \nI greatly value his leadership and his approach. I hope we can work \nwith our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take this idea, turn \nit into a law, and give our country more of an opportunity to create \nnew jobs as we move forward.\n  I already asked permission for the next 15 minutes that Senator Coons \nand I would be in a colloquy. I wish to defer to him for his comments \nat this time.\n  Mr. COONS. I thank very much Senator Alexander. I cannot think of a \nbetter person to partner with, to seek advice and guidance and \nleadership from, on the issue of STEM immigration and education reform \nthan Senator Alexander, a national leader on education policy. Like me, \nSenator Alexander is the son of a former classroom teacher, but also \nserved as the U.S. Secretary of Education and president of a prominent \nuniversity, the University of Tennessee. He knows firsthand of the \nchallenges, of the opportunity lost when tens of thousands of foreign \nnationals, who come here and seek the opportunity to get STEM master's \nand doctoral degrees in some of our best universities, are then forced \nto return home to their nation of origin rather than being able to stay \nhere, if they choose, to create jobs, grow businesses, and contribute \nto our country and our economy.\n  As someone who, before running for public office, worked with a \nhighly motivated materials-based science company that employed over \n1,000 researchers, I too have a sense of what great contributions \nimmigrants have always made to this country, but particularly in these \nareas of innovation and how they can contribute to our competitiveness.\n  Senator Alexander's closing comments about the America Competes Act \nis where we start this conversation. I came to this Senate knowing that \nmy predecessor from Delaware, Senator Kaufman, had been a strong \nsupporter of the America Competes Act, one of the few engineers to \nserve in the modern Senate. I was happy to take up the cause and press \nfor its reauthorization in the waning days of the 111th Congress.\n  I met with Senator Alexander last year and we talked about this as \none of the most promising unfinished pieces of business in that \ncritical report, ``Rising Above The Gathering Storm,'' and in that \nvital piece of legislation, the America Competes Act. As Senator \nAlexander had referenced, the America Competes Act was passed with \nstrong bipartisan support. That was the sort of thing that was focused \non moving America forward by identifying strong ideas that had support \nacross the whole country and a lot of different sectors and from both \nparties. It is my hope this is the beginning of building a strong \nbipartisan coalition on moving forward on immigration reform.\n  Let me talk for a minute, if I could, about our history and tradition \nof immigrants contributing to our country, being a strong part of job \ncreation and growth here, and in particular immigrants who come to this \ncountry to be educated in STEM disciplines--science, technology, \nengineering, and math.\n  If you think about it, for most of the last century we had some of \nthe strongest universities in the world. For much of the last 50 years, \nanyone who came here from a foreign land to get a doctorate in a STEM \ndiscipline, if they chose to go home, was going home to a country that \nwasn't a competitive environment. The United States--because of our \nadvances in workforce and infrastructure and our legal system, our \nentrepreneurial culture, our capital markets--was the world leader in \ninnovation and competitiveness. This is no longer the case. We still \nhave the strongest universities in the world, 35 out of the top 50, but \ntoday those 17,000 STEM doctoral and master's graduates that Senator \nAlexander referred to, when we force them to go home to their country \nof origin rather than allowing them to compete for those jobs here and \ncontribute to the American economy, are finding open arms in nations \nsuch as India and China, which are vigorous competitors. They are \nproviding the capital markets, the infrastructure and the workforce, \nthe resources to take advantage of those opportunities. We need an \nimmigration system that responds to the modern economy and the \nopportunities of a highly competitive modern world. Rather than \nhemorrhaging these highly skilled folks and having them return home, we \nshould give them an opportunity to participate in being job creators \nhere.\n  The numbers bear this out. If you take a look at the Fortune 500 \ncompanies today, more than 40 percent of them were founded by \nimmigrants or their children. Folks who had come to this country \nrecently from other parts of the world have established companies that \nemploy more than 10 million people worldwide and have combined revenues \nof more than $4 trillion, a figure greater than the GDP of every \ncountry in the world except the United States, China, and Japan. \nImmigrant-founded startup companies created 450,000 jobs in the United \nStates in the last decade, and collectively they have generated more \nthan $50 billion in sales in a single year.\n  Let me give one example that has meant a lot to me. I became friends \nwith the founder of Bloom Energy, KR Sridhar. In his native India he \ngot his undergraduate degree, but he came to the United States to get \nhis doctorate in mechanical engineering and then went on to be a \nresearcher at NASA's Ames Center and made a critical invention in solid \noxide fuel cells. He runs Bloom Energy, which has already created 1,000 \njobs. Last week the Governor of Delaware and my senior Senator, Tom \nCarper, joined others at the site of a former shuttered Chrysler plant \nfor the groundbreaking of a facility that Bloom Energy will make \npossible.\n  Why would we want a capable, bright contributor to our economy like \nKR to be forced to go home to his country of India, rather than \nwelcoming him here and giving him a chance to participate, to \ncontribute, and potentially become not just an American business leader \nbut an American citizen? We need to make it easier for the next \ngeneration of inventors and innovators to create jobs here.\n  This bill, as Senator Alexander has laid out, is relatively simple. \nIt creates a new class of visas for foreign students to pursue STEM \nmaster's and doctoral\n\n[[Page S3260]]\n\ndegree programs, and allows us to continue a conversation about how do \nwe recognize the longstanding central contribution to our economy, our \nculture, and our country of immigrants.\n  I believe there are other areas of immigration reform that have to be \non the table, that we have to move forward on. I am eager to move \nforward on family-focused reform and on other areas as well, where I am \na cosponsor of other immigration bills, but my hope is this legislation \nwill get the attention it deserves, will get the broad support from \nMembers of both sides of the aisle it deserves, and that it will form \npart of a compromise that will address the needs of all the \nstakeholders in immigration reform in a responsible and balanced \nmanner.\n  This legislation is not the end of the road, but it is a critical \nstep forward in making sure we continue a bipartisan, thoughtful, and \nconstructive dialog on how do we deal with an immigration system that \nis broken and that doesn't make America as competitive as it could be.\n  If I could, I want to close by thanking Senator Alexander for his \nleadership, for allowing me to work with him and to produce a bill that \nis streamlined, that is simple, that is accessible, and that I think \ncan contribute to making America a land that continues to welcome and \ncelebrate the real job creators, inventors, and innovators from all \nparts of the world.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, Senator Coons is one of the most \neloquent speakers we have in the Senate. He did a beautiful job in \nexplaining the bill. I hope it attracts support from both Republicans \nand Democrats. He mentioned the fact there are other immigration \nissues--and there are. There are a number of ones I wish to work on and \nget something done. I was here when we tried to get a comprehensive \nimmigration plan a few years ago. It had strong bipartisan support, but \none of the lessons we learned in that effort was that we do not do \ncomprehensive well here in the Senate. Sometimes it is better to go \nstep by step. That has been true for a long time.\n  We remember Henry Clay as the Great Compromiser, but Henry Clay's \ngreatest compromise was not passed by Henry Clay. He failed. It nearly \nruined his health and he went to Massachusetts to recover from it. A \nSenator named Stephen A. Douglas, from Illinois, the home of our \nassistant Democratic leader, came to the floor and introduced the Clay \ncompromise section by section and each section passed with a different \ncoalition, with Senator Sam Houston being the only Senator who voted \nfor each one of them. So my hope is that with the broad support we have \nfor this very simple idea--pin a green card on the lapel of a gifted \ngraduate of an advanced program in science, technology, engineering, \nand math, and allow them to stay here and create jobs here instead of \nforcing them to go home--I hope we have such strong support for this \nidea that we can go ahead and pass it, and then we can follow that up \nwith the other necessary steps we need to take on immigration, and \nhopefully we can do that with a coalition that represents Democrats and \nRepublicans as well. This is a great idea.\n\n  Somebody might say: Well, why don't they just do it the way we do it \nnow? Right now, it is H 1B visas. As everyone who is an employer knows, \nthey are complicated, burdensome, and there are not enough of them. \nThis is simple. It is a new visa. They get it if they are admitted, and \nthey get to stay 12 months while they look for a job. If they get a \njob, they get a green card, and there is no cap on the number, and that \nis the idea.\n  I thank Senator Coons for his leadership. I look forward to turning \nthis good idea, this piece of unfinished business in the bipartisan \nAmerica COMPETES Act, into law.\n  Mr. COONS. In closing, I will just say that the economics of this \nlegislation are simple, but, as Senator Alexander and I recognize, any \nstep toward immigration reform is complicated. Making it easier for \nforeign-born, American-educated innovators to stay in the United States \nis just one aspect of many of the urgently needed steps to reform our \noutdated immigration system.\n  I see that Senator Durbin has come to the floor. I am proud to \ncosponsor the Dream Act. I also support the Uniting American Families \nAct. There are other pieces of legislation that are essential to allow \nus to recognize and to strengthen the role immigrants play in the \nfabric of our country. I think this opportunity today to move forward \non a bipartisan bill that focuses on this one area without caps, with a \nnew class of immigration visa, is an important contribution to moving \nthis discussion forward for all of us.\n  I thank Senator Alexander.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Postal Reform\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today the Postmaster General announced \nthat the Postal Service would begin the process of consolidating about \n140 processing facilities around the country. Despite the harsh \nrealities of this announcement from the Postmaster General, there are a \nfew bright spots in Illinois.\n  The processing facilities in Springfield and Fox Valley, which the \nPostmaster General had originally slated for closure, will remain open. \nAdditionally, I am glad that the Postmaster General has heeded our \ncalls to keep Illinois jobs in Illinois and other jobs in the States \nwhere the processing facilities currently exist. The Postmaster \nGeneral's original plan would have potentially sent over 500 Illinois \npostal jobs to surrounding States, along with the mail they have \nprocessed so efficiently for so many years.\n  Beyond the postal employees, the Postal Service supports tens of \nthousands of private sector jobs in Illinois, which is the center of \nthe mailing and printing industry.\n  Certainly, today's announcements are difficult for my constituents \nwho live in Quincy and Rockford, Carbondale and Centralia, Bloomington \nand Effingham. I have consistently insisted--and the Postmaster General \nassured me--that we are going to avoid layoffs and that all of the \nemployees in these facilities will have the opportunity to pursue \nanother role in the Postal Service or to accept, if they wish, early \nretirement incentives. I am told none of these facilities will close \nbefore the end of the year.\n  As I said, today's news is disappointing and difficult for many in my \nState, including postal customers, postal employees, and small \nbusinesses. Still, I think it is important to note how far we have come \nfrom the Postmaster General's original plan to where we are today. \nOriginally he sought closure of 250 processing facilities nationwide--\ntoday's announcement, 140--and called for the closure of 3,700 mostly \nrural post offices.\n  In Illinois, the Postal Service originally targeted 9 plants for \nclosure which employ over 1,800 people. After countless hours of \nmeetings and hard work and a great deal of floor debate, we have moved \noff the potentially destructive path.\n  Let me say this too, Mr. President. You know this subject better than \nany other Member in the Senate. We met in my office with the Postmaster \nGeneral--I believe in November or early December--sat down with him and \nsaid that his proposal to reduce the number of post offices and \nprocessing facilities could be the death knell of postal service as we \nknow it today.\n  You will remember that we challenged them. We said: Mr. Postmaster \nGeneral, do not make any of these changes until May 15. Give Congress \nan opportunity to come up with a way to save money for the Postal \nService, to preserve the Postal Service, and to do it by way of \nlegislation, which is why we were elected.\n  He reluctantly said he didn't want to do it. Reluctantly he gave us a \nletter and said: I won't do anything until May 15. I will give the \nHouse and the Senate a chance to do their work.\n  If you will remember, Mr. President, I called Senator Lieberman, \nchairman of the administration committee--the government operations \ncommittee, and said to him: With this jurisdiction, we have to roll up \nour sleeves and get to work.\n  He said: We are ready. Senator Collins and I and Senator Carper and \nothers will work together to pass a Senate bill that achieves Postal \nService reform in a fairer way.\n\n[[Page S3261]]\n\n  And he did.\n  The same day, I called Chairman Darrell Issa, the California \nRepublican chairman of the House committee with the responsibility for \nthe Postal Service. I said to Chairman Issa: We now have until May 15 \nto do our job, to pass a bill in the House and the Senate and get it to \nthe President, and now the clock is running.\n  Mr. President, you will remember that we had a break over the \nholiday, and when we came back we were anxious. We didn't want to waste \nany time. Let the record show that at the end of the day, the Senate, \non a bipartisan basis, passed the postal reform bill. Thirteen \nRepublicans joined 49 on the Democratic side and passed a bipartisan \nbill.\n  Well, what happened in the House? The answer is nothing happened in \nthe House. The House of Representatives failed to do their job. They \nfailed to pass Postal Service reform. To my knowledge, they didn't \nbring a bill to the floor. And then May 15 came. The Postmaster General \nkept his word and waited, and then he made this announcement.\n  If the Senate bill that we passed had become the law of the land, \ntoday's announcement would have never taken place. We set up a process \nfor post offices and processing facilities to be evaluated in terms of \ntheir efficiency and costs that I think was sensible, reasonable, and \nwould have saved money. We didn't get to that point because the House \nfailed to act. That is the harsh reality of why we face what we do \ntoday.\n\n  Only the Speaker of the House and his majority can explain why they \ndidn't accept the challenge to legislate. My question to them is, If \nyou are not here to legislate, why are you here? An issue of such \nnational importance as the future of the Postal Service should have \nbeen done, as it was in the Senate, on a bipartisan basis in the House \nof Representatives. We did it here. We worked together. I cannot even \nremember how many amendments we considered, but we labored through \nevery single one of them and got it done.\n  Now I look around my State and see six or seven major processing \nfacilities closed, and it breaks my heart because what we did in the \nSenate would have avoided some of those. It would have at least put a \nprocess in place that was a lot fairer.\n  Well, my last word to the Members of the House is that it is not too \nlate. It is not too late to accept the responsibility and to pass the \nSenate bill if you can't pass one of your own. Call our bipartisan \nSenate postal reform bill to the floor. At least give it a vote in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  If they can pass it, let's send it to the President, and perhaps \nbefore the end of the year we can actually save some of these postal \nfacilities.\n  I don't want to create false hope because I couldn't believe that May \n15 would come and go and the House wouldn't act, but that is what \nhappened. So let's hope that changes for the better.\n  I am going to continue to work with the Presiding Officer as well as \nthe President of the United States and all of the committee members. \nThe Postal Service is something special.\n  I will close by saying this. When they ask Americans what they think \nof people who work in the Federal Government, they don't always have \nthe highest opinion--including Members of Congress. But when you ask \nthem about what branch of the Federal Government they have particularly \npositive feelings about, it is the Postal Service. You know why, and I \ndo too. It is that letter carrier who is looking in the window and \nwaving at your mom to make sure she is OK each day, and she looks \nexpectantly for the delivery of the mail even if it is just some \ncircular. That is that visitor each day who keeps her in touch with the \nworld and our Nation in touch with itself. That is the Postal Service.\n  I just went into the Springfield post office, my local branch, \nrecently, and they couldn't have been kinder or more courteous, helping \nall the people who were there. Our postal employees are some of the \nbest Federal employees in America, and I am proud of what they have \ndone. I am sorry they are going through this change. It is not \nsomething we wanted to see happen.\n  We are going to do this in a way that is good for the future of the \nPostal Service. I hope the House will join us in this bipartisan \neffort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                      Student Loan Interest Rates\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am joined by my colleague, Senator Brown \nof Ohio. We are extraordinarily apprehensive that in 45 days the \ninterest rate on subsidized student loans will double in the United \nStates. Young people and middle-aged people who are struggling to \neducate themselves and reeducate themselves will be faced with a \ntremendous increase in the cost of college and postsecondary education. \nThe interest rate will go from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent. This is \nparticularly ironic when the Federal Reserve routinely lends to large \nbanking institutions huge sums of money at less than 1 percent. So this \nis a huge impact on middle-income Americans who are struggling with so \nmany challenges: housing costs, employment problems--the whole plethora \nof issues they face.\n  It is estimated that more than 7 million students, including 43,000 \nin Rhode Island, will suffer because of this doubling that will take \nplace. A lot of our colleagues have said: Of course we don't want to \nsee this happen. I thought it was terribly ironic yesterday that they, \nwith very few exceptions, voted consistently for budgets that would, in \nfact, double the student interest rate. In fact, one of the budgets \nthey voted for previously, the Ryan budget from the House, would also \neliminate the in-school interest subsidies for certain loans. So there \nis this incongruity between, oh, we are all for keeping interest rate \nlow for students, but, of course, in our budget we double it.\n  There is another problem, and it has been reported in so many \ndifferent national and local newspapers. There is a huge problem with \nstudent debt. We have reached the $1 trillion mark in student debt. \nThis could be the next big, huge bubble we face financially. It \ncertainly impairs the ability of young men and women when they graduate \nto go and take the job they want, to buy the house they want, because \nthey are struggling with huge debts, and we are adding to that by \ndoubling the interest rate.\n  This is a policy issue, but it is also an intensely personal issue. I \nreceived letters from many constituents about the potential impact, and \nI know Senator Brown from Ohio has as well. I wonder if the Senator has \nsome comments at this point.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I appreciate the work of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland and Senator Harkin. Of course, Senator Reed has been working on \nthis issue for months and months. I am still amazed that the Senate \nrefuses time and again and the House refuses to do the right thing.\n  This started back in 2007. It was bipartisan with President Bush, \nwith the Democratic House and the Democratic Senate. The Presiding \nOfficer was involved, Senator Reed and others, and we passed it. We did \na 5-year freeze of interest rates. Now the bipartisanship seems to have \ngone, and repeatedly this body has either failed to step up or actually \nvoted no or voted wrong in some cases to move forward on this.\n  As Senator Reed has said, I, too, have tens of thousands of people--\n380,000 Ohioans--who are now in the Stafford subsidized loan program. \nIt will mean about $1,000--as it will in Rhode Island--per student, per \nyear if we fail to act by July 1.\n  I have been at four campuses just in the last month or so. I have \nbeen at a community college in Cleveland, the University of Cincinnati \nat the other end of the State, Wright State University in Dayton, and \nOhio State University in Columbus. I saw students--one was from the \nYoung Republicans on one of the campuses and others are Democrats--\ntrying to find a way to pay their bills. They are working-class kids, \nmiddle-class kids, poor kids--kids who want to find a way to get ahead.\n  We hear the same stories over and over, but let me just share one. On \nmy Web site people sign up and come to the Web site and tell their \nstories. I will just share one of them. I know Senator Reed has been \nhearing from people in Providence and Warwick and all over his State \nalso.\n  This comes from Dorothy in Mount Sterling, OH. She wants to be a \nspecial ed teacher. Dorothy says:\n\n\n[[Page S3262]]\n\n\n       I never thought that student loans would have such a huge \n     impact on my life. I am studying to be a special ed teacher. \n     I really want to make a difference so that our youngest \n     generations have an equal opportunity to succeed in life.\n       I rely on student loans to pay for my education and assist \n     me in times of need in this harsh economic climate.\n       Higher interest rates mean that I will never be able to \n     afford a home, a reliable vehicle. I will never be able to \n     provide for my family, and I will always feel in debt for \n     trying to make myself a better person and trying to be a \n     better citizen for our country and the State of Ohio.\n       If given the chance for a better job opportunity outside my \n     area of expertise, I would surely take it into great \n     consideration. I know that in the years to come, I will \n     desperately be looking to relieve myself from the cost of my \n     college education.\n       I feel like I have been punished for wanting an education \n     and wanting to better myself so that I can better the lives \n     of others. I just wanted to make a difference and I am \n     fighting against those who do not even realize what it means \n     to truly struggle.\n       Please don't stop fighting for me.\n\n  We can hear the desperation. We can hear the focus she has on \ncommunity service and public service, but we can also hear the view \nthat she is being undercut by decisions we are making--or not making.\n  She also said something else that was pretty interesting. When we \nsaddle these young people with loans, the average 4-year graduate in \nOhio has about $27,000 in debt. When we pile more on Dorothy or \nsomebody in Rhode Island or Vermont, it means they are less likely to \nbuy a house, less likely to start a business, less likely to start a \nfamily. It is morally wrong to stand in their way or make it harder.\n  Think what it does to the economy too. I want people such as Dorothy \nto get an education without huge debt, to buy a home, to begin to \nprovide and prosper and lift the whole community; people who are \nproductive workers and who care about the community. We have no \nbusiness taking that away from Dorothy and people like her and adding \nto her debt. That is why we have to do this first.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, if I could reclaim my time, the Senator has \nbeen a tremendous leader on this issue because he leads from the front. \nHe is in Ohio. He is talking to students and families. He understands \nthe personal ramifications that are involved.\n  Let there be no mistake. This is a program that benefits middle and \nlower middle-income Americans. Nearly 60 percent of the dependent \nstudents who qualify for subsidized loans come from families with \nincomes of less than $60,000. This is not a perk for the superwealthy. \nNearly 70 percent of independent students--that is the term of art for \nthose adults or older people who may have some previous training but \nthey have to go back to the community college to get a certificate and \nare trying to transition from a job that was shipped overseas to one \nthey think they can get here.\n  Nearly 70 percent of independent students borrowing these loans have \nincomes of less than $30,000 a year. So we are talking about people who \ncannot afford a doubling of the interest rate.\n  But there is another issue too. It is not just, as Senator Brown \npointed out, to fulfill legitimate and, in fact, admirable personal \nambitions of establishing oneself in a community by buying a home or \nraising a family; this is about our future, our productivity as a \nnation, our ability to compete in an incredibly difficult \ninternational, global economy.\n  We have looked at the statistics at universities such as Georgetown \nUniversity. Their Center for Education and the Workforce said over 60 \npercent of the jobs by 2018--a few years from now--will require some \npostsecondary education--60 percent. But in 2010, only 38 percent, \nroughly, of working adults held a 2-year or 4-year degree. So we have \nthis gap, a 20-percentage point gap, between the skills we need through \npostsecondary education and the skills we have. We hear not just from \nanalytical papers that are done by think tanks; we hear it every time \nwe go back to either Ohio or Rhode Island because employers come up to \nus and say: I have jobs to fill, but I can't find people with the \nskills, the training that I need to give them a job.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REED. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Senator Jack Reed from Rhode Island is one of the \nfew graduates from West Point in this body and served his country in so \nmany ways and still does. But I think about Jack Reed when I think \nabout what happened with the GI Bill after World War II. We want to \nhelp individual people with keeping these interest rates from doubling, \nbut we know when we help lots of individual people we help society as a \nwhole.\n  After World War II, literally millions of young men and women \nreturned from fighting for our country, came back to the United States, \nand the government was farsighted enough in 1944 under President \nRoosevelt, who signed the GI Bill, to prepare for this huge wash of \nyoung men and women coming back from the war. We as a nation were smart \nenough back 65, 70 years ago to help millions of those young men and \nwomen one at a time with their education.\n  But here is what else it did: Those millions of students who \nbenefited from the GI Bill gave so much to society. Perhaps our best \ntimes economically as a nation in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s \ncame out of the GI Bill because when government helps in partnership to \ngive opportunity to thousands or hundreds of thousands or millions of \npeople, it also helps the country as a whole, and that is part of our \nphilosophy in public service in many ways.\n  So what these Stafford loans, these subsidized loans do, as do Pell \ngrants--and we are seeing efforts to cut Pell grants by the House of \nRepresentatives too, which is just the stupidest thing ever in my mind \nbecause I don't understand the way some of them think--but when we \nprovide opportunities for Stafford loans, subsidized loans, or Pell \ngrants, it is helping people such as Dorothy and people in Rhode Island \nand Vermont. It is helping people in Mansfield and Toledo and Cleveland \nand Garfield Heights. I think it is one of those things that is hard to \nunderstand why we would not do this.\n\n  I wanted to ask Senator Reed a question, if I could. He explained on \nthe Senate floor one day how Republicans have said they are for this \nnow, that they don't want to double the interest rate--although I am \nnot sure of that from some of their activities. The Senator from Rhode \nIsland has talked about the way we want to pay for this versus the way \nthey want to pay for this.\n  I know the Senator talked about closing tax loopholes, and they \ntalked about sort of playing college students against women needing \nmammograms by cutting health care--if the Senator could explain that to \nmy colleagues.\n  Mr. REED. I would be happy to, reclaiming my time. First, let me echo \nwhat Senator Brown said, how this is about being competitive. When he \ntalked about the Pell grants, I have to reference my colleague and \npredecessor, Claiborne Pell, because he seized on the lesson of the GI \nBill and said: Let's extend it broadly to college students. So Pell \ngrants, Stafford loans, all of those vehicles were created. Frankly, I \nthink that is not only the reason we have led the world and the Nation \nin creativity, but it is the reason America, as well as--and probably \nbetter than any other place in the world, was able to proliferate \ncomputers and technology, et cetera, because we have a literate, well-\neducated citizenry who first could invent these devices and then could \nuse them properly. We are in danger, if we don't continue to support \neducation, of losing our innovative edge and losing our capacity as a \npeople to adopt innovation and technology and to continue to lead. For \nall of these reasons, our economic future is linked to continuing to \nsupport higher education.\n  There is another point I wish to make before I talk about the way we \nhave proposed to pay for this; that is, there have been some on the \nother side who say the problem is that tuition is going out of sight, \nand we are contributing to those tuition hikes. Well, under the \nsubsidized loan program, the maximum borrowing is $23,000. So this is \nnot the driving force. Colleges have to recognize they have to rein in \ncosts, but this is not the driving force. This is the way so many \nfamilies are able to make it through college and make it into the \neconomy and move up the economic ladder.\n  But what our colleagues have said is they are all for preventing this \ndoubling. Of course, yesterday they voted consistently, with very few \nexceptions,\n\n[[Page S3263]]\n\nto double the interest on Stafford loans. So what they say and what \nthey do sometimes are different.\n  But then they said the real dispute is how to pay for it. They want \nto pay for it by going after the money in the prevention fund, which is \npart of health care reform. But this prevention fund is absolutely \ncritical. As Senator Brown indicated, people need diagnostic tests. \nThey need to be able to go to a medical facility and get advice, \nassistance, and tests so they can avoid problems. That is not only \nsensible for the individual; that is the only way we are going to get a \nhandle on the proliferation of costs in the health care sector.\n  One of the ironies of our current health care system, pending the, we \nhope, implementation of the affordable care act, is that we have \nmillions and millions of Americans who have no real access to health \ncare, no access to preventive care, no access to simple things such as \ncheap pharmaceuticals to control cholesterol until they get to be 65 \nyears old. Then they go into the doctor's office, and they have \nMedicare. But their problems are so much more expensive.\n  I was speaking to ophthalmologists in my office, and they said: You \nare absolutely right. We see people come in for the first time with \nhealth care under Medicare who have serious problems such as diabetes \nand glaucoma. If we had seen them 10 years ago--if a physician had \ntreated them--through a prescription or another very inexpensive \ntherapy, they could have avoided these tremendous costs. That is what \nthey are going after.\n  By the way, that is, to me, another middle-class program because, \nfrankly, if one is well off and well situated financially, one will get \nall the preventive care one needs. It is those people who are \nstruggling in the middle class and moving into the middle class who \nneed this prevention fund.\n  So what we have proposed--is not to attack another benefit, or a \nsmart, wise, cost-effective approach to health care that would benefit \nmiddle-income Americans--instead we are going after a tax dodge, plain \nand simple. This is a tax dodge that has been called out by the \nGovernment Accountability Office as something that has been used to \navoid over $23 billion in taxes on wages in 2003 and 2004--a huge gulf.\n  In 2005, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration called \nthis loophole a ``multibillion employment tax shelter.''\n  Let me tell my colleagues how it works. An individual who is a \nprofessional--a lawyer, an accountant, a consultant, a lobbyist--and \nthe skills of that individual represent what he or she does as a \nlawyer, an accountant, et cetera. They are personal skills. But instead \nof being paid by an employer directly, they substitute a subchapter S \ncorporation so they are now an employee of the corporation. They take a \nminimum a salary, if you will, from the corporation, but then at the \nend of the year, the corporation gives the individual the surplus as a \ndividend, which is taxed much cheaper, so the person can avoid payroll \ntaxes. It is legal, but it is a tax dodge. It is a loophole.\n  This loophole is so egregious that conservative columnist Bob Novak \ncalled it out, Sean Hannity of Fox News called it out, and the Wall \nStreet Journal called it out saying it is a simple way to avoid paying \npayroll taxes, Medicare taxes, as well as other employment taxes.\n  Closing this loophole is sound policy. We should do this anyway. But \nwhen we do it in conjunction with this student lending, we actually are \nable to help struggling families and close an egregious loophole.\n  What some of our opponents have suggested is that this is just \nanother tax increase. We have been very careful. We restrict these to \nprofessional endeavors. We also restrict the impact to those making \nover $200,000 a year. So this is not targeted at the mom-and-pop \nstores. This is not targeted at the local laundry or the local dry \ngoods store or the local hardware store that is organized as a \nsubchapter S. In fact, Politifact, one of the agencies that does \nindependent analyses of various claims, clearly rejected this \ncharacterization as a tax increase on the mom-and-pop stores and on the \nsmall business companies and the job generators as false. So we have \nnot only a sensible, but a compelling way to pay for this.\n  So everyone agrees we can't let this happen on July 1. We have an \negregious loophole that should be closed anyway to pay for it, and I \nsuggest we move on. Just, procedurally, let's bring this to a vote. If \nthey want to put up the prevention fund for a vote, if they want to put \nup any other means to pay for it, fine.\n  Let's have our vote, and let's avoid the doubling of student loan \ninterest rates on July 1.\n  I know the Senator from Ohio has some comments.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I thank the Senator.\n  I appreciate that explanation because this is a tax loophole that \nalmost anybody who is fair-minded about this sees as a giveaway to \nsome. They call it the Newt Gingrich-John Edwards tax loophole, to be \nbipartisan, where each of them benefited by tens of thousands of \ndollars. Again, they did not cheat; they did not break the law. They \njust took advantage of a tax loophole I would think everybody here \nwould want to close because most people play it straight.\n  Their income is their income. They pay the Medicare tax on it. This \nis a case where they do not. We, I thought, believed in some fairness \nin taxation. But back to the individual people who will benefit from \nthis. That is why Senator Reed is involved. That is why the Presiding \nOfficer and Senator Sanders, I know, care about this issue.\n  Let me share, in closing, one last letter. This came from Courtney in \nGalloway, OH:\n\n       I, like many other students, always had a college savings \n     account. I remember putting birthday and holiday money in it \n     every year, and I always assumed that it would pay my way \n     through college.\n       Before I even made it to high school, though, my \n     grandmother fell gravely ill and my family had no other \n     choice but to use my college savings to pay for her hospital \n     bills, and eventually, the funeral.\n       Since then, paying for college has been my own \n     responsibility.\n       All the loans are in my name, and it is a burden that is \n     constantly hanging over my head. I am less than a year from \n     graduating--likely with honors--from The Ohio State \n     University with a degree in Social Work, but instead of being \n     excited and looking toward my future, I am constantly worried \n     about my loan debt and the possibility of rising interest \n     rates.\n\n  If I could interrupt the letter for a second, think about that. She \nis about to graduate. She wants to serve the country. She wants to \nserve her community. She clearly grew up with the right values--putting \nmoney aside, not spending it on things she wanted to do--when she was \nmowing lawns or babysitting or whatever she did in her teens, putting \nmoney aside and then spending it on her grandmother's medical expenses, \nand now she is worried.\n  Upon graduation--a wonderful moment in her life--she is anxious about \nwhat this all means. In the life of a social worker, she is not going \nto make a lot of money, obviously. That is what she wants to do. Yet \nshe is going to be facing these bills for years to come.\n  She said:\n\n       I know that, as a future Social Worker, I will be not \n     making as much money as people in other professions, but \n     helping others is where my heart lies.\n       Unfortunately, I may be limited in the positions I can take \n     if my interest rates increase.\n       Maybe even unable to work within the populations I am truly \n     interested in helping--veterans, the homeless, and senior \n     citizens if the pay would render me unable to pay off my \n     student loans.\n       I am very passionate about my education, and hold no \n     grudges . . . for what needed to be done, but the threat of \n     rising student loan interest rates has affected me in a very \n     serious way, and I feel as though it is something that I have \n     no control over, which is a very heartbreaking feeling.\n\n  She may not be able to pursue the public service she wants to do as a \nsocial worker because her loan debt is so heavy. How dare people in \nthis body make a decision by inaction or make a decision by doing \nnothing to heap more burden, put more debt on Courtney's shoulders. How \ndare they and how shameful it is that we simply cannot get bipartisan \nagreement--which we had 5 years ago with President Bush--to move \nforward on this and close a tax loophole to pay for it.\n  Do not put Courtney up against somebody who needs an immunization or \na breast cancer screening or a prostate cancer screening. Close the tax \nloopholes, move forward on this, take the anxiety off of Courtney and \nothers\n\n[[Page S3264]]\n\nas much as we can and do the right thing.\n  I yield.\n  Mr. REED. Reclaiming my time, again, let me thank the Senator from \nOhio for his leadership, for his passion, for his commitment. We are \nhearing from the other side that this is just about how to pay for this \nnecessary legislation to prevent the doubling of the interest rate. We \nhave offered a compelling way to pay for it in terms of closing this \negregious loophole. They have, as Senator Brown indicated, once again, \nput on the chopping block, if you will, preventive services for \nfamilies across this country and potentially the most sensible way to \nbegin to reduce our health care costs over time.\n  They have--when they have wanted to--completely ignored paying for \nthings such as tax cuts. We have seen that. Just recently the House \npassed the so-called Small Business Tax Cut Act with no offsets. So to \nliterally hold these students hostage to their unwillingness to bring \nthe bill to the floor, to debate it vigorously--to vote on their \nproposal to pay for it and to vote on our proposal to pay for it--is, I \nthink, unfortunate, if not unconscionable.\n  We have 45 days left.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                             PDMRA Program\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \njoin me in passing a critical bill that keeps the faith with the men \nand women of our Reserve Forces.\n  Representative Kline, a Republican Congressman from Minnesota, has \nled this effort in the House. I am leading it in the Senate. It affects \ntroops from all over the country, a promise that was made to them that \nmust be kept.\n  My home State of Minnesota has no large Active-Duty bases, but we \nhave a long and proud tradition of military service in our National \nGuard and our Reserves.\n  Throughout every military engagement since the Civil War--including \nthe two wars we have fought over the past decade--Minnesota's National \nGuard members and reservists have served with courage and honor to \ndefend our Nation overseas.\n  In fact, it was a ragtag group of workers and farmers who signed up \nfor the precursor of the National Guard during the Civil War, who went \nto the Battle of Gettysburg and had the highest percentage of \ncasualties of any unit in the Civil War. There is a big monument for \nthem honoring the fact that they had that high rate of casualties. In \nfact, they held the line for troops to come in in the Civil War.\n  The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have highlighted the importance of \nour brave citizen soldiers across the country and the unprecedented \nsacrifice they have been called upon to make. The National Guard and \nReserves were not built to serve as an active-duty force for prolonged \nperiods. Yet at times as many as 40 percent of the American forces \nfighting in these wars have been Guard and Reserve troops. I say to the \nPresiding Officer, I know you know that, being from Vermont, where you \nhave many National Guard troops who have served our country.\n\n  Just last month, about 3,000 members of Minnesota's National Guard \nFirst Brigade Combat Team--our Red Bulls--returned home from a year of \nservice in Kuwait assisting the drawdown in Iraq. Some of these men and \nwomen were not serving for their first, second, or third time. I met \nthese soldiers. Some of them were serving for their fourth time, for \ntheir fifth time, some even for their sixth time.\n  The repeated mobilizations and overseas deployments of Guard and \nReserve units have profoundly affected families and communities in \nMinnesota and across the Nation. That is part of the reason we pushed \nso hard to bring those troops home from Iraq. That is also why, in \n2007, in recognition of the extraordinary sacrifices our servicemembers \nand their families have made, the Department of Defense created the \nPost Deployment/Mobilization Respite Absence--or PDMRA, as it is \ncalled--Program.\n  The PDMRA Program awards extra leave days to servicemembers who \ndeploy beyond the standard rotation cycle. The motivation is simple: \nTroops who serve multiple deployments above and beyond the call of \nduty--who are basically being deployed as Active Duty even though they \nare not; folks who have raised their hands and stepped forward time and \ntime again to volunteer and support our country--deserve leave time at \nhome with their families as some compensation.\n  When they signed up to serve, there was not a waiting line. When they \ncome home to the United States of America and they need a job or they \nneed health care or they need an education or they want some time with \ntheir families, they should have that.\n  Well, one can imagine the concern the Red Bulls felt and I felt too \nwhen we learned all of a sudden the leave benefits our troops were \npromised under the program were being reduced as they were serving \noverseas. They were promised one thing when they left, and the program \nchanged when they were gone.\n  Here is what happened. Until last fall, members of the Reserve \nComponent who served more than 1 year out of 6 could be awarded up to 4 \nextra PDMRA leave days for each extra month of service. Then on \nSeptember 30, 2011, the Defense Department changed the policy, reducing \nthe 4 days down to 1 or 2, depending on the location of service.\n  But here is the problem: Instead of grandfathering in the troops who \nhad been promised the 4 days of leave under the old policy, the Defense \nDepartment implemented the change immediately, applying it to all \ntroops on the ground.\n  I can understand having a new policy, I really can. But do not do it \nto the troops who have already been promised one thing. That meant in \nthe middle of their deployment, 49,000 reservists deployed around the \nworld, who had been promised up to 4 days of leave for their service \neach month and who had earned that leave, were told, with little \nwarning, that the days they were promised under the PDMRA Program were \ngoing to be cut, starting October 1, 2011.\n  Well, as you can imagine, this was a real setback for our troops, and \nfor many reasons. First of all, it means they would get less time at \nhome with their families, whom they have not seen--their kids, their \nspouses, their parents.\n  Second, it means our troops and their families are forced to cope \nwith unexpected financial challenges as their leave benefits are cut \nwithout warning.\n  Finally, the change has meant that our reservists--who, unlike the \nActive Component, do not necessarily have a job to come back to when \nthey separate from duty--are faced with an increased and unexpected \nurgency to find employment.\n  Well, our economy is on the mend, it is stable, but we are still \nseeing, as the Presiding Officer knows, record numbers of unemployment \namong our veterans of the past two wars. Now is not the time to cut the \nleave benefits of people who have been promised the leave and push them \nout to find their own way.\n  When the men and women of our armed services signed up, they did it \nfor the right reasons. They are patriotic. They put their lives on the \nline for our country. The least we can do is keep the promises we made.\n  That is why my colleague in the House of Representatives, Congressman \nJohn Kline--himself a decorated veteran--and I introduced legislation \nthat makes a simple fix to this program.\n  Our bill does not reverse the new policy change that the Department \nheads made after careful review of the program. Our bill simply \ngrandfathers troops deployed under the old policy so they receive the \nleave benefits they were promised.\n  I want to take a few moments to share just a few key points about \nthis bill.\n  First, it has bipartisan support in both the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives. In fact, it passed in the House on Tuesday night with \nthe support of all Representatives.\n  Second, the cost of this bill is fully offset. No new spending is \ncreated in this bill.\n  Finally, this bill is now supported by Secretary Panetta himself. It \nis supported by the Department of Defense, after they realized what the \neffect of this policy would have if troops were not grandfathered in.\n  This is a country that believes in patriotism, and patriotism means \nwrapping our arms around those who have served and sacrificed for our \ncountry. I\n\n[[Page S3265]]\n\nthink all of my colleagues here today agree that nobody needs and \ndeserves our support more than the men and women who have offered their \nlives in defense of our Nation.\n  For 10 years, the men and women of our National Guard and Reserves \nhave done their duty. Now I believe it is for us in Congress to do our \nown duty to make sure our troops receive the benefits they are due.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I have high hopes that in the days \nimmediately ahead the Senate will proceed to the consideration of the \nFood and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012.\n  I am pleased to report to my colleagues that the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee has produced an excellent bill, the \nproduct of nearly a full year of bipartisan collaboration and good-\nfaith negotiation. The bill reauthorizes critically important FDA user-\nfee agreements and systematically modernizes FDA's medical product \nauthority to help boost American innovation and ensure that patients \nhave access to the therapies they need.\n  In this era of often extreme partisanship and legislative gridlock, \nthis bill is truly a refreshing exception. That is why I am hopeful and \nconfident that there will be no objection on the Senate floor to moving \nto this bill next week.\n  Frankly, all of us on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee are proud not only of the bill but of the remarkable \nbipartisan process that produced it. I am especially grateful to the \ncommittee's ranking member, Senator Mike Enzi, for his own insistence \non a bipartisan process, and for his leadership in moving this very \ncomplex legislation forward.\n  This afternoon I will review the bipartisan process--at every step \nmarked by openness and transparency--that produced this legislation.\n  More than 1 year ago, beginning in early 2011 for some issues, my \noffice and the office of Ranking Member Enzi convened six bipartisan \nHELP Committee working groups. Each working group was tasked with \ndeveloping consensus policy proposals on key issues, such as drug \nshortages and the integrity of the drug supply chain.\n  These bipartisan working groups met weekly and, in many cases, \nbiweekly, over the whole course of 2011, discussing and developing \ndraft consensus proposals.\n  While this consensus process was ongoing, my staff would often meet \nmany times a week with staffers representing both Democratic and \nRepublican members of the HELP Committee.\n  As I said, every single working group was bipartisan, and staff from \nmy office worked closely with Senator Enzi's office to solicit \npriorities from other members of the committee. In many cases, we \ninvited all HELP offices to join the groups.\n  We even invited staff of noncommittee Members who have been leaders \nin a particular policy area to join the groups. For example, our \nbipartisan drug shortage working group had staff members from 18 Senate \noffices, including the staffers for two Senators who are not even \nmembers of the committee.\n  While developing the consensus drafts, each of these bipartisan \nworking groups met with key stakeholders throughout the year to solicit \ntheir input. For example, the drug supply chain integrity working group \nmet with more than 40 stakeholders over a period of 9 months.\n  In addition to the working group meetings, beginning in late 2011, my \nstaff met twice a week for almost 18 weeks with all Democratic HELP \noffices to brief them on the reauthorization process and update them on \nthe progress of all of the policy proposals.\n  To further engage committee members, the administration, \nstakeholders, and the public, we held a total of five full committee \nhearings on the user-fee reauthorization over the last year. After our \nfirst public hearing in July of 2011, we held three hearings on \ndistinct policy issues surrounding user fees, as well as a hearing on \nthe actual user-fee agreements.\n  As a result of the excellent work of these bipartisan working groups, \nin March of this year my staff and Ranking Member Enzi's staff released \nfive bipartisan consensus drafts and solicited further stakeholder \ninput. Bipartisan staff conducted stakeholder briefings on the release \nof each draft, and the drafts were available on the HELP Web site for \nmore than 3 weeks prior to markup.\n  In response to the five discussion drafts released to the public, our \nstaffs received more than 160 comments and held more than 30 \nstakeholder meetings on a bipartisan basis over 3\\1/2\\ weeks.\n  Bipartisan staff worked to incorporate stakeholder feedback into the \ndrafts, and then the committee publicly released a managers' package on \nWednesday, April 18, 1 week before markup.\n  On April 25 of this year, the committee met to consider the bill. \nCommittee members voted nearly unanimously, by voice vote, to send the \nbill to the full Senate.\n  As I said, this entire process has been a model of bipartisanship, \nopenness, and transparency. Believe me, it was tough to achieve \nconsensus on many of the complex and controversial provisions in the \nbill. At every step, it required difficult and sometimes painful \ncompromise. Even as the committee chair, I did not get some of my \nhighest priority proposals, since I could not get consensus among \nmembers and stakeholders.\n  Compromise and sometimes sacrifice were essential. I was acutely \naware, as were other members of the committee, that it is imperative \nthat we pass the user-fee agreements in this bill. We were determined \nnot to allow partisanship to slow this package down or to jeopardize \nour goal of consensus.\n  As I said, the end result is an excellent bill. In addition to \nauthorizing the critically important FDA user-fee agreements, this \nlegislation makes it possible for the FDA to keep pace with the ever-\nchanging biomedical landscape.\n  Here are some of the major provisions of the FDA Safety and \nInnovation Act, which will be on the floor next week:\n  It authorizes key user-fee agreements to ensure timely approval of \nmedical products. It streamlines the device approval process, while \nenhancing patient protections. It modernizes FDA's goal of drug supply \nchain authority. We spur innovation and incentives for drug development \nfor life-threatening conditions. The bill reauthorizes and improves \nincentives for pediatric trials. It helps prevent and mitigate drug \nshortages. It increases FDA's accountability and transparency.\n  With this bipartisan bill, I think we have a bill, I hope, we can all \nsupport and that we can move forward on expeditiously. Neither \nDemocrats nor Republicans got everything they wanted. On every issue, \nwe sought consensus. Where we could not achieve consensus, we didn't \nallow our differences to deflect us from the critically important goal \nof producing a bill that everybody could support. As a result, this is \na truly bipartisan bill, and it is broadly supported by the patient \ngroups and industry.\n\n  This is the chart showing over 100 different associations and groups, \npatient groups, consumer groups, pharmaceutical groups, and research \norganizations all over America that have come out in support of this \nlegislation. So everyone from the pharmaceutical industry, your \ndrugstores, research institutions, and consumer organizations have all \nnow supported this bill to reauthorize our user-fee agreements.\n  I am also very pleased that today the Obama administration issued an \nofficial statement of administration policy asserting that ``the \nadministration strongly supports passage of S. 3187.''\n  Lastly, I will mention that the CBO scored the bill as fully paid for \nand estimates that the legislation would reduce the deficit by $363 \nmillion over the next 10 years. Again, not only are we enhancing \npatients' rights and protections, we are ensuring better integrity for \nthe drug supply chain. As we know, more than 80 percent of the products \nthat go into our drugs manufactured in this country come from\n\n[[Page S3266]]\n\nabroad. There have been many stories written, and many television \ninvestigative stories included, on problems in that drug supply chain. \nWell, this bill enhances our ability to ensure the integrity of that \ndrug supply chain from where they get the raw materials to where they \nput it together in this country.\n  This bill, as I said, not only does good for our patients, we enhance \nFDA's authority to streamline and make sure that we bring drugs to \nmarket in more rapid order. We save $363 million over 10 years doing \nit.\n  I look forward to bringing the FDA Safety and Innovation Act to the \nfloor in a few days. The House has had a similar bipartisan process, \nand they are also scheduled to take up their version of the bill next \nweek. If the Senate acts quickly, I am confident we can go to \nconference and get a final bill on the President's desk this summer.\n  To that end, I am hopeful and confident we can move without objection \nto consideration of the bill. It is important that we do so. This is \nabsolutely must-pass legislation. It is critically important to the \nFDA, to the industry, and to our patients to get this done.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join in the bipartisan spirit of \ncooperation we have engineered and witnessed in the HELP Committee over \nthe last year. Let us come together, Democrats and Republicans alike, \nand get this legislation on the floor and pass it because of its \ncritical importance to the American people.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Global Warming\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask that I be recognized for up to 15 \nminutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, today I want to expose a far-left \nenvironmental agenda that is being imposed upon the Department of \nDefense by President Obama and a lot of his allies, and it comes at the \nsame time that the Obama administration is focusing on dramatically \nreduced cuts in the military.\n  As ranking member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks, and as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, stopping \nthe radical global warming agenda, as well as President Obama's \ndevastating cuts to our military, have been my top priorities, and that \nis all I have been talking about for the last couple of months. I have \nhad a growing concern about how President Obama's global warming agenda \nis harming our military, but the remarks recently made by Secretary \nPanetta have led me to come and make a few statements.\n  First, let me say this about Secretary Panetta: I served with him for \n5 years in the House, and a number of years ago he and I became very \nclose friends. In fact, I rejoiced when he was nominated and we \nconfirmed him as Secretary of Defense. So I was extremely disappointed \nto see that he was wasting his valuable time perpetrating the \nPresident's global warming fantasies and his war on affordable energy, \nwhich occurred, no less, at a gathering of radical environmentalists. \nThat is where the statement was made. Secretary Panetta said:\n\n       In the 21st century, reality is that there are \n     environmental threats that constitute threats to our national \n     security.\n\n  He also vowed that the Pentagon would take a leading role in shifting \nthe way the United States uses its energy. Every talking point \nSecretary Panetta used in his speech, from rising sea levels to severe \ndroughts to the so-called plight of the polar bear, all of these--I \nwill not go into them one at a time--these all came out of Al Gore's \nscience fiction movie, and they have all been totally rebuked.\n  In reality, it is President Obama's war on affordable energy that is \nhaving a dramatic impact on our national security, a war that is \nfurther depleting an already stretched military budget and putting our \ntroops at risk.\n  Secretary Panetta made another revealing statement in justifying the \nPresident's green agenda. This was about two editions ago in the Hill \nmagazine:\n\n       As oil prices continue to skyrocket, the department `now \n     [faces] a shortfall exceeding $3 billion of higher-than-\n     expected fuel costs this year,' according to Panetta. In \n     order to dig its way out of that financial hole, DOD has no \n     choice but to look to alternative fuel technologies. Pentagon \n     officials plan to invest more than $1 billion into developing \n     those technologies in fiscal year 2013.\n\n  I might add, that is $1 billion that would otherwise be spent on \ndefending America. That is right, energy prices have skyrocketed, we \nunderstand that--precisely because of the politics of this \nadministration. Remember, they have openly admitted this.\n  Secretary of Energy Steven Chu said:\n\n       [S]omehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of \n     gasoline to the levels in Europe.\n\n  We all know why he made that statement. That was way back in 2008.\n  It was Obama's statement that said under his cap and trade--which is \nwhat they have been talking about--``electricity prices would \nnecessarily skyrocket.''\n  Now, because domestic energy prices have skyrocketed under his \nadministration, just as they wanted them to do, Secretary Panetta wants \nthe military to go green. Instead of spending scarce resources greening \nthe military, the commonsense solution is simple--to begin developing \nour own vast supply of energy resources.\n  Secretary Panetta's comments came just 2 weeks before the Senate \nArmed Services Committee is to begin the markup of this coming year's \nDefense authorization bill. So I will be taking this opportunity to \nwork with my colleagues on the committee to put the spotlight on \nPresident Obama's forcing his costly green agenda on the Department of \nDefense while he is taking down the budget for the defense. I look \nforward to introducing a number of amendments that will put a stop to \nthis nonsense and help ensure that Secretary Panetta has the tools he \nneeds. I can assure you--because I know him well--this is a script this \ncame off of.\n  As part of that effort, I am also releasing a document put together \nby the Congressional Research Service that puts a pricetag on how much \nthe Federal Government provides global warming policies, and I will be \ndiscussing this.\n  With President Obama running for reelection and pretending to be for \nan ``all of the above'' energy approach, Secretary Panetta's comments \nare surprising. But they are still also illuminating. President \nPanetta's commitment of $1 billion for alternative fuels makes clear \nthat despite the President's recent change in rhetoric for his \nreelection campaign, he remains fully determined to implement his all-\nout attack on traditional American energy development, and the military \nis one place where he can force that experiment. We are talking about a \ngreen experiment using our military.\n  To show just how egregious this whole thing is, let me spend just a \nsecond documenting how badly President Obama wants to take down the \nmilitary for the benefit of his green agenda. Over the past 4 years, \nDOD has been forced to drastically cut its personnel, the number of \nbrigade combat teams, tactical fighters, and airlift capabilities. It \nis eliminating or postponing programs such as the C 27, the Global Hawk \nBlock 30, the C 130 avionics modernization package, which we \ndesperately need, and the advancement of the F 35. These are programs \nwe have had on the drawing board, and it is very important we carry \nthese through to fruition.\n  Even more concerning, these cuts could go even deeper. Because the \nsubcommittee failed to report legislation last fall--and we all \nremember this--that would have reduced the deficit by at least $1.2 \ntrillion over the next 10 years, the Pentagon's budget could be cut by \nan additional $495 billion between 2013 and 2021. That is very \ninteresting because during that period of time we are talking about two \nthings--not just degrading the military, but over the next 10 years \ntaking $\\1/2\\ trillion out. If sequestration should come in that would \nbe another $\\1/2\\ trillion, and everyone realizes that would be \ndevastating to the military.\n\n  Secretary Panetta has rightly warned us that such drastic cuts would \nbe a threat to national security. He said:\n\n\n[[Page S3267]]\n\n\n       Unfortunately, while large cuts are being imposed, the \n     threats to national security would not be reduced. As a \n     result, we would have to formulate a new security strategy \n     that accepted substantial risk of not meeting our defense \n     needs. A sequestration budget is not one I could recommend.\n\n  That is a quote by Secretary Panetta.\n  General Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, weighed in \nalso and said:\n\n       The impact of the sequestration is not only in its \n     magnitude. It's in what it does . . . we lose control. And as \n     we lose control, we will become out of balance, and we will \n     not have the military this nation needs.\n\n  When they talk about accepting risk, we are talking about lives. That \nis what that means; risk equals lives. What are you willing to do for \nthis green agenda?\n  The remarks by the top DOD officials make Panetta's recent global \nwarming speech at odds with solving our military's budget problems. \nEven as Secretary Panetta expresses concern about the impact of these \ncuts on national security, he is openly supporting President Obama's \nforcing DOD to expend large amounts of scarce resources on expensive \nalternative fuels. This doesn't make any sense, and that is why I \nbelieve Secretary Panetta's global warming remarks were written by \nsomeone in the White House to appease the radical left and not \nSecretary Panetta. I am absolutely convinced of that. After seeing how \nsevere these cuts to DOD would be, how could anyone justify this so-\ncalled greening of the military?\n  Consider, for example, the Navy's plan to sail its Green Fleet, a \nstrike group powered by alternative fuels, by 2016. The success of this \nGreen Fleet is predicated upon biofuel--much of it algae based--\nbecoming practical and affordable. So they are assuming that is going \nto happen, which I don't think it is going to happen.\n  In 2009 the Department of the Navy paid $424 a gallon for 20,000 \ngallons of biodiesel made from algae, which would set a record for all-\ntime cost of fuel. That is per gallon--and that is when it was on the \nmarket for $4 a gallon--and it is $424 a gallon.\n  In December 2011 the Navy purchased 450,000 gallons of biofuel for \n$12 million, which works out to be about $26 a gallon. This purchase is \npart of a larger deal in which the Navy has pledged taxpayer funds of \n$170 million as their share of a $510 million effort to construct or \nretrofit biofuel refineries in order to create a commercially viable \nmarket. This biofuel will be mixed with conventional fuels by a 50 50 \nratio to yield a blend that will cost roughly $15 a gallon--roughly \nfour times what we should have to be spending.\n  Keep in mind this is at the same time we are rejecting systems that \nwere in our plans, and have been for a long period. And as if the \nservices are not already stressed by serious budget cuts, the Secretary \nof the Navy also directed the Navy and Marine Corps to produce or \nconsume one gigawatt of new renewable energy to power naval \ninstallations across the country.\n  Everyone agrees energy efficiency in the military is a worthy goal. \nIn fact, I have been a strong supporter of the DOD's alternative energy \nsolutions that are affordable and make sense, including the initiatives \non nonalgae biofuels and natural gas. In fact, in my State of Oklahoma \nwe are working, through the major universities and the Noble Foundation \nand others to take that leadership role. But forcing our military to \ntake money away from core programs in order to invest in unproven \ntechnologies as part of a failed cap-and-trade agenda is not only \nwrong, it is reckless.\n  I am not alone in saying this. My good friend, Senator McCain agrees \nwith me on this point. Just last month Senator McCain criticized \nearmarks for alternative energy research in the Defense appropriations \nbill which cost the taxpayers $120 million. Senator McCain said:\n\n       We're talking about cutting the Army by 100,000 people, the \n     Marines by 80,000 people, and yet we now have our armed \n     services in the business of advanced alternative energy \n     research? The role of the armed forces in the United States \n     is not to engage in energy research. The job of energy \n     research should be in the Energy Department, not taking it \n     out of Defense Department funds.\n\n  That is where it belongs, and I agree with Senator McCain's \nstatement.\n  The CRS report is significant. Largely due to my concern about green \nspending in the military, I recently asked the CRS to figure out how \nmuch money--how much of taxpayers' dollars--is actually being used to \nadvance the green agenda. The amount came out that since 2008, $68.4 \nbillion has been used to advance a green agenda.\n  Just to name a few options, if we didn't do that, we could add $12.1 \nbillion to maintain DOD procurement at fiscal levels of 2012 and allow \nour military to continue to modernize its fleet of ships, its aircraft, \nand its ground vehicles. We could avoid a delay in the Ohio-Class \nBallistic Missile Submarine Replacement Program, and it goes on and on, \nwhich I will have as a part of the Record.\n  Instead of funding these priorities, the Department of Defense has \nbeen forced to spend valuable resources on research relating to climate \nchange and renewable energy.\n  In the stimulus package, each branch of the Armed Services and the \nPentagon itself was given $75 million, for a total of $300 million, to \nresearch, develop, test, and evaluate projects that advance energy-\nefficiency programs. In total, since 2008, DOD has spent at least $4 \nbillion on climate change and energy-efficient activities. The same $4 \nbillion could have been used to purchase 30 brandnew F 35 Joint Strike \nFighters, 28 new F 22 Raptors, or completely pay for the C 130 Aviation \nModernization Program that we have been working on for a long period of \ntime.\n  Now, just for a minute I will turn to the argument that President \nObama and the far left have been using to justify this mission to go \ngreen. They always say we need a transition away from fossil fuels. One \nthing we do know--and it is a fact, and I don't think there is anyone \nout there who is disagreeing or arguing with this--we have more \nrecoverable reserves in oil, gas, and coal than any other country in \nthe world. When you stop and think what we have been talking about on \nthis war that this administration has had on fossil fuels, it has been \nthat on domestic energy.\n\n  One thing, if people understand, there is not a person in this body \nor anyone else I have found in America who did not learn back in \nelementary school days about supply and demand. We have all this vast \nsupply but the government will not let us develop our own supply. It is \nludicrous. We are the only country in the world where that is a \nproblem.\n  In addition to the fact that we cannot use our resources, develop our \nown resources, we keep hearing over and over what people are saying: If \nwe were to even open our public lands to development, to drilling and \nto producing, it would take 10 years before that would reach the pump.\n  I know my time is real short here so I am having to shortcut this, \nbut I am talking to one of the top guys producing today, Harold Hamm. \nHe is from Oklahoma. He actually is up in North Dakota right now and he \nis doing incredible things, developing shale and developing gas and oil \nto run this country.\n  I asked him a question. I said: I am going to use your name in \nquoting. How long would it take, if you were set up in New Mexico and \nall of sudden they would lift the ban, in order for that to reach the \npump? Do you know what his answer was? He said: Seventy days. It would \ntake 2 months to get the first barrel of oil up and then 10 days to go \nthrough the refining process and reach the pumps.\n  It is supply and demand. We have that. We should not be using our \nmilitary to advance the green agenda by this President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. May I interrupt for 1 moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I wanted to confirm the order of proceeding would be \nSenator Franken is going to speak and then I will speak for a few \nmoments after Senator Franken. I know the Presiding Officer is to be \nexcused very shortly.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. The Senator wishes to speak now?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask consent I follow Senator Franken. We will see \nto it the Presiding Officer is relieved timely, at 4 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S3268]]\n\n                      Student Loan Interest Rates\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, last week my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle blocked a vote that would have eased the burden of \ndebt for millions of college students in Minnesota and across the \ncountry. My Republican friends disagreed with us about the best way to \npay for this legislation, so a minority of Senators kept us from \nhelping millions of families and taking a step toward keeping our \nNation's workforce globally competitive. But this debate is not just \nabout helping students pay for college. I want to talk a little bit \nabout the two competing proposals to pay for this critical legislation. \nI wish to talk about our national priorities and our national values.\n  On one side, the Democratic proposal would close a loophole that \nallows some of the wealthiest Americans to avoid paying taxes they \nshould owe to the Federal Government. This fix, our fix, would only \napply to Americans making over $250,000 a year and would not create any \nnew taxes on businesses or individuals. It would close a loophole that \nallows high-income people to get out of paying taxes everyone else in \nAmerica is already expected to pay. This is what it is.\n  You see, some people making a lot of money talk to their accountants \nand tax lawyers who have figured out that the law was written in such a \nway that you could use an S corporation to get around paying some of \nyour payroll taxes. Payroll taxes are your Social Security taxes and \nyour Medicare taxes.\n  S corporations are basically a passthrough. Whatever profits your \ncompany makes, you at the end of the year pass it through to you and \nclaim it as income--and you pay regular income taxes on it. It is \nincome. But although the law was never intended to allow this, this is \nthe loophole: You can pay yourself an artificially low amount of money \nsometime earlier in the year and call that a salary, say, $40,000. Thus \nyou will pay enough to qualify for Social Security later when you \nretire. You will only pay FICA on this amount. But then at the end of \nthe year you take the rest of the business's profits as income. \nRemember, this is considered income--but you do not pay FICA taxes on \nthe amount. That is the loophole. You still pay income tax on it \nbecause it is income but, because of an accident in the way the law is \nwritten--this was not intended--you avoid paying FICA taxes on the part \nyou did not initially call salary.\n  All of the money you pocketed, both the so-called salary and the \nprofit at the end of the year, again, is income. It is income. It is \nnot capital gains so you should be paying, like everybody else, \nMedicare taxes on all of it and Social Security taxes on income up to \n$110,000, like everyone else. There is simply no excuse, no reason for \nnot paying taxes, paying your FICA taxes on the $110,000 Social \nSecurity, and all the rest for Medicare, except for an anomaly that was \naccidentally written into the Code.\n  This is exactly the type of loophole we should be closing. It is not \nsomething that Congress created intentionally, for a reason--to help \npeople buy homes or to encourage investment in research and \ndevelopment. There is no reason this loophole exists. There is no \npurpose to it. There is no reason to keep it there.\n  The Democratic legislation would close that loophole for those \nindividuals making more than $250,000 in a year and we would use that \nsavings to prevent the doubling of interest that students pay on \nStafford subsidized loans.\n\n  By contrast, the Republican proposal which passed the House a few \nweeks ago, would eliminate the Prevention and Public Health Fund, which \nis our national investment in preventive health care. This proposal \nwould undermine the health of our Nation by cutting funding for cancer \nscreenings, child immunizations, and diabetes prevention, among others. \nIt would be fiscally irresponsible to boot, since according to a study \nfor the Trust for America's Health, every dollar invested in proven \ncommunity-based disease prevention programs yields a return of $5.60.\n  My home State of Minnesota leads the country when it comes to \nproviding high-quality low-cost health care. When I was elected to \nrepresent the people of Minnesota, I put together a series of \nroundtables with experts around Minnesota to learn more about our \nhealth care system. I heard the same thing from leading national \nexperts at the Mayo Clinic, the University of Minnesota, from \nproviders, from doctors and people in public health and rural health, \ninsurance--everyone said the same thing: An ounce of prevention is \nworth a pound of cure.\n  There is no question that if we catch cancer early the patient will \nbe much more likely to make a full recovery. If every child has access \nto immunizations, we will prevent outbreaks of infectious diseases and \nour kids will grow up stronger and healthier. And if we can prevent \nsomeone from getting diabetes they will be healthier than if we wait \nuntil they have it and then treat them for the rest of their lives.\n  Not only will people be healthier if we prevent disease but we will \nsave a lot of money too. That is why the health care law included the \nPrevention and Public Health Fund. The fund already is investing in \ncommunity-based programs such as the diabetes prevention program, a \nprogram that Dick Lugar and I fought to include in the health care law. \nThis program was pilot-tested by the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention in Saint Paul, MN, and in Indianapolis. It involves \nstructured nutrition classes for 16 weeks and 16 weeks of exercise at \ncommunity-based organizations such as the YMCA, with people who have \nprediabetes.\n  Guess what. The program, the diabetes prevention program, has been \nshown to reduce the likelihood that someone with prediabetes will be \ndiagnosed with full-blown type 2 diabetes by nearly 60 percent. Those \nare pretty good odds.\n  The program doesn't just make people healthier, it also saves \neveryone money. The diabetes prevention program, the program I just \ndescribed, costs about $300 per participant, as compared to treating \ntype 2 diabetes which costs more than $6,500 every single year.\n  That is why United Health, the largest private insurer in the \ncountry--that happens to also be headquartered in Minnesota--is already \nproviding the program to its beneficiaries. In fact, the CEO of United \nHealth told me that for every dollar they invest in the diabetes \nprevention program they save $4 in health care later on. The money in \nthe Prevention and Public Health Program in the affordable care act is \nthere to scale up this program around the country so everybody in the \ncountry, every person who has prediabetes, can have availability to it. \nIt can be available to them.\n  This homegrown program is exactly what the Prevention and Public \nHealth Fund was designed to support. It is not the only one like it. In \nMinnesota the fund has gone to support tobacco cessation programs. It \nhas helped prevent infectious diseases. It has expanded our desperately \nneeded primary care workforce. I think we can all agree these are \nworthwhile investments.\n  Unfortunately, many of my friends on the other side of the aisle are \ntrying to end this important work, calling the Prevention and Public \nHealth Fund a waste of money or worse. Last week, one of my colleagues \non the floor inaccurately claimed that ``a health clinic was using the \nfund to spay and neuter pets.''\n  Let me take this opportunity to set the record straight. That is not \ntrue. The Department of Health my friend accused of using prevention \nfunds to pay to spay pets has not and will not spend prevention fund \nmoney for this purpose. I ask that in these debates we confine \nourselves to facts.\n  This all comes down to priorities. My friends on the other side of \nthe aisle would rather cut the Prevention and Public Health fund than \nclose a tax loophole for wealthy Americans which serves absolutely no \npurpose. In fact, they would rather keep us from voting on a bill to \nease the burden of debt for students across the country than close this \nloophole. I hear them sometimes talking about closing loopholes so we \ncan bring the marginal rate down. If you cannot close this loophole \nwhich has no purpose, I don't see any loophole we can possibly agree to \nclose.\n\n  I ask my friends on both sides of the aisle one favor: Talk to your \nconstituents. Talk to the people who have been saved from the \naffliction of diabetes or who have quit smoking or who have\n\n[[Page S3269]]\n\nimmunized their children because of the Prevention and Public Health \nFund. Talk to your State and local departments of health which are \nworking to prevent outbreaks of the next dangerous strain of flu thanks \nto the infectious disease prevention fund. Stand with me in support of \nthe Prevention and Public Health Fund.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from \nMinnesota for his courtesy in allowing this time for me when I would \notherwise be presiding.\n  I wanted to respond to the remarks that preceded Senator Franken's \nremarks, remarks by Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma, suggesting that the \nmilitary's investment in green technologies was an unwelcome imposition \non them, and against their wishes, by outside political forces and on \nthe basis of outside political considerations.\n  I just held a hearing in the Environment and Public Works Committee \non the subject of our Defense Department's investment and interest in \nalternative technologies. We had witnesses from all of the services, \nand the testimony was pretty clear and diametrically opposed to the \npoint of view just expressed by the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  I can certainly appreciate the enthusiasm of my friend from Oklahoma \nfor fossil fuels since fossil fuels are a big home State industry in \nOklahoma. But the testimony at the hearing was that the military was \npursuing alternative fuels for reasons of its own, for reasons that \nrelated to protecting the troops, to be more efficient and to protect \nthe strategic posture of the United States around the world.\n  Perhaps the most striking testimony they gave was that over 3,000 \nAmerican soldiers gave their lives between 2003 and 2007 protecting our \nfuel convoys in Iraq. When we get in theater and we have a heavily \nfossil-fuel-based military presence, the price we pay for that is paid \nin the blood of soldiers who die protecting the fuel convoys--3,000 \nyoung men and women between 2003 and 2007. So to the extent we can do \nthings like the Cooley company in Rhode Island and invest in tents that \nhave their own solar capture built right into the fabric so that the \ncooling within the tent in the blazing heat of the Middle East can be \ndone without having to truck that fuel in and without having to cost \nthose soldiers their lives--that is not something that is being imposed \non the military; that is something they very much want to accomplish as \npart of their core mission.\n  In Newport, RI, the Naval War College has a facility, and they are \nbuilding wind turbines there. They are building wind turbines there \nbecause they have calculated that over time they will save money by \nputting up those wind turbines compared to buying electricity. It is \nnot an imposition from outside. It is not some green agenda coming from \nWashington or anyplace else. It is the Newport Naval Station saying we \nsave money for our budget by doing this. And when we save that money, \nwe can put it into these other uses such as fighter aircraft, tanks, \nbullets, bandages, and boots.\n  The third piece of testimony had to do with the strategic posture of \nthe country internationally, which is something the military is \nconcerned with in a very deep and profound way. They made a couple of \npoints.\n  The first was that the less dependent the United States is on the \ninternational oil market, the fewer vital interests we have to risk \nshedding our blood and spending our treasure to protect. So it is in \nour national strategic interest to get off of our fossil fuel \ndependency and into a broader portfolio of energy sources.\n  The second is the emerging dangers of climate change, in which we are \nimmersed all around us if we look at the obvious evidence in front of \nour faces, which creates profound risks for social and civil unrest and \nviolence in other parts of the world as things change, as estuaries \nflood and are no longer productive agriculturally, as relatively dry \nareas turn to desert and can no longer sustain life, as the great \nglaciers in the high mountains dissipate and change the flow patterns \nof rivers on which economic life for individuals depends.\n  All of those things create conflict and strife, and the American \nmilitary is aware that where there is conflict and strife abroad, very \noften they are called in, and they feel the responsibility to try to \navoid that.\n  I take time every week to speak a little bit about climate change for \na number of reasons. As I said, there are a lot of folks in Washington \nwho would like to ignore this issue and it is presently being ignored, \nwhich is unfortunate and, in fact, shameful. The messages about climate \nchange we are getting are coming through loudly and clearly and we \nignore them at our peril.\n  Every week for the past 15 months, as the Presiding Officer knows, I \nhave distributed in our weekly caucus an update on some of latest \nclimate science bulletins, the news that is fresh that week. This week \nthe stories are that the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric \nAdministration in the weather statistics for the month of April 2012 \nreported warmer-than-average temperatures engulfing much of the \ncontiguous United States during April with the nationally averaged \ntemperature at 55 degrees Fahrenheit, 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above \naverage and the third warmest on record.\n  Warmer-than-average temperatures were present for a large portion of \nthe Nation for April. Six States in the central United States and three \nStates in the Northeast had April temperatures ranking among their 10 \nwarmest in history.\n\n  Above-average temperatures were also present for the Southeast, upper \nMidwest, and much of the West. No State in the contiguous United States \nhad April temperatures that were below average.\n  April 2012 came on the heels of the warmest March on record for the \nlower 48. January to April 2012 was the warmest such period on record \nfor the contiguous United States with an average temperature of 45.5 \ndegrees Fahrenheit, 5.4 degrees above the long-term average. Twenty-six \nstates, all east of the Rockies, were record warm for the 4-month \nperiod, and an additional 17 States had temperatures for the period \namong their 10 warmest.\n  These rising temperatures can lead to a number of concerns. For \ninstance, snowpack, and thus drinking water, could be drastically \nreduced in California and surrounding western States. The Scripps \nInstitution of Oceanography presented a study to California's Energy \nCommission last month explaining that the warming of 1.5 to 3 degrees \nFahrenheit between now and midcentury will reduce today's snowpack by \none-third. By 2100, at those temperatures snowpacks would be reduced by \ntwo-thirds. That makes a big difference to the agricultural communities \nthat depend on that water downstream of those snowpacks.\n  Meanwhile, Science Daily reported yesterday that ozone and greenhouse \ngas pollution such as black carbon are expanding the tropics at a rate \nof .7 degrees per decade. Said the lead scientist, climatologist Robert \nJ. Allen, assistant professor at the University of California, \nRiverside:\n\n       If the tropics are moving poleward, then the subtropics \n     will become even drier . . . impacting regional agriculture, \n     economy, and society.\n\n  People are noticing the changes around them. Outside of the Halls of \nCongress--where we have blinders on to this obvious issue--regular \npeople see the changes, and they are concerned about them. The United \nStates Geological Survey recently polled more than 10,000 visitors to \nthe Nation's wildlife refuges, hunters, fishermen, and families alike, \nand found that 71 percent of those polled said they were ``personally \nconcerned'' about climate change's effects on fish, wildlife, and \nhabitats. Seventy-four percent said that working to limit climate \nchange's effects on fish, wildlife, and habitats would benefit future \ngenerations.\n  These special interests who deny that carbon pollution causes global \ntemperatures to increase--and who have such a profound and maligning \neffect in this Chamber--deny that melting icecaps will raise our seas \nto dangerous levels, denying that all of these visible changes are \ntaking place.\n  The myth that these special interests propagate in the face of so \nmuch evidence is that the jury is still out on climate change caused by \ncarbon pollution so we don't have to worry about it\n\n[[Page S3270]]\n\nor even take precautions. This is false. It is plain wrong.\n  Virtually all of our most prestigious scientific and academic \ninstitutions have stated that climate change is happening and that \nhuman activities are the driving cause of this change. They say it in \npowerful language, particularly for scientists who are specific about \nwhat they say and guarded in the way they say it.\n  The letter said:\n\n       Observations throughout the world make it clear that \n     climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research \n     demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human \n     activities are the primary driver. These conclusions are \n     based on multiple, independent lines of evidence--\n\n  And here is the final crescendo--\n\n     and contrary assertions are inconsistent with an objective \n     assessment of the vast body of peer-reviewed science.\n\n  That is an awfully nice way to say it, but in a nutshell they are \nsaying anybody who disagrees is making it up.\n  These are serious organizations: the American Association for the \nAdvancement of Science, the American Chemical Society, American \nGeophysical Union, American Meteorological Society, American Society of \nAgronomy, and on and on.\n  It is not just them. It is also the military services--as I mentioned \nat the beginning of my remarks--it is also the intelligence \norganizations of the country, it is also most of our electric \nutilities, many of our biggest capitalists and investors, and of course \nit is our insurance industry that has to pay for the damage that \nensues. A recent article said: The worldwide insurance is huge, three \ntimes bigger than the oil industry.\n  Right now these companies are running scared. Some are threatening to \ncancel coverage for homeowners within 2 miles of the coast where \nhurricanes are on the increase, and in drying areas of the West where \nwildfires have wreaked havoc. Marsh and McClennan, one of the largest \ninsurance brokers, called climate change ``one of the most significant \nemerging risks facing the world today,'' while insurance giant AIG has \nestablished an office of environment and climate change to assess the \nrisks to insure us in the years ahead. The industry's own scientists \nare predicting that things could get a lot worse in the years ahead.\n\n  I am indebted to the Presiding Officer, the junior Senator from \nMinnesota, for the following observation, which is that 97 percent of \nthe climate scientists who are most actively publishing accept that the \nverdict is in on carbon pollution causing climate and oceanic changes. \nThe example he and I have discussed--and I can't help, since he is \npresiding right now, referring to it again--we are being asked in this \nbody to ignore facts that 97 percent of scientists tell us are real. \nNow, translate that into our personal lives. What if a child of ours \nwas sick and we went to a doctor and said: Is there something I need to \ndo about it? Is there a treatment that is necessary? What is the deal \nhere? And we got an opinion, and then we said: I am going to be a \ncautious, prudent parent because a treatment might be expensive. I want \nto make sure I am going down the right path, so I am going to get a \nsecond opinion, and the parent gets a second opinion. Then the parent \ngot a third opinion. You are a really prudent parent, and you got a \nthird opinion. Let's say you kept going. You got a fourth opinion, a \nfifth, a 15th, a 45th, a 75th, a 95th--you got 100 opinions. People \nwould think that was a little odd, but never mind. And then let's say \nthat 87 percent of those professional opinions came back saying: Yes, \nyour child is ill and needs this treatment. Would you then responsibly \nsay: The jury is still out on the question of why my child is sick. \nLet's not take any action now. These 97 percent of the doctors might be \nalarmists. We don't really want to go there, and, after all, it will \ncost money to buy the medicine.\n  Would any responsible parent do that? No. It is a ludicrous \nproposition, and that is just how ludicrous the proposition is that \nclimate change is not real.\n  The underlying facts are ancient ones. The guy who discovered that \nclimate change is caused by the release of carbon dioxide into the \natmosphere, John Tyndall, discovered this in 1863, at the time of the \nCivil War, 150 years ago. This is not a novelty. This is old \nestablished science, and it has become clear since then that there is a \nchange that is happening.\n  We pump out 7 to 8 gigatons a year. A gigaton is a billion--not a \nmillion, a billion--metric tons. We pump out 7 to 8 billion metric tons \na year of carbon dioxide, and that adds to the carbon load in the \natmosphere. This isn't something that is a theory, it is something that \nis a measurement now.\n  For 8,000 centuries mankind has existed in an atmospheric bandwidth \nof 170 to 300 parts per million of carbon dioxide--170 to 300--for \n8,000 centuries, 800,000 years. We have been an agricultural species \nfor about 10,000 years, to give my colleagues an idea. For 800,000 \nyears we were picking things off of bushes. Our entire history as a \nspecies falls essentially in that 800,000 years. All of our development \nas a species has happened in the last probably 20,000 years. So it has \nbeen a long run in that safe bandwidth of 170 to 300 parts per million. \nWe have shot out of it. We are at 390 parts per million and climbing. \nThe record in history as to what happens on this planet when we spike \nout of that range is an ominous one. It is a bad trajectory. It takes \nus back to massive ocean die-offs that are in the geologic record. So \nthis is something we need to be very careful about and we need to take \naction.\n  The suggestion that it is not happening is false. The suggestion that \nwe can wait it out is imprudent, reckless, and ill-advised. And the \nnotion that our professional career military who have lost 3,000 men \nand women defending fuel convoys in Iraq are engaged in trying to get \noff fossil fuels because of some outside political agenda that they \ndon't share is a preposterous allegation to make about the men and \nwomen who run our military, who make these decisions for our military, \nand who are seeking to defend the soldiers out in the field against \nthese consequences.\n  With that, I yield the floor, once again thanking the distinguished \nPresiding Officer for allowing me this time, and I would have otherwise \nbeen sitting there and presiding. So with appreciation to Senator \nFranken, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Representation Fairness Restoration Act\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I apologize for keeping the Presiding \nOfficer and the rest of the staff here a little later than they might \nwant, but I have an important message that will be brief.\n  I introduced legislation not too long ago called the Representation \nFairness Restoration Act, S. 1843. It was a reaction to the NLRB's \ndecision in the specialty health care case, where a group of nurses \nwithin specialty health care asked for permission to unionize and \norganize within that unit. The NLRB granted that, and that became the \nfirst microunion that has ever existed in the United States of America.\n  Today it is my understanding that the NLRB has approved the \nfollowing: the second floor designer shoes department and the fifth \nfloor contemporary shoes department at Bergdorf Goodman in New York--\nthe two combined have 45 employees out of 370. They have granted them \nthe right to organize.\n  This is a gigantic leap that differs from 75 years of settled labor \nlaw. Microunions within any retail establishment, medical \nestablishment, or any other type of business prevents cross-training, \ncauses discord, and is a way to upset an organization that otherwise is \nnot upset.\n  Labor law in this country has been settled for a long time. Last year \n70 percent of all the union calls in the United States of America \npassed on their vote. There is not a problem with unions being able to \norganize. But there is a huge problem if we continue to tear down the \nfirewalls that have had the playing field level.\n  Just recently the courts have twice thrown out rulings of the \nNational Labor Relations Board--one on ambush elections where they \ntried to reduce the average period of time from 58 days\n\n[[Page S3271]]\n\nto 10, which is totally unrealistic, and, even more importantly, on the \nposting rule where the employers were asked to post proorganization \nposters within the break rooms in their companies. Both times the \ncourts threw them out and said the NLRB has reached too far.\n  It is my hope the same thing would happen here again. But in the \nmeantime, I want to encourage the Senate to allow us to bring S. 1843 \nto the floor and have this debate. In the free enterprise system, in \nthe tedious economy we have today in this country, the last thing we \nneed is to begin changing labor law and pitting organized labor against \nmanagement in an adversarial type of way.\n  This example at Bergdorf Goodman today is an example of the National \nLabor Relations Board doing in regulation what we ought to be doing in \nlegislation on the floor of the Senate. My biggest concern is that now \nit seems as if the administration's leadership in every Department has \ndetermined if we can circumvent the legislative body and through \nregulation do what we cannot do on the floor, we will forget about the \nHouse, we will forget about the Senate, and it will be the executive \nand judicial branches that run the United States of America. That is \nnot good for our country, and that is wrong.\n  So I am going to call on the Senate and ask our leadership to let us \nbring this bill to the floor, to let us debate it and see if we want to \nchange 75 settled years of labor law and unbalance the playing field \nbetween management and labor. I do not think we do.\n  I am sorry to rush to the floor after just hearing this information, \nbut I think it is so important we nip it in the bud; that we let the \nplaying field remain balanced, and we not turn over the operation of \nsettled labor law to an NLRB that, quite frankly, seems to have run \namok as far as I am concerned.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak and yield the \nfloor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/17/senate-section/article/S3271-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3271-S3272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the Pikeville \nMedical Center for its continued commitment to providing superior \nmedical care to the people of Kentucky. Pikeville Medical Center has \nbeen named National Hospital of the Year, making it the only repeat \nwinner of this prestigious award. The 261-room hospital has over 2,000 \nemployees, including more than 270 physicians and residents, and its \nsuperior facilities, equipment, and staff have drawn in qualified \nmedical professionals from around the country.\n  In January 2011, Pikeville Medical Center became affiliated with \nCleveland Clinic's Heart Surgery Program, which has been ranked number \none among heart programs in the United States for 16 years. This recent \naffiliation has allowed PMC to provide cutting-edge technology and \ntreatments to its patients.\n  Prior to receiving this award, Pikeville Medical Center was named \n12th in the Nation of Top 100 Best Places to Work by Modern Healthcare \nMagazine and first on the Best Places to Work in Kentucky list by the \nKentucky Chamber of Commerce. Individual units of the Medical Center \nhave also received recognition. The Heart Institute is one of the first \n10 hospitals in the United States and the first in Kentucky to reach \nthe highest distinction awarded by the Society of Chest Pain Centers, \nand the Stroke Center is one of 10 Kentucky recipients of the American \nHeart Association/American Stroke Association's Get with the \nGuidelines--Stroke Gold Plus Quality Achievement Award. Along with \nthis, the Leonard Lawson Cancer Center was awarded the ``Outstanding \nAchievement Award'' 2 years in a row.\n  While the Pikeville Medical Center has much to be proud of, it \ncontinues to strive for excellence. The hospital recently completed a \n$10-million emergency department expansion and renovation, and is \ncurrently undergoing a $100-million construction project to provide new \noffices and outpatient surgery units. This is all part of the \norganization's mission to ``provide quality regional health care in a \nChristian environment.''\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask at this time for my colleagues in \nthe Senate to join me in recognizing the Pikeville Medical Center. \nThere was recently an article published in eastern Kentucky's local \nperiodical magazine, the Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition, highlighting \nthe center's many successes. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record said article.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition, Nov. 2011]\n\n                        Pikeville Medical Center\n\n       Pikeville Medical Center, now affiliated with Cleveland \n     Clinic Heart Surgery, is the nation's only repeat winner of \n     the National Hospital of the Year. President and Chief \n     Executive Officer Walter E. May has always encouraged PMC \n     employees to dream big and big things will happen. After \n     winning the award, he aid, ``It doesn't get much bigger than \n     this. This is like winning the Super Bowl, the NCAA Final \n     Four or the World Series for a hospital.''\n       As a true leader and innovator in the health care industry, \n     Pikeville Medical Center continues to raise the bar of \n     excellence. Currently employing more than 2,000 people, PMC \n     has hired over 550 employees just during the past year. PMC \n     is a 261-bed facility, and a $100 million construction \n     project is under way, producing 1,500 temporary jobs and 100 \n     permanent jobs. The new medical office building will house \n     nine floors of office and clinical space for outpatient \n     surgery, exam rooms and primary and specialty care \n     physicians, and the enclosed parking garage will have space \n     for more than 1,000 cars.\n       The combination of first class facilities, the best \n     equipment available and a highly motivated support staff has \n     enabled Pikeville Medical Center to recruit some of the \n     nation's most qualified physicians. More than 270 \n     credentialed professionals--physicians and residents--are \n     authorized to practice medicine at Pikeville Medical Center, \n     and the number continues to grow. Over the past year we have \n     recruited over 30 physicians and added six new services. \n     Among the newer service lines are: gynecological oncology, \n     otolaryngology, rheumatology, pediatric endocrinology, hand \n     surgery and nephrology.\n\n\n                          The Heart Institute\n\n       According to the American Heart Association, heart disease \n     is the #1 killer of Americans, making heart health a top \n     priority for Pikeville Medical Center. In January 2011, \n     Walter E. May addressed a standing room only crowd during a \n     special called press conference and announced Pikeville \n     Medical Center is now affiliated with Cleveland Clinic's \n     Heart Surgery Program.\n       The Cleveland Clinic heart program has been ranked #1 in \n     the nation for the last 16 years by U.S. News and World \n     Report. The affiliation has enhanced PMC's opportunities to \n     provide new treatments and therapies to patients and has \n     accelerated Pikeville Medical and Cleveland Clinic's mutual \n     accomplishments in leading cardiac surgery care. Currently, \n     PMC staff is attending training at Cleveland Clinic and \n     enhancing their abilities to deal with complex medical \n     situations, while utilizing new technologies and innovations, \n     The two facilities are also sharing surgical outcome data and \n     research.\n       In addition to the affiliation with Cleveland Clinic's \n     heart surgery program, PMC continues to make great strides in \n     heart care:\n       One of the first 10 hospitals in the nation and the first \n     hospital in Kentucky to be designated a Level III Accredited \n     Chest Pain Center, the highest distinction given by the \n     Society of Chest Pain Centers\n       THe cath lab has celebrated the 10th anniversary of the \n     first cath procedure performed at PMC.\n       Median ``door-to-balloon'' time averages around 65 minutes \n     (well below the standard of 90 minutes set by the American \n     Heart Association and the Joint Commission).\n       The heart team is comprised of Cardiologists, \n     Interventional Cardiologists, Cardiothoracic and Vascular \n     Surgeons and an Electrophysiologist. PMC's Heart Institute \n     operates offices throughout the region in Pike, Mingo and \n     Johnson Counties.\n\n\n                             Stroke Center\n\n       Pikeville Medical Center has received the American Heart \n     Association/American Stroke Association's Get With The \n     Guidelines'-Stroke (GWTG-Stroke) Gold Plus Quality \n     Achievement Award. Only 10 hospitals in KY have earned this \n     accreditation, and no other KY hospital east of Lexington has \n     earned this prestigious distinction.\n       The award recognizes PMC's commitment and success in \n     implementing excellent care\n\n[[Page S3272]]\n\n     for stroke patients, according to evidence-based guidelines. \n     To receive the award, PMC achieved 85 percent or higher \n     adherence to all GWTG-Stroke Quality Achievement indicators \n     for two or more consecutive 12-month intervals and achieved \n     75 percent or higher compliance with six of 10 GWTG-Stroke \n     Quality Measures, which are reporting initiatives to measure \n     quality of care.\n       ``With a stroke, time lost is brain lost, and the Get With \n     the Guidelines-Stroke Gold Plus Quality Achievement Award \n     demonstrates PMC's commitment to being one of the top \n     hospitals in the country for providing aggressive, proven \n     stroke care,'' said Dr. Naveed Ahmed, Medical Director of \n     Pikeville Medical Center's Stroke Unit. ``We will continue to \n     provide care shown in scientific literature to quickly and \n     efficiently treat stroke patients with evidence-based \n     protocols.''\n\n\n                      Leonard Lawson Cancer Center\n\n       Once again, Pikeville Medical Center's Leonard Lawson \n     Cancer Center received the ``Outstanding Achievement Award'' \n     from the Commission on Cancer of the American College of \n     Surgeons. PMC is one of only three hospitals in the state of \n     Kentucky to ever achieve this award, and is the only hospital \n     in Kentucky to be honored twice and consecutively.\n       PMC has been recognized by the Commission on Cancer of the \n     American College of Surgeons for offering: The full scope of \n     multi-disciplinary services required to screen, diagnose, \n     treat, rehabilitate and support patients with cancer and \n     their families; A high quality, comprehensive team approach \n     by cancer care professionals; Complete range of state-of-the \n     art services and equipment; Access to information about new \n     treatment options and ongoing cancer trials; Access to \n     prevention and early detection programs, cancer education and \n     supportive services.\n       The cancer center has also instituted program enhancements \n     and improvements including opening a new Paintsville Oncology \n     Clinic, offering genetics counseling and opening a \n     gynecological oncology service.\n       ``The Cancer Center at Pikeville Medical Center is not just \n     a group of employees, they are a team. They continually \n     strive to provide excellent quality care. One of their goals \n     is to provide a special kind of friendship along the way. A \n     friendship that starts with a disease as serious and \n     devastating as cancer and evolves, during their time at PMC, \n     into a special relationship we refer to as the PMC family,'' \n     said Roxanne Hale. Director of the Cancer Center.\n\n\n                          Emergency Department\n\n       In preparation for achieving Level II Trauma Center \n     certification, Pikeville Medical Center has completed a $10 \n     million emergency department expansion and renovation. This \n     new facility encompasses nearly 23,000 square feet, includes \n     two trauma bays, three triage bays, provides physiological \n     monitoring and a 32\u007f\u007f flat screen tv in every room and has CT \n     scanning and digital x-ray on-site.\n       Over the past year, PMC's ED patient satisfaction scores \n     have reached nearly 100%, and while the new facility is \n     impressive, it's PMC's employees who make this recognition \n     possible.\n\n\n                  The Journey of Excellence Continues\n\n       Pikeville Medical Center's employees are guided by the \n     mission statement ``to provide quality regional health care \n     in a Christian environment.'' ``This is more than just a \n     slogan,'' said Chief Operating Officer Juanita Deskins, ``it \n     is a prescription for the work lives of our employees.'' It \n     is primarily because of this work ethic that PMC regularly \n     receives recognition and awards, such as: 12th in the nation \n     of the top 100 Best Places to Work by Modern Healthcare \n     Magazine (the second year in a row PMC made the top 100 \n     list); the number one hospital in the state on the Best \n     Places to Work in Kentucky list, compiled by the KY Chamber \n     of Commerce; three employed physicians listed among the \n     nation's Best Doctors; for the third consecutive year PMC' \n     has been selected as a Hospital of Choice; Patient \n     Satisfaction Award from the Pike County School District \n     Superintendent; the prestigious Excellence Award from the \n     Kentucky Center for Performance Excellence, following the \n     strict criteria set forth by the nationally-acclaimed Malcolm \n     Baldrige Award; the Insight Award fur outstanding service in \n     Inpatient Oncology and Inpatient Rehabilitation; the gold \n     seal of approval from the Joint Commission for Primary Stroke \n     Centers.\n       While those accolades are impressive, Pikeville Medical \n     Center will not rest on its laurels. There is always room for \n     improvement and our institutional vision has not yet been \n     fully realized--our journey is not over.\n       Pikeville Medical Center will continue to improve and grow, \n     and will always pursue excellence. Technology will evolve and \n     we will continue to recruit the country's best doctors and \n     add specialty services to assure the best health care \n     possible for our patients. In the words of Walter E. May, \n     ``We aren't trying to provide health care that's `as good as' \n     anyplace else . . . we're working to provide health care \n     that's better than these patients could get anywhere else. At \n     Pikeville Medical Center, we're proud to say . . . we're \n     still the one!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/17/senate-section/article/S3272-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3272-S3273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT\n\n\n                          Transportation Costs\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask permission to engage in a colloquy \nwith the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy. I would like to address a \nproblem that affects many women who are victims of domestic violence. \nWe have addressed a variety of important concerns with the Senate's \nrecent passage of the Violence Against Women Act, and I hope the House \nwill promptly pass that important, bipartisan bill. A major barrier for \nwomen seeking services in New Hampshire and across the country is lack \nof transportation. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee and author of \nthe Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, you may have \nencountered this issue also.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for bringing \nattention to this important issue and for all her hard work addressing \nissues of domestic and sexual violence. As a Senator and a prosecutor, \nI have found that transportation is a particular problem for victims of \ndomestic and sexual violence who live in rural areas.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. You know well the issues facing rural communities in \nVermont, as I do in New Hampshire. Domestic violence occurs as \nfrequently in rural areas as it does in cities, and many women in rural \nsettings do not have access to a car or public transportation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. This presents a real safety risk for women.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. It does. When you are a woman in a violent situation, \nnot having access to transportation is more than an inconvenience, it \ncan be life threatening. One woman in Atkinson, NH, called the local \ncrisis center for transportation because her husband would not let her \nhave access to the car keys and controlled the family's finances \nentirely. She was simply trapped.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would you agree that the availability of transportation is \ncritical to making sure all women have access to the services provided \nby crisis centers, shelters, and other service providers?\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Yes, that is exactly right. The Violence Against Women \nAct provides support for important services like medical treatment, \ncounseling, shelter, and legal assistance to seek protective orders. \nClearly women need to be able to get to these centers in order to take \nadvantage of these important resources.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Have you found that transportation is something that \ncrisis centers are currently able to provide?\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Many crisis centers that receive grants from VAWA do \nuse their general funds to assist women with transportation costs who \ncould not otherwise afford them. I believe that is a use of funds \nconsistent with the intent of Congress to expand services to all women \nand families who are victims of domestic violence. Do you agree?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree that helping women access these services is \nabsolutely consistent with the intent of the Violence Against Women \nAct.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. And I thank the Senator for including language in the \nreauthorization of VAWA recently passed by the Senate that further \nclarifies that transportation services are an acceptable use of VAWA \nfunds. The bill adds language in the new victim services definition in \nsection 3 to include ``other related supportive services'' and in \nsection 102(a) adds ``other victim services'' to the victim services \npurpose area in the grants to encourage arrest policies and enforcement \nof protection orders. Both of these changes would provide even more \nability than under current law for VAWA grants to cover crucial \ntransportation services.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree that this language is intended to cover a variety \nof crucial victim services including transportation services.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I also appreciate the bill's new language emphasizing \nthe importance of providing services to women in rural or \ngeographically isolated areas. Identifying this particularly vulnerable \npopulation will be helpful for those centers which focus services on \nwomen and families in these isolated areas. I believe this provision \nmakes clear the intent of Congress to supplement the costs of reaching \nthese women and bringing them to safety.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree that is one of the intents of section 202, which \nfocuses on enforcement of domestic violence,\n\n[[Page S3273]]\n\nstalking and child abuse laws for victims and families in rural areas. \nTransportation is a necessary component of enforcing these laws and \nprotecting vulnerable women. I am concerned, as I know you are, about \nwhat women do when they are in a dangerous situation and do not have \ntransportation to get away.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. That is a real problem. Many women initially rely on \nthe police or an ambulance to remove them from unsafe situations, but \ntheir problems continue once they reach a shelter or crisis center. \nThey have no way to get to court for hearings related to protective \norders, child custody and divorce. One of the directors of the crisis \ncenter in Berlin in the North Country of New Hampshire spends at least \n25 percent of her time taking women to and from court. Due to recent \nState budget cuts, the closest courthouse is 45 minutes away. That is a \nsignificant investment of time and money.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It certainly is. And the Violence Against Women Act aims \nto provide financial support for communities that need it most so they \ncan continue to keep women safe.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I thank the Senator from Vermont for engaging in this \ncolloquy to address the importance of providing transportation services \nto women and families in need. I thank him, too, for his leadership on \nthe reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. It has helped so \nmany women over the years, and I know it will continue to save the \nlives of women in New Hampshire and across the county.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/17/senate-section/article/S3273-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FACEBOOK'S TAX DEDUCTION\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, tomorrow will be a day in tax history--when \nFacebook goes public, it will get a $16 billion tax deduction, which is \nthe largest tax deduction ever taken by any corporation exploiting the \nstock option tax loophole.\n  Facebook's recent filings in anticipation of its upcoming stock \noffering provide new facts about its plans to use stock option tax \ndeductions, not only to help it avoid future taxes for years and years \nto come, but to get a refund of taxes it has already paid.\n  Facebook's recent registration statement shows that, due to hundreds \nof millions of stock options handed out to its founders and top \nexecutives, it plans to claim stock option tax deductions worth a \nwhopping $16 billion. That is more than twice as much as estimates a \nfew months ago, and many, many times larger than the stock option \nexpenses shown on Facebook's ledgers.\n  Facebook is a booming, successful company. Its securities filing \nboasts of double-digit increases in Facebook's average revenue per \nuser, citing a 32-percent increase in 2010 and another 25-percent \nincrease in 2011, with ``growth across all regions.'' Despite \ntrumpeting those revenue increases to investors, Facebook is planning \nat the same time to tell Uncle Sam it has no taxable income, offsetting \nits revenues with stock option tax deductions.\n  Facebook's $16 billion stock option tax deduction is so huge, it will \nenable Facebook to claim a $500 million refund of taxes paid over the \nprior 2 years and wipe out this year's tax bill. The company says it \nwill also use its deduction to create a ``net operating loss'' that can \nbe used to eliminate its profits and its taxes for up to 20 years into \nthe future.\n  As with so much of our Tax Code, it is not the law breaking that \nshocks the conscience, it is the stuff that is allowed. For years, my \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations has identified this stock \noption tax loophole and tried to explain its cost, its unfairness, and \nwhy the loophole should be closed. Facebook's $16 billion tax deduction \nbrings the issue into sharp focus.\n  This profitable corporation will stop paying any Federal corporate \nincome taxes, simply because it gave hundreds of millions of stock \noptions to its executives. It will go from a corporate citizen that \npaid its taxes, to one that not only pays no taxes to Uncle Sam on its \nprofits, but gets a tax refund.\n  Some Facebook defenders claim the company's nonpayment of taxes is \noffset by the taxes paid by its executives. But first of all, Facebook \ndemands and receives government services that its executives don't--\nfrom patent protection to cybersecurity to trade enforcement. Second, \nthe fact that executives pay taxes doesn't mean corporations shouldn't \npay taxes. Facebook should be paying its fair share, and it is only \nthrough a tax loophole that it won't be. Adding insult to injury is \nthat one of its founders recently renounced his U.S. citizenship just \nto avoid paying his taxes.\n  Facebook is an American success story. Its ability to use a stock \noption loophole to zero out its U.S. tax bill, despite ample profits, \nmakes no sense. It also isn't fair to the rest of American taxpayers \nwho will have to pay more because Facebook pays nothing.\n  In these tough economic times, Congress needs to make choices about \nwhere to spend taxpayer dollars. The stock option tax deduction, as \ndemonstrated by Facebook, fuels excessive executive pay, shifts the tax \nburden from corporations to other taxpayers, and enables profitable \ncorporations to get out of paying a dime toward the country that helped \nmake their success possible.\n  What could our Nation do with the billions of dollars it will lose \nwhen Facebook uses the stock option loophole? Well, we could reduce the \nFederal deficit. Or we could pay for programs to help kids go to \ncollege or programs that protect our seniors and veterans, put cops on \nthe beat or teachers in classrooms.\n  The stock option loophole should have been closed long before \nFacebook's stock option bonanza. But surely the case of Facebook \nillustrates to the Senate, to the Congress, and to the American people \nwhy we should close this loophole. If Congress were to enact the Levin-\nSherrod Brown bill, S. 1375, it would close an unjustified corporate \ntax loophole that boosts executive pay at the expense of everybody \nelse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/17/senate-section/article/S3273-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3273-S3274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       150TH ANNIVERSARY OF USDA\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the 150th \nanniversary of the Department of Agriculture.\n  I believe Thomas Jefferson said it best in a letter to George \nWashington in 1787. Jefferson wrote: ``Agriculture is our wisest \npursuit, because it will in the end contribute most to real wealth, \ngood morals, and happiness.''\n  In 1862, the 37th Congress and President Lincoln established the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, and 150 years later, agriculture is still a \npillar of the American economy.\n  From wheat fields in Montana, to dairy farms in Wisconsin, to grocery \nstores in New York City, 1 in 12 jobs is linked to agriculture and \nforestry. In Montana it is one in five for agriculture alone.\n  Agriculture is one of the few U.S. business sectors to boast a trade \nsurplus of $34 billion last year.\n  Because of our Federal farm policies, Americans have access to the \nsafest and most affordable food in the world. Americans spend less than \n7 percent of their disposable income to feed their families, compared \nwith almost 25 percent in 1930 or as high as 28 percent in Russia \ntoday.\n  The farm bill, which is set to expire this September, provides a \nresponsible risk management system that ensures American farmers and \nranchers can keep putting food on our tables even in times of drought, \nflooding, and other disaster. It provides conservation tools to protect \nthe land we love and depend on for generations to come. It focuses \nresources to help beginning farmers and ranchers get their foot in the \ndoor, promotes U.S. products overseas, invests in research, and helps \nstruggling families put food on the table.\n  Last month, the Senate Agriculture Committee passed the Agriculture \nReform, Food and Jobs Act of 2012 with a bipartisan vote of 16 to 5.\n  I want to underscore the word ``reform.'' Times are tough. We cannot \nafford business as usual anymore.\n  After spending the last year talking directly with Montana farmers \nand ranchers about their priorities, I can tell you no one understands \nthis better than they do.\n  So the Senate Agriculture Committee worked directly with producers to \nstrengthen what works and cut out what doesn't. Together we came up \nwith a responsible plan to cut spending by $23 billion while still \nproviding a strong risk management program for farmers and ranchers. \nThat is right,\n\n[[Page S3274]]\n\nthe Senate Agriculture Committee's farm bill reduces the deficit by $23 \nbillion. It eliminates more than 100 duplicative programs to make \ngovernment leaner and more effective. It strengthens accountability to \nmake sure we are giving a hand up where it is most needed and not \nwasting taxpayer dollars where it's not. And, perhaps most importantly, \nthis farm bill supports more than 16 million American jobs. That is why \nI led a letter to leadership with 43 of my colleagues this week urging \nquick action. Moving this farm bill is the right thing to do for our \nfarmers and ranchers, the right thing to do for American taxpayers, and \nthe right thing to do for jobs.\n  So as we say happy birthday to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, I \nthink the best gift Congress could give is passing the farm bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/17/senate-section/article/S3274-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IMPORTANCE OF SENATE BIPARTISANSHIP\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, over this past weekend, while reading the \nNews Journal, Delaware's only statewide newspaper, I came across a \ncolumn written by my good friend and our former colleague, Ted Kaufman. \nHe was writing about an issue that is troubling to me and to many of \nour colleagues--the narrowing scope of bipartisanship in the U.S. \nSenate today.\n  As you know, Mr. President, our longtime colleague Senator Richard \nLugar faced a difficult primary contest last week in Indiana. While he \nput up a good fight, he ultimately lost the primary to someone who \nopenly espouses an aversion to bipartisanship. In recent days a number \nof our colleagues, including Senators Durbin and Kerry, have stood in \nthis Chamber to lament the parting of Senator Lugar. Like them, I, too, \nam disappointed that Senator Lugar will not be part of the Senate in \nthe future.\n  Though I haven't always agreed with him on every issue, Senator Lugar \nhas been and remains a deeply respected colleague and statesman. He \nunderstands that national unity and patriotism should always trump \npartisan bickering, and he believes that working with colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle is critically important for the welfare of our \ncountry.\n  In his article last weekend, Ted Kaufman wrote, ``If candidates like \nMike Castle and Richard Lugar are defeated because they are willing to \nconsider bipartisan solutions, the gridlock can only get worse.'' I \ncouldn't have said it better myself. Dick Lugar is the type of Senator \nwe need more of, not less of. With his departure, the Senate will lose \nsomeone who was willing to put progress ahead of party and willing to \nfavor compromise over conflict.\n  Senator Lugar, as mayor of Indianapolis and as Senator from Indiana, \nyou have served your State and your country with distinction. I have no \ndoubt that as this Congress and your time in the Senate come to a close \nlater this year, you will choose to finish strong. I expect that as you \ndo, my colleagues and I will have the opportunity to work with you, in \na bipartisan way, on a number of critically important issues for our \ncountry. There will be much work to do, together.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe text of Senator Kaufman's article as a testament to the importance \nof bipartisan cooperation in the Senate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the News Journal, May 12, 2012]\n\n          Lugar Proved `Bipartisanship' Serves Principles Well\n\n                            (By Ted Kaufman)\n\n       I have spent the last 40 years of my life working in and \n     teaching about the U.S. Senate. Right after then-Senator \n     Biden and I came to Washington, he told me something I have \n     always kept in mind when dealing with its members. ``There is \n     a reason the citizens of each state picked each individual \n     senator,'' Senator Biden said, ``and it is worth looking for \n     what that is.''\n       The Senate has always been a partisan place. The arguments \n     are fierce. Strongly held beliefs collide. No matter how much \n     I disagreed with the positions taken by senators on the other \n     side of the aisle, I could respect and even admire nearly all \n     of them.\n       One of the senators I disagreed with on many issues but \n     came to greatly admire was Richard Lugar. Last week, in the \n     Indiana Republican primary, he lost his bid for a sixth term. \n     He will be sorely missed in the next Senate.\n       For many years, I watched as he and Senator Biden passed \n     the gavel back and forth on the Foreign Relations Committee, \n     where they traded positions as chair or ranking member. As \n     partisan a conservative Republican as he was on most domestic \n     issues, Senator Lugar deeply believed in the approach to \n     foreign policy articulated in the early 1940s by Michigan's \n     Republican Sen. Arthur Vandenberg: ``To me, bipartisan \n     foreign policy' means a mutual effort, under our \n     indispensable, two-party system, to unite our official voice \n     at the water's edge so that America speaks with one voice to \n     those who would divide and conquer us and the free world.''\n       Throughout his Senate career, Senator Lugar was a driving \n     force in maintaining this approach to foreign policy. He did \n     not grandstand. In his quiet, intelligent way, he became one \n     of our most knowledgeable experts on an issue that wins few \n     votes but is literally a matter of life-and-death for the \n     planet--nuclear proliferation.\n       Perhaps his greatest accomplishment was the joint effort \n     with former Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn that established the \n     Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, which provides U.S. \n     funding and expertise to help former Soviet countries \n     safeguard and dismantle their nuclear and chemical arsenals. \n     The program has deactivated thousands of nuclear warheads, \n     chemical weapons, and their delivery systems. It has \n     eliminated all the nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, \n     and Belarus. Senator Lugar, as much as any single person \n     alive, is responsible for greatly reducing the threat of \n     nuclear proliferation into the terrorist world.\n       There were many reasons why Senator Lugar lost his bid for \n     re-nomination. But among the criticisms raised against him by \n     his opponent was that he supported the Strategic Arms \n     Reduction Treaty. It is hard to understand how this vote \n     could be characterized as anti-Republican when Lugar was \n     joined in his support of START by the Secretaries of State \n     for the last five Republican Presidents.\n       I smile when I see Senator Lugar being portrayed in the \n     media as a ``moderate.'' His voting record on domestic issues \n     has been consistently conservative. The American Conservative \n     Union gives him a 77 percent lifetime rating. But that, it \n     seems, is not conservative enough. His victorious opponent, \n     Richard Mourdock, ran a campaign that was openly dismissive \n     of any kind of bipartisanship. Right after Mourdock won the \n     nomination, he explained, ``I have a mindset that says \n     bipartisanship ought to consist of Democrats coming to the \n     Republican point of view.''\n       Wherever I go, the most common thread in talks I have with \n     many different groups of people is their frustration with the \n     lack of compromise and gridlock in Washington. If candidates \n     like Mike Castle and Richard Lugar are defeated because they \n     are willing to consider bipartisan solutions, the gridlock \n     can only get worse.\n       I could not agree more with what Senator Lugar said in his \n     typically thoughtful concession speech: ``Bipartisanship is \n     not the opposite of principle. One can be very conservative \n     or very liberal and still have a bipartisan mindset. Such a \n     mindset acknowledges that the other party is also patriotic \n     and may have some good ideas. It acknowledges that national \n     unity is important, and that aggressive partisanship deepens \n     cynicism, sharpens political vendettas, and depletes the \n     national reserve of goodwill that is critical to our survival \n     in hard times.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/17/senate-section/article/S3274-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3274-S3275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INTERNATIONAL FOOD SECURITY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my enthusiastic \nsupport for our efforts to elevate international food security \ncommitments through the G8, which is being held this weekend in \nMaryland.\n  I understand that President Obama has invited the Presidents of \nBenin, Ghana, Ethiopia, and Tanzania to participate in the summit and \nstrategize on ways in which we can all work together to accelerate \nprogress on food security. With over 1 billion poor and hungry people \naround the world, there is no time to wait.\n  Just 3 years ago, in L-Aquila, Italy, G8 leaders committed to support \ndeveloping-country plans for agriculture to the tune of $7 billion a \nyear over 3 years. African governments also committed to allocating 10 \npercent of their budgets to support agriculture, because they recognize \nthat three-fourths of Africans make a living from agriculture.\n  This week we expect the G8 leaders to focus on private sector \ninvestment, donor coordination, innovation, and partnership. I see this \nas a natural next step in which we strive to amplify the truly historic \ncommitments that we have made to ending world hunger.\n  As Secretary Clinton said in 2009, ``We have the resources to give \nevery person in the world the tools they need to feed themselves and \ntheir children. So the question is not whether we can end hunger. It's \nwhether we will.''\n  We must harness the good will of the private sector, do a better job \nof coordinating among ourselves in the\n\n[[Page S3275]]\n\ndonor community, and show the American people that we are doing \ndevelopment better. With such a limited foreign assistance budget, \ngetting the most out of every dollar that we spend is vital if we are \ngoing to beat global hunger and human suffering.\n  To that end, I am very pleased that the U.S. will be following up on \nnot only what the members of the G8 committed but what they actually \ndelivered. In order for our new food security initiative to succeed, \nall pledges must have clear accountability mechanisms.\n  I believe that our own Feed the Future Program, our global hunger and \nfood security initiative, does just that. Feed the Future focuses on \nsmall farmers, particularly women. It helps countries to develop their \nagriculture sectors to generate opportunities for broad-based economic \ngrowth and trade, which in turn support increased incomes and help \nreduce hunger. It is strengthening strategic coordination to align the \nefforts of the private sector, civil society, and multilateral \ninstitutions. And it is delivering on sustained and accountable \ncommitments through robust monitoring and evaluation systems. I look \nforward to hearing more about the Feed the Future success stories in \nthe months to come, as USAID officials develop and release their \naccountability reports.\n  There are a few other elements of the program that I would just like \nto underscore as someone who cares very deeply about the status of \nwomen. First, Feed the Future developed and launched the Women's \nEmpowerment in Agriculture Index, a research method which measures the \nquantity and quality of gender integrated programs. This is essential \nis we are to continue designing better development programs.\n  Second, Feed the Future has launched a fund to advance innovative \napproaches to promote gender equality in agriculture and land use and \nintegrate gender effectively into agricultural development and food \nsecurity programs. And third, Feed the Future has harnessed the \ncapabilities of other U.S. Government partners such as the Department \nof Agriculture to develop science-based solutions to many of the \nproblems faced by women farmers.\n  Feed the Future is already working with the private sector in Africa; \njust recently USAID announced a unique trilateral partnership between \nPepsiCo, USAID, and the World Food Program. Through this partnership \nthey will provide a nutritionally fortified feeding product while \nhelping to build long-term economic stability for smallholder chickpea \nfarmers in Ethiopia by involving them directly in PepsiCo's product \nsupply chain.\n  Ending global hunger is a monumental task. But when the leaders of \nFrance, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, Canada, Russia, and \nthe United States join together with our African partners and the most \npowerful private sector and civil society organizations in the world, I \nbelieve it is one that we can achieve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/17/senate-section/article/S3275-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        BUDGET RESOLUTION VOTES\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Today I wish to discuss a series of votes we took \nyesterday on five different budget resolutions offered by my \ncolleagues.\n  I ultimately voted against the budget resolutions offered by my \ncolleagues because they were simply not in line with what I believe our \npriorities for this country should be.\n  Like my colleagues, I am very concerned about our long-term fiscal \nsituation. That is why last year I helped pass the Budget Control Act \nof 2011. This legislation caps spending levels for 2012 and will reduce \nour deficit by at least $2.1 trillion over the next 10 years.\n  In many ways, the Budget Control Act is even more extensive than a \ntraditional congressional budget resolution. Unlike a budget resolution \nthat is not signed by the President, the Budget Control Act has the \nforce of law. It also set discretionary caps for 10 years, instead of \nthe 1 year normally set in a budget resolution.\n  Believing we should go further, I also voted for a constitutional \nbalanced budget amendment offered by Senator Udall of Colorado and \ncosponsored bipartisan legislation to give the President line-item veto \nauthority to go after wasteful spending.\n  The key difference between the Budget Control Act and the budget \nresolutions that were offered yesterday is that the Budget Control Act \ndid not achieve its savings on the backs of the middle class while at \nthe same time giving more tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans.\n  In 2010, I worked with 14 Senators to block a statutory increase of \nour national debt limit until the Senate agreed to set up the \nbipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility. While I do not \nagree with every single recommendation included in the final report, I \nhave made clear through my support for the bipartisan efforts in the \nSenate to advance this framework and I believe it provides a good \nstarting point for the work we must do to reduce our debt.\n  This framework would put in place a long-term plan to responsibly \nreduce the deficit by achieving at least $4 trillion in debt reduction \nthrough a balance of revenue and spending cuts. This is the balanced \napproach I hear Minnesotans asking for every day, and it is the \napproach I will continue to insist we take.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/17/senate-section/article/S3275-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                             2012 TOP COPS\n\n Mr. HELLER.

Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department \nofficers John Abel, Michael Ramirez, Corey Staheli, Beaumont Hopson, \nand David Williams' overwhelming courage in the line of duty epitomizes \nthe best of what America's police officers have to offer. I am honored \nto recognize this group of Nevadans whose efforts to go above and \nbeyond their oath to serve is a testament to the strength of our law \nenforcement community.\n  This year marks NAPO's 19th annual TOP COPS Awards ceremony to honor \nmembers of the law enforcement community for their heroic actions. I \nstand with NAPO in their dedication to raising public awareness \nconcerning the contributions made by our law enforcement officers to \nthe welfare of our communities. Officer Ramirez literally stood in the \nline of fire to protect shoppers at a Las Vegas WalMart while \nattempting to apprehend a criminal. His colleagues bravely answered the \ncall to duty and fatally shot the assailant after he shot Officer \nRamirez several times in the arm and once in the chest. Fortunately, \nOfficer Ramirez's bulletproof vest, along with the bravery displayed by \nhis colleagues, saved his life. I am so honored to acknowledge these \nexceptional individuals who are being recognized for their commitment \nto the safety, protection, and well-being of the people and community \nof Las Vegas.\n  It is a privilege to recognize our law enforcement officers who put \ntheir lives on the line for our protection every day.

MAGUIRE\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe remarks of Representative Ralph Hall be printed in the Record on \nthe tenacity of Cary M. Maguire, founder, Chair and President of the \nDallas-based Mcguire Oil Company and Maguire Energy Company.\n  The remarks follow.\n\n       Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Cary \n     M. Maguire, a fellow Texan who exemplifies fortitude, \n     American entrepreneurship, and community service.\n       Over the past twenty years, Cary's strength of character \n     was tested and proven as he fought for justice in a property \n     rights dispute against the Houston, Texas city government. \n     Despite being dealt a bad hand, court after court, Cary never \n     surrendered. He showed courage and faith that justice would \n     prevail, and his perseverance was ultimately rewarded.\n       Cary is the founder, Chair, and President of the Dallas-\n     based Maguire Oil Company\n\n[[Page S3276]]\n\n     and Maguire Energy Company. In 1991, Cary's company was given \n     a permit by the city of Houston to drill near the banks of \n     Lake Houston. However, when his crew began the project a city \n     officer patrolling the area stopped the team, citing a city \n     ordinance that prohibited drilling within 1,000 feet of the \n     shore. The city revoked Maguire Oil's permit, and a lengthy \n     court battle began.\n       The case was shuffled around for fourteen years as courts \n     argued over jurisdiction and how to proceed. In 2009, a \n     Harris County court-at-law awarded Maguire $2 million in \n     damages, plus $2.2 million in interest. The City appealed \n     this ruling before agreeing on a settlement, settling a \n     lawsuit that spanned two trials, four appeals and the \n     administrations of four mayors.\n       While acknowledging that the amount spent in legal fees \n     exceeded the amount of the settlement, Cary stated that he \n     continued the case because he thought it was important to \n     defend the principle that while government has the right to \n     take property for the public good, it does not have the right \n     to do so without compensating the property owner.\n       Cary proceeded to donate the settlement money to found the \n     Center for Ethics and Public Responsibility that bears his \n     name at Southern Methodist University (SMU) in Dallas, Texas, \n     where he serves as Trustee Emeritus in recognition for his \n     outstanding service to the University as a member of the \n     Board of Trustees from 1976 to 2000.\n       In addition to his founding grant to create the Maguire \n     Center for Ethics and Public Responsibility, Cary also \n     endowed a university-wide professorship in ethics at SMU. He \n     has provided additional funds for programs and facilities in \n     SMU's Edwin L. Cox School of Business, including the Maguire \n     Energy Institute, the Maguire Chair in oil and gas \n     management, and the Maguire Building housing undergraduate \n     programs in the Cox School.\n       In 1995 he and his wife, Ann, were among the first \n     recipients of SMU's Mustang Award honoring individuals whose \n     longtime service and philanthropy have had a lasting impact \n     on the University.\n       His national leadership positions include service on The \n     National Petroleum Council, the Executive Committee of Mid-\n     Continental Oil and Gas Association, and membership of the \n     Madison Council of the Library of Congress, where he funded \n     the Maguire Chair in Ethics and American History.\n       Mr. Speaker, Cary Maguire's professional and philanthropic \n     contributions will have a lasting value not only in the great \n     State of Texas, but our nation. He embodies many outstanding \n     qualities that define the American spirit. As we adjourn the \n     House of Representatives today, let us do so in appreciation \n     of this American leader, Mr. Cary Maguire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/17/senate-section/article/S3276-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO CHARLIE EARL\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Charlie \nEarl for his exemplary record of public service to the Washington State \nBoard for Community and Technical Colleges and the people of Washington \nState.\n  Charlie Earl will retire on July 31, 2012, after more than 40 years \nof public service in the State's higher education system and a variety \nof government positions. He most recently served for 6 years as the \nexecutive director of the Washington State Board for Community and \nTechnical Colleges and 7 years as president of Everett Community \nCollege. As the executive director, Charlie worked to increase public \naccess to higher education while enhancing the quality of Washington \nState's career and technical education system. All the while, the past \nseveral years have seen the most difficult economic environment in \nWashington State's recent history. As our State budget tightened, \nspending on our community colleges decreased by 22 percent, but this \ndid not stop Charlie from developing a vision for the State and leading \ntoward it with energy, passion, and commitment.\n  While Charlie served as executive director, he propelled Washington's \ncommunity and technical colleges to be among the most innovative in the \ncountry. Charlie's leadership supported the development and expansion \nof the Washington State student achievement performance award, \nopportunity grants, 4-year applied baccalaureate degrees, an open \ncourse library, and the Integrated Basic Education and Skills Training, \nI-BEST, Program. These changes allowed for many students to return to \nschool to earn their diploma or certificate or learn new skills \nrequired of the 21st century workforce. The I-BEST Program challenges \nthe traditional notion that students must complete all basic education \nbefore they can begin postsecondary education or training. This model \nallowed students to move through school, earn degrees, and join the \nskilled workforce faster and with less cost to the student, State, and \nFederal Government. I am not alone in seeing this as a revolutionary \nmodel in adult education. In 2011, the I-BEST Program was named a \n``Bright Idea'' by Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government and \nis being replicated in 20 other States. All of this would not have been \npossible if not for Charlie's leadership, advocacy, and stewardship of \nthe Washington State Board for Community and Technical Education and \nits staff.\n  During Charlie's tenure, enrollment increased at Washington's 34 \ncolleges by 80,000 students. This was clearly no small feat. Washington \nState has also seen the largest increase in certificates and degrees \nsince the community and technical college system began tracking this \nstatistic. This was achieved not simply because more students are \nenrolling in career and technical education but because more students \nare reaching important academic goals and building momentum to finish \ntheir academic program. As you can clearly see, Charlie worked \ntirelessly to promote student access, and ensure all students are \nmaking timely progress towards their education and career goals. The \nachievements of the Washington State Board for Community and Technical \nColleges during Charlie's tenure as executive director have been \nremarkable.\n  Charlie graduated from the University of Washington with a bachelor's \ndegree in finance and from Washington State University with a master of \narts degree in political science. He serves as chair of the National \nCouncil of State Directors of Community Colleges, is a past president \nof the Washington Association of Community and Technical Colleges, and \nhas been a board member of the Washington Council on Aerospace, \nWorkforce Training and Education Coordinating Board, Early Learning \nAdvisory Council, Governor's Job Creation Subcabinet, and National \nGovernors' Association Compete to Complete Advisory Group. Charlie's \nentrepreneurial spirit and unwavering commitment to student success \nwill be sorely missed.

ANSALDI\n\n Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the \nextraordinary, selfless, and faithful commitment of Monsignor Joseph C. \nAnsaldi to the Catholic Church. On Saturday, June 2, 2012, Monsignor \nAnsaldi will celebrate the 50th Anniversary of his ordination to the \npriesthood.\n  Monsignor Ansaldi attended both a Catholic grammar school and a \nCatholic high school where he learned the\n\n[[Page S3277]]\n\nvalue of such a wonderful religious education. He realized early on \nthat he wished to devote his life to the Catholic Church and the \ncommunity in which he grew up. Following his early education, Monsignor \nAnsaldi attended and graduated from St. Joseph Dunwoodie with \nbachelor's degrees in philosophy and theology and later received his \nmaster's degree in history from Fordham University.\n  Ordained in 1962, his first assignment was chaplain at Mt. Loretto's \nGirls' Division. He then spent 6 years at Cardinal Hayes High School, \nwhere he taught history, German, and religion prior to his appointment \nthere as dean of students. He then was appointed academic dean to St. \nJoseph by-the-Sea, and then in 1982, then archbishop of New York, \nTerrence Cardinal Cooke, appointed Monsignor Ansaldi as principal of \nSt. Joseph by-the-Sea. Finally, in 1990, Pope John Paul II named \nJosepha C. Ansaldi a monsignor, and in 1991, Cardinal O'Connor \nappointed Monsignor Ansaldi Vicar of the Staten Island vicariate.\n  Under Monsignor Ansaldi's tenure, enrollment at St. Joseph by-the-Sea \nrose by more than 25 percent to over 1,300 students. He also expanded \nthe physical plant of the school to ensure that these students had the \nresources necessary to prosper. Many of his students became National \nMerit Scholar finalists and are forever grateful to the extraordinary \nleadership of their principal.\n  Monsignor Ansaldi reminds us all about the tremendous role that \neducators play in the lives of students. Thousands of students have \ngone to college due to the efforts of Monsignor Ansaldi and many have \nbeen inspired to follow in the footsteps of Monsignor Ansaldi.\n  The extraordinary vibrancy of New York is greatly enriched by its \nstrong religious community. These communities owe much of their \nprosperity to the tireless efforts of religious leaders. Monsignor \nAnsaldi, who has served the people of New York for 50 years, is one \nshining example of the important role religious leaders can play in the \nlives of thousands of people. They have provided their communities \ninfinite wisdom and counsel during times good and bad. Monsignor Joseph \nC. Ansaldi is a true leader who has selflessly and faithfully devoted \nhis life to the betterment of the Catholic Church and to all mankind.\n  Mr. President, it is my honor to acknowledge the achievement and \ncontributions of Monsignor Joseph C. Ansaldi on this 50th anniversary \nof his ordination to the priesthood in the Catholic Church.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/17/senate-section/article/S3277-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO NANETTE A. NADEAU\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I wish to honor \nMrs. Nanette A. Nadeau, who on June 3, 2012, at Peterson Air Force \nBase, CO, will retire after over 36 years of Federal civil service. \nNanette is the Deputy Director of Legislative Affairs for the North \nAmerican Aerospace Defense Command and U.S. Northern Command. She has \nbeen an enduring presence and focal point for all congressional matters \nand our interaction with the commands.\n  Legislative liaisons facilitate communication between their agencies \nand Congress, effectively bridging our organizational cultures. These \nprofessionals require expert, almost insider, knowledge of \nCongressional procedure, committee structure, and legislative process. \nMy office depends heavily on the rapport we have with military liaisons \nfor timely, transparent dialogue. Nanette has exemplified the best of \nwhat we have come to appreciate.\n  Nanette is a native of Jefferson, NH. She attended White Mountain \nRegional High School where she had the distinction of recruiting the \nband Aerosmith to play at her senior prom. While her high school \naccomplishments were legendary, it was on a day she was absent from \nschool that would change her life's course--the day she met a young \nsoldier, Douglas Nadeau. Doug had received a call that day from a young \nlady who wanted to skip class with a couple friends, but they needed a \nride because the school was several miles from town. Nanette was one of \nthe friends. They married in June of 1974 and headed out together as \nDoug continued to serve our country around the world.\n  In the military, there is an adage that ``home is wherever the \nservice sends you,'' and over the years the Nadeaus called places like \nGermany, Georgia, and Virginia home. Like other military spouses, \nNanette made sacrifices along the way as she bounced from one civil \nservice job to the next, sometimes settling for a lower grade. She \nstarted her Federal service career as a General Schedule-2, sorting \nmail in the Post Office in Giessen, Germany. Finding her niche in \nlegislative affairs, she earned a reputation for excellence and was \npromoted over time to General Schedule-14 . Despite enduring frequent \nmoves, Nanette found time to earn her bachelor's degree from The \nCollege of William & Mary, graduating summa cum laude, and later added \nan MBA from the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, also summa \ncum laude, all while working full time.\n  After having seen the world, the Nadeaus felt most at home in \nColorado. Fort Carson was where Doug was stationed when they were \nmarried and they returned in 1987 for Doug's last assignment, \neventually deciding to settle in the Colorado Springs area. During her \ntenure as a legislative liaison, Nanette has prepared countless pages \nof testimony and led numerous congressional visits. She has \norchestrated visits for my staff and me to military installations in \nthe local community, including Peterson and Schriever Air Force Bases \nand Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station. A pinnacle moment for Nanette \nwas being awarded the well-deserved honor of Civilian of the Year in \n2006.\n  Around NORAD and USNORTHCOM, Nanette has become known for her \ndiscretion, interpersonal skill, and sharp sense of humor. She enjoys a \nlevel of trust with her colleagues that can only be earned over time. \nNanette will leave an indelible mark on NORAD and USNORTHCOM and her \ninstitutional knowledge and savvy analysis of legislative activity will \nbe hard to replace. However, she can take pride in the knowledge that \nshe leaves her post better than she found it, and be confident that her \nlegacy will endure through those she has mentored over the years.\n  On behalf of a grateful nation, I thank Nanette for her many years of \nfaithful, selfless service and offer warm congratulations on the \noccasion of her retirement. May she and Doug enjoy a very bright \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/17/senate-section/article/S3277-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/17/senate-section/article/S3277-3", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations, treaties, and a withdrawal which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/17/senate-section/article/S3277-4", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3277-S3278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n  ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13047 OF MAY 20, 1997, WITH \n                        RESPECT TO BURMA--PM 49\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

A bill to establish the National Women's High-Growth \nBusiness Bipartisan Task Force, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. 3196 and S. \n3197. This legislation will strengthen the resources and support that \nwe provide to women entrepreneurs, and to strengthen oversight of the \nSBA's technical assistance programs. The SBA's Entrepreneurial \nDevelopment programs are a vital source of training and management \nsupport for entrepreneurs, and I am pleased to work with Chair Landrieu \nto improve these programs and ensure that the taxpayer dollars that \nsupport them are being utilized in the most efficient and effective way \npossible.\n  The Women's Small Business Ownership Act of 2012 builds upon our \ncommitment to providing assistance to women entrepreneurs, whose firms \nhave grown at ice the rate of other firms. The SBA's Women's Business \nCenter, WBC, program provides critical assistance to economically or \nsocially disadvantaged entrepreneurs, especially women. The bill I am \nintroducing today with Chair Landrieu holds funding for the WBC program \nat current levels for the next three years, in recognition that now is \nnot the time to grow Federal programs, including proven ones like the \nSBA's technical assistance efforts.\n  Our bill also makes necessary improvements to the WBC program, such \nas establishing a process and criteria that the SBA must follow in \nadministering grants under this program, and expanding eligible \nentities that can host Women's Business Centers to include local \neconomic development organizations and community colleges. It also \nimproves the transparency of project funds to ensure that WBC hosts are \nnot comingling their grant funds with those for separate purposes and \ninitiatives.\n  To further strengthen growth in women-owned businesses, we are also \nintroducing the National Women's High-Growth Business Bipartisan Task \nForce Act of 2012. This legislation would repeal the National Women's \nBusiness Council and replace it with a Women's High-Growth Business \nBipartisan Task Force charged with developing and promoting \ninitiatives, policies, and programs designed to encourage the formation \nof startups and high-growth small business concerns owned by women.\n  Under current law, the Council receives funding to employ an \nexecutive director and four additional employees, who may receive a \nmaximum pay rate of GS 15. However, most other advisory committees \nacross the government and SBA operate without staff, and under this \nbill we will save taxpayers nearly $1 million by transitioning the \ncurrent Council into a Task Force, similar to the Interagency Veteran's \nTask Force at the SBA, which was established in 2008.\n  Additionally, this legislation places an emphasis on high-growth \nsmall businesses owned and controlled by women. Recently, the Kauffman \nFoundation, based in Kansas City, MO, researched the effects of \nstartups as part of the American economy. These reports demonstrate the \nnecessity of new and young start-ups to act as mechanisms for reviving \nthe American economy; particularly those of high-growth entrepreneurs. \nIn this rapidly growing area of high-growth firms, which often \nincorporate intellectual property endeavors, this bill ensures that \nwomen's small business concerns are being addressed, with an emphasis \non achieving and maximizing high-growth potential.\n\n[[Page S3282]]\n\n  Finally, I am pleased to join Chair Landrieu in introducing the \nStrengthening Resources for America's Entrepreneurs Act. This \nlegislation aims to improve oversight and coordination among the SBA's \nexisting entrepreneurial development, ED, programs, including the \nWomen's Business Centers, WBC, the Small Business Development Centers, \nSBDC, and the Service Corps of Retired Executives, SCORE, by setting \nperformance measures, reducing duplication, and increasing partnerships \nwith local entrepreneurial training providers to make them more \neffective and responsive to the needs of small businesses.\n  Importantly, this legislation makes several changes to the SBA's \nentrepreneurial development programs at no cost to taxpayers. The bill \ninstructs the SBA to develop a plan outlining how to use ED initiatives \nto create new jobs over the next 2 years, improves cross-program \ncoordination to maximize use of program resources, establishes a \nconsistent data collection process for all of its technical assistance \nprograms, and ensures that someone is available to assist small \nbusinesses at all SBA district offices. By requiring the SBA to collect \ndata will provide important insights into the strengths of the ED \nprograms and highlight where there is room for improvement.\n  Now, more than ever, we in Congress must do everything within our \npower to help small businesses drive our Nation's economic recovery, \nand the SBA programs we are reauthorizing today are critical elements \nof that support. In the coming weeks, I look forward to working with \nthe Chair and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to move these \nbills through the full Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3196\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reform graduate medical education payments, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the Graduate Medical \nEducation, GME, Reform Act, along with my colleague Senator Kyl. This \nlegislation is a continuation of my longstanding efforts to support our \nfuture health care workforce and improve patient care.\n  While there are a variety of initiatives to support the education and \ntraining of physicians, none are more substantial than the GME funding \nprovided by Medicare. This program either directly or indirectly \nsupports every single physician trained in this country. No other \nFederal or State program can claim this credit.\n  Unfortunately, the size of the program has led some to propose its \nfunding be cut and redirected toward deficit reduction. The President's \nFiscal Commission, the Domenici-Rivlin plan, and even some Members of \nCongress have made this recommendation. Reducing GME funding by the \nlevels specified in these proposals could be devastating to training \nprograms.\n  These proposals stem from an assertion by the congressionally \nauthorized Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, MedPAC, that teaching \nhospitals are overpaid for the education and training they currently \nprovide residents, and that GME funding should be better used to align \nresidency training with key improvements in our health care delivery \nsystem. However, the Fiscal Commission and the Rivlin-Domenici plan \nignored the latter aspect of MedPAC's recommendation. MedPAC did not \nrecommend removing GME funding from the system. Instead, MedPAC \nsuggested Congress should make teaching hospitals more accountable for \nthe GME funding they currently receive. In MedPAC's proposal, all GME \nfunding would stay in the system to help support and improve medical \neducation and training.\n  The legislation we are introducing today aligns closely with MedPAC's \nproposal for greater accountability by teaching hospitals and enhanced \neffectiveness in the use of GME funding, but with some key changes. One \nsuch change would enable hospitals to compete for additional GME \nfunding in order to provide a greater incentive for teaching hospitals \nto improve their programs.\n  Teaching hospitals incur higher costs than other hospitals. They \ninvest in the newest technologies and employ the physician supervisors \nmost qualified to train our future doctors. Moreover, as a result of \nthe new health care reform law, many of these hospitals, physician \nsupervisors, and residents will treat an influx of patients beginning \nin 2014. GME funding is critical to building and sustaining our health \ncare infrastructure and future health care workforce.\n  It is critical that GME funding remain intact, but that doesn't mean \nwe shouldn't use this opportunity to encourage these programs to do \nmore to better train residents in: primary care delivery, a variety of \nsettings and systems, care coordination, and how to work in inter-\nprofessional and multi-disciplinary teams. The new oversight provided \nfor in the GME Reform Act would help to break down the silos in \nmedicine and ensure that physicians work together to provide patients \nwith comprehensive health care.\n  In addition, the legislation would enhance GME payment transparency, \nwhich we hope will help prove to the skeptics that this funding serves \na critical purpose.\n  I am particularly pleased that the Association of American Medical \nColleges has expressed support for legislation. While the organization \nwould prefer this legislation be included as part of an overall effort \nto increase the number of residents trained each year, which I also \nsupport, I believe we must begin a dialogue about a sensible and \nthoughtful approach to improving GME accountability and transparency. I \nhope my colleagues will take careful look at our legislation, and I \nlook forward to working with them on this important issue.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Federal Government now pays for more than \nhalf of all health care costs in this country, and that number is \nlikely to grow with the rapidly aging U.S. population. Indeed, Medicare \nwill face a nearly \\1/3\\ enrollment increase in the coming decade. We \nhave promised health care benefits to these seniors; to keep that \npromise, we must ensure there are enough physicians to treat them. \nUnfortunately, the medical workforce is shrinking: estimates show that \nwe may experience a shortage of up to 159,000 physicians by 2025.\n  In light of these sobering statistics, the government has a strong \ninterest in doing more to encourage the training of physicians who can \ndeliver quality care to our Nation's seniors. Even if we continue \nfunding medical education at current levels, we will soon face a severe \ncrisis in access to medical care. Cutting this medical education \nfunding would be counter-intuitive at best; dangerous at worst. In \nrecent years, however, there have been several proposals to do just \nthat.\n  It is true that there is a lack of transparency and accountability \naround this funding--mainly because we do not require hospitals to \nreport on how money is spent, and because we have not set workforce \ngoals for hospitals to meet. But that does not necessarily mean that \nthe money is spent poorly, or that it is an area ripe for funding \nreductions.\n  Rather than simply slash funding, we should work to remedy this lack \nof\n\n[[Page S3287]]\n\ntransparency and encourage hospitals to meet certain quality metrics. \nThe Graduate Medical Education Reform Act offers one promising avenue \nto do so. Under this bill, if a teaching hospital produces quality \nresidents as measured by certain consensus-based metrics, it can get up \nto a 3 percent increase in indirect medical education funding. \nConversely, a hospital that fails to meet the metrics can be penalized \nby up to 3 percent.\n  This is one common-sense approach that maintains overall current \nfunding levels while encouraging quality teaching programs. I urge my \ncolleagues to join Senator Reed and me in supporting this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Burr, Mr. Nelson, of Florida, \n        and Mr. Rubio):\n  S. 3202. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to ensure that \ndeceased veterans with no known next of kin can receive a dignified \nburial, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today, as Chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I am proud to introduce the Dignified \nBurial of Veterans Act of 2012 with Senator Burr, Ranking Member of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, and my Senate colleagues from the state \nof Florida, Senators Nelson and Rubio.\n  When America's heroes make a commitment to serve their country, we \nmake a promise to care for them. One of the many ways in which we care \nfor our veterans is by helping to provide them with a burial that \nhonors their service.\n  That is why I was concerned when I learned that a veteran at a VA \nNational Cemetery had an inappropriate burial. This veteran, with no \nknown next-of-kin, was buried in a cardboard container that later \ndisintegrated to the point where the veteran's remains were exposed and \nfound during a raise and realign project at the cemetery. The veteran's \nremains were later placed in a bag and reburied with what was left of \nthe cardboard box. This defies logic.\n  There is no reason why the remains of a veteran should ever be \ntreated with this lack of dignity.\n  Yet, under current law, VA is not authorized to purchase a casket or \nurn for veterans who do not have a next-of-kin to provide one, or the \nresources to be buried in an appropriate manner.\n  We must take steps to prevent this from occurring again. That is why \nthis bill would authorize VA to furnish a casket or urn to a deceased \nveteran when VA is unable to identify the veteran's next-of-kin and \ndetermines that sufficient resources are not otherwise available to \nfurnish a casket or urn for burial in a national cemetery. This bill \nwould further require that VA report back to Congress on the industry \nstandard for urns and caskets and whether burials at VA's national \ncemeteries are meeting that standard.\n  I think we can all agree that every veteran deserves a dignified \nburial. Today, I am pleased to stand with my bipartisan colleagues to \nintroduce a bill that would ensure that they receive one.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3202\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Dignified Burial of Veterans \n     Act of 2012''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Res. 466\n\n       Whereas Ukraine has experienced encouraging growth and \n     reforms since it declared its independence from the former \n     Soviet Union in 1991 and adopted its first constitution in \n     1996;\n       Whereas the 1996 constitution provided basic freedoms like \n     the freedom of speech, assembly, religion, and press, but was \n     ultimately too weak to contain the existing corruption-laced \n     political culture inherited from its communist past;\n       Whereas, as a result of the electoral fraud by which Mr. \n     Yanukovych was declared the winner, the citizens of the \n     Ukraine organized a series of protests, strikes, and sit-ins, \n     which came to be known as ``The Orange Revolution'';\n       Whereas the Orange Revolution, in concert with United \n     States and international pressure, forced the Supreme Court \n     of Ukraine to require an unprecedented second run-off \n     election, which resulted in opposition leader Mr. Yushchenko \n     defeating Mr. Yanukovych by a margin of 52 percent to 44 \n     percent;\n       Whereas, in the 2010 presidential election, incumbent \n     Yushchenko won only 5.5 percent in the first round of voting, \n     which left former Prime Minister Yanukovych and then Prime \n     Minister Yulia Tymoshenko to face one another in the run-off \n     election;\n       Whereas, Mr. Yanukovych defeated Ms. Tymoshenko by a margin \n     of 49 percent to 44 percent;\n       Whereas, shortly after the 2010 inauguration of Mr. \n     Yanukovych, the Ukrainian Constitutional Court found most of \n     the 2004 Orange Revolution inspired constitutional reforms \n     unconstitutional;\n       Whereas, in 2010, President Yanukovych appointed Viktor \n     Pshonka Prosecutor General, equivalent to the United States \n     Attorney General;\n       Whereas, since Mr. Pshonka's appointment, more than a dozen \n     political leaders associated with the 2004 Orange Revolution \n     have faced criminal charges under the Abuse of Office and \n     Exceeding Official Powers articles of the Ukrainian Criminal \n     Code;\n       Whereas, in 2011, Prosecutor General Pshonka brought \n     charges under these Abuse of Office articles against former \n     Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko over her decision while in \n     office to conclude a natural gas contract between Ukraine and \n     Russia;\n       Whereas, on October 11, 2011, Tymoshenko was found guilty \n     and sentenced to seven years in prison, fined $189,000,000, \n     and banned from holding public office for three years;\n       Whereas, recognizing the judicial abuses present in \n     Ukraine, the Parliamentary Assembly Council of Europe (PACE) \n     passed Resolution 1862 on January 26, 2012;\n       Whereas Resolution 1862 declared that the Abuse of Office \n     and Exceeding Official Powers articles under which Tymoshenko \n     was convicted are ``overly broad in application and \n     effectively allow for ex post facto criminalization of normal \n     political decision making'';\n       Whereas, since Ms. Tymoshenko's imprisonment, the \n     Prosecutor General's Office has reopened additional cases \n     against her that were previously closed and thought to be \n     sealed under a ten year statute of limitations;\n       Whereas, on October 28, 2011, the Ukrainian Deputy \n     Prosecutor General alleged in a television interview that Ms. \n     Tymoshenko was involved in contract killings, tax evasion, \n     bribery, and embezzlement;\n       Whereas, at the time of the Deputy Prosecutor's public \n     allegations, no formal charges were filed, thereby violating \n     Ms. Tymoshenko's right to ``presumed innocence'' guaranteed \n     by Article 6(2) of the European Convention on Human Rights;\n\n[[Page S3288]]\n\n       Whereas, since August 5, 2011, Ms. Tymoshenko has \n     languished in a prison cell in Ukraine with limited outside \n     contact and access to needed medical treatment;\n       Whereas the denial of proper medical assistance has left \n     Ms. Tymoshenko in a failing state of health;\n       Whereas international calls for Ms. Tymoshenko's release, \n     access to outside visitors, and adequate medical treatment \n     have been ignored even as her health continues to \n     deteriorate;\n       Whereas, on April 28, 2012, major international news \n     organizations, including the British Broadcast Corporation \n     and Reuters, reported on and produced photos of bruises \n     received by Ms. Tymoshenko during an apparent beating by \n     prison guards on April 20, 2012;\n       Whereas, in response to her inhumane treatment, Ms. \n     Tymoshenko began a hunger strike on April 20, 2012;\n       Whereas, amid international outrage, the European Union has \n     delayed indefinitely the signing of a free trade agreement \n     with Ukraine, and the member countries of the Organization \n     for Security and Co-operation in Europe currently are \n     deliberating whether to allow Ukraine to assume the \n     chairmanship of the organization, which has been scheduled \n     for 2013; and\n       Whereas, under international pressure, Ms. Tymoshenko was \n     moved to a hospital in Kharkiv on May 9, 2012, prompting her \n     to end her hunger strike: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the administration of President Viktor \n     Yanukovych for the politically motivated imprisonment of \n     former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko;\n       (2) calls on the Yanukovych administration to release Ms. \n     Tymoshenko immediately for medical reasons;\n       (3) urges the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe not to recognize Ukraine's scheduled 2013 chairmanship \n     of the Organization until the release of Ms. Tymoshenko;\n       (4) urges the Department of State to withdraw the United \n     States Ambassador to the Ukraine and suspend operations at \n     the United States Embassy in Kiev until the release of Ms. \n     Tymoshenko;\n       (5) calls on the Department of State to institute a visa \n     ban against President Yanukovych, Prosecutor General Viktor \n     Pshonka, and other officials responsible for Ms. Tymoshenko's \n     imprisonment; and\n       (6) calls on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to \n     suspend all cooperative agreements with Ukraine and place \n     Ukraine on indefinite probation with regard to its \n     Distinctive Partnership with the Organization until the \n     release of Ms. Tymoshenko.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url":

The report of the Secretary of \nState, which includes an Overview of the proposed Convention, is \nenclosed for the information of the Senate.\n  The United States supported the development of the Convention, which \nprovides uniform rules for determining the law applicable to certain \nrights in commercial transactions involving investment securities held \nthrough intermediaries (such as brokers, banks, and other financial \ninstitutions). The Convention incorporates modern commercial finance \nmethods already market-tested in the United States through the Uniform \nCommercial Code. It would ensure that countries that become party to \nthis Convention would also apply those methods. The Convention, once in \nforce, would improve the functioning of investment securities markets, \nreduce uncertainty in cross-border commerce, and reduce national and \ncross-border systemic risk.\n  The Department of the Treasury, the U.S. Securities and Exchange \nCommission, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, and the New \nYork Federal Reserve Bank support ratification by the United States of \nthis Convention, as do key private sector associations.

I also transmit, for the information of \nthe Senate, the report of the Secretary of State with respect to the \nConvention.\n  Anchored in the principles of equality of opportunity, \nnondiscrimination, respect for dignity and individual autonomy, and \ninclusion of persons with disabilities, the Convention seeks to \npromote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human \nrights by persons with disabilities. While Americans with disabilities \nalready enjoy these rights at home, U.S. citizens and other individuals \nwith disabilities frequently face barriers when they travel, work, \nserve, study, and reside in other countries. The rights of Americans \nwith disabilities should not end at our Nation's shores. Ratification \nof the Disabilities Convention by the United States would position the \nUnited States to occupy the global leadership role to which our \ndomestic record already attests. We would thus seek to use the \nConvention as a tool through which to enhance the rights of Americans \nwith disabilities, including our veterans. Becoming a State Party to \nthe Convention and mobilizing greater international compliance could \nalso level the playing field for American businesses, who already must \ncomply with U.S. disability laws, as well as those whose products and \nservices might find new markets in countries whose disability standards \nmove closer to those of the United States.\n  Protection of the rights of persons with disabilities has \nhistorically been grounded in bipartisan support in the United States, \nand the principles anchoring the Convention find clear expression in \nour own domestic law. As described more fully in the accompanying \nreport, the strong guarantees of nondiscrimination and equality of \naccess and opportunity for persons with disabilities in existing U.S. \nlaw are consistent with and sufficient to implement the requirements of \nthe Convention as it would be ratified by the United States.\n  I recommend that the Senate give prompt and favorable consideration \nto this Convention and give its advice and consent to its ratification, \nsubject to the reservations, understandings, and declaration set forth \nin the accompanying report.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, May 17, 2012.\n                                  ____\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to \ntheir ratification, the Convention between the Government of the United \nStates of America and the Government of the Republic of Chile for the \nAvoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with \nRespect to Taxes on Income and Capital, signed in Washington on \nFebruary 4, 2010, with a Protocol signed the same day, as corrected by \nexchanges of notes effected February 25, 2011, and February 10 and 21, \n2012, and a related agreement effected by exchange of notes (the \n``related Agreement'') on February 4, 2010.

The proposed Treaty contains \ncomprehensive provisions designed to address ``treaty shopping,'' which \nis the inappropriate use of a tax treaty by residents of a third \ncountry, and provides for a robust exchange of information between the \ntax authorities in the two countries to facilitate the administration \nof each country's tax laws.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe proposed Treaty and give its advice and consent to the ratification \nthereof.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, May 17, 2012.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/17/senate-section/article/S3293-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ORDERS FOR MONDAY MAY 21, 2012\n\n  Mr. REID.
