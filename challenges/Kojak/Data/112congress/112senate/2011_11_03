Mr. President, yesterday evening, I called my friend from \nSearchlight, NV, Arthur Fraijo. Arthur's family has been in Searchlight \nfor many years. His mom and dad have passed away. I keep in touch with \nhim. He is a wonderful, hard-working man. I said, ``Where are you \ntoday, Arthur?'' He said, ``I am at work.'' I said, ``You're kidding, \nwhere are you?'' He was at this project out by Primm, a big solar \nproject. I said, ``How long have you been working?'' I remember that he \nsaid it was a matter of weeks. It is the first job he has had in 3 \nyears. He is an iron worker and he is working now, and he is very \nhappy. Here is an iron worker, a construction worker, who has finally \nfound a job.\n  In Nevada we have thousands of other people who have been out of work \nfor a long period of time--construction workers such as Arthur. Most \nare not fortunate enough to have a job such as he has. That is what our \nlegislation is all about. The legislation we will vote on this \nafternoon deals with putting people back to work, hundreds of thousands \nof construction workers. This is a bill that does not add more deficit \nspending. It is paid for, and it is not an attack on millionaires and \nbillionaires. Many millionaires and billionaires are very fortunate in \nthat they may not, in a given year, make a million dollars but they \nstill have assets, so they are millionaires and billionaires. We have \nmade sure that a small percentage of Americans would help us put people \nsuch as Arthur back to work.\n  What we have suggested in our legislation is so reasonable and so \nfair. What we are saying is that people who make all this money--more \nthan a million dollars a year--should contribute to the restructuring \nof our economy. The plan is paid for by asking these people to \ncontribute a little more to get the economy back on track. We are not \nasking all millionaires and billionaires; we are asking the people who \nhave made more than $1 million a year to pay a little bit extra. It is \nthe right thing to do. It amounts to two-tenths of 1 percent of the \npeople who make money in America--two-tenths of 1 percent.\n  It is unbelievable that the Republicans have lined up in the past--\nand we have heard they are going to do the same thing today--in \nunanimous opposition to this commonsense plan that is supported by \npeople all over America--not Democrats only, not Independents only, but \nDemocrats, Independents, and Republicans.\n  Americans are crying for jobs, crying for us to pass this bill. This \nwould put\n\n[[Page S7094]]\n\n3,000 or 4,000 people to work in Nevada. I think that is extremely \nimportant. And in every State it is the same. I talked to my friend \nfrom New Mexico yesterday, Senator Bingaman, the senior Senator, and he \nsaid it would put 4,000 people to work there. New Mexico's economy is \nnot as troubled as Nevada's, but they are not doing as well as in years \npast.\n  This legislation levies a small tax on the top two-tenths of 1 \npercent of the American taxpayers. Their income has increased 275 \npercent over the last three decades. The top 1 percent of these people \nin America make as much as the other 99 percent put together.\n  We are being told that, well, we want to help you, but we have taken \na tax pledge from this person named Grover Norquist. As Alan Simpson \nsaid, does that mean more than your country? If it does, he said you \nshould not be in Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/03/senate-section/article/S7094-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LENDER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we are going to see very different \napproaches to infrastructure and job creation today. The American \npeople can decide for themselves which one makes more sense.\n  The Republican proposal extends the current highway bill for another \n2 years, giving States and contractors the certainty they need to start \nnew infrastructure projects and to create jobs.\n  The legislation Senator Hatch is proposing today puts an end to the \nuncertainty for the next 2 years. This proposal also gives States the \nauthority to decide how this money is spent. If folks in Ohio or \nKentucky want to build a bridge, Washington can't force them to build a \nbike path.\n  The Republican proposal accelerates the review period and clears away \nthe bureaucratic redtape. The President admitted a few months ago that \nthe shovel-ready projects in his first stimulus bill didn't turn out to \nbe as shovel ready as he thought. Our proposal helps make sure they \nare.\n  Our bill prohibits the EPA from imposing burdensome and unnecessary \nnew regulations on American cement producers and domestic boilers, so \nthe cost of American-made materials for the projects paid for through \nthis highway bill don't skyrocket just as they are set to begin. The \nbill keeps those costs down.\n  Best of all, it is fully paid for through funds that were originally \nappropriated for another purpose but not spent. Whatever is left over \nafter these projects are funded goes to pay down the deficit.\n  The Democrats are taking a different approach. First, according to \nthe CBO, the Democrats' proposal will do little for the economy and \nputting people back to work in the short term, because the money will \nbe spent very gradually. According to the CBO, less than one-tenth of \nthe funds in the Democrats' proposal will be spent next year. Less than \none-tenth of the funds in the Democrats' proposal, which we will be \nvoting on today, will be spent next year, and roughly 40 percent won't \nbe spent until after 2015. This hardly matches the President's call for \ndoing something ``right away.''\n  Second, it costs another $57 billion we don't have.\n  Third, they want to pay for this temporary spending bill with a \npermanent tax increase on job creators. Again, they want to pay for a \ntemporary spending bill with a permanent tax hike on job creators.\n  Fourth, they already know that Republicans and, yes, some Democrats, \ndon't think we should be taxing job creators, particularly at a time \nwhen 14 million Americans are looking for a job--and that we will vote \nagainst any proposal that does so.\n  In other words, the Democrats have deliberately designed this bill to \nfail.\n  So the truth is that Democrats are more interested in building a \ncampaign message than in rebuilding roads and bridges. Frankly, the \nAmerican people deserve a lot better than that. The people of Kentucky \ndeserve a lot better than that. The people in my State have serious, \ntime-sensitive bridge projects--the Brent Spence bridge, I-69 bridge, \nLouisville bridges, and Sherman Minton bridge, which is currently shut \ndown. They deserve better than that.\n  The Associated General Contractors of America and the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce have already spoken out against the Democrats' proposal.\n  The rest of the American people can decide which approach they \nprefer: our proposal, which doesn't add to the deficit, doesn't raise \ntaxes, empowers the States to make decisions on the local level, and is \ndesigned to gain bipartisan support or the Democrats' top-down \napproach, which perpetuates uncertainty, raises taxes on businesses at \na time when we should be giving them more reasons to hire, not less, \nand which was designed in coordination with the White House political \nteam to fail.\n  These are the two approaches on display in the Senate today. The \nchoice should be obvious.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the highway bill has been worked on for \nmonths by Senator Boxer, who is the chairman, and the ranking member, \nSenator Inhofe. They have arrived at a conclusion.\n  I had a conversation yesterday with Senator Inhofe, and they have \nworked out almost all of the details on the bill. We have to do \nsomething on this bill because it expires at the end of this year--the \n1st of February, I believe.\n  My friend, the Republican leader, whom I care a great deal about \npersonally, is absolutely wrong. The American people support our \napproach. Seventy-six percent of the American people like it. People of \nall political definitions support it. Why? Because it is so fair.\n  We are asking the top two-tenths of 1 percent of people who make \nmoney in this country to contribute a surtax of seven-tenths of 1 \npercent of money they make over $1 million.\n  Job creators? I don't think so. The funding mechanism the Republicans \nuse this time is in violation of the agreement we made last July. We \nhave an agreement. We have cut domestic discretionary spending enough. \nThat was the agreement we made. What they have done is come back to \nwhack it more, which, I repeat, is going back on our agreement on how \nmuch we are spending on appropriations.\n  Not only that, but the Republicans do what they have done time and \ntime again. We all know we would be better off if we didn't have as \nmany regulations as we have. That is why every President, including \nPresidents Bush and Clinton, have done their best to eliminate \nunnecessary regulations. President Obama is doing the same thing. The \nRepublicans come here and say that the way to create jobs is to get rid \nof regulations. On this way of paying for this--this smoke and mirrors \nthat they have--they want to block implementation of health care \nreform, leading to higher costs and more uninsured Americans; block \nWall Street reform, increasing the risk of future financial crises and \ntaxpayer bailouts. Can you imagine, at this stage, that we would want \nto increase the power of those on Wall Street? I don't think the \nAmerican people care about that. Also, they want to block antipollution \nprotections, leading to dirtier air and more premature deaths and \nillness. They want to weaken food safety protections and weaken worker \nsafety protections. I, of course, will urge my entire caucus to vote \nagainst this because it is the typical approach the Republicans have \nused, and it has not created a single job--a single job.\n\n  There is commentary in today's newspapers about what the House has \nbeen doing. They haven't done anything to create jobs. With that \nextremely powerful Republican caucus, they have done nothing--nothing--\nto create jobs.\n  Now, Mr. President, I am glad we have a motto that says ``In God We \nTrust.'' But can you imagine, they voted yesterday whether we wanted to \nemphasize, to underline and underscore ``In God We Trust.'' They spent \nyesterday debating that issue in the House of Representatives. That \ndidn't create a single job.\n  There is not a single Senator who does not trust in God, that I know \nof.\n\n[[Page S7095]]\n\nYet that is what they are debating. People such as Arthur Fraijo are \ndesperate for work, have been out of work all these years. Yet not a \nsingle thing they do creates jobs.\n  The legislation we will vote on at 3 o'clock will produce hundreds of \nthousands of jobs now.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My good friend has made a great campaign speech, but \nthe election is in November of next year. If we want to accomplish \nsomething, we have to do it together. We have had a series of votes \nover the last few weeks clearly designed to fail. The proposal my good \nfriend is talking about, in all likelihood, is going to have bipartisan \nopposition. It was not developed with Republican input, and it was not \ndesigned to get a positive outcome.\n  The House of Representatives, on 15 different occasions recently, has \npassed bills with bipartisan support--bipartisan support--that we are \nnot taking up. One of them--the 3-percent withholding bill--enjoys the \nsupport of the President of the United States as well. So it is my hope \nthat in the very near future we can figure a way to actually pass \nsomething together that would become law.\n  I wish we could put off the election until next year because these \nefforts to do these messaging amendments, as politically invigorating \nas it may be to the base of the Democratic Party, don't have anything \nto do with actually passing legislation that could have a positive \nimpact. So we will have the two votes today, but I would urge my good \nfriend to join me in looking for things on which there is enough \nbipartisan support to actually make a law, not just try to make a \npoint.\n  I am sure it is the case that most Americans support raising taxes on \nhigh-income individuals. My guess is they might have a different view \nif they knew that four out of five of those individuals were actually \nbusiness owners. Nevertheless, it is time, it seems to me, for us to \nquit making the campaign speeches and remember the election is in \nNovember 2012, not this month of 2011, and see if we can't work \ntogether to pass legislation the President can sign and that will help \nmove the country in a different direction.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend, the Republican leader, comes \nbefore this body today and says we should do our campaign speeches next \nyear when the world knows my friend has said his No. 1 priority in this \nCongress is to defeat President Obama.\n  We have had on the Senate floor for the last 10 months a campaign \nspeech every day directed by my friend and his Republican colleagues in \nhis caucus doing everything they can to make President Obama look bad \nand doing nothing to help our economy. Their goal is to do everything \nthey can to drag down this economy, to do anything they can to focus \nattention negatively on the President of the United States in hopes the \nminority leader can get my job, perhaps, and that President Obama will \nbe defeated.\n  So let's not talk about campaign speeches on the Senate floor. Let's \ntalk about reality. I do not believe we should be concerned about a \npiece of legislation that asks the richest of the rich to pay a few \npennies of their vast fortunes to put people like my friend back to \nwork. That is what this is all about. The American people agree with \nwhat we are doing. We are trying to have this government involved in \nthings that create jobs, not slogans, not ``let's get rid of those \nregulations'' or do we believe in God or that kind of stuff.\n  That has not created a single job. What we want to do is create jobs. \nWe also don't want to go back on the agreement we worked on for months \nregarding the deficit reduction plan and raising the debt ceiling, \nwhere we agreed on what our spending should be for this coming year. We \nwill see how sincere my Republican colleagues are. The CR expires in 2 \nmore weeks. The CR is the continuing resolution. Let's see if they go \nback on their word in that regard; that they will begin threatening to \nshut down the government if they do not get whatever slogan looks good \nduring any specific period of time.\n  We have the FAA that is about to go out of business again because the \nRepublicans are unwilling to pass a bill without some labor issue that \nhas nothing to do with the bill that was passed--zero to do with it. \nEven the person who runs Delta Air Lines, that has been the focus of \nthis, wants the FAA bill done. They recognize they have been hurt very \nbadly by what the Republicans have done to focus attention on them--\nattention they do not want focused on them.\n  So I hope we can, on a bipartisan basis, do the things that are good \nfor the country, and I think creating jobs is one of the most important \nthings we should do. I would say to my friend: We can stay here all \nday, and I will get in the last word. We can extend to 11:20 now, but I \nwill get in the last word in our conversation today.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is certainly the case the majority \nleader can always have the last word, but I would say, with all due \nrespect to my friend, he just made another campaign speech.\n  I think what the American people would like to see us do is actually \npass something together that will become law--pass something together \nthat will become law. That is how to get an accomplishment out of the \nU.S. Constitution. That is how to send something to the President.\n  We know how to work together to make things happen. We have done that \nin the past. All I am suggesting is that the exercise we are going to \nhave later today has nothing to do with making law and making a \ndifference. It is about making a point. We both know how to do that. We \nboth know how to make points and make laws. What we are doing later \ntoday is not about making laws.\n  I am told by staff I need to move to proceed to S. 1786.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The motion will be pending.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would finally say this: I hope we will \nhave a new dawn arising soon where we will see my Republican friends \nbreak away from this lockstep they have been in. I can't imagine they \nbelieve they are doing the right thing by voting against asking the \nrichest of the rich--.02 percent of the richest people in America--to \ncontribute a small amount toward creating jobs in America. That is what \nthis is all about.\n  I would hope someday we will see a few Republicans break from the \npack and vote to create jobs rather than trying to defeat President \nObama come next November.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/03/senate-section/article/S7095-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, while I have been interested in the \ncomments between the two leaders, I have to agree with the Republican \nleader that this is an exercise, in many ways, in futility because the \nbill brought forth by the other side has very little chance of passing \nthrough both Houses of Congress because it is a partisan bill.\n  Let me just mention a few things this morning. While growth remains \nsluggish in our economy, unemployment high, and job growth insufficient \nto drive unemployment lower, the number of pages in the Federal \nRegister is at an all-time high. Pages devoted to final rules rose by \n20 percent\n\n[[Page S7096]]\n\nbetween 2009 and 2010, and proposed rules have also risen by close to \n20 percent to 2,439 in 2010.\n  Of the 4,257 regulatory actions already in the pipeline, 219 are \nconsidered economically significant, meaning they are estimated to \nimpose a cost of $100 million or more on the economy. By comparison, \nthat is 28 more than this time last year and 47 percent more than in \n2009. In total, the Obama administration has imposed 75 new major \nregulations costing over $38 billion annually. And we wonder why our \ncountry is in such trouble.\n  The minutes of the late September meeting of the Federal Reserve \nmonetary policymaking committee reveal that in talking to businesses \nand market participants, many contacts have ``cited uncertainty about \nregulatory and tax policies as contributing to businesses' reluctance \nto spend.''\n  If businesses are not spending because of regulatory uncertainty, \nthen their customers will see lack of demand for their products. The \nlack of demand explanation for economic sluggishness offered by the \nadministration and its Keynesian advisers begs the question of why \nthere is a lack of demand. While there are likely several reasons, the \nFed clearly identifies one of them: Uncertainty about regulatory \npolicies.\n  Indeed, uncertainty regarding future regulatory policies as a \ncontributing factor for business reluctance to hire and invest has been \ncited in minutes of the past three policymaking meetings of the Fed's \nmonetary policymaking committee. Those identifying that such \nuncertainty is impeding job creation are American businesses and not \ngovernment bureaucrats insulated from the front lines of businesses and \nnot their Keynesian advisers. They are the boots on the ground in the \nAmerican economy--the very people who create jobs--most of whom are \nsmall businesspeople.\n  The legislation I have introduced seeks in part to ease the burden of \nFederal regulations on businesses, including smaller and younger \nbusinesses--where vibrancy is critical for job creation--and to provide \na rational regulatory decisionmaking process to provide greater \ncertainty to businesses about the future regulatory environment.\n  Provisions in this act represent ideas that have garnered bipartisan \nsupport. Indeed, many of the provisions follow directly from the \nPresident's own jobs council. The President's Council on Jobs and \nCompetitiveness, according to the council, ``was created to provide \nnonpartisan advice.''\n  I am talking about the bill we have filed on this side.\n  The jobs council presented recommendations to President Obama on \nOctober 11, 2011, in Pittsburgh, PA. Those recommendations stem from \nthe council's interim report titled ``Taking Action, Building \nConfidence: Five Common-Sense Initiatives to Boost Jobs and \nCompetitiveness.'' Many of the provisions in my act stem directly from \nrecommendations in the council's report and from the report's call for \na more rational Federal regulatory system.\n  Allow me to offer some quotes and comments related to the President's \njobs council's interim report recommendations in the context of this \nact.\n  First, the President's job council says:\n\n       The nation's complex federal, state, and local permitting \n     system can lead to unnecessary delays. In fact, large \n     Department of Transportation projects can spend years getting \n     the required Environmental Impact Statement process completed \n     under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).\n\n  I agree. This legislation--my legislation--promotes more efficient \nregulation to rein in some of the burdensome Federal redtape that \nstymies transportation infrastructure projects and job creation. At the \nsame time, it fully recognizes environmental and safety concerns \nsurrounding those projects. Relative to those concerns, the President's \njobs council remarks that ``what's gotten less attention, however, is \nthe number of jobs at stake.''\n  Second, the President's jobs council says:\n\n       Current markets face significant uncertainty--tax policy, \n     pollution restrictions, and performance standards are all in \n     flux.\n\n  I agree. This side's legislation serves to reduce some of that \nuncertainty and promote rational regulatory decisionmaking with \ncongressional review of rules and regulations that are of major \neconomic significance and required approval of the very rules that \nwould impose major costs on the U.S. economy and job creators.\n  Third, the President's jobs council states:\n\n       There is broad consensus that a key step towards jump-\n     starting economic growth would be removing regulatory \n     barriers and simplifying overly complex government processes. \n     Their inefficiencies cost businesses time and money.\n\n  I agree. This legislation seeks, through rational regulatory \ndecisionmaking and reviews, to remove unnecessary and costly regulatory \nbarriers and provide simpler, more rational government regulatory \nprocesses.\n  Fourth, the President's jobs council--this is referring to Executive \norders to review regulations--says:\n\n       Unfortunately, the Executive Orders mandating regulatory \n     analysis and review did not apply to IRCs [independent \n     regulatory commissions] such as the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \n     because the law won't allow it. While some IRCs employ \n     economic analysis when crafting new regulations, many do not \n     routinely do so. As an example, in 2010, IRCs issued 17 \n     economically significant regulatory reactions--16 of which \n     were promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission \n     and the Federal Reserve System. None underwent the \n     comprehensive regulatory impact analysis or included the \n     cost-benefit analysis that is expected from executive branch \n     agencies. The Council therefore recommends that legislation \n     be passed that requires that IRCs conduct cost-benefit \n     analysis for all ``economically significant'' regulatory \n     actions that may have an annual impact on the economy of $100 \n     million or more as well as any significant guidance that \n     meets the same threshold.\n\n  I agree. This legislation we have filed on this side will provide \ncongressional oversight on any such performed by IRCs such as the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve, the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission, and other Federal regulators for \neconomically significant actions.\n  Fifth, the President's jobs council says of its recommendations for \neconomically significant regulatory actions:\n\n       These recommendations are not designed to weaken regulation \n     or regulatory agencies, but rather to improve the rulemaking \n     process, and to create more effective and less burdensome \n     regulations that will promote economic growth and job \n     recovery.\n\n  I agree. The Republican legislation promotes a rational regulatory \nsystem with improved rulemaking oversight to create more effective and \nless burdensome regulations in order to help promote jobs growth.\n  I also agree with the spirit of the jobs council remarks that efforts \nsuch as this legislation, far from ``gutting regulations and \nthreatening safety,'' will promote economic efficiency and renewed job \ncreation. The call for rational regulation and rulemaking is in no way \na gutting of regulations or a sacrifice of public safety or of \nenvironmental quality efforts. We all know that rules and regulations \nare quite likely to continue to grow and evolve. This legislation seeks \nonly to put rational decisionmaking into the foundation of our \nregulatory and rulemaking processes that are too often driven by \nspecial interests of largely unaccountable and fully unelected Federal \nregulatory bureaucrats wishing to impose their preferences on America's \njob creators.\n  Proponents of the so-called infrastructure bank have actively cited \nin recent advocacy speeches findings from Global Competitiveness \nReports of the World Economic Forum. Well, if ratings from the World \nEconomic Forum guide their views and guide them to advocate hundreds of \nbillions of dollars from taxpayer resources for a risky new GSE that \nthey call an infrastructure bank, let's look at what the forum has to \nsay regarding the United States.\n  First, in their recent Global Competitiveness Report, in what are \ncalled ``the most problematic factors for doing business'' in America, \nthe top 4 factors out of 15 are tax rates, No. 1; inefficient \ngovernment bureaucracy, No. 2; access to financing, No. 3; and tax \nregulations, No. 4. Inadequate supply of infrastructure rates No. 10, \nright below policy instability and restrictive labor regulations.\n  There you have it. The Global Competitiveness Report the \nadministration and my friends on the other side of the\n\n[[Page S7097]]\n\naisle use to advocate a risky new infrastructure bank places taxes and \ninefficient government bureaucracy as the top two leading problems in \ndoing business in America. Those are the top two factors that are \nholding back job growth, and a brandnew, risky infrastructure bank \nbureaucracy funded by permanently higher taxes would only make those \nproblems worse.\n  By contrast, the legislation I offer directly addresses inefficient \ngovernment bureaucracy by acting to ease the inefficient regulatory \nburdens imposed on job creators by largely unaccountable and unelected \nFederal bureaucracies throughout our massive regulatory agency maze and \ntheir special interests. And, I might add, those regulatory agencies \nseem clearly not to have job creation and easing of the plight of \nAmerica's 14 million unemployed workers as part of their main \ninterests.\n  The legislation I am proposing also provides for a fully paid-for \nhighway extension through 2013 that will give States and contractors \nthe certainty they need to begin large projects and create jobs.\n  It calls for an elimination of dedicated funding for transportation \nenhancements and gives States the authority to decide whether to spend \nresources on bike paths or other such transportation add-ons.\n  It reforms the National Environmental Policy Act--NEPA--to eliminate \nthe inefficient bureaucratic environmental redtape and to accelerate \nproject delivery and contracting, just as called for by the President's \nown jobs council. It addresses the bureaucratic redtape associated with \nthe NEPA that the President's own jobs council identifies, and it \ncontains reforms that receive the support of the Department of \nTransportation.\n\n  It includes a provision to stop Environmental Protection Agency rules \nthat serve to drive up costs of concrete and steel, which are key \ningredients in the road and construction projects.\n  It includes provisions for waivers of inefficient environmental \nreviews, approvals, and licensing and permitting requirements on road, \nhighway, and bridge rebuilding efforts in emergency situations.\n  It imposes a regulatory timeout on regulations to help stem the \nregulatory tsunami that is impeding job creation. We face a national \njobs and unemployment emergency. It is truly a crisis. The Federal \nReserve, the President's own jobs council, and job creators in Utah and \nacross America have made clear that onerous regulations and regulatory \nuncertainty are acting to cast a wet blanket on job creation in \nAmerica, and the 14 million unemployed Americans are painfully in need \nof jobs. My fellow Republicans and I are listening.\n  The legislation I propose goes straight to the matter in the interest \nof job creation now, not years from now once some inefficient, new, \npoliticized, unelected Federal bureaucracy called an infrastructure \nbank is up and running to supply taxpayer funds to specially chosen and \nfavored risky projects--something we have seen plenty of in this \nadministration and some administrations in the past as well.\n  The legislation I propose addresses the repeated calls from job \ncreators who are stymied by inefficient, burdensome regulatory redtape \nderived from special interest Federal bureaucracies rather than the \ninterests of American workers.\n  The legislation I propose draws from bipartisan recommendations, \nincluding recommendations from the President's own bipartisan jobs \ncouncil.\n  The legislation I propose accommodates fully paid-for infrastructure \nprojects to be undertaken to help build roads, bridges, and a host of \nother projects without imposing permanent, job-killing, higher taxes \nduring a national unemployment emergency.\n  I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to support this \nlegislation. This idea of an infrastructure bank appears to me to be \njust a future example of what Fannie and Freddie were all about. I \nthink we can do this without having an infrastructure bank, we can do \nit better, and we can do it pushing a lot of the President's ideas \nforward, a lot of the World Economic Forum's ideas, and a lot of ideas \nthat both sides of the aisle have to conclude are important for \novercoming this regulatory mess that is making it almost impossible to \ncreate jobs and almost impossible to get legislation through this body.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be \ndivided equally and not charged to one side or the other.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The senior Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to \nspeak to the legislation that is pending before us, S. 1769, the \nRebuild America Jobs Act. This legislation, in fact, would put \nliterally millions of Americans back to work rebuilding our Nation's \nroads, our bridges, our airports, and our railways.\n  The bill that is before us has two components. The first is a direct \n$50 billion Federal investment in our infrastructure, and it would be \nsplit between roads, rail, transit, and airport projects. More than \nhalf of that would go to our well-established, formula-driven highway \nand transit programs, and that would include about $132 million for New \nHampshire.\n  The second piece of this proposal would create an infrastructure \nbank. That is legislation I cosponsored, and it has had bipartisan \ncosponsorship in the Senate. The bank, as it is structured, would be \nable to leverage public dollars to attract private capital, and that \nwould, if it is successful, lead to hundreds of billions of dollars in \ninfrastructure over the next 10 years. It is a bipartisan idea, as I \nsaid, and it has attracted support from both the AFL-CIO and the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce. Clearly, it is a good idea if it has both of those \norganizations onboard. Together, this legislation that is pending \nbefore us would mean immediate jobs for our construction industry. It \nhas been one of the hardest hit by this recession.\n  In New Hampshire the number of people working in the construction \nindustry in 2010 was the lowest it had been in a decade. It was 25 \npercent lower than it was just in 2006, according to the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics.\n  Christian Zimmerman, who is the head of one of our biggest \ncontractors in New Hampshire, Pike Industries in Belmont, told me he \nhas had to lay off 150 workers in the last couple of years as Federal \nfunding to build New Hampshire's roads has run out.\n  The Federal Highway Administration estimates that every $1 billion in \nhighway spending supports more than 27,000 jobs. Economists at Moody's \nestimate that for every dollar we spend on infrastructure, our gross \ndomestic product goes up by $1.59. That is because of the ripple effect \nthis spending has in economic activity. There are a number of good \nreasons to support the legislation that is before us.\n  In the short term, this proposal would help put those who are \nunemployed in the construction industry back to work. That is something \nthat would be critical as we are thinking about how to help the \nmillions in this country who are unemployed and who have been \nunemployed, many of them for more than a year.\n  In the long term, the benefits of this investment in our \ninfrastructure are equally important. A quality infrastructure is \ncritical to our businesses. It is critical to our future economic \ngrowth, and it is critical to our future competitiveness in the world.\n\n[[Page S7098]]\n\n  According to numerous studies, deteriorating infrastructure costs \nbusinesses more than $100 billion a year in lost productivity. There is \nvery good evidence to show that our lack of investment in recent years \nis making itself felt in the condition of our roads and our bridges. \nThis past June, the New Hampshire Society of Civil Engineers issued a \nreport card on the condition of our State's roads and bridges, our \ndams, our wastewater facilities, our airports, and our waterways, those \nmajor projects we all consider part of our infrastructure. Sadly, the \nengineers' report card gave New Hampshire's infrastructure a grade of \nC. That is better than the grade the national organization has given \nthe United States as a whole; that was a D. It is not as good as we \nwant it to be, and it is not as good as we need for New Hampshire or \nthis country if we are going to continue to be competitive.\n  Mr. President, 15 percent of New Hampshire's bridges are rated \nstructurally deficient by the Federal Highway Administration, and 148 \nof them are red-listed. When I was first elected to the State senate, \nwe had a controversy in New Hampshire because we had a highway \ncommissioner who said because of the number of red-listed bridges, when \nwe all drove around New Hampshire and went over a bridge we should \ndrive fast and not look back.\n  Well, fortunately, we are not in that position right now, but we have \na lot of bridges that need investment, and this bill before us would \nprovide New Hampshire with additional Federal highway funding that \nwould help us address these bridges that are red-listed and address our \nother transportation needs.\n  The most important project that should be addressed by this \nlegislation in New Hampshire is a project that has been under way for \nyears in the southern part of our State that has been threatened by the \nuncertainty surrounding Federal funding. It is the widening of \nInterstate 93 between southern New Hampshire and Massachusetts. This \nproject is long overdue. It is badly needed by commuters and businesses \nin the area. The I-93 project was budgeted and planned based on the \nidea that the Federal Government would provide a consistent level of \nfunding, but, unfortunately, the Republican budget the House has called \nfor would produce a 35-percent cut in our highway program. \nUnfortunately, Congress has not yet been able to reach an agreement on \na long-term reauthorization of our highway program. The uncertainty \naround this and the prospect of such a drastic cut has made this \nproject, I-93, very difficult to finance.\n  Right now New Hampshire transportation officials have $115 million \nworth of bonding authority for this project that is just sitting on the \nsidelines because the Federal Government has not made good on its \nfunding commitments. The bill before us would help complete this \ncritical project for New Hampshire and so many others like it across \nthe country.\n  If we want to see the benefits that investment and infrastructure can \nprovide in New Hampshire, we only need to look at the new airport \naccess road that goes to our largest airport and our largest city of \nManchester. It is going to open to traffic a full 2 years ahead of \nschedule. The project was accelerated because of the funding it \nreceived from the Recovery Act.\n  I remember the winter after we passed the Recovery Act and looking at \nthe bridge that was being constructed and talking about how we were \ngoing to be able to speed up this project because of those Recovery Act \ndollars. In fact, it has happened. It is going to open 2 years early. \nLocal planning boards along the Manchester Airport access road are \nalready seeing increased interest from commercial developers for the \nland that is along that road, that has been opened because of this new \nhighway. Of course, Manchester's airport is also going to benefit from \nthe investment in our airport access road.\n\n  Another piece that is in this legislation that is critical to our \ninfrastructure investment in New Hampshire and across the country is \nthe funding for a next-generation system of air traffic control which \nwould transfer our system from a ground-based radar system to a GPS-\nbased system--something most of us have in our cars these days. That \nwould allow the entire airline industry to plan more efficient, point-\nto-point routes, and it would allow everybody to save on fuel costs.\n  I had the opportunity to meet with Southwest Airlines a couple weeks \nago. It is the largest air carrier at the Manchester Airport. They \ntalked to me about the challenges they are facing and the entire \nairline industry is facing because we haven't invested in this next \ngeneration system of air traffic control. They said it will save us \nmoney because it will be more economical in terms of fuel usage because \nthey can go point to point, and it will save time because we can \nprovide for more efficient routes.\n  This is a no-brainer. Right now, our system of air traffic control is \nbehind even the country of Mongolia. It is time for us to make this \ninvestment, to make it easier for airlines to fly into a small hub \nairport such as Manchester. It would save us all money. It would be \nsafer. It is an investment that is long overdue.\n  A couple weeks ago, I also had a chance to speak at an infrastructure \nsummit that the Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce supports for the \nGreater Manchester region. There was a whole day of talking about why \ninvestment in our infrastructure is important, because without reliable \npower, without reliable bridges and public transportation and roads, \nbusinesses can't thrive. The Manchester Chamber believes investment in \ninfrastructure is critical to growing our economy and creating jobs, \nand I share that belief. It is a belief that I came to as a State \nsenator way back over 20 years ago, when I served in the New Hampshire \nState Senate. It is something I continued to support as Governor. In \nthose days, we worked together on a bipartisan basis because we all \nunderstood, Republicans and Democrats, investing in infrastructure \nproduces returns.\n  New Hampshire and the rest of our country need this investment that \nthis legislation pending before us would provide. Our unemployed need \nthe work. Our businesses need to know we are going to make these \ninvestments so they can depend on this certainty for their long-term \ngrowth and competitiveness.\n  So I hope, as we come to this vote today on the motion to proceed to \nthis legislation, my colleagues, particularly those across the aisle, \nwill give up their opposition to this legislation. I know they know how \ncritical it is to invest in our infrastructure. So this is something we \nall ought to come together around. Just because this is a proposal that \nhas been put forward by the President is not a reason not to support \nit.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support the passage of this legislation. \nLet's make these investments. Let's put people back to work. Let's make \nsure we are going to be competitive in the future. Thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, we know that investment in our \ninfrastructure means jobs and economic development now and in the \nfuture. We know as a country that in the fifties, sixties, seventies, \nand eighties we built infrastructure--highways, bridges, water, sewer, \ncommunity colleges, medical research, modernizing high schools--all the \nthings we did in the postwar years for five decades, in the forties \nthrough the eighties. The world had never seen this before.\n  We know that American prosperity--the postwar prosperity--in large \npart was based on the foundation we had set in infrastructure--again, \nthe physical infrastructure of bridges across the Ohio River joining \nthe Presiding Officer's State and mine in Huntington, Ironton, \nParkersburg, Marietta, and Wheeling, and across to Belmont County in \nOhio. We know that the infrastructure of building community colleges \nsuch as Jeff Tech and building branch campuses at OU, and now building \nbroadband, but then funding medical care--those things created the \nlong-time prosperity of our country.\n\n[[Page S7099]]\n\nThese are forward-thinking investments with payoffs that last for \ndecades and benefit our Nation, our small businesses, and our workers \nfor generations.\n  History tells us that our Nation's infrastructure has been critical \nto our Nation's economic, competitive, and industrial strength. Let's \nlook back a bit. Abraham Lincoln created the transcontinental railroad. \nThousands of jobs were created, and the development of the American \nWest was possible. President Roosevelt modernized our Nation's electric \ngrid during the New Deal. More than just electricity came to the \nTennessee Valley in rural America. Americans were put to work setting \nthe poles, stringing wire, building the hydroelectric dams that \nimproved the quality of life, and attracting countless businesses to \nthe region. So the infrastructure was built, creating jobs. But even \nmore so, the foundation was set where many more jobs were created.\n  President Eisenhower and the Congress established our interstate \ntransportation system. A generation of workers carved out highways and \nroadways, allowing commerce and people to travel from coast to coast.\n  Our Nation used its postwar infrastructure boom to become the \neconomic superpower that we are today. Public work investments not only \ncreate good-paying, middle-class construction jobs, they spur economic \ndevelopment projects in small towns and rural communities and urban \nareas. We know what happens when a highway comes into a community, what \nit does to spawn other kinds of work. It serves as a multiplier effect \nand attracts businesses and workers and foreign companies to build in \nAmerica, and benefits from that clear competitive advantage. That is \nwhy we led the world for five decades.\n  It is clear that when companies decide where to locate or expand or \ninvest, that infrastructure, broadband, energy, transportation, all are \ncritical factors in the decision. Businesses rely on solid \ninfrastructure.\n  Companies such as Ohio's Proctor & Gamble in Cincinnati recognize \nthat our infrastructure provides a competitive advantage, enabling them \nto ship their products anywhere in the world. Ohio manufacturers, such \nas General Motors and Honda and Smuckers, rely upon our infrastructure \nas they operate with just-in-time manufacturing.\n  Yet we are falling behind in maintaining the very infrastructure that \nmade us a superpower. Unsafe bridges have cost lives. Clogged roads and \ncongested air space cost billions of dollars in lost trade and \nproductivity. Some people tell us they spend more time commuting than \nthey are at home with their families.\n  We are seeing 19th century water and sewer systems failing our 21st \ncentury cities. Meanwhile, more and more people depend on these \nservices, while cities and States can't meet demand--where States face \nbudget and revenue shortfalls that make these investments difficult, if \nnot impossible.\n  And there is China--which is fast becoming one of our chief economic \ncompetitors--building more roads, better airports, and faster rail \nsystems than we are. Why do we let that happen? No one in this \nCongress--nobody--and in State legislatures, as Senator Shaheen said \nearlier--should be proud of the condition of our roads. No one in this \nCongress should be proud of the fact the newest airports and train \nstations are being built somewhere far from our shores. Yet there \nremains an unwillingness here--and I am still incredulous about this--\nto make the sort of investments necessary to improve our Nation's \ninfrastructure.\n\n  I guess we have to cut taxes more for rich people instead of asking \nthem to pay a little more to put that money into infrastructure. \nHistorically, infrastructure has been bipartisan. I have heard some of \nmy colleagues saying there is no such thing as a Democratic or \nRepublican bridge. But it seems there is now because we see time and \ntime again some of my conservative colleagues saying: No, we are not \ngoing to spend money on infrastructure. We are not going to do that.\n  Let me show a picture of a bridge I have been across many times. I \nhave seen it from Cincinnati many times. This is a view from the \nKentucky side. This is called the Brent Spence Bridge. The President \nwas there not too long ago. I was not with him that day, but I have \nbeen on this bridge many times. It was named after a Congressman from \nKentucky who served from 1931 to 1963. The bridge was inaugurated by \nPresident Johnson. So the bridge construction began and came later.\n  This is I-75 through Cincinnati, going from Kentucky to Cincinnati \ninto Dayton, if you can follow it all the way north, and then into \nToledo and ultimately into Detroit. This bridge carries millions of \ndollars' worth of freight and millions of drivers across the bridge. \nSomeone said this bridge accounts, perhaps, for as much as 4 percent of \nour gross domestic product going either north or south across this \nbridge.\n  Today, the Brent Spence Bridge is 1 of 15 the U.S. Department of \nTransportation has deemed functionally obsolete. But the Brent Spence \nbridge is not alone. We can see there is no real space if a car breaks \ndown. There is not much of a lane to get over if someone has a heart \nattack while driving or all the problems one can imagine having while \non the bridge. This is major, major bridge across one of the most \nimportant rivers in this country--the Ohio River.\n  A recent study of our Nation's infrastructure found there are more--\nget this--more structurally deficient bridges in the United States than \nthere are McDonald's restaurants. Think about that: There are 14,000 \nMcDonald's restaurants. But according to Transportation for America, \nthere are 18,000 deficient bridges and 70,000 structurally deficient \nbridges.\n  From a public safety and commerce perspective, fixing a bridge is a \nnecessity. The largest hurdle remains financing. Under the President's \nproposal we will vote on this afternoon, more than $60 billion, \ncompletely paid for, would go toward road and bridge construction, \nfixing our airports and transit systems. It would make our roads and \nskies safer for transportation.\n  The bill includes a national infrastructure bank that would fund \ninfrastructure projects of regional or national significance, such as \nthis almost 50-year-old bridge. Increasing private sector \ninfrastructure lending, a national infrastructure bank could couple \nFederal loans with private equity, ensuring a private-public \npartnership that meets local needs.\n  For the Brent Spence Bridge, it would mean Ohio and Kentucky could \nobtain the necessary funding to complete the project ahead of schedule, \ncreate jobs, and protect the public safety.\n  We have to do this. We have to renovate and update our \ninfrastructure. Why wait? Interest rates are as low as they have almost \never been. Construction costs--because there is so much competition \namong construction companies to get work now--are as low in historical \ntimes as perhaps they have ever been, and we need this work now because \nof the job employment situation. So we will benefit from replacing and \nfixing this bridge for years into the future.\n  For freight rail investments in Columbus, it would mean reducing the \nbottlenecks that prevent goods from moving across the country. For \nairports, it means reducing congestion and improving runways; on our \nrivers, such as the Ohio River, it means fixing locks that slow barge \ntraffic.\n  Lake Erie, at the other end of my State, has made such a difference \nin the settlement of Buffalo--although there is also Lake Ontario \nthere--Cleveland, Ashtabula, and Toledo. We know what these Great Lakes \nhave done for the economic development of our country. It means fixing \nthese ports. For all our States, it means jobs and economic \ndevelopment.\n  This is about a construction manufacturer in Peoria selling equipment \nto contractors working at the Port of Toledo. It is about dock workers \nloading American-made steel and Ohio-grown soybeans for export to \nmarkets around the world. That is what this bill is about.\n  This bill is about jobs now. It is about setting the table for jobs \nin the future. We know that. Republicans and Democrats alike know that. \nYet Republicans, I guess, just want to see Barack Obama fail. That is \nwhat the Republican leader has said repeatedly, though I don't \nunderstand that. But that is what he says.\n\n[[Page S7100]]\n\n  This bill is fully paid for. The bill before the Senate is funded by \na very small tax on people making over $1 million a year. If someone is \nmaking $1 million a year, their taxes will not go up, but they will pay \na little bit of money on the second million they make. So this isn't in \nany way going after small business, it is just saying the people who \nhave done well have to pay a little more money. It is common sense and \nit is the American way.\n  We are asking those who have benefited the most--many on Wall Street, \nmany of them on Main Street--people who have done very well to make \nthis investment. We know it is infrastructure that has helped people \nmake lots of money in this country. Without infrastructure, many of \nthese companies never would have been successful.\n  World-class infrastructure is how we move goods across the country \nand export around the world--on our trucks, on our rails, on our \nbarges, and on our airplanes. It is how we get to work and school, it \nis how we attract businesses, and it is how we protect the public \nhealth, through clean water and sewer systems.\n  This will create jobs immediately--good-paying, middle-class jobs. \nThese jobs provide workers with health care and retirement. These are \nexactly the kind of jobs the Presiding Officer welcomes in Wheeling and \nCharleston and Beckley and I welcome in Portsmouth and Cleveland and \nAkron. These jobs enable people to buy a home, to save for their \nchildren's education, and to plan for their future. These jobs not only \ncreate the construction jobs we need, putting money in people's pockets \nthey will spend in the community, but they also create manufacturing \njobs in steel and cement and all kinds of materials. They also create \nlong-term jobs as companies grow because they have better \ninfrastructure.\n  This is about rebuilding our infrastructure. It is about rebuilding \nour middle class. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation later \ntoday when we vote on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                       Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to speak about an issue that \nI and most Americans, I believe, find extremely troubling and one I \nhave been seeking to have properly addressed for many years now; \nnamely, the outright corruption and blatant abuse of the American \ntaxpayer that has been taking place at the hands of Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac for decades.\n  Since they were placed in conservatorship in 2008, the two \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises--GSEs; i.e., supported by the \ntaxpayers--have soaked the American taxpayer for nearly $170 billion in \nbailouts. Just this morning, the Associated Press reported that Freddie \nMac has now requested an additional $6 billion to continue their, so \nfar in my view, failed efforts. I quote from the Associated Press:\n\n       Government-controlled mortgage giant Freddie Mac has \n     requested $6 billion in additional aid after posting a wider \n     loss in the third quarter. Freddie Mac said Thursday that it \n     lost $6 billion, or $1.86 share, in the July-September \n     quarter. That compares with a loss of $4.1 billion, or $1.25 \n     a share, in the same quarter of 2010. The government rescued \n     McLean, Virginia-based Freddie Mac and sibling company Fannie \n     Mae in September 2008 after massive losses on risky mortgages \n     threatened to topple them. Since then, a Federal regulator \n     has controlled their financial decisions. Taxpayers have \n     spent about $169 billion to rescue Fannie and Freddie, the \n     most expensive bailout of the 2008 financial crisis. The \n     government estimates it will cost at least $51 billion more \n     to support the companies through 2014, and as much as $142 \n     billion in the most extreme case.\n       Freddie and Washington-based Fannie own or guarantee about \n     half of all U.S. mortgages, or nearly 31 million home loans \n     worth more than $5 trillion. Along with other federal \n     agencies, they backed nearly 90 percent of new mortgages over \n     the past year. The two mortgage giants buy home loans from \n     banks and other lenders, package them into bonds--\n\n  Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So here we are. We have spent $169 \nbillion and now they are asking for $6 billion more. What do we find \nout? Fannie and Freddie now will dole out big bonuses. I am not making \nthis up.\n  Quoting now from a Politico article:\n\n       The Federal Housing Finance Agency, the government \n     regulator for Fannie and Freddie, approved $12.79 million in \n     bonus pay after 10 executives from the two government-\n     sponsored corporations last year met modest performance \n     targets tied to modifying mortgages in jeopardy of \n     foreclosure. The executives got the bonuses about two years \n     after the federally backed mortgage giants received nearly \n     $170 billion in taxpayer bailouts--and despite pledges by \n     FHFA, the office tasked with keeping them solvent, that it \n     would adjust the level of CEO-level pay after critics slammed \n     huge compensation packages paid out to former Fannie Mae CEO \n     Franklin Raines and others.\n\n  I might add, these huge bonuses and packages that were given to Mr. \nJohnson, Mr. Raines, and many others--and there is clear evidence of \nthis--was done by cooking the books. Yet not a one of them has been \nheld accountable in any way, shape or form.\n  Continuing to quote from the article:\n\n       Securities and Exchange Commission documents show that Ed \n     Haldeman, who announced last week that he is stepping down as \n     Freddie Mac's CEO, received a base salary of $900,000 last \n     year yet took home an additional $2.3 million in bonus pay. \n     Records show other Fannie and Freddie executives got similar \n     Wall Street-style compensation packages; Fannie Mae's CEO \n     Michael Williams, for example, got $2.37 million in \n     performance bonuses.\n\n  That was after the taxpayers paid $160 billion. That is why they are \non the hook for another $6 billion and God knows how much more. So we \nare giving these individuals $900,000 a year in salary, millions of \ndollars in bonus pay, and who in the world is the Federal Housing \nFinance Agency to award these bonuses?\n  FHFA's Acting Director Edward DeMarco--and I must admit to my \ncolleagues I had not heard of Mr. DeMarco--told Congress last year that \nthe managers who were at the helms of the mortgage companies during the \nmarket collapse were dismissed but also argued that generous pay helps \nlure ``experienced, qualified'' executives able to manage upward of $5 \ntrillion in mortgage holdings.\n  Whatever happened to asking patriotic Americans to come and serve and \nhelp homeowners out of this crisis? Whatever happened to patriotic \nAmericans who would serve and help the nearly half of all homeowners in \nmy State of Arizona whose mortgages are underwater?\n  DeMarco told lawmakers he is concerned that suggestions to apply a \nFederal pay system to non-Federal employees could put the companies in \njeopardy of mismanagement--could put the companies in jeopardy of \nmismanagement--and result in another taxpayer bailout. They just asked \nfor $6 billion more. He said the compensation packages at Fannie and \nFreddie are part of the plan to return them to solvency while reducing \ncosts to the taxpayers.\n  A March report by FHFA's inspector general--obviously ignored by Mr. \nDeMarco--said the agency ``lacks key controls necessary to monitor'' \nexecutive compensation, nor has it developed written procedures for \nevaluating those packages. In other words, the beat goes on. Business \nas usual, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\n  It is unconscionable. It has been proven time and time again that \nFannie and Freddie Mac are synonymous with mismanagement, waste, \noutright corruption, and fraud. And their Federal regulator has the \naudacity to approve $12.8 million in executive bonuses to people who \nmake $900,000 per year. This body should be ashamed if we let this \nhappen, especially in these economic times. Every day more and more \nAmericans are losing their jobs and their homes, and we are allowing \nthese people to take home annual salaries of $900,000 and bonuses of \nmillions of dollars, all while they ask the taxpayers for $6 million \nmore today.\n  It has come to my attention that some of my colleagues are writing \nletters, calling for committee hearings on this issue. Letters are \nfine, hearings are fine, hearings are great. They are not the answer. \nThe answer is for us to stop it from happening, and we can do that with \nan amendment on the pending appropriations bill. I will be offering an \namendment, and I hope all of my colleagues would join in.\n  Let me just bring the attention of my colleagues to a book called \n``Reckless Endangerment,'' written by Gretchen Morgenson and Joshua \nRosner. The title of it is ``How Outside Ambition, Greed and Corruption \nLed to Economic Armageddon.'' So we are talking about pay and bonuses, \nand I read from the book:\n\n       Because bonuses at Fannie Mae were largely based on per-\n     share earnings growth, it was\n\n[[Page S7101]]\n\n     paramount to keep profits escalating to guarantee bonus \n     payouts. And in 1998, top Fannie officials had begun \n     manipulating the company's results by dipping into various \n     profit cookie jars to produce the level of income necessary \n     to generate bonus payouts to top management.\n       Federal investigators later found that you could predict \n     what Fannie's earnings-per-share would be at year-end, almost \n     to the penny, if you knew the maximum earnings-per-share \n     bonus payout target set by management at the beginning of \n     each year. Between 1998 and 2002, actual earnings and the \n     bonus payout target differed only by a fraction of a cent, \n     the investigators found.\n       Investigators uncovered documents from 1998 detailing the \n     tactics used by Leeane Spencer, a finance official at Fannie, \n     to make the company's $2.48 per-share bonus target. That \n     year, Fannie Mae earned $2.4764 per share.\n       In a mid-November memo to her superiors, Spencer forecast \n     that the company was on track to earn $2.4744 per share, just \n     shy of what was needed to generate maximum bonus payments to \n     executives.\n\n  Look, this story goes on in this book. It goes on and on how the \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac executives intentionally ripped off the \nAmerican people, describing profits in a way that was totally false, \ngetting tens of millions in bonuses. This is a government-sponsored \nenterprise. Mr. Johnson, bailed out with $100 million or so of \ntaxpayers' bonuses:\n\n       In 1999, Johnson joined Goldman's board, stepping into a \n     highly lucrative position that offered rich investment \n     opportunities overseen by the firm and opened doors for \n     Johnson around the world. In 2000, the Goldman board position \n     paid Johnson $50,000, not counting stock awards.\n\n  With brokerage firms such as Goldman Sachs, which flourished from the \nfees by underwriting securities issued by Fannie and Freddie, with fees \ntotalling $100 million a year, guess who came on Fannie's board. Mr. \nJohnson.\n\n       Johnson was still on the board in 2010, when the Securities \n     and Exchange Commission sued the investment bank for \n     securities fraud related to its sale of a dubious mortgage \n     security. By that time, Johnson was earning almost $500,000 \n     for his work on the Goldman board.\n       The accounting fraud at Fannie went undiscovered until 2005 \n     when an investigation by OFHEO unearthed it. In a voluminous, \n     intensely detailed 2006 report, OFHEO noted that if Fannie \n     Mae had used appropriate accounting methods in 1998, the \n     company's performance would have generated no executive \n     bonuses at all.\n       A lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission \n     in 2006 said the company's 1998 results were ``intentionally \n     manipulated to trigger management bonuses.''\n       Although a highly kept secret at the time, Johnson's--\n\n  This is Mr. James Johnson--\n\n       Johnson's bonus for 1998 was $1.9 million, investigators \n     determined. It later emerged that the company had made \n     inaccurate disclosures when it said Johnson earned a total of \n     almost $7 million in 1998. In actuality, his total \n     compensation that year was like $21 million, OFHEO said, \n     referring to an internal Fannie Mae analysis it had turned \n     up.\n\n  So one of the great scams in American history is going on, and the \npeople responsible for it have never been held responsible. They have \nnever been held responsible. I refer my colleagues, take a look at this \nbook, and I recommend taking blood pressure medicine before you read \nit.\n  Now, here we are, business as usual in Washington. The approval \nrating of Congress is now down to 9 percent. As I have said \ncontinuously, we are down to paid staffers and blood relatives.\n  Why aren't they happy with us? Why haven't we solved the housing \ncrisis in America? Why is it that half the homes in Arizona are still \nunderwater, worth less than their mortgages, while the financial \ninstitutions on Wall Street are doing just fine, with record profits, \nand Fannie and Freddie continue to act as if they did nothing wrong? \nAnd to add insult to injury, after a third quarter loss of $6 billion, \nthey are going to get millions of dollars in bonuses.\n  I may be a bit of an idealist, but I will bet you there are some \npatriotic, talented Americans who would be willing to serve on Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac without being paid $900,000 a year and millions of \ndollars in bonuses. I really believe that. I really believe that. Yes, \npeople are sitting in around the country; and, yes, I don't agree with \na lot of their agenda. But when they read of things like this, their \nanger is justified. Already, $170 billion in bailouts. This morning, an \nadditional $6 billion. Yet the American taxpayer is told they are \nmaking progress? And who has been held responsible at these \norganizations, at these government-sponsored enterprises that were \nresponsible? To my knowledge, no one.\n  So it seems to me the least we can do is cancel these bonuses, make \nsure it doesn't happen, and maybe ask for some qualified, experienced, \ntalented Americans to come in and take over this agency. And the first \nguy I think ought to go is the guy who approved these payouts, Mr. \nEdward J. DeMarco.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I couldn't agree more with the Senator who \njust spoke that we are in a situation where the all-time approval \nrating of this body seems to have reached an all-time low. There are \njustified reasons for the frustration and for the anger of a very broad \nrun of our constituents, of the folks who hired us to come here from \nour States of West Virginia and Delaware, from Arizona, and others to \ntry to fix the problems confronting this country. And much of the mess, \nmany of the things that got us into this problem have not been solved.\n  I rise today to speak about one way forward out of it. I think one of \nthe reasons there is so much frustration with Congress and the general \npublic is there is broad support for some simple solutions to get \nAmericans back to work, to revive and strengthen our economy, and we \njust seem incapable of reaching across this partisan divide and moving \nforward. One of those is an infrastructure bank.\n  I rise today to follow up on a speech I gave yesterday about why \ninvesting in American infrastructure means investing in America's \nfuture. Infrastructure--building roads and bridges, highways and sewer \nsystems, modernizing America's backbone--enjoys very broad support from \nall across the United States, from all different sectors, because \nAmericans understand it will put folks back to work in the building \ntrades industries that have taken the hardest hit in this recession and \nin a way that will lay the groundwork for our long-term future \ncompetitiveness.\n  This is smart spending. This is investing in the best tradition of \nFederal, State, local, and private partnerships to make America more \ncompetitive for the future.\n  I want to talk about one element of the bill which I hope we will \nmove to later today, the American Infrastructure Financing Authority, \nor known more colloquially as the National Infrastructure Reinvestment \nBank.\n  If this idea sounds familiar, it is because it has already been \nintroduced. It is a bipartisan bill, the BUILD Act, championed by \nSenator Kerry and Senator Hutchison, of which I am a cosponsor, and one \nthat provides a creative financing vehicle for building infrastructure \ngoing forward.\n  Before becoming a Senator in the election just 1 year ago yesterday, \nI served for 6 years as the county executive of Delaware's largest \ncounty, and one of the services our county was responsible for was \nrunning a county-wide sewer system. We had 1,800 miles of sanitary \nsewer, and it was a constant challenge to maintain. That is a lot of \npipe, a lot of pump stations, and a lot of sewage backing up in \npeople's homes in the middle of the night, which led to a lot of \naggravated calls from constituents.\n  It was an aging system like so much of America's infrastructure, one \nin which we had underinvested for too long. From personal experience, I \ncan tell you that the lack of infrastructure, of adequate sewer \ncapacity was a major to barrier to future growth. So, too, across \nStates and counties and cities all over this country. Where the roads \nand rail, the ports, and the sewer systems aren't up to current global \nstandards, we can't expect to grow to meet our global competitors.\n  When we talk about capital infrastructure improvements at the local \nlevel in the government I used to be with, it wasn't some wish list. \nThis wasn't some future technology. This wasn't some risky investment. \nIt was triage. It was critically needed investment in pipes in the \nground that would protect our water, strengthen our community, and grow \nour economy.\n  As a nation, the American Society of Civil Engineers has told us we \nneed $2.2 trillion over just the next 5 years in infrastructure \ninvestments to keep America moving forward. We are talking about fixing \nunsafe bridges, dealing with clogged highways, and rebuilding\n\n[[Page S7102]]\n\nairports so they can handle larger modern aircraft safely. That is an \nenormous scope, $2.2 trillion over just the next 5 years. We are \nalready asking so much of the supercommittee in terms of finding \ndramatic savings and reductions in Federal spending. Where will this \nlevel of investment come from to put America back to work?\n  So, in my view, we have to get creative. We have to leverage. We have \nto bring in more resources than are currently on the field, and \nespecially now, especially in this country I think we have to be smart \nabout how we spend our funds.\n  The Rebuild America Jobs Act, to which I hope we will be moving later \nthis afternoon, would put $50 billion directly into infrastructure, put \n$10 billion as a downpayment into making possible this new \ninfrastructure bank, seed money that makes possible loans and loan \nguarantees--not grants--for a wide range of infrastructure projects, \nincluding energy, water, and critically needed transportation. \nRemember, we need more than $400 billion a year in investment right now \njust to keep up. But we all know the constrained budgets of our \ncounties, State, and local governments can't get the financing they \nneed. This infrastructure bank would provide the leverage, a vehicle to \nfinance desperately needed projects.\n  Just a few things about it. It would be for big projects, projects \nthat cost more than $25 million in rural communities, $100 million in \nthe rest of the country. It would only be allowed to finance up to 50 \npercent of a project to avoid crowding out private capital and to make \nsure that private capital has skin in the game so it is a viable \nproject. It is my expectation, in fact, that the infrastructure bank \nwould finance a much smaller piece of most projects, just enough to \nbring private investment to the table. It would be government-owned but \nindependently operated, have its own bipartisan board of directors, and \nfunction much like the successful Ex-Im.\n  An infrastructure bank passed by the Senate this week could provide \nup to $160 billion in direct financial assistance over its first 10 \nyears to infrastructure for transportation. That would be paired with \nprivate investment that could double, triple, or even quadruple, \nincreasing the full impact of this bank.\n\n  I said yesterday that infrastructure is a smart investment for our \ncountry and that a national infrastructure bank as a part of that \nstrategy would provide a vehicle for the private sector to get in on \nthis investment as well and to help us accelerate our move toward the \nfuture. This is smart policy.\n  It is a funny thing about infrastructure, how we inevitably take it \nfor granted. Whether you are running a State highway system or a county \nsewer system, you never know how much people miss it until it isn't \nworking the way they expect.\n  Unfortunately, in cities, counties, and States across our country \ntoday, companies and communities are discovering that our aged \ninfrastructure is imposing costs on us we cannot bear. The American \nSociety of Civil Engineers, which I have referred to before, recently \nreleased a study saying that our Nation's deteriorating surface \ntransportation infrastructure alone could result in the loss of nearly \n1 million jobs and will suppress our GDP growth by nearly $1 billion \nbetween now and 2020. That is an enormous loss of future economic \nactivity.\n  We cannot put this off any further. As a country, we cannot keep \nswerving to avoid these potholes on the path to prosperity. Eventually \nwe are going to hit them, and eventually they will continue to be a \ndrag on our Nation. The Rebuild America Jobs Act would fill these \npotholes, would patch these pipes, would lay the new runways to allow \nAmerica's economy to take off.\n  This Rebuild America Jobs Act, which would rebuild 150,000 miles of \nroadway, maintain 4,000 miles of train track, upgrade 150 miles of \nairport runways, restore critical drinking water and wastewater \nsystems, is nothing short of the smart investment we need to be \ncompetitive for the future. It would put people back to work, it would \nsteer us on the right road to sustained recovery, and it would fix the \nproblems that lie right in our path as we try to do our jobs for the \nfolks who hired us to come here and help them get back to work.\n  We need to act today. It is my hope that my colleagues will join us \nthis afternoon in voting for the motion to proceed to the Rebuild \nAmerica Jobs Act, a critical piece of which is this smart \ninfrastructure bank.\n\n\n                   The Nomination of Richard Andrews\n\n  Mr. President, I move now briefly to support the nomination of \nRichard Andrews, who has been nominated to be U.S. district court judge \nfor the District of Delaware. Rich Andrews is an exceptional lawyer, a \ndedicated public servant, and a good man. When the Senate confirms his \nnomination, hopefully later today, Rich will become the fourth active \njudge serving in the District of Delaware. This will mark the very \nfirst time in 5 years that this very busy court will operate without a \nvacancy. For a small district such as Delaware, albeit one with such a \nspecialized and complex caseload, even a single vacancy places a \nsignificant burden on the court.\n  Mr. Andrews' nomination has been pending 177 days, and while I am \ngrateful for the consent agreement that I hope will allow his \nnomination to be considered today, I remain concerned that such a \nnoncontroversial and qualified nominee as Rich could take nearly half a \nyear to reach floor consideration. The judicial vacancy rate hovers \nnear 10 percent, we have 31 judicial emergencies, and it is my hope \nthat this body will continue to move expeditiously to fill vacancies \nthroughout the country.\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I had a chance to chair the \nnominations hearing for Rich and to take part in the committee's \nconsideration of his nomination. I have reviewed his record, listened \nto his testimony, met with him personally, conferred with my senior \nSenator, Mr. Carper, and as a result of all this, I assure my \ncolleagues I have every confidence that Rich is a qualified judge and \nwill serve Delaware and this Nation brilliantly.\n  During his 30 years of service for Delaware so far, he has \nestablished himself as a talented, dedicated, and humble public servant \nwho possesses the strongest work ethic and the highest integrity and \nintellect.\n  He began his service to our State when, after graduating from \nBerkeley Law School, he came to Delaware as a law clerk for Chief Judge \nCollin Seitz of the Third Circuit. Luckily for us, he never left.\n  After completing his clerkship, he joined the U.S. Attorney's Office \nfor the District of Delaware, where he spent the next 24 years, much of \nit serving as the first assistant U.S. attorney and chief of the \nCriminal Division. During this time, he has tried, in that role, more \nthan 50 felony jury cases and argued 17 cases before the Third Circuit \nCourt of Appeals.\n  Since leaving the U.S. Attorney's Office in 2007, he has served as \nState prosecutor for the Delaware Department of Justice and leads more \nthan 70 deputy attorneys general in the Criminal Division and has \noverseen tens of thousands of prosecutions each year. I am confident \nthat his experiences as a prosecutor have given him the knowledge, \nskills, and temperament to join and serve ably on the District of \nDelaware Federal bench.\n  When I chaired his nomination hearing, I was impressed by his \nprofessionalism, intelligence, and demeanor. Rich enjoys broad \nbipartisan support, having been reported unanimously by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join Senator Carper and me in supporting \nMr. Andrews so he will have the opportunity to continue his selfless \nservice to the people of our State and our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. I also ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Rhode \nIsland be recognized immediately after me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Human Trafficking and Slavery\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today for a moment to \nintroduce an issue I have become interested in in the last few months, \none that, quite frankly, I didn't know a lot about--the issue of human \ntrafficking and slavery.\n\n[[Page S7103]]\n\n  For many Americans, for many of us in the 21st century, we think of \nslavery as a concept of the 18th and 19th centuries, something that \nhappened in other places a long time ago, when, in fact, it exists \ntoday around the world. The issue is actually pretty startling. The \nState Department estimates that there are between 700,000 and 800,000 \npeople in the world each year who are trafficked. The number of people \ntrafficked in the United States is about 16,000 to 17,000. That is a \nlot of people in the 21st century who are being trafficked and are held \nin bondage. I saw a special on a cable network recently that outlined \nthis issue. I then started researching it. I was shocked to learn that \nmy home State of Florida is particularly affected by this issue.\n  Recently, I had the honor and the privilege of being appointed to the \nHelsinki Commission, the group here in the Senate that works, along \nwith the House of Representatives, as Commissioners on that Commission. \nWe held a hearing yesterday on the issue of human trafficking, and it \nis an issue I am going to be increasingly speaking about over the next \nfew weeks because I truly believe it is one of the great humanitarian \ncauses of this new century. It begins with awareness, with a clear \nunderstanding of what is happening around the world with regard to this \nissue, the fact that there are these people. As we speak, as I \nstand here today, perhaps within walking distance of this very building \nthere are people held against their will in servitude.\n\n  The one that gets all the publicity--and rightfully so because it is \nso painful and outrageous--is sex trafficking, children and young girls \nand young women brought into this country and held against their will \nas sex slaves. It happens all over the world. It is sad to learn there \nare governments around the world that cooperate with this and tolerate \nit and are corrupted by it. That gets a lot of publicity and attention, \nand we are going to be paying a lot of attention to that.\n  We heard stories of diplomats who work in this city, diplomats from \nother nations who come here and bring domestic workers with them to \ntheir homes and hold them here against their will and take their entire \npaycheck. We are going to be denouncing some of these people on the \nfloor by name in the weeks and months to come.\n  The other thing that is shocking--although I said the sex trafficking \ngets a lot of attention--is the forced-labor aspect of it. People are \nrecruited in other countries, brought here, and they are told: We are \ngoing to bring you to the United States, and you are going to come \nhere, you will make a living, make some money, and you can send some \nback home. When they get here, they are held against their will, and \nthey are not paid. In fact, sometimes they owe traffickers money, and \nthey are held in squalid conditions. That is happening here in this \ncountry underneath our very noses, not to mention the egregious cases \naround the world, and we are going to focus on those cases around the \nworld as well.\n  The State Department, by the way, ranks every country on the basis of \nhow much they cooperate, on the progress they are making in prosecuting \nand investigating these issues. Those are available. A report came out \nrecently. It identified the countries that are doing well, the \ncountries that are trying to do well, and the countries that, frankly, \ncouldn't care less and actually do not mind this stuff going on in \ntheir jurisdiction. They deserve to be condemned not just on this floor \nbut in the international community, and we will talk about that as well \nin the weeks to come.\n  I do not think we can point the finger at anyone unless we look at \nourselves as a nation and society and call attention to this issue. So, \nas I begin to introduce this issue and my involvement in it, there are \na couple of things I would like to point out from yesterday's hearing.\n  The first is that this is largely occurring as a result of criminal \nenterprises. The same people who traffic drugs and are involved in all \nkinds of organized crime are also involved in human trafficking. We see \nthat increasingly in major areas, and we have seen prosecutions, but we \nhave also learned that increasingly what we are finding are small-scale \noperations, sometimes families.\n  We heard the case of a mother and her two sons who were involved in a \nhuman trafficking ring. It is very profitable, very lucrative. It costs \nabout $10,000 to bring a young woman into this country, and they can \nmake that money back in the sex trade within a few days, and after that \nit is all profit. It is outrageous and has opened the door to small-\nscale operations that are doing this.\n  What are the impediments to dealing with this? There are a few, and \nit will take a long time to work on.\n  The first, unfortunately, is lack of recognition. I think that at the \nlocal level and even at the Federal level, our law enforcement officers \nand personnel who want to do the right thing probably need more \ninformation about identifying these cases, seeing the markers of human \ntrafficking, identifying cases that clearly reek of human trafficking, \nand identifying those and treating them for what they are.\n  The second thing we need is better protections for these victims. You \nknow you are not going to be able to prosecute people and put them in \njail unless the victims are willing to testify, and victims are not \ngoing to testify if they don't feel secure. If they believe you are \ngoing to deport them or put them in immigration jails or, worse, if \nthey think these organized crime rings are going to harm their families \noverseas, it is going to be very hard to get victims to cooperate.\n  Last but not least--and I know this is a complicated issue--our \nimmigration system is contributing to this. We have a very complicated \nimmigration system, and it is an expensive one, a burdensome one. What \nit is creating is the need for middlemen, and, guess what, more often \nthan not, unfortunately, nowadays the middlemen, these foreign labor \nagencies--too many of them--are, in fact, human traffickers who are \nutilizing this system, the legal immigration system, to bring people \ninto this country and, once they are here, to hold them against their \nwill. We have to focus on that because ultimately that has to be \nsolved. Our legal immigration system has to be modernized. If it is \nnot, one of the problems we will continue to face is this issue of \nhuman trafficking.\n  The good news is that here in Congress there is a bill--\nreauthorization of the TVPRA. It passed out of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee in October of this year by a 12-to-6 vote. It does a few \nthings.\n  It promotes increased cooperation among Federal agencies, between the \nUnited States and other countries.\n  It supports and enhances the victim-centered approach, which \nbasically says we are going to approach this from the viewpoint of the \nvictim and create protections and security for the victims so they can \ncooperate and help us prosecute these people.\n  The bill focuses on cutting off human trafficking at its roots by \nsupporting international efforts to focus on this issue. There are a \nlot of countries out there that want to do the right thing; they either \ndo not have the resources or knowledge base to do it. There are some \ncountries out there that do not mind this. In fact, they cooperate with \nthis stuff. They like that it is going on in their countries. They are \non the take, so to speak. They need to be called out for what they are \ndoing as well.\n  Finally, it promotes accountability. It ensures that the Federal \nfunds are being used for their intended purposes, and it reduces the \nauthorization levels to address fiscal concerns but focuses on the \nprograms that have been most effective.\n  My hope is that bill, which is a bipartisan bill, will come to this \nfloor soon and that we will have an opportunity to make it better, to \nget it passed, and to work with our colleagues in the House to send a \nvery clear message that this is a priority, that this is something we \nshould all agree on and work on together. It is a great cause to be \ninvolved in. It is one of the great humanitarian, human rights causes \nof the 21st century, and I think how we deal with it or fail to deal \nwith it will say a lot about us as a people and as a nation. I hope I \ncan encourage as many of my colleagues as possible to take up this \ncause as their own. I look forward, in the weeks to come, to coming to \nthe floor and talking more about it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n[[Page S7104]]\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Rebuild America \nJobs Act because it responds to two critical needs: the jobs crisis we \nface throughout this country and the need to improve our national \ninfrastructure, which is obvious to everyone, in every part of this \ncountry.\n  Over the 4 years of this economic crisis, the unemployment rate in \nRhode Island has been one of the highest in the Nation. It now stands \nat 10.5 percent. For many families, it has been a stressful and \ndemoralizing time. Very few have avoided the impacts of this economic \ncrisis in their own lives or in the life of someone close to them.\n  It has been particularly devastating for those involved in \nconstruction, a sector where more than 2 million Americans, including \n7,000 Rhode Islanders, have lost their jobs since 2007. It is \nfrustrating for these workers because all around them they can see the \nneed to maintain and improve our infrastructure, which, by the way, is \nessential to the free-flow of commerce and the economic prosperity of \nthe country going forward. Indeed, all of us, regardless of our \neconomic status, benefit from a sound transportation system.\n  A few weeks ago, Senator Whitehouse and I joined Rhode Island \ntransportation officials at the Providence Viaduct. This is a 1,300-\nfoot stretch of Interstate 95 that runs directly through the heart of \nProvidence, RI, our capital city. It connects New York and Boston and \nthe whole north-south highway system on the east coast. It is one of \n155 bridges in our State alone that have been found to be structurally \ndeficient. It must be replaced within the next few years. It no longer \ncan be repaired time and time again; it has to be replaced. If it is \nnot replaced, then traffic will have to be rerouted, which will have a \nmajor impact on our economy and the regional economy. Route 95 is the \nhighway link between New York City and Boston. If suddenly you put up a \nroadblock in that highway link and restrict traffic to one lane, you \nare going to see economic activity throughout the Northeast affected. \nAlready, the Rhode Island Department of Transportation has installed \nwooden planks beneath the viaduct to catch any concrete or debris \nbefore it falls on cars and pedestrians below. That is an example of \nthe first signs of the increasing decay. This is the kind of \ncommonsense project this jobs bill addresses, but it is not the only \none.\n\n  Indeed, 21 percent of Rhode Island's bridges are listed as \nstructurally deficient, while nearly 30 percent are functionally \nobsolete. There is a huge amount of work that we can do to improve \nexisting conditions that make us more productive going forward. For \nRhode Islanders, passing this jobs bill would translate into \napproximately $141 million of highway funding to help us respond to \nthese obvious needs. Moreover, it would provide approximately $21 \nmillion in transit funding, which would provide a real shot in the arm \nto help maintain an efficient public transportation system. We take \npride in that. We have a statewide transportation system. It is \noriented around our bus system. It travels the length and breadth of \nthe State. It is very efficient, but it needs support, and this bill \nwould help provide that support.\n  The bill would also provide funding for airport improvements, which \ncould help Rhode Island's major airport, T.F. Green Airport, with a \nmajor runway safety and expansion project. This project would make air \ntravel not only safer, but it would make our airport more capable of \nintercontinental and international service. Right now we don't have \nthat effective option. If we did, that would be a huge multiplier for \nour economy, and it is based on sound infrastructure improvement.\n  These are not new, novel techniques or new, advanced technologies. \nThis is old-fashioned extending a runway, fixing a bridge, getting the \neconomy moving again. Everyone understands that. Everyone on Main \nStreet and East Street and South Street and West Street in every corner \nof this country understands that, and we have always done it, and this \nbill will help us do it.\n  Finally, the bill establishes a national infrastructure bank, which I \nbelieve can play a critical role in financing these projects going \nforward. These projects would include clean water projects, energy \nprojects, as well as transportation projects. There is absolutely no \ndoubt that these investments in infrastructure will benefit our \neconomy.\n  According to economist Mark Zandi, every dollar invested in these \ntypes of projects will generate approximately $1.59 in economic \nactivity, so there is a significant multiplier effect. Importantly, it \nis part of getting us moving again and building up a self-sustaining \nmomentum. Again, these projects will employ private companies that will \nhire individuals in all of our home States to begin the work that must \nbe done to improve our infrastructure, to provide the kind of vital \ntransportation links that are critical to any economy. It is also very \nimportant to know that this proposal is fully paid for, and you have \nboth business and labor supporting the investments in the bill.\n  I would hope we could all join together in a sign of not just common \nunity but common sense and adopt this provision. Build infrastructure. \nIt is paid for, and it puts people to work. That is what the American \npublic is asking us to do and we should do it.\n  I want to comment briefly on the Republican alternative proposal. It \nfails to provide the investment to deal with the infrastructure and the \njob crisis we face today. In fact, it does the opposite. It effectively \ncuts $40 billion in discretionary funding without addressing the needs \nof our highway trust fund and other infrastructure improvement \nvehicles.\n  More importantly, it scales back important public health protections \nunder the EPA. The Republican package includes the so-called EPA \nRegulatory Relief Act, the REINS Act, and the Regulatory Time-Out Act. \nTogether these provisions not only threaten our economic progress but \nalso our public health, and they would nullify the EPA boiler rule. \nThis rule has been calculated to produce $10 to $24 in health benefits \nfor every dollar spent, at least a 10-to-1 ratio of health benefits \nversus dollar spent, preventing approximately 6,600 premature deaths \nand about 40,000 asthma attacks each year.\n  This translates, again, into another major crisis we face, and that \nis an affordable health care system. One way to make the health care \nsystem affordable is to prevent premature deaths, asthma attacks, and a \nhost of other things, and that is not incidental to what environmental \nprotection does. That is at the heart of environmental protection.\n  Finally, it would place a moratorium on most regulations, including \nfinancial regulations. We have seen, sadly to our chagrin, the effect \nof lax regulation in 2008 when our financial markets were on the verge \nof collapse. Unless we have effective regulation, unless we can \neffectively deploy the new tool provided under the Dodd-Frank act, \nunless we can resource regulators to keep a watchful eye on the \nmarketplace, frankly, we are going to once again relive those very dark \nand daunting days of 2008 when we saw markets on the verge of collapse. \nAnd we do so, frankly, in a global economic environment where there are \npressures coming from Europe and pressures coming from around the \nglobe, economic pressures. If our markets are not strong and well \nregulated, can they withstand the backwash from a crisis in Greece, a \ncrisis in Italy, a crisis across the globe?\n  I do believe the legislation that has been proposed by Leader Reid--\nproposed essentially by the President--makes sense, and I hope we can \nunite in common purpose to do what is common sense and invest in \nbridges and roads in America, fully paid for, and avoid the diversion \nof this alternate proposal that would essentially impair our health, \nthe public health of America, and not advance our financial stability \nas a nation.\n  I yield the floor and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to make some brief \nremarks about a judge who is coming up for a vote, and I ask that both \nmyself and the other Senator from Wyoming be allowed to speak \nconsecutively.\n\n[[Page S7105]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Nomination of Scott Skavdahl\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Leahy and Senator \nGrassley and their staffs for moving this nomination. Because of their \nefforts, I have this opportunity to express my support for Judge Scott \nSkavdahl's nomination to serve on the bench of the U.S. District Court \nfor the District of Wyoming.\n  Although Scott grew up in Harrison, NE, it wasn't long before he made \nhis way to my home State and enrolled at the University of Wyoming. The \nuniversity must have felt like a whole new world to him because he had \njust graduated from a high school that had less than 50 students. \nStill, while others might have been intimidated, Scott saw it as \nanother of life's challenges to be faced and overcome, so he worked \nhard to complete the requirements for his undergraduate degree. In \nbetween his classes, Scott managed to find the time to pursue another \ninterest of his, as he joined and played on the university's football \nteam for 4 years.\n  After graduation, Scott made a decision that was to start him on a \npath that would set the tone and the direction of his life when he \napplied to and was accepted by the University of Wyoming Law School. \nHis classes were difficult and demanding, but Scott knew what he wanted \nto do with his life, and, as was true for him in so many things, he \njust wouldn't quit until he had accomplished what he set out to do. \nThat attitude of confidence and commitment to setting goals and \nachieving them is one of the reasons Scott has been able to establish a \nreputation for himself throughout his career as a serious and \nthoughtful litigator and as a judge. Whenever someone speaks of him, \nthey always seem to use the same words to describe him. They say he is \nincredibly smart, a hard-working attorney, and a highly competent and \ncapable judge. They also say: Although he wasn't born in Wyoming, we \nare very glad to have him.\n  Looking back over each step along the way that led him to this \nnomination, it is clear that Scott has used his time and his talents \nwisely and well. Because of his background and his experience on a \ndaily basis, Scott has come to know in detail the issues that face the \npeople of Wyoming and how the people feel about him. That is why it was \nno surprise that I have heard nothing but good things about Scott, his \napproach to the law, and his demeanor as a judge. Simply put, Scott \nknows all about the administrative ins and outs of the District of \nWyoming, and he has used his courtroom as a classroom to help us all be \ninformed and aware of the issues that come before him and the reasons \nfor his decisions on all of them.\n  At times such as these, it is always interesting to take a moment to \nlook back at someone's life and connect the dots that brought him or \nher to this important moment in time. For Scott, a childhood in \nNebraska led him to Wyoming, where he obtained the knowledge and skills \nhe needed to pursue a career in something that really interested him--\nthe law. He then used those credentials he earned in the classroom and \nhis life to move step by step through our legal and judicial system.\n  His talents and abilities soon caught the attention of former Wyoming \nGovernor Dave Freudenthal and President Obama. The President has now \nnominated him to serve in this very important post, and he has been \nunanimously voted out of committee. In and of itself, that recognition \nis a powerful endorsement of Scott's background, his ability to \ninterpret and apply the law, and his experience both in the courtroom \nand in his community. It also expresses our confidence that Scott will \ncontinue to serve as an integral part of the court system of Wyoming, \nthe West, and our Nation for many years to come.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this nomination, and I look forward \nto the Senate's approval of the nomination of Judge Scott Skavdahl.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor for my fellow Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, in the 19 years since his graduation \nfrom the University of Wyoming School of Law, Judge Skavdahl has \ndistinguished himself both as an attorney and as a trial judge.\n  After working in the private sector and clerking for U.S. district \njudge William Downes, Judge Skavdahl was appointed by former Governor \nDave Freudenthal to serve as a district judge for Wyoming's Seventh \nJudicial District.\n  During his time on the State bench, Judge Skavdahl earned the respect \nof the attorneys and the parties appearing in his court. He earned that \nrespect for his integrity and his ethics to carry out his duties. He \nearned that respect for his reasoned decisions. He earned that respect \nfor the manner in which he conducts himself in the courtroom and for \nbeing prepared and for his knowledge of the law. There is no doubt in \nmy mind that Judge Skavdahl will bring those same skills and that \nrespect for the law that he exhibited in the Seventh Judicial District \nto the Federal bench. Wyoming's Federal judges have a long tradition of \nbeing widely regarded by their peers and respected by the people who \nappear in their courts. Judge Scott Skavdahl will continue that \ntradition for many years to come.\n  I know Judge Skavdahl. I know his family. He is a judge I respect and \nadmire from a family I respect and admire. I strongly encourage all of \nthe Members of the Senate to join with Senator Enzi and join with me in \nsupporting Judge Skavdahl's nomination.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I see the Senator from West Virginia in \nthe Chamber. Is he prepared to speak? I do not want to take advantage \nof the Senator from West Virginia. I was going to speak for about 5 \nminutes, if I could.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the plan that has been introduced to the \nSenate today is an affront to common sense, the plan presented by \nSenator Reid. It is an affront to the financial condition this country \nis in. I am working and hope to be able to support a highway bill that \nwill have a modest increase in highway spending that is paid for that \ndoes not increase the debt. We can do that. It is not that hard.\n  Apparently, it is hard because nobody wants to make any tough \nchoices. They do not want to set priorities. So then it becomes very \nhard. We just want to keep everything going at the same rate. But we do \nneed to invest some money in our infrastructure to maintain it, our \nhighways, bridges, roads, and expand certain highways that need to be \nfixed. I think we should do that.\n  Senator Reid comes in with a tax increase plan, a big spending plan, \ntotaling, I think, $60 billion. We are supposed to pass this, and we \nhave not yet found the money to pay for the fundamental highway bill \nthis Congress is supposed to be working on. I believe it is wrong. I do \nnot believe it can be justified by any stretch of the imagination.\n  They say: Don't worry. We are raising taxes to fund this new \ntransportation infrastructure program. Only a small portion of it is \nthe infrastructure bank. This country is spending enough. We are \nwasting enough money now. It would be a mistake for the American people \nto allow Congress to extract more money from them to spend today on \neven a new program while we are doing nothing about the surging debt \nthat is running on in our country, while we are doing nothing about the \nSolyndra-type loan programs that are wasting money in huge amounts. \nThat loan failure alone amounts to as much money as Alabama gets from \nthe general fund, the highway bill, and infrastructure bill, period--\none loan. So we need to get our act together, and I do not believe it \nis legitimate.\n  I am the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee. I am looking at \nthese numbers, and I am astounded. So we raise taxes. One time they \nsaid we have to raise taxes to reduce our debt. Now we raise taxes to \nincrease spending on a new program, and we still do\n\n[[Page S7106]]\n\nnot have the basic $12 billion that is being looked at to be found to \nfund the basic highway bill.\n  I am flabbergasted. I do not believe it is right. I think it is some \nsort of clever gimmick that political thinkers got together and \nconjured up, that they could imagine: This will be a fun thing. We will \nbring it up on the floor. It has no chance of passage. We will bring it \nup on the floor. Republicans will oppose it, and we will accuse them of \nbeing against highways. We will accuse them of giving tax breaks to \nmillionaires. That is what we will do. That will be clever. That will \nbe fun.\n  Sometimes we have to get serious about this debt. For the third year \nin a row--we have just completed the fiscal year on September 30--we \nhave had over $1 trillion in debt. Forty percent of the money we are \nspending is borrowed. If we ever have to raise taxes--and that would be \nthe last thing--it ought to be done only after we have squeezed every \nwasteful dime out of spending in this country before we go back and ask \nthe American people to give more money to a Congress that plays games \nwith their money, that has allowed the deficits to be maintained at a \nrate beyond anything this Nation has ever seen before and are projected \nto continue indefinitely under plans that are out there from the budget \nthe President submitted to us, which, fortunately, is not going to be \naccepted.\n  We have a real problem. I wish to be on record as saying I do not \nbelieve this is a responsible way for us to proceed. I know there are a \nlot of politics around here. But we are at a point where we need to be \nthinking about a responsible way to find the funding to maintain a good \nhighway program, and that is not going to be easy. To have this bill \nthrown in here that is going to be dead as a doornail is not a good \napproach to it. We need to be worrying about that problem rather than a \nhuge new spending program, allowing a bunch of bureaucrats to pick and \nchoose where they want to send the money. That is the way the \nprogressives like to do it: We give them money and let these smart \npeople decide where to pass it around. They probably will not give any \nto West Virginia and Alabama. They have bigger projects in their minds \nthan that.\n  I wanted to share those thoughts, and I thank the Presiding Officer. \nI hope my colleagues will oppose the Reid idea that will be coming up \nlater today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, we have had a lot of conversation today. \nWe all agree we need infrastructure. On both sides of the aisle we have \nhad a good conversation. I have said before, a road is not a Democratic \nor Republican road, a bridge is not a Democratic or Republican bridge, \nnor is a water line or a sewer line. So I rise to address the competing \nproposals to build infrastructure in this country and to start getting \nAmerica back to work.\n  Earlier this week, I attended a ribbon-cutting at the Bluestone Dam \nin beautiful Hinton, WV. When they started work on that dam, I was the \nGovernor of our great State of West Virginia. I was sitting in my \noffice and said to the Corps colonel: Explain to me what the problem \ncould be.\n  He said: Maybe the bedrock, and there might be some possibilities \nwith unusual flooding where we could lose that dam, breach that dam.\n  I asked: What does that mean?\n  He said: Think of it this way, Governor. We are sitting in your \noffice in the capitol, in Charleston, WV. We would be underwater right \nnow.\n  So it brought it to reality for me, the extent of the water we are \ndealing with and the billions and billions of dollars in downstream \ncosts that would be incurred. So we decided we had to fix that. With \nthe help of our Federal Government, we started working on that way back \nin 2002, and we are going into our third phase of that project.\n  Roads and bridges are in terrible condition all over the country and \nin every part of everybody's State. Every Member of the House and every \nMember of the Senate has a road or a bridge--all 535 of us--Republicans \nand Democrats alike have a road or a bridge or a water line or a sewer \nline in our area that needs repair. As the Presiding Officer from \nDelaware had noted with the work he did for all the good people of \nDelaware, there was still an awful lot of repair that was needed.\n\n  I believe in infrastructure. In West Virginia, we say: Our economy \ncan't grow if people can't go. With that, you have to be able to be \nmobile. We also say in West Virginia: You have to drive to survive \nbecause we are one of the most rural States in the Nation. Our people \ndrive as far, if not farther, than people in most other States do for \ntheir jobs.\n  With that, we have to make sure they have the ability to get to those \ngood jobs and be able to provide for their family.\n  I have said before--and it has been heard on the floor over the last \nfew hours--that infrastructure is not a Democratic idea or a Republican \nidea. It is a commonsense idea.\n  In 2007, we Governors at that time met in Philadelphia. Knowing the \neconomy was slowing down, we asked: What can we do? We looked back in \nhistory and saw President Roosevelt, in the 1930s, basically invested \nin infrastructure. We had the WPA projects which we see today. A lot of \nus have used the projects and still are. Tremendous value was returned \nto this country and the infrastructure of this country through those \nhard-working people at that time who just needed a helping hand.\n  President Eisenhower, in the 1950s--after the Korean war, the economy \nneeded a jump-start, and we saw the Interstate Highway System being \nbuilt for a very mobile society coming off the wars. We are still using \nthat same infrastructure that was put in place then.\n  This issue is bipartisan because building infrastructure is \nbipartisan. It solves two problems. It fixes our crumbling roads and \nbridges, and it creates much needed American jobs. Of all the people in \nmy State applying for unemployment--and it might be true in most every \nState--construction workers are the biggest group of unemployed people \ntoday, with the most skill sets in America. Almost 20 percent of the \nunemployment is in the construction trades. That is unacceptable in \nthis great country when we have repairs being needed everywhere.\n  We are going to vote on two proposals today. I know one was just put \non quick order, and there is another one we are going to be voting on. \nOne is a Democratic measure, which is our Rebuild America Jobs Act, and \nthe other one is a Republican measure that funds transportation, and it \nreins in the EPA, for which I have been trying to make sure there is a \ncommonsense approach to how we balance the economy and the environment. \nIn West Virginia, I think we can do it as well if not better than most \nbecause we are dealing with those types of challenges.\n  I believe both these bills will help kick-start the economy and \ncreate American jobs--I do--and we all know we need that. I will vote \nfor both of them. One is a Democratic proposal and one is a Republican \nproposal. But I do believe I was sent here as a West Virginian to help \nmy State.\n  It is not because they are bad ideas or wrong ideas that they are \nprobably going to fail. They both have good merits to them. But as our \ngood friend from Alabama just said, it is politics of the order. That \nis what we are dealing with, and we will find reasons, probably, why we \ncan't give our support.\n  On our jobs bill, there is $60 billion--$50 billion, which I think \nthe Presiding Officer spoke so eloquently on earlier, and $10 billion \nfor an infrastructure bank. I know what an infrastructure bank does in \nmy State. In my State, we have $2 billion of need. We have a $300 \nmillion resolving account. It is the same as what we are talking about \nhere. It has helped us tremendously. But everybody comes to the table. \nWe are able to bridge some financing and put projects together that we \nnever could have done, and it is tremendously needed.\n  With that being said, it probably will not pass because our dear \nfriends on the other side of the aisle, our Republican colleagues, and \nour friends over in the Republican Party, are going to say: It has a \nseven-tenths-of-1-percent tax on incomes over $1 million--seven-tenths \nof 1 percent.\n  I can vote for that. I support that. But I also recognize that is a \nproblem for them. So in recognizing that, I am\n\n[[Page S7107]]\n\nwilling to reach out and look for other ways to pay for this. I think \nthat is the spirit we should be working in. Are there offsets or \ncredits? I think 73 of us have voted in a bipartisan fashion for an \nethanol credit. Isn't that something we could work on? How about the \nmoney we are spending in Afghanistan and Iraq and rebuilding those \nnations' infrastructures? I have said this before: If you help us build \na new bridge in West Virginia, we will not blow it up. If you help us \nbuild a new school, I guarantee we will not burn it down. We are so \nproud to say the good people all over this country have helped us in \nWest Virginia, and we like to help other people in other States. We \nwill work together. That is what we should be doing, rebuilding \nAmerica.\n  That is what I have asked of everyone: Come together. Let's make sure \nthe infrastructure need we have all over our great country is the first \nand foremost thing we are working on together because we do agree, as \nDemocrats and Republicans and as Americans, we need it. That is \nsomething I think we can come together on.\n  Let me turn now to the Republican bill, which a few hours ago I was \nnotified will be coming up. This bill is not perfect either. A 2-year \nextension of transportation spending does not give States the certainty \nthey need. We have usually had a 6-year authorization. I know when I \nwas Governor of West Virginia we did 6 years. We did our 6-year \nplanning of our roads in our State based on the Federal bill, the \nauthorization of the Federal highway bill. With only 2 years, it is \nhard to get any project completed. Sometimes it is even hard to get it \non the drawing board.\n  That being said, I am a strong supporter of reining in the EPA, which \nthis bill does. I believe we have to set our transportation priorities. \nUnfortunately, Washington and all of us here seem to have become so \ndysfunctional that politics--whether it is the party politics or the \npersonal politics--is put before the good of the country. This has to \nstop.\n  I heard one of our good Senators from Arizona this morning saying we \nare down to a 9-percent approval rating. If it was not for our staff \nand our family, we don't know if we would be within the margin of \nerror. With that being said, we have to come together. We have had \ndisagreements throughout the history of this great country, and we have \ncome together many times on very difficult issues.\n  This is one I think will challenge all of us to come together as \nAmericans. The people of West Virginia did not send me to Washington to \nplay the blame game. I have said many times, I have never fixed a \nproblem by blaming somebody else for it. I fixed a problem by \nidentifying that we had a problem and then trying to bring all sides \ntogether to fix it. That is what we need more of in Washington. I do \nnot think any of us were sent to blame each other. I think we were sent \nto work together.\n  Again, I am going to urge all my colleagues and friends on both sides \nof the aisle to focus on the next generation. We see them every week we \ncome here, our young pages. They are our next generation. We need to be \nmaking votes for them, not our next election, which will be in 2012. \nThat election is going to come and go. But if we do not give them the \nopportunity to have the building tools they need to build a foundation \nthat they can be the greatest next generation this country has ever \nseen, then I do not know what we are going to say for the future of \nthis country.\n  I, for one, am not going to vote along those lines, to where it is \ngoing to be based on what is good for me, based on what is good for the \nparty I belong to but strictly based on what is good for America and \nthis next generation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nabout 12 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Johanns pertaining to the introduction of S. 1805 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the Senator's \nexplanation of the cross-air rule. I would just say he is off the mark, \nbecause if you produce deadly pollution in your State--deadly--you have \nan obligation to clean it up before it goes into another State.\n  It is like taking your garbage and dumping it in your neighbor's \nfront lawn. We don't do that in America. So we are going to have a \nrobust debate next week on the cross-State air rule.\n  I hope people keep in mind that we are talking about deadly pollution \nproduced in one State and moving over to a series of other States which \nhave no defense. So anyone who wants to come and claim that is the \nright thing to do morally--just walk away from that rule--I think they \nare going to have a hard time explaining it back home. I would not dump \ngarbage on the front lawn of my neighbor's house. I think that patina \nis the best explanation of what this is about. More on that later.\n  Today we are going to be facing a very interesting choice. As we \nknow, President Obama has put together a major jobs package, and he \npays for it by going to the millionaires and saying that once they make \n$1 million, after that we think they could pay a little bit more to \nhelp us get out of this recession. My Republican friends voted that \ndown. They were appalled we would even suggest there would be even a \nfew dollars of increased taxes on people who make over $1 million. They \nwould rather not do any job creation and protect the people who earn \nover $1 million.\n  (Mr. MANCHIN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mrs. BOXER. We have a very stark choice today. We have a small \nversion of the jobs bill--this one focuses on infrastructure, mostly \ntransportation investments--paid for by a seven-tenths-of-1-percent tax \non people who earn over $1 million, and it would not go into effect on \nany of those funds until they pass the million. So it would be taxed \nseven-tenths of 1 percent on income over $1 million.\n  I make that point because it is not going to hurt anybody. A person \nmaking $1.5 million would pay an additional $3,000. This is not \nanything that will hurt the millionaires and billionaires. It is going \nto make this country stronger. It is going to grow this economy.\n  Here is what we have: We have a Democratic jobs bill. It is $60 \nbillion--$50 billion for roads and bridges and $10 billion for an \ninfrastructure bank.\n  To put that into the context of why this is such a good bill and why \nit would create 650,000 jobs, let me tell you what it is doing in \nessence. It is taking an extra year of transportation funding--we spend \nabout $50 billion a year, approximately, through the highway trust \nfund--and it would inject essentially another year of spending over the \nnext 12 months, creating well over 650,000 new jobs.\n  The Republican alternative actually loses jobs. They say they will \ncontinue the highway trust fund for 2 years. So they are just \ncontinuing what we are already doing. That is great. But then they cut \nthe equivalent amount from police, fire, food inspection, and the FBI, \nand it will result in a loss of many jobs--200,000 jobs. So we have one \nbill, the Democratic bill, that creates a minimum of 650,000 jobs, and \nwe have the Republican bill that cuts 200,000 jobs.\n  What are they thinking, Mr. President? What are they thinking? This \nis not the time to cut 200,000 jobs. Then they end health care reform \nwhich we all know, while not perfect, is going to help reduce our \ndeficit. What they have done is continue the highway spending at \ncurrent levels--it doesn't add one job--and then they cut all those \nother jobs to pay for it--200,000 jobs--and then they repeal health \ncare reform, which will add to the deficit.\n  They cannot stand the thought of a millionaire paying a little bit \nmore to help us at this time even though everybody knows we are at a \npoint in time where the gap between the wealthiest and the middle class \nhas never been bigger. Four hundred families earn more than 50 percent \nof all the rest of us; 400 families earn more than 50 percent of all \nthe rest of us. It is unbelievable.\n  My State has many wealthy people in it, many poor people in it, and \nhas a good middle class. But it is getting tougher to be part of that \nmiddle class.\n\n[[Page S7108]]\n\nThe middle class is hit hard with health costs, with college costs that \nkeep going up, and with gas prices going up. They are hit hard with \nmortgages they can't refinance because their mortgage is now higher \nthan their home is worth. So we have to act on these issues. We have \nthe ability to do it.\n  If we just read the Preamble of our Constitution, it tells us what we \nare supposed to do: work for a more perfect union, establish justice, \ndomestic tranquility, and promote the general welfare. We have to do \nthese things today because we are losing the middle class.\n  This bill before us, the Democratic jobs bill, is an excellent place \nto start this very day by infusing $60 billion into spending that will \ngo mostly to private sector contractors, people who build roads and \nbridges. Do you know that 70,000 bridges in America are deficient?\n  My colleague, Senator Inhofe, and I are working closely on a highway \nbill. We are going to have one soon. He tells the story of a woman \nwalking in Oklahoma. She is simply taking a walk, and the bridge starts \nto fall apart; it falls down and traps her and kills her. He said she \nwas a young mother. This is America in the 21st century. That is not \nacceptable. We can't have a country like ours neglect its \ninfrastructure. It is wrong.\n  But our Republican friends will not work with us because they don't \nwant to ask people earning over $1 million to pay just a little bit \nmore. For example, if someone makes $1.1 million, they will have to pay \n$700 more in their taxes. That is it. But they don't even want to go \nthere. What they want to do is say: Oh, yes, we will just renew the \nhighway bill, but we will slash across the board everything but \ndefense. That is how we are going to pay for their jobs bill, which \nactually will lose hundreds of thousands of jobs. It is unbelievable to \nme.\n  I don't think this is the time to say we will turn our backs on jobs. \nAs a matter of fact, in order to extend the highway trust fund we are \ngoing to fire cops, firefighters, food safety inspectors, FBI agents, \nand Border Patrol agents. That is their alternative. So don't vote for \nit unless you think it is the time to put all those people out of work.\n  What Republicans also do in this so-called jobs bill--which is a no \njobs bill; it is a jobs loss bill--is they decide they want to block \nimplementation of very important health and safety rules. I want to go \nthrough what those rules are. We are going to talk about the Clean Air \nAct right now.\n  The Republicans are repealing two rules that deal with clean air. \nHere is the thing. It is going to make people sicker. It is going to \nmean lots of jobs in clean tech. It is the last thing the country \nneeds. It flies in the face of the views of the people. Let's talk \nabout one of the rules they want to cut back: industrial boilers and \nincinerators.\n  This bill, called a jobs bill, would halt an EPA rule issued in \nFebruary 2011 to reduce toxic air pollution. What do I mean? Toxic \nmeans it is toxic to our health; it will hurt us. People will die from \ntoxic air pollution. People do die from toxic air pollution. The toxins \nthe boilers and incinerators rule would reduce include mercury, lead, \nand other hazardous air pollution released by boilers and incinerators.\n  They can write it the way they want it, but here is what happens when \nwe go back to those days when we allowed these toxins to be emitted. We \nsaw developmental disabilities in our children. We saw more cases of \ncancer, more cases of heart disease, aggravated asthma, and premature \ndeath.\n  These are not just words. Congress commissioned a study, and we now \nknow exactly what we are doing, how many lives it saves, and how many \nvisits to the hospital it saves. Let me remind my friends who think \nthat it is good for the economy to have toxic air pollution, if we \ncannot breathe we cannot work. If someone has to rush to the hospital \nor their child is rushed there because of an asthma attack, they lose a \nday's work. If a pregnant woman now has a problem with the child, and \nthe child is disabled or has problems mentally from too much mercury, \nthis is a tragedy.\n  Some people say: Oh, the EPA is regulating too much and it costs too \nmuch. Let me tell you the price of the Republican agenda: sick people, \nloss of jobs in the clean tech industry, lost days of work, loss of \nkids' schooldays.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate, when they have their next meeting \nwith a large group of people--whether it is 100 or 50 or just a \ncouple--ask them how many of them have asthma. Ask them how many know \nsomeone close to them with asthma. I guarantee the hands of one-third \nto one-half of those in the room will go up. That doesn't just happen--\nasthma--because a person just woke up on the wrong side of the bed. It \nhappens because of the air they are breathing. It is toxic.\n  But in the Republicans' so-called jobs bill--which I already told you \nloses jobs--they not only do that, but to add insult to injury they \nrepeal all of these rules.\n  Let me put it into context for you, since I have now spoken \nemotionally about what it does to people when they breathe in toxins. \nLet me cite the numbers.\n  Congress demanded a study. We said, give us the numbers, and so a \nstudy was done. We believe the protections from this industrial boiler \nrule will annually prevent up to 6,500 premature deaths, 4,000 heart \nattacks, 4,300 hospital emergency room visits, 310,000 days when people \nmiss work or school, and 41,000 cases of aggravated asthma. The \nbenefits from these safeguards are expected to be $54 billion annually \nby 2014. That is the rule my Republican colleagues want us to set \naside.\n  If you went to your constituents and said to them: You know, we have \na rule here that says industry is going to have to use the best \navailable technology and clean up their pollution, and here is what it \nis going to do--it is going to prevent 6,500 premature deaths, 4,000 \nheart attacks, 4,300 hospital visits, 310,000 days when people miss \nschool or work, and 41,000 cases of aggravated asthma, and it is going \nto deliver $54 billion a year in health benefits--I think your \nconstituents would say, go for it, Senator; that makes sense.\n  Let me talk about a poll that just came out that reflects how people \nfeel about this. Listen to this. We have our Republican friends \noffering what they call a jobs bill, which I have proven contains job \ncuts because they simply continue the highway trust fund. They do not \nadd anything new, but they cut a couple hundred thousand jobs to pay \nfor it. That is their so-called jobs bill.\n  They then want to repeal two rules that fall under the Clean Air Act, \nand I just talked about the boiler rule. But let me tell you what the \npeople think, since we are supposed to represent the people.\n  There was a bipartisan poll done in October, a few days ago, \nreflecting 88 percent of Democrats, 85 percent of Independents, and 58 \npercent of Republicans opposed Congress stopping the EPA from enacting \nnew limits on air pollution from electric powerplants.\n  Who is speaking for the people? We need to vote down the Republican \nalternative because 88 percent of Democrats want us to, 85 percent of \nIndependents want us to, and 58 percent of Republicans want us to. They \ndo not want Congress stepping in.\n  On Tuesday, Senator Paul is going to have a motion to repeal the \ncross-state air pollution rule, which is a rule that says to the States \nif they are creating toxic air pollution and it is flowing to another \nState, it has to be cleaned up. Now, 67 percent of voters support the \ncross-state air pollution rule and 77 percent of voters support the \nmercury air toxics rule. So 65 percent of voters surveyed are confident \nthe health and environmental benefits of air pollution standards \noutweigh the costs, and 75 percent of voters believe a compelling \nreason to implement these air rules is the boost to local economies and \nthousands of new jobs that are created from investments in new \ntechnologies.\n  If we are representing the people of these great United States, we \nbetter listen to what they are saying in a bipartisan way. They are \ntelling us to leave the EPA alone. When people come to this floor and \ndemonize the EPA, they are going against the beliefs of the American \npeople.\n  There are some incredible quotes I want to read, because, to me, it \nis amazing what is happening around here. When I get to the place here \nI want, I am going to cite some quotes from unlikely sources.\n  Mr. President, how many minutes remains on our side?\n\n[[Page S7109]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 14 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  Here is a quote from General Motors:\n\n       General Motors company recognizes the benefit of the \n     country continuing the historic national program to address \n     fuel economy and greenhouse gases that the EPA began.\n\n  That is signed by the chairman and CEO of General Motors.\n  Here is a quote from a letter from a whole group of electricity-\nproducing companies: PG, Calpine Corp., NextEra Energy, Inc., Public \nService Enterprise Group, National Grid USA, Exelon Corp., \nConstellation Energy, and Austin Energy. This is a quote from their \nletter to the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Our companies' experience complying with air quality \n     regulations demonstrates regulations can yield important \n     economic benefits, including job creation, while maintaining \n     reliability.\n\n  Kind of amazing, isn't it? And there is Gerald Ford, the Republican \nPresident who signed the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1974--also under \nattack, by the way--who said:\n\n       Nothing is more essential to the life of every single \n     American than clean air, pure food, and safe drinking water.\n\n  Yet if you look at the Republican plan, they roll back clean air \nregulations and they roll back food safety. Even after we had people \ndie from contaminated cantaloupe, my friends on the other side think \nnow is the time to cut back on food safety inspection. Give me a break. \nWho are we here representing?\n  This is why people across the country are upset. They see things such \nas this and they say, is this Alice in Wonderland?\n  Listen to what Christine Todd Whitman and William Ruckelshaus wrote--\ntwo Republicans who were former EPA Administrators under Republican \nPresidents. They said:\n\n       It is easy to forget how far we have come in the past 40 \n     years. We should take heart from all this progress and not, \n     as some in Congress have suggested, seek to tear down the \n     agency that the President and Congress created to protect \n     America's health and environment.\n\n  They wrote that letter in March of this year. They understand. This \nisn't a partisan issue. Republicans breathe the same air that Democrats \nand Independents breathe. That is why it is so frustrating to see, in a \nso-called jobs bill from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, \nan actual loss of jobs and loss of clean air regulations and loss of \nfood safety inspectors.\n  I have to say I find myself quoting Richard Nixon more and more these \ndays. He signed the Clean Air Act. Listen to what he said at a State of \nthe Union speech. He said:\n\n       Clean air, clean water, open spaces--these should once \n     again be the birthright of every American.\n\n  I have cited these quotes from Republican Presidents and former \nAdministrators of the EPA under Republican Presidents, so I am stunned \nat this so-called jobs bill. I have talked about the industrial boiler \nrule, but they also roll back the cement manufacturing facilities rule \nthat would indefinitely delay standards to address smog and toxic soot \npollution from over 150 cement kilns nationwide. These facilities \ncontain hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, arsenic, lead, and \nother heavy metals.\n  Remember the movie ``Arsenic and Old Lace''? Arsenic kills you. Too \nmuch of it does that. Come on. We need to clean up the air, and we need \nto be sure we do it in a reasonable way. I am on that side--the side of \ndoing it in a reasonable way. And no one could be more reasonable than \nLisa Jackson. I tell you, the woman has the patience of a saint. She is \nnot going to go out and hit people over the head with this. She is \ngoing to phase in these regulations, and she is going to listen \ncarefully. And you have to listen. Mercury, arsenic, lead, and other \nheavy metals are the third largest mercury source in the country. These \nrelate to cement manufacturing facilities.\n  Let me tell you what these pollutants do. They cause cancer and they \nharm the reproductive system and the developmental system. Pregnant \nwomen and children are at risk. We hear a lot of talk about life--when \ndoes life begin? That is up to each individual and their God to decide \nthat. But one thing I hope we can agree on is that a pregnant woman \nshouldn't be subjected to too much mercury or too much arsenic in the \nair.\n  We have a rule here, a reduction of mercury and toxic soot emissions. \nWe know that rule will prevent 2,500 premature deaths, 1,500 heart \nattacks, more than 1,700 emergency room and hospital visits, that it \nwill prevent 17,000 cases of aggravated asthma attacks, 130,000 days of \nlost work, and it will provide up to $18 billion of benefits annually \nby 2013, which is a benefits-to-cost ratio of 19 to 1. Yet my friends \non the other side think it is a terrible idea and want to indefinitely \ndelay it.\n  Let me tell you something. If we had that kind of attitude in \nCongress years before, we wouldn't have a Clean Air Act. I can tell you \nwhat happened in Los Angeles. We used to have about 160 days in Los \nAngeles where people could not go out. They were warned to stay \nindoors. As a result of the Clean Air Act, we have had none of those \ndays--none--in Los Angeles in 2010.\n  So why on Earth does anyone want to delay these rules? If you want to \nsit with Lisa Jackson and sit with me, as the chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, and sit with others and see if \nthere is a way we can do this in a fair manner, of course. But the \npublic wants us to act, and the action they want us to take is to \nsupport the EPA, not to put our noses in there and stop them from doing \nwhat the Clean Air Act requires them to do.\n  Poll after poll shows that voters are on the side of clean air. They \nare on the side of protecting the public health. They are not on the \nside of polluters. So I wish to say, we know two things today: People \nwant jobs, and they also want their health protected. We also know that \nwhen you protect the people's health, what happens is a huge economic \nboost is given to the clean tech sector, and that boost has resulted in \nmany jobs. As many as 1.7 million jobs are created because of these \nclean air rules and clean water rules.\n  The whole world wants these technologies. I had the amazing \nexperience of visiting China, and I didn't see the Sun--I didn't see \nthe Sun--for the 7 days or so I was there. The air is filthy, and \npeople complain about it. One day we had the hint of sun--the hint of \nsun--breaking through the pollution, and the people there said, what a \nbeautiful day. You must have brought the good weather. I said, you know \nwhat, come to California, I will show you a blue sky.\n  We cannot go backward. We need to move this country forward.\n  If the arc of history bends toward justice, it also bends toward \nhealth, public health, making sure our people get that health care, \nthat they don't have those public health enemies out there--the soot, \nthe arsenic, the lead, the mercury--and, yes, jobs. We have seen our \nGDP explode since we passed the Clean Air Act, and we grew more than \nany other industrialized nation while we had these laws in place, for \ntwo reasons. One, these laws create clean tech jobs. Two, if we can't \nbreathe, we can't work. When we have a healthy society, we are far more \nproductive.\n  So we have the Democratic alternative that will create over 600,000 \njobs in transportation. It doesn't go into these extraneous issues such \nas the air pollution laws, and it is paid for by seven-tenths of 1 \npercent of income over $1 million.\n  Then we have the Republican alternative that just continues our \ntransportation at the same levels and pays for it by cutting 200,000 \njobs--police, fire, and the rest, FBI agents, food safety inspectors, \nBorder Patrol agents. Just what we don't need. That is what they do. \nPlus, just for good measure, they repeal basically two Clean Air Act \nrules that I talked about from boilers and cement plants.\n  Folks, if ever there was a difference between the parties in \nevidence, this is it. If one person comes up to me and asks if there is \nreally a difference between Democrats and Republicans, I will point \nthem to this debate.\n  So I hope very much that we will get enough votes to take up the \nDemocratic bill that is fully paid for and will create over 600,000 \njobs, that will fix our deficient bridges and our deficient highways, \nthat will say to the construction workers: We know you are out of work, \nand we are going to put you back to work--or the Republican alternative \nthat would result in 200,000\n\n[[Page S7110]]\n\njobs lost and overturn these clean air rules that are so important that \nthe vast majority of people, including Republicans, who are asked about \nit would say: Congress, keep your hands off these rules because, you \nknow what. We think they are working.\n  I reserve the remainder for other speakers, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let's be clear about what the Democrats' \nRebuild America Jobs Act is and what it is not about.\n  It is about expanding infrastructure spending, financed by tax \nincreases. It is about setting up a brand-new government bureaucracy in \nthe form of an infrastructure bank that will take years to get underway \nand will subject taxpayers, once again, to private sector risk-taking \nand to bailouts.\n  It is about following in the footsteps of the ongoing costly \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs, called Fannie and Freddie. \nIt is about increasing the Federal footprint in the infrastructure \narena. It is about increasing taxes on those with incomes above \n$500,000, now creatively called millionaires, including incomes of many \nbusiness owners who risk their own capital to create jobs.\n  It is about further Federal wage controls on construction projects \nwhich lead to inefficient use of taxpayer funds. It is also about \ncreating political talking points for the upcoming Presidential \nelection. They know their bill is doomed to fail. It is all a game.\n  Here is what the legislation is not about. It is not about creating \njobs. It is not about engineering a more efficient and a more fair tax \ncode. No, this is the same tune, different song: A bill for more \nspending, financed with new taxes.\n  It remains baffling to me that this is all the other side ever seems \nto have to offer. The Democrats' proposal incorporates more spending on \nvarious infrastructure initiatives, including one of the President's \nfavorites, high-speed rail.\n  As columnist Robert Samuelson wrote in the Washington Post in \nFebruary of this year:\n\n       High-speed rail is not an investment in the future. It's \n     mostly a waste of money.\n\n  As for the arguments by some that we risk losing our global \ncompetitive edge without things such as high-speed rail, I would \nencourage them to pay attention to what is going on beyond our shores.\n  China, facing safety concerns, high debt associated with high-speed \nrail, and political scandals involving kickbacks and undue influence on \nrail spending has scaled its plans back and operates some high-speed \nrail at 30 miles per hour.\n  Spain, a one-time darling of those who promote high-speed rail \nspending, is also scaling back, having identified such spending as \nimprudent in the current economic environment.\n  Here at home, States have rejected high-speed rail initiatives. We \njust learned in recent days that California's bullet train is now \nprojected to cost close to $100 billion, nearly twice its previous \nprojection.\n  Nonetheless, the administration and my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle wish to plow forward by shoveling more taxpayer funds into \nexactly those sorts of projects, with little more than rosy projections \nof future costs and benefits that justify the expense.\n  I am deeply skeptical that the Democrats' legislation to fund more \ninfrastructure projects is a good way to address our current national \nunemployment emergency and need for jobs.\n  According to CBO:\n\n       Large-scale construction projects of any type require years \n     of planning and preparation. Even those that are ``on the \n     shelf'' generally cannot be undertaken quickly enough to \n     provide timely stimulus to the economy.\n\n  More often than not, the delays are because of burdensome and \ninefficient regulatory red tape.\n  As President Obama discovered too late, shovel-ready projects are \nhard to find. In June he joked about his first stimulus, saying:\n\n       Shovel-ready was not as shovel-ready as we had expected.\n\n  Now, that may have been humorous, except they should have known \nbetter. Unfortunately, Americans looking for jobs and the American \ntaxpayers who are now on the hook to pay off President Obama's \nstimulus-driven debt do not find this to be a laughing matter.\n\n  The infrastructure bank proposed by the other side would not even be \nup and running for well over 1 year, and probably longer. It will take \n1 year or more just to set up the bureaucracy. How can this possibly \nhave anything to do with creating jobs and lowering unemployment today?\n  There are worrisome details about the proposed new government \ninfrastructure bank bureaucracy and the power it will wield. The \nproposed bank's board is required to give ``adequate consideration''--\nwhatever that means--to a host of features, including ``whether there \nis sufficient State or municipal political support for the successful \ncompletion of the infrastructure project.''\n  While proponents of the infrastructure bank are selling it as a new, \npolitics-free way to fund projects, even the authorizing legislation \nexplicitly calls for political considerations.\n  The Democrats' bill also claims the bank would be a ``United States \nGovernment-owned independent'' institution--government-owned and \ncontrolled by political appointees but somehow independent, just like a \nGSE, government-sponsored enterprise.\n  The definition of ``eligible infrastructure project'' in their bill \nincludes a wide range of possible projects, including high-speed rail, \nwhich Americans do not want or need, and solid waste disposal \nfacilities such as the one that drove Harrisburg, PA, into bankruptcy.\n  Most worrisome, the infrastructure bank board is provided with the \nauthority to make any modifications it would like, at its discretion, \nto what constitutes an eligible infrastructure project. How long do we \nthink it would take for the board to start doling out taxpayer funds to \nnon-viable projects? Haven't we seen enough of that in this \nadministration?\n  Proponents of the infrastructure bank make the peculiar argument that \nsomehow because the bank would not be able to make grants, taxpayers \nface no risks of losses. Yet the bank is empowered to make loans, which \nare risky. The bank is empowered to issue loan guarantees just like \ntaxpayer-backed government guarantees of Fannie and Freddie. Really. \nStop and think about it. This just looks like a rebirth of Fannie and \nFreddie. That is all we need. How is that not risky?\n  Also problematic is direct authorization in the Democrats' proposed \ninfrastructure bank for deferral of payments of direct loans in the \nevent ``the infrastructure project is unable to generate sufficient \nrevenues to pay the scheduled loan repayments of principal and interest \non the direct loan under this Act.''\n  Translation: If a project's revenues streams are insufficient to pay \noff the government loan, then the loan gets modified and extended. \nThis, of course, benefits any private partner of the taxpayer-funded \ninfrastructure project while taxpayers are put on the hook for the \nlosses.\n  Have we been here before? We all know what the answer to that is.\n  This is an explicit admission, in the authorizing legislation, that \ncontingencies are expected in which taxpayers suffer losses and end up \nbailing out private entities. This is the essence of a corporate \nbailout. This is corporatism at its worst--privatized profits and \nsocialized losses.\n  The whipsawing is too much to handle. On one hand, the President, a \nformer community organizer, stands with the Occupy Wall Street \nprotesters, criticizing the so-called rich. On the other hand, he and \nhis congressional allies support legislation that would make taxpayers \nresponsible for the bad decisions of wealthy contractors. I look \nforward to the critiques of this crony capitalism at the Occupy Wall \nStreet gatherings.\n  Taxpayers are on the hook for billions. Keep in mind it is not merely \nthe advertised initial price of $10 billion of taxpayer money necessary \nto start up the proposed new infrastructure bank bureaucracy that would \nbe at stake. The bank will be empowered to ``leverage'' taxpayer \ndollars to support 10, 20, or maybe 30 times that amount for so-called \npublic-private partnership projects.\n  Have we already forgotten that leverage is what helped create the \nlargest financial crisis since the Great Depression? Yet, amazingly, \nfor proponents of the infrastructure bank, leverage in this case is a \ngood thing.\n\n[[Page S7111]]\n\n  Make no mistake, leverage means risk, and more leverage means more \nrisk. Why, when taxpayers have not even seen the last of the losses \nfrom Fannie and Freddie, would we even consider setting up a brand-new \npublic-private mongrel called an infrastructure bank that will again \nsubject taxpayers to losses? Why would we set up a new Federal \nbureaucracy that will require bailouts on projects specially selected \nby unelected political appointees with the power to pick winning and \nlosing projects eligible for government assistance?\n  It is of interest that one of the new pitches for an infrastructure \nbank is that we need it to help us be more globally competitive. \nSometimes comparisons are made with the growth of infrastructure \nspending in developing countries such as China. But, of course, \ndeveloping countries devote many resources to infrastructure spending. \nIt is almost a tautology. Those countries are starting with a much \nsmaller beginning base, so we would expect a need for greater growth.\n  Proponents of infrastructure spending cite rankings of the United \nStates globally on its infrastructure from a recent World Economic \nForum's Global Competitiveness Report. If they had read the most recent \nreport carefully, they would note that it identifies that the top two \nmost problematic factors for doing business in America are tax rates \nand inefficient government bureaucracy. Yet the Democrats' bill seeks \nto increase tax rates and construct a new bureaucracy called an \ninfrastructure bank.\n  We do not need a new Federal bureaucracy filled with politically \nappointed bureaucrats. We do not need a government picking economic \nwinners and losers. We do not need more government spending years from \nnow to deal with an unemployment crisis today. We do not need more \ntaxes at a time when the unemployment rate is stuck at 9.1 percent. And \nwe most definitely do not need another GSE. But if you like Fannie and \nFreddie, you will love the proposed infrastructure bank.\n  Once again, the other side has turned to divisiveness and class \nwarfare. Evil millionaires and billionaires, whom Democrats now define \nas an individual with income starting at $500,000, need to be brought \nto economic justice. A 0.7-percent tax--or whatever the rate-of-the-\nweek special cooked up by the Democratic war room happens to be--\nimposed on individual incomes that begin at $500,000 will bring \nequality and justice for all.\n  A few points need to be made about the surtax proposal. First, it is \nmore taxes to pay for more government spending. We need to keep that in \nmind when we hear Democrats talk about the need to raise taxes to \nreduce the deficits.\n  Second, it is not real economic or tax policy. It is designed to \ndeliver a talking point to an administration increasingly concerned \nabout its reelection prospects.\n  I remind my friends on the other side of the aisle again that those \nearning $500,000 or more, whom they creatively call millionaires and \nbillionaires, are not a static group of people. Many who earn those \namounts in 1 year are likely to earn far less in the next year or in \nthe prior year. In fact, the highest income taxpayers are a dynamic and \nrapidly changing group. Any one of us could get there if we just work \nhard enough and are smart enough to get there. That income group is \nconstantly changing.\n  Keep in mind that a significant number of people hit by the \nDemocrats' tax hike would be business owners--the same people we need \nto create new jobs. Significant fractions of net-positive business \nincome and of active flow-through business income would be subject to \nSenator Reid's new surtax. This is especially harmful to small \nbusinesses, which are often organized as flow-through entities, \nincluding sole proprietorships, partnerships, LLCs, and S corporations.\n  We do not need higher taxes that will fall on job creators to write \nchecks for the President's special preferences, such as spending on \nhigh-speed rail that Americans do not want or need. We do not need a \nrisky, GSE-like, taxpayer-funded infrastructure bank populated by \npolitical appointees, able to pick and choose whatever spending they \nwould like to define as an infrastructure project, while subjecting \ntaxpayers to private risk-taking.\n  Fortunately, there is a better way, and it is contained in my \nlegislation, the Long-Term Surface Transportation Extension Act of \n2011. Briefly, here is what it does.\n  It eliminates dedicated funding for transportation enhancements and \ngives States the authority to decide whether to spend resources on add-\nons, such as bike paths.\n  It reforms the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, by \neliminating inefficient bureaucratic red tape and accelerating project \ndelivery and contracting, just as called for by the President's Jobs \nCouncil.\n  It supports job creation by placing a temporary timeout on job-\nkilling regulations that are estimated to have significant economic \neffects.\n  It includes provisions for waivers of inefficient environmental \nreviews, approvals, and licensing and permitting requirements for road, \nhighway, and bridge rebuilding efforts in emergency situations.\n  It goes straight to the matter of job creation, and it draws from \nbipartisan recommendations, including recommendations from the \nPresident's own bipartisan Jobs Council. We have not ignored the \nPresident. We are taking some of his ideas and putting them in this \nbill.\n  It allows fully paid-for infrastructure projects to be undertaken to \nhelp build roads, bridges, and a host of other projects without \nimposing permanent, job-killing, higher taxes during our national \nunemployment emergency.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote in support of my legislation and \nto vote against the tax-and-spend alternative offered by those on the \nother side. We have had enough of this. We had enough with Fannie and \nFreddie. Yes, it was set up to do good, but it has wound up putting us \nin hock, and then just this week we find that they all--many of the \nleaders of Fannie and Freddie--are taking home huge bonuses for running \nthe place. The new ones, the new leadership--maybe that is a little \nharsh, but the fact is, why should they be taking bonuses when we know \nFannie and Freddie are in real trouble? I predict that if the \nDemocratic bill passes and we get this infrastructure bank set up, it \nis only a matter of time until this will be another Fannie or Freddie. \nThat is what happens when government bureaucrats decide who wins, who \nloses, and interferes with the private sector and those who have always \nmade the private sector go and work well for all of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Rebuild \nAmerica Jobs Act. This bill is about jobs today and jobs tomorrow \nacross the Nation and in my home State of Maryland. It also is about \nrepairing our crumbling infrastructure.\n  This bill does three things. First, it provides $50 billion for \nimmediate transportation investments. It will provide formula funding \nand award competitive grants to our States for transportation \ninfrastructure projects. This includes funding for our highways and \nbridges. It also includes our transit systems and passenger and freight \nnetworks as well as our aviation system and ports.\n  Second, it provides $10 billion to establish a national \ninfrastructure bank. This bank will leverage private and public capital \nto fund large infrastructure projects. These include not only \ntransportation projects but also desperately needed water and sewer, \nand energy projects. The bank will provide direct loans and loan \nguarantees for projects of regional and national significance.\n  I have been a strong proponent of establishing a national \ninfrastructure bank for several years now going back to the original \nDodd-Hagel legislation. I am now a cosponsor of Senators Kerry, \nHutchison, and Warner's bill.\n  Third, this bill pays for itself. It implements a surtax of less than \n1 percent on those that make more than $1 million a year. This tax will \nbegin in 2013.\n  This bill is so important because it will create hundreds of \nthousands of jobs across America by putting construction workers and \nengineers back to work. According to Moody's, every $1 spent on \ninfrastructure spurs economic activity raising GDP by about $1.59. \nWithout this investment, nearly 1 million Americans will lose their \njobs and our economy will lose nearly $1 trillion over the next 10 \nyears.\n\n[[Page S7112]]\n\n  Our failing transportation infrastructure is costing everyone money \nwe don't have: State and local governments, motorists, and companies \nshipping their goods. Americans pay approximately $333 in car repairs a \nyear because of poor road conditions and more at the pump because of \ncongestion. We just learned Marylanders have the longest commute in the \ncountry--even longer than New Yorkers. Can you believe that?\n  Freight bottlenecks and congestion are costing us about $200 billion \na year. It is estimated that our failing infrastructure will drive the \ncost of doing business up by adding $430 billion to costs in the next \ndecade. This means it will cost more to ship goods and consumers will \nfeel it in their pocketbooks.\n  My State of Maryland has a 6-year transportation plan with $10 \nbillion worth of needs. A recent blue ribbon commission found the State \nneeds another $500 million annually to meet these needs. This bill will \nhelp close this funding gap by providing nearly $600 million in \ntransportation formula funding to Maryland. This funding will support \nabout 7,500 jobs.\n  This formula funding will pay for repaving and improving safety on \nour highways and byways. It will be used for to replace diesel buses \nwith more environmentally friendly hybrid models. Improvements also \nwill be made to Maryland's commuter rail service, MARC, and the light \nrail and metro in the Baltimore region. Lastly, Maryland would be \neligible for competitive grants for all modes of transportation \nincluding high-speed rail investments along the Northeast corridor.\n  In addition, the infrastructure bank will provide new financing \noptions for Maryland. It will help move along projects of regional and \nnational significance that currently are harder to get underway with \ntraditional financing options. Most promising is that the bank will \nprovide financing for water and sewer and energy infrastructure \nprojects too. Maryland alone has $14 billion in water and sewer \ninfrastructure needs.\n  I firmly believe that a reliable and well maintained infrastructure \nis a vital to sustain economic growth and create jobs. That is why we \nmust pass this bill and get Americans back to work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     nomination of richard andrews\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, last year, I was pleased to provide the \nPresident with the names of three superbly qualified Delawareans for \nhim to consider for the one open seat on the U.S. District Court in \nDelaware. Any one of them would have made an excellent addition to the \ncourt, and all of them uphold the high regard in which this court is \nheld, not only in Delaware but across the country.\n  The President has made a particularly strong choice in nominating \nRichard G. Andrews for this judicial appointment this past May. The \nSenate Judiciary Committee used sound judgment in approving his \nnomination unanimously in September. We are grateful for the \nexpeditious handling and approval of this nomination--unanimously.\n  When I travel across Delaware, I often hear from people who are \nconvinced that the Senate is overwhelmed by partisan tensions. I am \nsure that my colleagues--both Republicans and Democrats here today--\nhave heard similar concerns. Confirming Rich Andrews will help to win \nback confidence that we can work together to do the right thing, not \njust for the people of Delaware but the people of America.\n  Throughout his career, Rich Andrews has been supported by members of \nboth parties. He was appointed to U.S. Attorney under Attorney General \nJanet Reno and Attorney General John Ashcroft. Most recently, the \nSenate Judiciary Committee supported his nomination without one single \ndissent.\n  Our country is fortunate that someone with his outstanding \ncredentials has stepped forward to do this critical work. Mr. Andrews' \neducation, background, and legal experience make him superbly qualified \nfor this position.\n  As a student at Haverford College, Rich Andrews graduated with a \nbachelor of arts degree in political science, after which he earned his \nlaw degree at the University of California at Berkley--where he served \nas Note and Comment Editor for the California Law Review. After law \nschool, Rich Andrews launched his career as a Clerk for the Honorable \nCollins J. Seitz, legendary chief judge of the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  Following his clerkship, for 23 years Rich served as a prosecutor in \nthe U.S. Attorney's Office in Wilmington--serving in a number of high-\nprofile positions and eventually rising to the position of assistant \nU.S. attorney. When duty called, he stepped up to serve as acting U.S. \nattorney on three separate occasions. I kidded him and said he served \nas acting U.S. attorney longer than other people have served as U.S. \nattorney in other States. During his time with the United States \nAttorney's office, Rich prepared and prosecuted countless Federal \ncases, and in so doing, gained wide-ranging trial experience that he \nwill draw upon heavily while serving as District Court Judge, if \nconfirmed today.\n  Currently, Rich serves as the State prosecutor for the Delaware \nDepartment of Justice, where he manages the Criminal Division, oversees \nmore than 70 deputy attorneys general, and makes critical decisions \nabout how to proceed in high-level criminal cases.\n  Finally, in addition to his professional experience, Rich is a family \nman and a person of great character. His wife, Cathy Lanctot is the \nassociate dean and a professor of law at Villanova University. Their \nson Peter is a sophomore at Columbia University, and their daughter Amy \nis a senior--and student council president--at Mount Pleasant High \nSchool, not far from where my family and I live.\n  In his ``free time,'' Rich has coached for the Concord Soccer \nAssociation of Delaware for more than a decade--and I understand that \nRich also has spent the last 4 years grading answers for the Delaware \nbar exam.\n  In every facet of his life, Richard Andrews has performed with \ndistinction. Let me conclude by saying that I am proud to support \nsomeone who has provided, and who will continue to provide, exemplary \nservice for the people of our State and Nation.\n  His sound legal judgment, his tireless work ethic, and his experience \nas a Federal prosecutor have prepared Richard Andrews well to fill this \nseat on the U.S. District Court in Delaware. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting his confirmation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I would like to speak on the vote that \nis about to occur in this Chamber on the Rebuild America Jobs Act.\n  Over the past few days, we have been discussing how to best address \nour Nation's crumbling infrastructure. The cracks in this broken system \nbecame tragically clear on a beautiful summers day in Minnesota, August \n1, 2007, when the I-35W bridge simply crashed into the Mississippi \nRiver, killing 13 people and throwing dozens of cars in the river. As I \nsaid that day, a bridge should not fall down in the middle of America, \nbut it did, and an eight-lane highway should not fall down, not a \nhighway that is literally six blocks from my house, a bridge that I \ndrive over every day with my family, but that is what happened.\n  Four years after the I-35W bridge collapsed and was fixed a year \nlater, still 25 percent of the Nation's 600,000 bridges have been \ndeclared structurally deficient or obsolete--25 percent. Our country \nhas gotten a near-failing grade from the Civil Academy of Engineers. \nOur construction workers have an unemployment rate that is over 13 \npercent--more than 4 points above the national average. These are not \nacceptable realities in this country.\n  Americans spend 4.8 billion hours every year stuck in congestion, \nstuck in traffic.\n  When you look at what happens in other countries, other countries \nthat are spending 7, 8, 9 percent of their gross national product on \ninfrastructure, we are barely hanging in at 2 percent. Yet we want to \nbe a competitive nation, we want to be a nation that makes things \nagain, that exports to the world. If we do not have the air traffic \ncontrol system that works, if we\n\n[[Page S7113]]\n\ndon't have the bridges that work, if we don't have the highways that \nwork, if we don't have the waterways to bring our barges down to bring \nour goods to market, we are not going to be able to compete in this \neconomy. This is simply not an acceptable reality for a country such as \nAmerica.\n  Think about the Interstate Highway System, built during Eisenhower's \nPresidency with a Democratic Congress. Think about rural \nelectrification. These things were built during difficult times in this \ncountry. Why? Because we didn't think America was about just tinkering \nat the edges, we believed America was about moving ahead. That is why \nwe need to move forward today on the Rebuild America Jobs Act. All of \nus recognize the urgent need for new and bold initiatives to fix what \nis broken and to build the roads, the bridges, and the airports we need \nto fuel a 21st-century export economy.\n  The infrastructure bank, which is, of course, included in this \nlegislation, is something that has enjoyed bipartisan support from the \nbeginning. It is one of those initiatives that will foster public-\nprivate partnership, with the potential to leverage hundreds of \nbillions of dollars for infrastructure investment. It is about big \nprojects, but it is also about rural projects in States such as Vermont \nand Minnesota. It is about wastewater treatment plants and water \nprojects and sewer projects--work that has been neglected for way too \nlong.\n  Fixing our Nation's infrastructure will provide a broad range of \nbenefits. We can reduce our congestion, we can better compete globally, \nand we can create jobs and improve public safety. This is about working \nto ensure that no bridge ever again collapses in the middle of America. \nThis is our challenge. We cannot put it off any longer. This is the \ntime to act.\n  Traditionally, there had been no such thing as a Democratic bridge or \na Republican bridge. In fact, the Transportation Secretary for \nPresident Obama is a former Republican Congressman. We have come \ntogether on infrastructure. We cannot come apart. This is the time to \ncome together.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to allow this bill to proceed to a vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield back all the time on both sides, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to proceed to S. 1769. \nUnder the previous order, 60 votes are required to adopt the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 51, nays 49, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 195 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--51\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Blumenthal\n     Boxer\n     Brown (OH)\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Coons\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Manchin\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--49\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Brown (MA)\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heller\n     Hoeven\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Kirk\n     Kyl\n     Lee\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Paul\n     Portman\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rubio\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill).

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for \nthe adoption of this motion, the motion to proceed is rejected.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we wish to outline what the rest of the \nday appears to be.\n  I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the previous order, \nfollowing the next vote, the Senate proceed to executive session to \nconsider the following nominations: Calendar No. 353 and Calendar No. \n356; that there be 15 minutes for debate equally divided in the usual \nform; that following that debate, Calendar No. 356 be confirmed and the \nSenate proceed to vote with no intervening action or debate on Calendar \nNo. 353, with the provisions of the previous order remaining in effect; \nand that the next 2 votes be 10 minutes in duration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to proceed to S. 1786.\n  Under the previous order, 60 votes are required to adopt this motion. \nUnder the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate, \nequally divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, what is before us now is supposed to be \na jobs bill. Actually, all they do in this alternative, my Republican \nfriends, is extend the highway trust fund at the current levels. That \nis something we intend to do, and Senator Inhofe and I are going to \nbring the bill to the floor that does that, but they decided they want \nto do it now. And how do they pay for it? They cut $40 billion out of \nsuch functions as firefighters, police, Border Patrol, food safety \ninspectors, and we will lose 200,000 jobs from that action.\n  In addition, there are two rollbacks of environmental laws that \ndeserve a heck of a lot more notice than putting them in this bill. \nThat is going to hurt our people because if you can't breathe, you \ncan't work. We have to get the mercury and the soot and the arsenic out \nof the air.\n  I hope we will vote no on this. It is not a jobs bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Andrews, of Delaware, to be United States \nDistrict Judge for the District of Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes, equally divided.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I wish to ask for your wholehearted \nsupport for Judge Skavdahl of Wyoming. He was nominated by our \nDemocratic Governor. He was appointed by the President, and he has the \nwholehearted support of our delegation. We have spoken for him in \ncommittee and are doing that again on the floor. We have a full \nstatement we submitted. So I would thank you for your vote on this \nnomination. He came up through the courts in Wyoming and now will be a \nFederal judge, with your help.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I thank the majority leader for securing \nvotes on 2 of the 22 judicial nominees on the Senate's Executive \nCalendar ready for Senate consideration. I am glad that we will finally \nvote on the nominations of Scott Skavdahl to the District of Wyoming \nand Richard Andrews to the District of Delaware, both qualified, \nconsensus nominees reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee \nnearly 2 months ago. I wish that we were able to vote today on the \nother 20 judicial nominees who have been ready and waiting for final \nSenate action.\n  This morning the Judiciary Committee reported another 5 judicial \nnominations, bringing the total to 27 who have been thoroughly vetted, \nconsidered and reported by the Judiciary Committee. All 27 of these \nnominees are qualified and have the support of their home State \nSenators, Republican and Democratic. Twenty-three of the 27 nominees, \nlike the 2 we will consider today, were unanimously approved by the \nJudiciary Committee with all members. Senate Democrats are prepared to \nhave votes on all these important nominations. I know of no good reason \nwhy the Republican leadership is refusing to proceed on the 20 nominees \nwho have been stalled before the Senate for weeks and months. At a time \nwhen vacancies on Federal courts throughout the country remain near 10 \npercent, the delay in taking up and confirming these consensus judicial \nnominees is inexcusable.\n  The American people need functioning Federal courts with judges, not \nvacancies. Though it is within the Senate's power to take significant \nsteps to address this problem, refusal by Senate Republicans to consent \nto voting on consensus judicial nominations has kept vacancies high for \nyears. The number of judicial vacancies has been near or above 90 for \nover 2\\1/2\\ years. A recent report by the nonpartisan Congressional \nResearch Service found that we are in the longest period of \nhistorically high vacancy rates in the last 35 years. These needless \ndelays do nothing to help solve this serious problem and are damaging \nto the Federal courts and the American people who depend on them.\n  More than half of all Americans--over 163 million--live in districts \nor circuits that have a judicial vacancy that could be filled today if \nSenate Republicans just agreed to vote on the nominations reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support. As many as 26 States \nare served by Federal courts with vacancies that would be filled by \nthese nominations. Millions of Americans across the country are harmed \nby delays in overburdened courts. The Republican leadership should \nexplain why they will not consent to vote on the qualified, consensus \ncandidates nominated to fill these extended judicial vacancies.\n  Senator Grassley and I have worked together to ensure that each of \nthe 27 nominations reported by the Judiciary Committee was fully \nconsidered after a thorough but fair process, including completing our \nextensive questionnaire and questioning at a hearing. This White House \nhas worked with the home State Senators, Republicans and Democrats, and \neach of the judicial nominees being delayed from a Senate vote is \nsupported by both home State Senators. The FBI has conducted a thorough \nbackground review of each nominee. The American Bar Association's \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary has conducted a peer review \nof their professional qualifications. When the nominations are then \nreported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee, there is no reason for \nmonths and months of further delay before they begin serving the \nAmerican people.\n  Despite the damagingly high number of vacancies that has persisted \nthroughout President Obama's term, some Republican Senators have tried \nto excuse their delay in taking up nominations by suggesting that the \nSenate is doing better than we did during the first 3 years of \nPresident Bush's administration. That is simply not true. It is wrong \nto suggest that the Senate has achieved better results than we did in \n2001 through 2003. As I have pointed out, in the 17 months I chaired \nthe Judiciary Committee in 2001 and 2002, the Senate confirmed 100 of \nPresident Bush's Federal circuit and district court nominees. By \ncontrast, after the first 2 years of President Obama's administration, \nthe Senate was allowed to proceed to confirm only 60 of his Federal \ncircuit and district court nominees.\n  Indeed, as 2010 was drawing to a close, Senate Republicans refused to \nproceed on 19 judicial nominees who had been considered and reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee and forced them to be returned to the \nPresident. It has taken the Senate nearly twice as long to confirm the \n100th Federal circuit and district court judge nominated by President \nObama as we had when President Bush was in the White House.\n  During the third year of President Bush's administration, the Senate \nconfirmed 68 of his Federal circuit and district court nominees. By \nearly November, 66 judges had been confirmed. In contrast this year, \neven including many nominees confirmed this year who should have been \nconfirmed last year, the Senate has only confirmed 53 of President \nObama's judicial nominees. Fifty-three is not better than 66. By this \npoint in President Bush's first 3 years, the Senate had confirmed 166 \nof his Federal circuit and district court nominees. So far in the 3 \nyears of the Obama administration, that total is only 113. One hundred \nand thirteen is not better than 166. Notably, the Senate this year is \nlagging far behind the pace we set for circuit court nominations in the \nthird year of President Bush's administration. The Senate this year has \nconfirmed just 6 circuit court nominations, compared to 12 at this \npoint in President Bush's third year. The six confirmations this year \nare only half as many as were confirmed at this point in President \nBush's third year. There are five circuit court nominations pending on \nthe Senate's Executive Calendar today and a sixth circuit court \nnomination reported by the committee this morning. By this point in the \nthird year of President Bush's administration, the Senate had confirmed \na total of 29 of his circuit court nominees. By comparison, the Senate \nhas confirmed only 22 of President Obama's circuit court nominees. \nTwenty-two is not better than 29. By this point in the Bush \nadministration, vacancies had been reduced to 42. Today they stand at \n85. Eighty-five vacancies is not better than 42.\n  This is not the way to make real progress. No resort to percentages \nof nominees ``processed'' or ``positive action'' by the committee can \nexcuse the lack of real progress by the Senate. In the past, we were \nable to confirm consensus nominees more promptly, often\n\n[[Page S7115]]\n\nwithin days of being reported to the full Senate. They were not forced \nto languish for months. The American people should not have to wait \nweeks and months for the Senate to fulfill its constitutional duty and \nensure the ability of our Federal courts to provide justice to \nAmericans around the country.\n  I think confirmations and vacancies numbers better reflect the \nreality in our Federal courts and for the American people. It is hard \nto see how the Senate is supposed to be doing better when it remains so \nfar behind the pace we set in those years. During President Bush's \nfirst 4 years, the Senate confirmed a total of 205 Federal circuit and \ndistrict court judges. As of today, we would need another 92 \nconfirmations over the next 12 months to match that total. That means a \nfaster confirmation rate for the next 12 months than in any 12 months \nof the Obama administration to date. That would require Senate \nRepublicans to abandon their delaying tactics. I hope they will.\n  The two nominations we consider today are each superbly qualified \nconsensus nominees whom I expect will be confirmed with significant \nbipartisan support. The nomination of Judge Scott Skavdahl to fill a \nvacancy on the District of Wyoming was reported unanimously by the \nJudiciary Committee on September 8, nearly 2 months ago. Judge \nSkavdahl, who is currently a magistrate judge on the District of \nWyoming, having previously served as a law clerk for Chief Judge \nWilliam Downes, the judge he is nominated to replace, has the strong \nsupport of his Republican home State senators, Senators Enzi and \nBarrasso. Judge Skavdahl spent 8 years as a State court judge for the \nSeventh Judicial District of Wyoming before that working in private \npractice in Wyoming. The ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary unanimously rated Mr. Skavdahl ``well qualified'' to serve, \nits highest rating.\n  The Judiciary Committee also unanimously reported the nomination of \nRichard Andrews to fill a vacancy on the District of Delaware nearly 2 \nmonths ago. Mr. Andrews currently serves as Delaware's State \nprosecutor, having previously spent 24 years as a Federal prosecutor in \nDelaware, where he rose through the ranks to become chief of the \nCriminal Division. Mr. Andrews was appointed to serve as the acting \nU.S. attorney for Delaware on three occasions, including by John \nAshcroft, the Attorney General under President Bush. He also clerked \nfor Chief Judge Collins Seitz of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nThird Circuit. Mr. Andrews has the strong support of both his home \nState Senators, Senator Carper and Senator Coons, who worked with Mr. \nAndrews in Delaware. I thank Senator Coons for chairing the committee's \nhearing on Mr. Andrews' nominations and for working hard to move it \nthrough the committee and Senate process.\n  The Senate must come together to address the serious judicial \nvacancies crisis on Federal courts around the country that has \npersisted for well over 2 years. We can and must do better for the more \nthan 163 million Americans being made to suffer by these unnecessary \nSenate delays.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, today the Senate will confirm two more \njudicial nominees, which will be the 52nd and 53rd article III \nconfirmations of this Congress. We have confirmed 17 judges in the past \n30 days.\n  I may sound like a broken record, but despite what others have said, \nwe have and continue to make real progress on consensus nominees. We \nhave taken positive action on 85 percent of the judicial nominees \nsubmitted by President Obama this year. Over 91 percent of nominees \nsubmitted during President Obama's Presidency have had their hearing. \nWith these votes, only during 8 of the last 30 years has the Senate \nconfirmed more judicial nominees than we have done during this year.\n  I would like to say a few words about the nominees, both of whom I \nsupport.\n  Scott Wesley Skavdahl is nominated to be a district court judge for \nthe District of Wyoming. He is a graduate from the University of \nWyoming and their College of Law. Judge Skavdahl began his legal career \nin 1992 as an associate attorney at the law firm of Brown, Drew, Massey \n& Sullivan. After 2 years with the firm, he departed for a 3-year \nclerkship with the Honorable William F. Downes on the District Court \nfor the District of Wyoming.\n  In 1997, he returned to private practice at the firm Williams, \nPorter, Day & Neville, where he made partner in 2000. From 2001 to \n2003, Judge Skavdahl served as a part-time U.S. magistrate judge. He \nalso served as a State district judge for the Seventh Judicial District \nof Wyoming from 2003 to 2011. In February 2011, Judge Skavdahl was \nappointed U.S. magistrate judge for the District of Wyoming, a post he \nholds to this day.\n  The American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary has rated Judge Skavdahl with a unanimous ``well qualified'' \nrating.\n  Richard G. Andrews is nominated to be a district judge for the \nDistrict of Delaware. Mr. Andrews received his bachelor of arts from \nHaverford College in 1977 and a juris doctorate from the University of \nCalifornia at Berkley Boalt Hall School of Law in 1981.\n  He began his legal career as a law clerk to the Honorable Collins J. \nSeitz, Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. \nMr. Andrews then joined the Office of the United States Attorney for \nthe District of Delaware as a Federal law clerk. After a year in that \nposition, he was named an assistant U.S. attorney.\n  Mr. Andrews spent the next 24 years in that office, handling a mix of \ncriminal and civil cases in Federal district court. He has served on \nthree occasions as acting or interim U.S. attorney, was first assistant \nfor a number of years in the office, and served as chief of the \nCriminal Division.\n  Since 2007, Mr. Andrews has served as State prosecutor within the \nDelaware Department of Justice.\n  The American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary has rated Mr. Andrews with a substantial majority ``well \nqualified,'' minority ``qualified'' rating.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields back time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I yield back all time on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is yielded back.\n  Under the previous order, the nomination of Richard G. Andrews, of \nDelaware, to be United States District Judge for the District of \nDelaware is confirmed.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Scott Wesley Skavdahl, of Wyoming, to be United States District \nJudge for the District of Wyoming?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, after the vote today, I think that any \neffort to pass a bill such as the ones we just voted on would be very \ndifficult. But something good does happen from that; that is, we had \nthe vast majority of people in the Chamber recognizing that we need to \ndo something that would be stimulative to the economy--something unlike \nthe stimulus bill we had before, where only 3 percent of the money \nactually went to building roads, highways, maintenance, and that type \nof thing.\n  I do appreciate the fact that we are now in a position where I think, \nwith this behind us, we can be looking at a good, legitimate highway \ntransportation reauthorization bill. I have been working very closely \nwith Senators Boxer, Vitter, and Baucus--we are considered the ``big \nfour'' in the Environment and Public Works Committee--to come up with \nsomething. I have to say that we have worked very hard, and I am \ntalking about hours and hours. Anytime you can get Senator Barbara \nBoxer from California and me to agree on something, you know we have \ngone through a lot of work--and we have. We have gone through a lot of \ngive and take.\n  Senator Boxer and I, along with Senators Vitter and Baucus, recognize \nthat we desperately need to have a transportation reauthorization bill, \nand we need to do it the right way. All these things we have been doing \nwith extensions don't work. There is not a Member of this Chamber who \ndoesn't go back every week and talk to his transportation director and \nsay why can't we quit these extensions and get a good bill.\n  We have a good bill, and we are talking about reforms. It is our \nintention next week, I believe, to mark up this bill. We are looking \nforward to that. I have a very strong bias toward transportation. For \nthe years I was in the House, I was on that committee. We didn't have \nthese problems then. We had a highway trust fund that always had a \nsurplus because we were very aggressive at that time and, of course, a \nlot more people were purchasing gas at that time and revenues were up. \nSo we had a surplus.\n  Unfortunately, this always happens in Washington, DC. Members came \nalong and looked at the surplus, and that was a target. Everybody \nwanted in on it, so they put their deals into the highway trust fund. \nThat is partly why we got to where we are today.\n  I appreciate the conversation we have gotten from the President. He \ntalks about how he wants infrastructure, and he has a picture of where \nhe was standing in front of a bridge making a speech about creating \njobs. But he doesn't have anything in his program that does anything \nwith infrastructure. Our problem is that President Obama has been \ntalking the talk, and he has spoken more about infrastructure than any \nother President since Eisenhower proposed the Interstate Highway \nSystem. But when you get up to the $800 billion stimulus bill, in doing \nthe calculations, only 3 percent--about $27 billion of that--was in \nhighway construction or maintenance. Senator Boxer and I made an effort \non the floor--a bipartisan effort--to try to raise the percentage. I \nwanted it up to 10 percent or higher, but we were unable to do it. The \nPresident was not on our side on that.\n  I think the good news is that today's votes, of both Democrats and \nRepublicans, showed that they are very interested and supportive of a \nhighway bill. We have gotten a lot of that out of the way and we can \nconcentrate on a highway bill. I think both parties are trying to \ncreate jobs and economic growth through the building of highways and \nbridges.\n  Most Americans are unaware of how damaging regulations are. When I \nstop and think about proposing a massive program, which is what we are \ntalking about now--reauthorization program--it is massive in that the \nfunding level would probably stay the same as it has been since the \nhighway authorization bill of 2005. But when they talk about that, we \nare always faced with the regulation problems. We are trying to address \nin this bill the regulation problems that are out there to try to have \nsome shortcuts, to try to get some things done that otherwise would \ntake a lot longer. Regulations have been a huge problem.\n\n\n                            EPA Regulations\n\n  This administration's Environmental Protection Agency alone has an \nunprecedented number of regulations, and they are destroying jobs. The \nresults are there. I will mention the five most expensive regulations \nof all the regulations that have come out.\n  First is the greenhouse gas regulation. I think we all know what that \nis. That is them trying to do something through regulations they were \nunable to do through legislation.\n  Second, ozone, the national ambient air quality standards. That would \nbe about a $678 billion loss in GDP by 2020.\n  Incidentally, I failed to mention the greenhouse gas regulations, \nwhich would be in excess of $300 billion to $400 billion a year.\n  The boiler MACT regulations--that would be a $1 billion loss to GDP. \nUtility MACT--MACT is maximum achievable technology. In other words, \none of the problems with all these MACT bills coming out of the \nadministration is that there is no technology available to carry out \nthe mandates on emissions. Cement MACT is another, with $3.5 billion in \ncompliance costs.\n  Fortunately, in September, President Obama withdrew the EPA's \nproposed toughened ozone standards. There is good reason for that, and \none is that ozone standards are supposed to be predicated upon new \nscience. This was on the same science that the last ozone changes were \nbased on. I think when people caught on to that and recognized what it \nwould cost--in Oklahoma, we would be looking at some 15 counties that \nwould be out of attainment, and there is nothing more dreadful that \ncould happen to a State than have your counties go out of attainment so \nthat you are not able to recruit jobs, or even keep the jobs you have. \nWe would be talking about around 7 million jobs throughout the United \nStates. Because of that, politically, he postponed that. Frankly, I \nthink he is postponing it until after the next election. If he should \nbe reelected, I can assure you we will see that again.\n\n  Democrats always say we need to have tax increases and that is the \nbest way to grow. I look at this sometimes. Recently, the Office of \nManagement and Budget came up with a calculation that is consistent \nwith one I have been using for 20 years: For each 1-percent increase in \neconomic activity in this country, or 1-percent growth, that equates to \nabout $50 billion of new revenue. Interestingly enough, this is all a \nRepublican idea. President Kennedy, who was a Democrat, said we have to \nraise more money for the Great Society, and the best way to raise money \nis to reduce marginal tax rates. He did it and it worked. We saw what \nPresident Ronald Reagan did in the years that followed that. During the \n8 years he was in office, the proceeds for marginal rates went from \n$204 billion to $466 billion. That was at a time when rates were \nreduced more than any other 8-year period in history. We are looking at \nother opportunities to reduce regulations and all that so we can \nresolve the problem.\n  There is one thing that is very important--and I know there is nobody \nin this Chamber who doesn't recognize the concern I have expressed over \nthe\n\n[[Page S7117]]\n\nyears about the legislation proposed ever since the Kyoto treaty on \nlegislative cap and trade. Every time there is an analysis made--\nwhether by MIT, or by the Wharton School, Charles Rivers, or any of the \nrest of them--the range of the cost of cap and trade legislatively is \nalways between $300 billion and $400 billion a year. We found out that \nif you do it by regulation, it is going to be far more than that. These \nare Democrats who are on record as saying that. Lisa Jackson, for whom \nI have a great deal of respect, is the Obama-appointed Director of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. Every time I ask her a question, she \ngives me an honest answer. She said:\n\n       I have said over and over, as has the President, that we do \n     understand that there are costs to the economy of addressing \n     global warming emissions, and that the best way to address \n     them is through a gradual move to a market-based program like \n     cap and trade.\n\n  Yes, they would cost a lot of money. Nobody refutes the $300 billion \nto $400 billion figure.\n  John Kerry said this:\n\n       If Congress does not pass legislation dealing with climate \n     change, the administration will use the Environmental \n     Protection Agency to impose new regulations.\n       These regulations would be more expensive. I think the EPA \n     admitted that if they were able to accomplish this through \n     regulations, they would need to hire an additional 230,000 \n     employees and spend an additional $21 billion to implement \n     its greenhouse gas regime.\n\n  All of this economic pain is for no gain. As EPA Administrator \nJackson also admitted before the EPA committee, these regulations will \nhave no effect on the climate. I want to mention that. That is \nsignificant. A lot of people disagree with me in terms of the impact of \nCO2 emissions and all of that.\n  Let me say this. Two things having to do with that issue are very \nimportant. One is that if we were to pass legislation or do something \nthrough regulation that would be aimed at reducing greenhouse gases, \nwould this have an effect on the reduction of emissions worldwide? I \nasked that question to Lisa Jackson, and her answer was \n``no.'' Obviously, the problem is not here in the United States, it is \nin China, India, and other places.\n\n  In looking at it that way, I have to also mention that we all know \nwhat happened with climategate. We all know, when we went in and \nstarted an endangerment finding, it was based on the science that came \nfrom the IPCC, which has now been totally discredited. When I have more \ntime, I will go into the details as to how that was discredited. For \nexample, this was such a great scandal, the Daily Telegraph said:\n\n       This scandal could well be the greatest in modern science.\n\n  So that is what was happening. They were cooking the science at the \nUnited Nations and the IPCC. Now we are at the point where we asked for \nan inspector general opinion as to whether the EPA had followed the \nproper guidelines in trying to regulate greenhouse gases, and, in fact, \nthey did not follow the right guidelines.\n  So I would only say that the inspector general's investigation \nuncovered that the EPA failed to engage in the required record-keeping \nprocess leading up to the endangerment finding decision, and it also \ndid not follow its own peer review procedures to ensure that the \nscience behind the decision was sound science. EPA Administrator Lisa \nJackson readily admitted the science that was used was flawed, the \nscience used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n  So I would say this: We are concerned about what is going to happen \nnow. We are concerned about the overregulations. We are concerned about \nthe process that has been used and how regulations are used to support \nan agenda the President has.\n  I will mention one last thing, and that is a regulation I didn't \nmention before. Of the five most expensive regulations, this isn't one \nof them, but it could end up costing the most. We know for a fact that \nthe United States of America--we have a report now that shows that with \nall the findings and with all the good things that are happening in the \nshale throughout the United States and elsewhere in the Northern \nHemisphere, we could be totally free from dependency on any other \ncountry if we would just get politicians out of the way and develop our \nown resources.\n  We have enough natural gas to meet America's demand for 90 years and \nenough oil for 50 years, but in order to do this, they have to use a \nprocess called hydraulic fracturing. Ironically, that was started in my \nState of Oklahoma in 1949 and has been used ever since that time, and \nthere has never been a confirmed case of groundwater contamination. \nNonetheless, right now we see that they are going through this process \nof saying: We are going to take over the regulation of hydraulic \nfracturing from the States and place it with the Federal Government. I \nhave to be suspicious that there is motive behind that, and that motive \nis to restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing.\n  We could open the east coast, the west coast, the gulf coast, the \nnorthern slope, and everything else, but if we can't use that process, \nwe will not be able to achieve energy independence, which we can do. We \ndon't have to use anything new that is out there other than oil, gas, \nand coal. With what is happening right now with hydrogen, we have an \nopportunity to become self-sufficient.\n  With that, I will yield the floor so my good friend can make his \ncomments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to recognize the valor and \naccomplishments of the 389th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron. The \n389th--better known as the T-Bolts--is part of the 366th Fighter Wing \nbased at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho. At Mountain Home, the \nsquadron is composed of 80 airmen from across the United States, \nincluding aviators and essential ground personnel. While deployed, the \nsquadron grew to over 400, including maintainers, intelligence \npersonnel, and support staff from the 366th.\n  In May 2011, the T-Bolts deployed to Bagram airbase in Afghanistan, \nwith 18 F-15E Strike Eagles to support Operation Enduring Freedom. In \nthe process, they demonstrated resolve and what can be accomplished \nthrough fierce loyalty to each other and to our country. The T-Bolts \nprosecuted 3,100 combat missions and dropped 800 tons of ordnance. They \nsupported 3,700 ground missions by American and allied forces and \nresponded to 820 ``troops in contact'' emergency combat support calls. \nIn addition, they worked directly with special operations forces to \ndestroy 170 enemy weapons caches and capture 620 detainees, including \n90 high-value individuals.\n  The diligence of the maintainers and ground personnel ensured that \nthe 389th met 100 percent of their taskings without missing a single \nsortie. And the pilots and weapons system officers broke the F-15E \ndeployment record, flying more than 14,000 hours in just over 6 months.\n  Through their excellence and determination, the 389th kept relentless \npressure on the al-Qaida network, killing key members of their senior \nleadership. Additionally, they directly supported numerous large-scale \ncoalition ground operations with kinetic and non-kinetic effects as \nthey provided lethal close air support across Afghanistan.\n  The men and women of the 389th made a real and substantial \ncontribution to the safety of America, the success of the global war on \nterror, and the destruction of al-Qaida and those who would do us harm. \nBy successfully taking the fight to the enemy, the T-Bolts helped write \nthe history of the early 21st century through their tenacity and \ncourage.\n\n  No one summed it up better or more eloquently than the commander of \nthe 366th Fighter Wing, COL Ron Buckley, who said of his airmen:\n  I am incredibly proud of the professionalism and dedication our \ngunfighters displayed while flawlessly executing their mission to \ndeliver precise combat air power for joint operations on the ground. \nFrom aircrews to maintainers to support, the T-Bolts carried on the \nincredible legacy of the gunfighters and answered our Nation's call.\n  I also want to take this important opportunity to honor America's \nunsung heroes by recognizing and commending the families and loved ones \nof those who serve in the 389th. We are also\n\n[[Page S7118]]\n\nproud of their service, their commitment, and the immense sacrifices \nthey made and continue to make on behalf of our country.\n  The T-Bolts served honorably in defense of a grateful nation, and I \nam pleased today to recognize the heroic members of the 389th for their \nvalorous service while deployed in support of Operation Enduring \nFreedom.\n  I am reminded of the core values of the Air Force: integrity first, \nservice before self, and excellence in all you do. There is no better \nexample than the airmen of the 389th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron. \nWith consummate bravery and boldness, the T-Bolts honor every American \nthrough a spirit of dedication and a sense of duty to defend a cause \nlarger than one's self. For their efforts, we and future generations \nare forever indebted and eternally grateful.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I apologize to the Chair. I had a \nmisunderstanding as to where we were, and I only wanted to try to get \nthe point across, which I think I failed to do, regarding the cost of \nthese regulations.\n  I think I used as an example the five--I mentioned, actually, six \nwhen you consider hydraulic fracturing also as one of the regulations. \nBy far, the one that is the most expensive is the regulation that would \nbe for the greenhouse gases. I think we have pretty much established \nthe cost to do a cap-and-trade bill and the range being from $300 \nbillion to $400 billion. The quotes I used, which I won't repeat now, \nwere from Administrator Jackson and Senator Kerry and others stating \nthat doing it through regulation would be far more expensive. So I \nthink we need to be looking at it in terms of about $400 billion a \nyear. This would be a tax on the American people. This would be the \ncost to our GDP.\n  I remember back in 1993 when we had the Clinton-Gore tax increase. It \nwas the largest one in four decades at that time. It was an increase in \nthe death tax, an increase in marginal rates, an increase in capital \ngains--an increase in almost all taxes--and it was a $30 billion tax \nincrease. What we are talking about here is a tax increase that is 10 \ntimes that great--10 times. We are using the figure now of $400 billion \nbecause we know that through regulation, it will cost more.\n  Again, I go back and repeat the quote we had from Administrator \nJackson of the EPA, who said in response to my question, live in our \ncommittee, if we were to pass legislation--at that time, I think it was \nthe Waxman-Markey bill, although it doesn't really matter because cap \nand trade is cap and trade--would that reduce overall emissions, and \nshe said no because it would only apply to the United States.\n  I would carry it one step further. If we were to pass or do anything \nthrough regulation here, all it will do is cause our manufacturing base \nto go out and find the energy necessary to operate. And where do they \ngo? They go to places such as China, India, and Mexico--places that \nhave almost no emission standards. So if there is a pollution problem, \nit becomes much greater, not less, in terms of overall emissions.\n  Another situation I often talk about is the time before I left to go \nto the Copenhagen United Nations event, where they were going to try to \nconvince the rest of the world that we were going to pass legislation \nthat would be cap and trade and impose this tax on the American people.\n  In a committee hearing, I said to Administrator Jackson: I have a \nfeeling that as soon as I leave town, you are going to have an \nendangerment finding.\n  Sure enough, that is what happened.\n  I said: When you have an endangerment finding, it has to be based on \nscience. So what science would you be using?\n  She said: By and large, it would be the science developed by the \nUnited Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n  Ironically, right after that, climategate came up and really \ndestroyed the legitimacy of the IPCC.\n  I have read some of the quotes that were given by different people \nwhen they talked about climategate. One of them is a British writer \nGeorge Monbiot, who is known for his environmental and political \nactivism, and he is on the other side of this. He writes a weekly \ncolumn for the Guardian. He said:\n\n       Pretending that this isn't a real crisis isn't going to \n     make it go away.\n\n  Here, he is referring to climategate and the fact that they were \ncooking the science.\n\n       Nor is an attempt to justify the emails with \n     technicalities.\n\n  Again talking about the participants in IPCC.\n\n       We'll be able to get past this only by grasping reality, \n     apologizing where appropriate and demonstrating that it \n     cannot happen again.\n\n  I also mentioned the Daily Telegraph in the UK. Quoting from it:\n\n       This scandal could well be the greatest in modern science.\n\n  Then the Atlantic Magazine, which generally is editorializing the \nother side of this issue, said:\n\n       The closed-mindedness of these supposed men of science, \n     their willingness to go to any lengths to defend a \n     preconceived message, is surprising even to me. The stink of \n     intellectual corruption is overpowering.\n\n  That was the loss of credibility of the whole idea of the science \nthat was put together by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \nat the United Nations. But to make it even worse, we requested that the \ninspector general do a study and report back as to the science and how \nthe science was developed by the IPCC and whether it followed the \nguidelines that were necessary. They came back just 1 week ago with a \nreport that says the EPA has failed to follow the responsible \nguidelines. In fact, even before the scope of the study was finalized \ntoday, the EPA was already collecting data samples at the undisclosed \nfracking sites, so they are going in now to using the same type of \nflawed science and going after other parts of their agenda. In this \ncase, it would be hydraulic fracturing, which I mentioned just a few \nminutes ago, is an attempt to stop our ability to develop our own \nresources.\n  In the course of this overregulation, I think we have to keep in mind \nand to keep talking about these six greatest and most costly regulatory \nproblems that we have out there and how much it is going to cost the \nAmerican people. Again, the one that is the most serious right now is \ntrying to regulate and do a cap-and-trade through the regulations as \nopposed to doing it through legislation.\n  We are going to keep talking about that. It is not going to go away. \nPeople think time will make people forget. But we don't forget \nsomething of that magnitude.\n  I did a calculation in my State of Oklahoma; as I always do, I get \nthe number of families who file a tax return each year. When something \ncomes along that will cost something, I do the calculation and I do the \nmath and then I go back to the American people and say: Get ready. This \nis what it is going to cost.\n  If we were to have passed any of the bills that were like the Kyoto \nProtocol, and the last one being the Waxman-Markey bill, the cost would \nhave been at least $300 billion. If we take that annual cost, that \nwould cost my tax-paying families in Oklahoma in excess of $3,000 a \nfamily, and they get nothing for it.\n  We can do an awful lot of talking about the deficits and the spending \nof this administration. Let's don't overlook perhaps the most expensive \nthing to the American people; that is, the overregulation that makes us \nnoncompetitive with the rest of the world.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

HARDIMAN\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise to pay tribute to John Hardiman, \npublic defender for the State of Rhode Island, who passed away several \ndays ago.\n  John was, frankly, the finest public servant I have ever seen in my \nentire\n\n[[Page S7119]]\n\ncareer, as a soldier, as an elected official. I have never encountered \nanyone with the dedication, decency, and the determination of John \nHardiman. He literally devoted his life to the office of public \ndefender in the State of Rhode Island.\n  He graduated from law school in 1982. He started as a staff attorney \nthere, worked his way up to the head of trial division, and then became \nthe public defender for the entire State of Rhode Island.\n  His life was devoted to the law. Quietly, persistently, with \ndiligence, dedication, and decency, he sought to do justice--justice \nnot to the powerful or privileged but for the powerless. Indeed, in \nmany cases, his clients were not only notorious; they were infamous. \nBut John knew the test of our ideals, the test of our legal system, and \nof our constitutional form of government was that the laws would not \nsimply protect the powerful and privileged, but that they protect all \nAmericans.\n  Above the entrance of the U.S. Supreme Court are the words ``Equal \nJustice Under Law.'' For many people, even lawyers, those are just \nwords. For John Hardiman, it was his life's vocation, and he made real \nthose words in the lives of every Rhode Islander.\n  John was a tenacious advocate, but he was always a remarkably modest \nand decent man. His legal skills rested on a foundation of \nunimpeachable integrity and decency. He dedicated his life to serving \nothers. In that advocation and vocation, he was following the example \nof his father, Dr. James Hardiman, and his mother. They left John a \nshining example of compassion and concern, a generous spirit, and a \nhumble heart. All his brothers and sisters follow that same example as \nthey, too, in their lives served others.\n  I had the privilege of growing up with John. He was one of the little \nkids in school, about 5 years younger, but he always had the \nreputation--entirely justified--of being a good kid. Where I come from, \nbeing a good kid was the highest form of praise. That good kid turned \nout to be an extraordinary man, advocate, and public servant. This is a \npoignant moment for me because I recall the many times I saw him \nthroughout his life and my life, as a young student in grammar school, \nas an athlete similar to his brothers, as a lawyer, as a public \ndefender, as a public servant. He was someone whom you were always glad \nto see, and those types of individuals are rare and precious, indeed.\n  John's passing diminishes all of us, especially his family. But his \nlife has touched the lives of every Rhode Islander. Many will never \nrecognize what he has done. But in standing for justice and for the \nrule of law and for the rights of those who are in the shadows, he \nstood for all of us, nobly, decently, with a proud spirit but a gentle \nspirit also. We have all been diminished, but what he has done for us \nhas made us stronger and better and more ready to go on to take up his \nwork. His example will sustain us and inspire us as we go forward, as \nwe try to finish his noble work.\n  I wish to especially extend my condolences to his children, Elizabeth \nand Emmett, and to all his family. Rhode Island has lost an \nextraordinary public servant, an extraordinary gentleman. But we are \nbetter for having known him, we are better for having him serve us so \nwell, so courageously, so decently.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, there has been a lot of discussion in \nthe Senate, in the House, and in the media about what the \nsupercommittee is doing and what they should be doing. The American \npeople understand their responsibility in terms of trying to reduce our \nnational debt and our deficit is difficult. I wish them the best of \nluck in coming up with a solution.\n  My hope, simply stated, is that the supercommittee will do what the \nAmerican people want them to do. The American people, through \ndemonstrations all over this country and in poll after poll, have made \nit pretty clear what they want to see happen. The American people are \nbecoming more and more aware that there is something very wrong in this \ncountry when we have the most unequal distribution of income and wealth \nof any major country on Earth; when the top 1 percent earns more income \nthan the bottom 50 percent; when in a recent 25-year period, 80 percent \nof all new income went to the top 1 percent; and when the gap between \nthe very rich and everybody else is wider today than it has ever been \nsince 1928, the year before the Great Depression.\n  If anyone thinks distribution of income in this country is unfair, \nthen they should look at distribution of wealth, which is much more \nunfair. Today the wealthiest 400 Americans own more wealth than the \nbottom half of America, 150 million people--400 people, 150 million \nAmericans. That unbelievable inequality in terms of wealth, in my view, \nis not only morally wrong, it is very bad economics, and it is not \nsustainable.\n  When the supercommittee deliberates as to where they should go, I \nthink one direction is very clear. The American people of all political \nspectrums have made their point of view known very strongly on this \nissue. Whether Democrat, Independent, or Republican, poll after poll \nshows when the wealthiest people in this country are becoming \nwealthier; when, as Warren Buffett reminds us, their effective tax \nrate--i.e. real tax rate--is the lowest it has been in decades; yes, \nthe wealthiest people in this country are going to have to pay more in \ntaxes to enable us to go forward on deficit reduction.\n  So any serious plan brought forth by the supercommittee must ask the \nwealthiest people in this country to pay more in taxes. Furthermore, as \nI think everybody knows, we have corporation after corporation that \nbenefits from huge tax loopholes.\n  A study just came out today that shows one out of four major \ncorporations pays nothing in taxes. Recently, there are examples that \nmajor corporations made billions of dollars in profit and not only paid \nnothing in taxes but got rebates from the IRS. Many of these \ncorporations stash their profits in tax havens in the Cayman Islands \nand elsewhere to avoid U.S. taxes.\n  I think the American people are very clear; if we are going to go \nforward with deficit reduction, large corporations are also going to \nhave to start paying their fair share of taxes. This is across the \npolitical spectrum.\n  I hope the supercommittee is hearing and understands that any \nagreement must contain significant revenue from the wealthiest people \nin this country and from the largest corporations.\n  Furthermore, at a time when military spending has tripled since 1997, \nI hope as part of their agreement that the supercommittee takes a hard \nlook at our defense budget and asks whether it is necessary that the \nUnited States of America spends more on defense than the entire rest of \nthe world combined.\n  Those are some of the areas I hope the supercommittee will explore: \nasking the wealthy to start paying their fair share of taxes, ending \ntax loopholes for large corporations, and taking a hard look at \nmilitary spending which has tripled since 1997.\n  Then there is another area the supercommittee must also look at; that \nis, to understand that in the midst of the worst recession since the \nGreat Depression, a recession caused by the greed and recklessness and \nillegal behavior on Wall Street, the supercommittee must not cut Social \nSecurity, cut Medicare, or cut Medicaid. Social Security is the most \nsuccessful Federal program in the history of our country. It has a $2.5 \ntrillion surplus. It can pay out all benefits for the next 25 years \nbecause it is funded by the payroll tax. It has not contributed one \nnickel to our deficit. The supercommittee must not cut Social Security.\n  Madam President, 50 million Americans have no health insurance and \nmany others are underinsured. According to a study at Harvard \nUniversity, 45,000 Americans die each year because they do not get to \nthe doctor when they should. Under those conditions it\n\n[[Page S7120]]\n\nwould be immoral, it would be wrong for the supercommittee to cut \nMedicare and to cut Medicaid.\n  I hope the supercommittee does what the American people have said \nvery loudly and clearly--they have said it in demonstrations, they have \nsaid it in polls, they have said it in communications with their \nMembers in the House and the Senate--we have an opportunity to make \nsignificant progress in terms of deficit reduction, but that deficit \nreduction should not take place on the backs of the elderly, the \nchildren, the sick, and the poor. Those populations, the most \nvulnerable people in this country, are hurting enough right now.\n  I hope the supercommittee has the courage to do what is right. I hope \nthey have the courage to do what the American people want them to do.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken).

Mr. President, we are going through one of the most \ndifficult and painful periods in American history, and millions of \nAmericans are wondering what is happening to our country. Behind the \ncurtain of spin, propaganda, and political attacks, here is what I \nbelieve is happening.\n  The rules of the economic game in this country are increasingly being \nrigged to provide unfair advantage to the wealthy and well-connected \nand to take unfair advantage of regular folks and families. America has \nalways promised a straight deal, and that straight deal, for many \nAmericans, is getting harder and harder to find.\n  Let me say I am relentlessly proud to be an American. I grew up in \nthe foreign service of this country, surrounded by families who put \npublic service and pride in this country ahead of their comfort, their \nconvenience, even their safety and their family's safety. I am \nabsolutely convinced of American exceptionalism. I have seen it, and I \nhave lived it.\n  That is why I am so upset to see our country in the shape it is in \ntoday. Our Founding Fathers changed the world when they set in place \nour finely balanced system of government, illuminated by the clear and \nguaranteed rights of the American people. We are squandering that \ninheritance. Our government is not working, our rights are being \nundermined, and it is the American people who are paying the price. \nThey are paying the price because too often they are not getting a \nstraight deal anymore.\n  Let's look at some of the places where the deal is rigged, where \nspecial interest gets special deals, and where the regular American \nfamily doesn't get a straight deal. Big multistate banks are allowed to \ncharge middle-class families 30 percent credit card interest rates that \nare likely illegal under the State laws where that family lives. \nSenators in this Chamber who are ardent States rights federalists in \nevery other circumstance have no complaint when their State law is \noverruled and overborne by the big banks. Students with college loans--\nwho now carry $1 trillion of debt--and families with home mortgages are \ndenied the privileges every corporate borrower gets to seek, bankruptcy \nprotection against their debt when they are in over their heads.\n  Our individual tax system allows the wealthiest and highest income \nAmericans to pay lower tax rates than middle-class wage earners pay or \neven hide their income in offshore tax havens and pay no tax at all. \nThe corporate tax system allows international corporations to route \ntheir profits through foreign countries and through tax shelters to pay \nlittle or no tax in this country.\n  When you drill down to cases, GE, General Electric, on billions of \ndollars in profit, paid little or no Federal income tax. When you pull \nup to look system-wide, even though corporations are richer than ever, \nAmerican people now contribute $5 for every $1 corporations contribute \nto sustaining our country's revenues. It used to be 1 to 1. For every \n$1 corporations contributed, the American people contributed $1. There \nwas an even sharing of our Nation's revenue needs. But for 75 years now \nit has been steadily sliding, and now it is 5 to 1 against ordinary \nAmericans and in favor of corporations.\n  The wealthy elite who make their fortunes in the marketplace don't \nprotect and honor the marketplace. They try to rig the game, even when \nit puts the marketplace itself at risk. When that requires everybody \nelse to come to their rescue, they show no shame and little gratitude \nand go right back to work gaming the system. Those who have become CEOs \nextract from their company's ridiculous amounts of compensation. CEO \npay is up in my lifetime from 40 times the average wage of the employee \nto 400 times the average wage. These CEOs even extract princely \ncompensation when they fail.\n  The big polluters have one party denying science entirely, denying \nthe plain evidence of carbon pollution all around us and spinning the \nphony theory that the cost of controlling pollution is a burden on the \neconomy when it is actually a huge net gain for our country. A party \nthat used to proudly carry the banner of conservation and environmental \nprotection is now reduced to serving corporate spin masters with phony \nfabrications, and it is the middle-class families who pay the price.\n  The appointees of one party on the Supreme Court, by a bare 5-to-4 \nmajority, are willing to overturn precedent and flout the rules of \njudicial decisionmaking to decrease something novel and remarkable: \nthat corporations are people and money is speech and, therefore, our \nprecious constitutional rights to free speech, as American people, give \ncorporations a right to spend as much money as they please, even \nanonymously, in American elections.\n  International corporations with no loyalty to any flag or nation but \nwith virtually unlimited money may now drown out the voices of regular \npeople, regular families in our American democracy. CEOs get to use the \ncorporate megaphone amplified by the corporate treasury to drown out \ntheir employees' voices. Just one big corporation with just 5 percent \nof one-quarter's profits could match the entire political spending of \nboth Presidential campaigns in the last election.\n\n  Our Constitution and Bill of Rights established the jury not once but \nthree separate times as an important institution of freedom in our \nsystem of democracy. DeTocqueville--one of the great historians and \ncommentators on the American system of government--called the American \njury ``one of the forms of the sovereignty of the people.'' Big \ncorporations go to court all the time and fight it out before a jury \nwhen they want to. Yet over and over again, a middle-class family, in \ncontracts, cannot negotiate or control, in fine print they probably \nnever even read, their credit card company, their cell phone company, \nthe companies they do business with, quietly take away their right to \ngo against them before an American jury. Over and over again those same \nSupreme Court Justices who decided a corporation was a person have let \nthem down. They have to go, instead, to something called arbitration \ninstead of a constitutional American jury.\n  To give an idea of how arbitration works, for a long time the biggest \narbitration company in the country was a racket rigged to rule against \nthe consumer. It had to be shut down by legal actions by our State \nattorneys general. Add it all up, all those different areas that I \nmentioned, and there have been a lot of changes since my childhood.\n  There are a lot of changes in how our country runs, and it is all in \nthe same direction--special deals and special tax rates and special \nrules that help big corporations and people who are as wealthy as big \ncorporations and leave out regular people who don't have masses of \nmoney, money, money; rules that allow corporations to intrude into our \npublic discourse in this democracy and drown out people's voices \nthrough mighty corporate megaphones amplified by money, money, money; \nlies and nonsense cooked up in corporate spin\n\n[[Page S7121]]\n\nfactories being treated as fact obtaining acceptability by how often \nthe lies are repeated thanks to money, money, money.\n  Under all of that money, what is drowning is the sense we are all in \nthis together as Americans. One of the things America actually stands \nfor in this world is that we are fair with each other. We get a \nstraight deal, and we give each other a straight deal. That is one of \nthe ways we, as Americans, set an example in this world, an example of \nbeing fair. There are plenty of countries in the world whose internal \npolitical and economic systems amount to a racket, a racket rigged for \nthe benefit of the rich and powerful where farmers and workers and \nordinary families get screwed and the wealthy skim all the cream. Some \nof these countries are so bad we call them kleptocracies. The world is \nfull of that.\n  It has been the pride and joy of America that we are not like that. \nIt has been our message to the world that it doesn't have to be like \nthat. But now it is looking more and more like we actually are becoming \njust like that.\n  What can we do about it? What can we do to make sure Americans are \ngetting a straight deal in all of this? I propose these actions: No. 1, \nbig banks should have to follow the State laws just like local banks do \nand just like you and I do. No more going to South Dakota and marketing \nfrom their credit cards 30 percent interest rates that violate the laws \nof the home State.\n  No. 2, if big corporations can restructure all their debts in \nbankruptcy court, so should students and families be able to. No \nsecond-class citizenship for those who borrowed college loans and home \nmortgages.\n  No. 3, amend the Constitution to make it clear that corporations are \nnot people--never were, never could be. The Good Lord just did not make \nit that way. We need to make it crystal clear that corporations can't \nspend money in American elections anonymously or through phony shell \norganizations. If big oil wants to influence American elections, \nAmericans should know it is big oil.\n\n  No. 4: Straighten out our tax systems and, until we do, put in a \nminimum tax for ultra-high income earners that is at least at the rate \nthat ordinary American taxpaying families pay. While we are at it, put \nin a minimum corporate tax rate that is at least half of what average \ncorporations pay. No corporation that is making millions or billions of \ndollars should get away with paying nothing in income tax.\n  No. 5: Shut down the offshore tax havens and charge companies a CEO \npay surtax on CEO compensation that is more than 100 times their \naverage worker's compensation.\n  No. 6: Make polluters pay the actual costs of their pollution. Why \nshould a polluting company be able to push onto all of the rest of us \nthe costs of their pollution? Why should American families bear that \npolluting corporation's costs? Economics tells us that should be part \nof the company's cost of doing business.\n  No. 7: No more corporate tax deductions for offshoring American jobs, \nand no more favoring of offshore corporate income derived from what \nused to be American jobs.\n  No. 8: Take out of those take-it-or-leave-it consumer contracts the \nprovisions that take away in the fine print the American right to go \nbefore an American jury, as the Constitution and Bill of Rights \npromises whenever a citizen has a grievance or has been harmed.\n  None of these eight things I have mentioned asks anything of anyone \nthat isn't fair, and most of them simply ask that ordinary Americans \nget the same deal, or at least no worse of a deal, than special \nAmericans get and big corporations get. This all does no more than put \npeople on the same level, or at least under the same rules, as the rich \nand powerful.\n  When someone is getting a better deal than you because of who they \nare, you are not getting a straight deal. When someone is taking \nadvantage of you because you are small and easy to take advantage of, \nyou are not getting a straight deal. When the rules of the game are \nrigged to help the winners win and to make you a loser, you are not \ngetting a straight deal. It is time we started giving the people of \nAmerica a straight deal around here.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan).

DELMER GROSS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding Kentuckian who dedicated his life to serving the children \nof Laurel County. Mr. Delmer Gross was a bus driver for the Laurel \nCounty Board of Education for 39 years and cherishes his memories \ndriving kids to and from school--many of his former students are his \ngood friends still to this day. In his spare time, Delmer serves as the \npastor at London Community Church, a role he has enjoyed for almost 43 \nyears.\n  Delmer started driving a school bus in 1969 when he was only 21 years \nold. He spent 5 years driving a double route as his first assignment. \nEach morning he would start by busing students in grades 1 through 12 \nto Swiss Colony. Then he would go to Mitchell Creek, located west of \nInterstate 75, and pick up elementary school students, only to return \nthem to Swiss Colony via the road that is now Ky. 1956.\n  His second route took him all the way down to Rockcastle River and \nwas much more dangerous because of the truck traffic. ``We didn't have \na four-lane road then,'' Delmer recalls. ``There were a lot of crooked \nplaces where I had to pick up kids on the opposite side of a curve. \nI've had trucks slide at me sideways. A couple of times it was quite \nfrightening.'' Delmer drove this route for almost 24 years before he \nbegan driving a town route with special-needs students in 1997.\n  One time, Delmer was driving on Ky. 1956 through freezing rain and \nsnow and made a stop just under the crest of a hill. Two girls got off \nthe bus just before a car came over the hill and barely stopped in \ntime. Unfortunately, a second car came along and was unable to stop. It \ncrashed into the back of the first, sending the car spinning into a \ndriveway. The second car bounced into Delmer's lane as a result of the \ncrash and hit the bus head-on, clipping one of the girls in the knee. \nDelmer went straight home, got in his car, and drove over to the little \ngirl's house to help her father take her to the hospital. Thankfully, \nshe walked away with only minor injuries.\n  Delmer deeply cherishes the countless memories that he made with the \nstudents he shuttled throughout his three-decade-long career, and he \nrarely had any disciplinary issues with any of the children. ``I had a \ngood relationship with almost all of the students I hauled,'' Delmer \nsaid.\n  Madam President, Mr. Delmer Gross's dedication to his job and the \nsafety of his students is admirable. I commend him for his 39 years of \nexcellent service to the children of Laurel County schools. Delmer's \ncareer serves as an inspiration to the people of our great Commonwealth \nand exemplifies the true spirit of Kentucky. The Laurel County-area \nSentinel Echo published an article in the spring of this year to honor \nMr. Delmer Gross's achievements. I ask unanimous consent that the full \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                 [From the Sentinel Echo, Spring 2011]\n\n                  Driving a Bus Is No Laughing Matter\n\n                            (By Carol Mills)\n\n       Delmer Gross loved being a bus driver for the Laurel County \n     Board of Education for 39 years, but he saw the behavior of \n     students getting worse over the years.\n       ``The last 15 years the students have been getting \n     progressively worse,'' he said. ``Less respect for adults, \n     less respect for authority. You had several that were pushing \n     their boundaries. I see the attitudes of children, the \n     discipline and behavior is a much greater problem than it was \n     20 years ago. It's becoming a problem in all public places. \n     Kids don't have parents who really discipline them. As adults \n     they have major problems with society. They weren't taught \n     respect, weren't forced to respect and it's showing.''\n       Gross said the Bible teaches ``to spare the rod we hate our \n     child.'' ``I don't think we get much smarter than the man who \n     said that,'' he said. ``In his day he was the wisest man\n\n[[Page S7122]]\n\n     that ever lived. Solomon wrote all those proverbs that are \n     recorded in the Bible.''\n       Gross did not have many disciplinary problems with the \n     students on the bus and when he did, he usually handled them \n     himself.\n       Gross, now 64, started driving a school bus in 1969 when he \n     was 21 years old. He also painted houses between routes and \n     has been the pastor at London Community Church for almost 43 \n     years.\n       ``I had a double route, which most drivers did,'' Gross \n     recalled. ``I left this community and went to the next \n     community which is White Oak. I transported all of the \n     children first through 12th grade to Swiss Colony and then I \n     would drop all of the kids and go to Mitchell Creek, which is \n     back by Interstate 75 just on the west side of 75. Then I \n     would go through that community and would pick up just \n     elementary kids and bring them back on what was old Route 80 \n     at the time. It's (Ky.) 1956 now. I would run that route from \n     Interstate 75 along with Mitchell Creek and transport them \n     back to Swiss Colony. I did that for a short time.''\n       Gross drove the White Oak route for five years and then he \n     let someone else take it over who lived in that community. He \n     then took a dangerous route on Old Ky. 80.\n       ``It was a very dangerous route because of the truck \n     traffic. We didn't have a four-lane road then,'' he said. ``I \n     drove all the way down to the Rockcastle River. I drove that \n     route for 23 or 24 years. There were a lot of crooked places \n     where I had to pick up kids on the opposite side of a curve. \n     I've had trucks slide at me sideways. A couple of times it \n     was quite frightening.''\n       In 1997, Gross started driving a town route with special-\n     needs students. He said it was not as hectic as driving a \n     route with all the age groups.\n       Over the years while driving a school bus, Gross had two or \n     three minor accidents and one that could have been very \n     dangerous.\n       ``It was a day in March. It would snow and then it would \n     melt, then freeze and then snow some more, melt and freeze,'' \n     he recalled. ``The officials kept an eye on most of the main \n     roads, but just about 3 o'clock it started freezing and \n     snowing. I picked up a load at South High School and came to \n     (Ky.) 1956. I made a stop just under the crest of a hill, \n     probably 150 to 200 yards away. A car came over the hill just \n     after I dropped off two girls. The car stopped in time. \n     Another car came over the crest and when she braked, she hit \n     the little car in the rear end and spun it around and pushed \n     it back into a driveway.''\n       ``One of the girls managed to run across the road and over \n     to the edge of a bank,'' he continued. ``The car that caused \n     all of this bounced off that little car and into my lane and \n     hit my bus head on and went underneath the bus. The other \n     girl who had gotten off the bus was clipped on the knee by \n     the car that caused the accident. She only had a minor \n     injury. The drivers of the two cars weren't hurt. I thought \n     both girls were going to be pinned between my bus and the \n     car.''\n       Gross said the officer who worked the accident did not \n     mandate the girl who was hurt be taken to the hospital to be \n     checked out.\n       ``I was quite surprised after it was all over and when I \n     went home, I called back to the child's home and I took my \n     little car and waited until her father got home from work and \n     we took her to the hospital.''\n       One of Gross's memorable moments on the bus route was the \n     day two boys were cutting up and joking. They were sitting up \n     front so that he could keep an eye on them.\n       ``They were cutting up quite a bit, joking, teasing and \n     laughing,'' Gross said. ``That didn't bother me. I was \n     listening to them. One of them said something kind of funny. \n     I thought I could be cute so I said something I thought \n     topped what he had said. He looked at his little buddy--they \n     were both elementary kids--`Tell you what,' he said, 5,000 \n     comedians in this country out of a job and look what we're \n     stuck with.' I got so tickled I didn't even try to top that \n     line.''\n       ``I had a good relationship with almost all of the students \n     I hauled,'' Gross added. ``A lot of the older age groups are \n     grown up now and are good friends of mine.''\n       Gross is married to Yvonne and they have three children--\n     Suzanne Gray, Cheryl Winters, and Delmer Paul Gross.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/03/senate-section/article/S7122-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ILLINOIS JUVENILE JUSTICE REFORM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, as a proponent of smart and fair crime \npolicies, as well as improving the effectiveness of the juvenile \njustice system, I would like to commend my home State of Illinois for \nits recent reforms in this area. I have long supported and sponsored \nlegislation in Congress to ensure that children are treated \nappropriately, whether they are sexually exploited victims who do not \nbelong in the criminal justice system, or whether they commit crimes \nand deserve targeted assistance or punishment. As one of several States \nin the Nation moving away from a punishment-based juvenile justice \nsystem and toward one of rehabilitation and prevention, Illinois has \nbeen nationally recognized for its progress. Two recent laws in \nparticular have advanced our treatment of youth in the criminal justice \nsystem in Illinois.\n  First, as of January 1, 2010, 17-year-old misdemeanants in Illinois \nare no longer automatically filtered into the adult justice system. \nUnder Public Act 95-1031, 17-year-olds charged with misdemeanors will \nnow have access to the juvenile courts rather than the adult system. \nThis change will allow more youth to participate in much-needed \nrehabilitation services such as mental health, drug treatment, and \ncommunity-based services.\n  In addition, the state legislature took another step forward by \nenacting Public Act 96-1199 last year. This law requires the Illinois \nJuvenile Justice Commission to study the impact of expanding the \njuvenile court's jurisdiction to 17-year-olds charged with felonies. It \nalso requires the Commission to develop timelines, propose a funding \nstructure, and submit a final report to the Illinois General Assembly \nby December 31, 2011.\n  These new State laws will help our state use its resources more \neffectively and give more young people the opportunity to live \nproductive lives. In their efforts to further these goals, I would also \nlike to commend two of our juvenile justice advocates in Illinois. \nBetsy Clarke is the founder and president of the Illinois Juvenile \nJustice Initiative and has spent more than 20 years advocating for the \nyouth of our state. Along with leading efforts to reduce the \nprosecution of youth in adult criminal courts, she has supported \nRedeploy Illinois, a program that emphasizes community-based \nalternatives over secure confinement. Redeploy Illinois has saved \nIllinois taxpayers millions in corrections costs. Ms. Clarke also \nplayed a role in the formation of the new Illinois Department of \nJuvenile Justice and legislation requiring early counsel so youth can \nobtain quality legal representation from the beginning of their \ndealings with the criminal justice system.\n  Grace Warren is the co-director and family organizer for the National \nParent Caucus, a group of parents and family members dedicated to \nkeeping youth under the age of 18 out of the adult criminal system. She \nbecame involved in this public awareness campaign in 2004 when her 17-\nyear-old son was convicted and sentenced as an adult. Previously, she \nworked with the Tamms Year Ten Campaign and the Illinois Coalition for \nFair Sentencing of Children at Northwestern University. She currently \nvolunteers with the John Howard Association of Illinois, monitoring \njuvenile and adult facilities, and she recently provided testimony to \nthe Federal Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice on the importance \nof family engagement by juvenile and criminal justice systems.\n  In this time of shrinking state budgets, it is important to recognize \nefforts to improve outcomes for our youth and communities which also \nutilize our state resources more effectively. With the recent juvenile \njustice reforms in Illinois and the hard work of two dedicated leaders \nin this field, Illinois is well on track to succeeding in these goals. \nI commend this progress, and I will continue to wholeheartedly support \nthese efforts through my work in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/03/senate-section/article/S7122-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7122-S7123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      OBJECTION TO FCC NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I intend to object to proceeding to \nthe nomination of Jessica Rosenworcel and Ajit Pai to be commissioners \non the Federal Communications Commission.\n  I will object to proceeding to the nomination because the FCC \ncontinues to stonewall a document request I submitted to the FCC over 6 \nmonths ago on April 27, 2011, regarding their actions related to \nLightSquared and Harbinger Capital. Since then, I have repeated my \nrequest to the FCC through letters I sent on July 5 and September 8 and \nthe FCC continues to deny my request for documents.\n  During the course of my correspondence with the FCC, the FCC has made \nit clear that it will not voluntarily turn over documents to the 99.6 \npercent of the Members of Congress and Senators who do not chair a \ncommittee with direct jurisdiction over the FCC. As I said in my \nSeptember 8, 2011, letter their actions are misguided and \nunsupportable.\n  It not only sets a dangerous precedent for Federal agency to \nunilaterally set the rules on how it engages with\n\n[[Page S7123]]\n\nCongress it also prevents any meaningful ability for the vast majority \nof Congress to inform themselves of how an agency works.\n  Several months ago, I had to take similar action when I supported \nSenator Chambliss' hold of James Cole's nomination to be Deputy \nAttorney General in order to get documents from the Department of \nJustice. In the end, the documents we uncovered shed light on the \nDepartment's actions regarding Operation Fast and Furious and the \nmurder of Agent Brian Terry.\n  I strongly believe that it is critical for Congress to have access to \ndocuments in order to conduct vigorous and independent oversight. It is \nunfortunate that this administration, which has pledged to be the most \ntransparent in history, disagrees. As long as they continue to do so, I \nwill be forced to take steps like this in order to ensure that Congress \nreceives a complete picture of this administration's actions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/03/senate-section/article/S7123-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7123-S7124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO KRISTEN KELLIHER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am taking this opportunity to share \nwith the Senate the extraordinary accomplishment of a young Vermonter. \nAt the age of 17 years, 4 months, and 13 days, Kristen Kelliher became \nthe youngest female to climb the highest peaks in all 48 States in the \ncontinental United States. Her journey began in 2002 as she and her \nfamily started climbing during family vacations. Soon she progressed to \nscaling the tops of America's most challenging peaks, including Mount \nHood and Mount Rainer. Along the way, she endured injuries and \nlogistical setbacks, but she never let those stop her from reaching her \ngoal. She saved the best for last. Surrounded by 30 family members on a \nsunny September day, she summited Vermont's Mount Mansfield, in Stowe. \nShe is a dynamic role model to all Vermonters, young and old.\n  Along with excelling on the hiking trails, Kristen is also an honor \nstudent and a three-sport athlete. She plans to graduate early and \nclimb the last two peaks--Hawaii's Mauna Kea, and Alaska's Mount \nMcKinley--next year. Kristen is modest when praised about her \nachievement and says she only hopes to inspire others to reach goals \nthey once thought unattainable. Vermonters are proud to recognize \nKristen Kelliher's strength, skill and stamina, and we congratulate her \non this great accomplishment. I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record an article about her achievement, from The Boston Globe.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Oct. 14, 2011]\n\n                     Climbing Into the Record Book\n\n                          (By Josephe P. Kahn)\n\n       Norwich, VT.--On a warm, sunny afternoon last month, \n     Kristen Kelliher hiked to the top of Mount Mansfield, the \n     highest point in her home state of Vermont. Accompanied by 30 \n     family members and friends, she was greeted at the summit by \n     a banner celebrating her achievement, one that landed \n     Kelliher in the record books.\n       That day, at age 17 years, 4 months, and 13 days, she \n     became the youngest female to ``highpoint''--stand atop the \n     highest peak--in all 48 states in the continental United \n     States.\n       Climbing Mount Mansfield, all 4,393 feet of it, was a piece \n     of cake, though, compared with what Kelliher accomplished \n     this year. Beginning in June, she conquered three peaks that \n     rank among America's most challenging: Oregon's Mount Hood, \n     Montana's Granite Peak, and Washington's Mount Rainier, whose \n     imposing height (14,410 feet) and treacherous weather \n     conditions make any ascent risky.\n       The previous female record holder, Danielle Birrer, was 18 \n     years, 4 days old when she set the record in 2000. In all, \n     only 404 climbers of any age or gender have achieved the 48-\n     state feat, according to the Highpointers Club, a Colorado \n     organization that compiles such statistics.\n       In the meantime, Kelliher has set her sights on Hawaii and \n     Alaska--and an even more exclusive club, the 50-staters. Of \n     its 214 members, fewer than 15 are female.\n       ``I've wanted to do this since I was 9,'' Kelliher said in \n     an interview at the high school she attends across the \n     Vermont border in Hanover, N.H., where she is in her senior \n     year. A three-sport athlete and honors student, Kelliher was \n     preparing to play in a varsity field hockey game.\n       Inspired by an article about a record-setting 12-year-old \n     male highpointer, Kelliher, who has been hiking and skiing \n     all her life, decided to try for the girls' record at an age \n     when many girls might consider hiking more of a chore than a \n     challenge.\n       ``I'm kind of competitive. OK, a lot,'' Kelliher said, \n     breaking into smile. ``It sounded like a cool goal. I \n     thought, I could do that, too.''\n       Her climb into the record books has not been uneventful, \n     uninterrupted, inexpensive, or worry-free, however, \n     particularly on her family's part.\n       Conquering Rainier in July took three attempts, each with \n     its own challenges. Her first expedition--accompanied by her \n     stepfather, Bill Bender, a solar-energy company owner, and \n     led by a professional guide team--ended in disappointment. \n     After returning to base camp, Kelliher learned that while her \n     group had technically ``summited,'' they had stopped short of \n     reaching Rainier's actual highpoint, because of bad weather. \n     The mountain's true highpoint, known as Columbia Crest, was a \n     40-minute round trip from where her party turned around, even \n     though the group received papers certifying that they had \n     summited.\n       It took two more attempts, each costing several hundred \n     dollars in guide fees and equipment rentals, for Kelliher to \n     cross Washington off her list: number 46, and counting.\n       \"I was so upset,'' she recalled of the stomach-sinking \n     moment when she found she had fallen short. ``If I am going \n     for a record, I have to get to the top. Technically, nobody \n     would have known. But morally it wasn't quite right.''\n       Her stepfather says it's in her nature to persevere where \n     others might not.\n       ``Mentally as well as physically, Kristen's very tough,'' \n     he said. Climbing Mount Hood, Kelliher incurred painfully \n     swollen shins that stayed unhealed through her first Rainier \n     climb. ``You never heard her complain, though'' Bender said. \n     Instead, Kelliher grew even more determined after other \n     climbers seemed doubtful she could make it up Rainier, \n     period, potentially forcing them to turn back, too.\n       What has recently become a celebration of one teen's \n     extraordinary feat is also a family saga, one that has taken \n     Kelliher, her parents, and three siblings to remote corners \n     of America that few seek out, much less scale with backpacks \n     and ice axes.\n       Their first conquest happened almost by accident, on a 2002 \n     cross-country road trip, when the family hiked up South \n     Dakota's Harney Peak. Highpointing wasn't even in their \n     vocabulary yet.\n       In 2004, urged on by Kelliher, they began targeting other \n     states more systematically. First came New England (all \n     except Vermont, which she saved for last), then six mid-\n     Atlantic states. An 18-state odyssey in 2005 took them \n     through the Deep South, Midwest, and Southwest. In 2006, they \n     knocked off 11 more states. In most cases, the family--\n     including Kelliher's older brother, Ryan, now 19, and two \n     half-brothers, Billy, 10, and Danny, 7--drove from state to \n     state, camping along the way and hiking together up all but \n     the steepest peaks.\n       ``This trip has taken places we just wouldn't have gone to \n     otherwise,'' said her mother, Mary Bender, a pediatrician. \n     Asked whether her daughter's quest to set a record had been \n     their driving force, she nodded and laughed. ``Although I \n     will say that if Kristen had set out to see every shopping \n     mall in America, that wouldn't have worked for us.''\n       Only once, in June 2006, did the family highpoint twice \n     (Illinois and Indiana) in a single day. States like Florida, \n     whose 345-foot highpoint, Britton Hill, is America's lowest, \n     were no challenge at all. Five, including Rhode Island, never \n     rise above 900 feet.\n       On the other extreme are 11 state highpoints soaring 11,000 \n     feet and higher, many of which are difficult to access. \n     Wyoming's Gannett Peak, for instance, which Kelliher and \n     Bender climbed in August 2010, is reachable only by a 46-mile \n     round trip hike. Lugging backpacks crammed with climbing \n     equipment and camping gear, the two spent six long days \n     getting to the top and back.\n       Highpoints, said Bill Bender, ``are all kind of weird in \n     their own way. You have to be a little eccentric to do \n     this.'' He has never calculated the overall cost of their \n     highpointing excursions, which until recently have been \n     budgeted as ordinary family vacations. However, flying to the \n     last few Western states and paying for guides and equipment \n     have nudged their spending into ``the many thousands. I'm not \n     sure we want to know the total. Except for the last handful, \n     though, it's been fairly inexpensive.''\n       Tim Webb, president of the 3,000-member Highpointers Club, \n     says his organization attracts a diverse mix of hikers, \n     wilderness backpackers, and serious mountaineers, each with \n     different objectives.\n       ``We get a broad spectrum, including lots of families who \n     plan vacations around highpointing,'' Webb notes. \n     Accumulating even 40 states, for which his club awards a \n     special pin, is ``a pretty significant accomplishment,'' he \n     adds.\n       Early on, the Benders were unsure Kelliher would remain \n     interested in pursuing all 48. By 2007, Kelliher having \n     completed 10 trips and 42 highpoints, only two Eastern \n     states, New York and Vermont, were left. Then came a two-year \n     hiatus.\n       ``Kristen was still growing, and she needed to grow into \n     the bigger mountains,'' her stepfather recalled.\n       She began last year taller, stronger, and more resolute \n     than ever. ``If I wanted to do this [set the record],'' \n     Kelliher said, ``I knew I'd have to start moving.''\n\n[[Page S7124]]\n\n       Now it's on to 50, and another possible age record. Next \n     February, after completing high school a semester early, \n     Kelliher will tackle Hawaii's 13,796-foot Mauna Kea, a \n     relatively easy climb. Last is Alaska's 20,320-foot Mount \n     McKinley (also known as Denali), the most challenging of all. \n     For every 1,000 climbers who go up, three fail to make it \n     down alive.\n       Kelliher has signed with a guide team for next May and will \n     pay for the trip's $17,000 cost herself. Already filling out \n     college applications, she's looking for corporate sponsorship \n     or grant money to help.\n       ``It's definitely scary,'' her mother said. ``If Kristen \n     can figure out how to fund it, in her 17-year-old way, I \n     won't stop her, though. And if she can't, well, then I don't \n     have to worry about her being killed in an avalanche.''\n       Kelliher says she will not be discouraged if her group \n     fails to conquer Denali.\n       Yet if she succeeds, it just might inspire another fourth-\n     grader to work harder--and climb higher--to achieve goals she \n     once thought were unreachable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/03/senate-section/article/S7124-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO STEVEN C. BORELL\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, today I bid farewell to Steven \nC. Borell, the executive director of the Alaska Miners Association, who \nhas decided to retire after 22 years at the helm of Alaska's foremost \nmining advocacy agency.\n  While I am sure the State's mining industry will be in great hands \nwhen Mr. Fred Parady takes over as the new executive director in \nJanuary, still it is very hard for me to imagine a minerals industry in \nthe State of Alaska without Steve championing not only its regulatory \nsurvival but its future growth.\n  For far longer than I have been in public service, Steve has been the \nsteady, knowledgeable voice on all issues surrounding mineral \ndevelopment in Alaska. His depth of knowledge of land laws and \nregulatory/permitting issues is legendary. He has had the trust of \nregulators and politicians and has done a sensational job of \nrepresenting the interests of the minerals industry, fighting for \nreasonable terms and commonsense regulation of the industry--an \nincreasingly difficult task given recent regulatory proposals out of \nWashington.\n  Alaskans are extremely lucky that Steve, an industrial engineer by \ntraining, came to Alaska in spring 1988 to run Valdez Creek mineral \noperations at Cantwell and then stayed on to cheerlead the rebirth of \nthe State's minerals industry. Steve, who graduated from Kansas State \nUniversity in 1968, had previously worked first as a foreman at a mine \nin Velva, ND, advancing to be the mine's superintendent in 1976. He \nlater worked at mines in Colorado and in Colombia in South America \nbefore working at the Consolidated Coal Company and for the Arch \nMineral Corporation in Illinois before coming to Alaska. While in \nAlaska, he also served as a consulting engineer on several mineral \nprojects.\n  In 1989, the State, after the death of efforts to open the U.S. Borax \nmolybdenum claims at Misty Fjords outside of Ketchikan, had only two \nmajor operating hard-rock mines, the Red Dog and Greens Creek Mines, \nand the Usibelli coal mine that together produced $277 million in \nminerals. Since Steve assumed the helm of the industry's main advocacy \narm, Fort Knox, Pogo, and the Kensington mines have all come on line, \nexploration spending has quadrupled, and the value of the minerals \nindustry has risen more than tenfold, topping $3 billion, and many more \nprojects are on the way. While higher ore prices certainly have helped, \nSteve's hardwork, perseverance, and dedication to helping the industry \novercome regulatory barriers is a key reason for the increase.\n  I know how hard he has worked to keep track of and to help bring some \ncommon sense to the mind-boggling permitting and regulatory processes \nthat have dogged the minerals industry in recent years. His \ndetermination and attention to detail have helped numerous Alaska \nprojects advance. He has always been a strong advocate for Alaska's \nhundreds of small-scale placer and recreational miners and for large-\nscale mineral developers. He has helped both equally, giving freely of \nhis time and talent to promote Alaskan development for the good of the \nState and all its citizens.\n  I could sing his praises on this floor for hours. My staff and I will \nmiss him greatly, and I am sure all of the industry will too. But \npromoting mineral development, fighting the forces that want to \noverregulate and lock up Alaska lands, has become not just a full-time \njob, but now requires an all-consuming passion given the \nadministration's wild land edicts, more than 2,000 Federal regulatory \nproposals, and an endless stream of environmental suits and attacks. No \none has earned a rest more than Steven C. Borell.\n  I can only wish him well in the future and again thank him for all \nthat he has done for Alaska and our citizens. The State is a far better \nplace for all of his many efforts. We all owe him our true thanks and \ngratitude for a job very well done, and we will all miss his sage \nadvice and wisdom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/03/senate-section/article/S7124-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING THE COLORADO NONPROFIT ASSOCIATION\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, today I honor the \nColorado Nonprofit Association as it celebrates 25 years of supporting \nColorado's nonprofit organizations and strengthening our communities.\n  Colorado has a strong and diverse nonprofit sector with almost 19,000 \npublic charities. These nonprofits perform many services that \nstrengthen Colorado's communities and enrich the lives of our \nresidents. It is also important to note that even in our current \ntroubled economy, these organizations are an engine of growth, \ngenerating almost $17 billion in revenue in 2009 and sustaining \nthousands of jobs throughout the State.\n  Colorado Nonprofit Association is a statewide organization with \nalmost 1,400 nonprofit members whose mission is to lead, assist, and \nstrengthen nonprofits. Founded in 1986 as the Colorado Association of \nNonprofit Organizations, its original charge was to create and support \nprograms designed to increase the effectiveness of nonprofits around \nthe State. The Association has since expanded its scope as the \nnonprofit sector has grown.\n  The association has developed key resources for nonprofit \norganizations and the public. ``The Principles and Practices for \nNonprofit Excellence in Colorado,'' first published in 2007, contains \nState and Federal legal requirements, management best practices, and \ntransparency and accountability standards. Supported by Colorado's \nsecretary of state and attorney general, the association has \ndistributed more than 30,000 copies of this resource and conducted \nnumerous training sessions around the State. The association's Colorado \nGenerosity Project seeks to increase charitable giving in Colorado by \nincreasing awareness of the nonprofit sector. It has also published \nseveral research reports about nonprofit economic activity and the \nbeliefs and behaviors of Colorado's donors. Each of these initiatives \nhas contributed to a greater culture of giving in the State while \nstrengthening local economies and improving the well-being of every \nColoradan.\n  The association further encourages civic engagement by nonprofit \norganizations. With wide community networks, nonprofits are well \nsituated to solve community and social problems and to engage \npolicymakers in this effort. The Colorado Nonprofit Association \nprovides resources and information to nonprofits to support their \nadvocacy and develop productive working relationships with elected \nofficials. I appreciate the association's continued partnerships, which \nmake our State a better place to live.\n  In the Nation's current economic climate, the demand for services and \nprograms offered by nonprofit organizations is greater than ever. The \nColorado Nonprofit Association provides the right leadership to assist \nour nonprofits in these challenging times. I recognize this \norganization for its contributions over the years and look forward to \nits continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/03/senate-section/article/S7124-3", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7124-S7125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:31 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1070.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \ncertain provisions of the Creating Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Small Business Tax \nExtenders Act of 2011, targeted tax relief legislation to extend, for \none year, the essential tax relief provisions that were included in the \nSmall Business Jobs Act of 2010.\n  When the Small Business Jobs Act was crafted, I worked closely with \nFinance Committee Chair Baucus and then Ranking Member Grassley to \nensure the critical small business tax provisions that reflected our \nshared priorities were included in that legislation. I sincerely \nappreciate all of their hard work on that legislation.\n  As the former Chair and now Ranking Member of the Small Business \nCommittee, I am well aware of the urgent imperative of job creation in \nour country. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average \nannual unemployment rate for 2010 was 9.6 percent. For 27 out of the \npast 32 months the unemployment rate has been at 9 percent or above. \nAbout 45 percent of the unemployed have been out of work for at least 6 \nmonths--a level previously unseen in the 6 decades since World War II.\n  At a time when 14 million Americans are still unemployed, and have \nbeen so for the longest period since record keeping began in 1948, our \ngovernment should be taking every possible step to ease the burden on \njob creators. We\n\n[[Page S7129]]\n\nmust help create an environment that is conducive to small businesses' \njob creation. One critical way to do so is through targeted small \nbusiness tax incentives.\n  That is why as a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, I \nhave been urging this administration to champion tax reform and in \nfact, I led a panel on the issue as part of the Economic Summit at the \nWhite House more than 2 years ago.\n  The individual income tax form has more than tripled in length from \n52 pages for 1980 to 174 pages for 2009. American taxpayers spend 7.6 \nbillion hours and shell out $140 billion, or 1 percent of GDP, just \nstruggling to comply with tax filing requirements. This is not \nsurprising as there has been 15,000 changes to the tax code since the \nlast overhaul in 1986.\n  Alarmingly, the tax code is also needlessly handcuffing our ability \nto compete in today's integrated global economy, as we strain under the \nsecond highest corporate tax burden in the industrialized world. While \nthis administration and the Senate majority are pondering whether we \nshould reform our tax code, small businesses continued to struggle with \nthe current tax regime at the expense of creating more jobs and growing \noperations.\n  While I continue to advocate for comprehensive tax reform, there are \ncertain measures that, although not a silver bullet, should be passed \nright away to help improve the economic environment for small \nbusinesses. The Small Business Tax Extenders Act of 2011 is a critical \nexample. This legislation contains provisions I have championed for \nyears to provide small businesses greater cash flow, incentivizing \ntheir investments, and increasing tax fairness.\n  The lifeblood of a small business is its cash flow and this bill \ncontains several provisions to improve it. One of these provisions will \naddress a fundamental injustice of the tax code by extending for \nanother year deduction for health insurance premiums against not only \nincome taxes but also against payroll taxes. At a rate of 15.3 percent, \nthe self-employment, or SECA, tax is imposed on the health benefits of \nbusiness owners. This is a costly injustice that makes health insurance \njust that much more expensive at a time when insurance costs are \nalready prohibitively expensive.\n  In the coming year we will certainly see health premiums rise, making \nit all the more onerous on small businesses to provide critical \nbenefits to their employees. Allowing the full deduction for health \ninsurance is critical for its affordability. I was thrilled that we \nwere able to address this injustice in the Small Business Jobs Act of \n2010, and I sincerely hope that this provision can be extended for \nanother year.\n  This legislation will also extend for 1 year a provision permitting \ngeneral business credits to be carried back 5 years and taken against \nthe Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT. Before the enactment of the Small \nBusiness Jobs Act, a business's unused general business credit could be \ncarried back to offset taxes paid in the previous year, and the \nremaining amount could be carried forward for 20 years to offset future \ntax liabilities.\n  The 5-year carryback of credits will allow business owners to reach \nback to prior years when they had taxable income to offset prior tax \nliability with these credits and get immediate cash infusion. Business \nowners can use this cash as they choose, but as we have seen with net \noperating loss relief, they use these funds for anything from meeting \npayroll to investing in new equipment. The same principle applies with \nrespect to the provision that allows credits to be used against the \nAMT.\n  When Congress implements policies through the tax code, it is with \nintent that businesses will utilize such incentives to do what they do \nbest--grow their operations which in turns leads to hiring additional \nemployees. Unfortunately during a downward business cycle that we have \nbeen experiencing for more than two years, businesses do not have \nincome tax liability that can be offset with a credit. It is rather \nsimple: if you do not have enough revenue to claim a credit, that \ncredit is of little use to you.\n  An incredible benefit of the carryback and the use of general \nbusiness credits against the AMT is to make the small business health \ninsurance tax credits enacted earlier this year more effective and make \nhealth insurance more affordable for business owners to offer to their \nemployees.\n  This bill would also extend for 1 year the availability of the so-\ncalled section 179 expensing to give businesses the option of writing \noff the cost of qualifying capital expenses in the year of acquisition \ninstead of recovering these costs over time through depreciation, and \nallow businesses to take advantage of higher limits for the so-called \nsection 179 expensing. Under this provision, up to $250,000 can be \nexpensed for real property and up to $250,000 for equipment, or up to \nthe full $500,000 for just equipment.\n  Expanding Section 179 expensing has been a significant Small Business \nCommittee bipartisan priority of mine, and former Small Business \nCommittee Chair Kerry and current Chair Landrieu, as reflected in no \nfewer than three separate bills in the previous Congress: the Small \nBusiness Stimulus Act of 2009, S. 156, Snowe-Kerry-Landrieu; the Small \nbusiness Expensing Permanency Act of 2009, S. 2822, Snowe-Landrieu; and \nthe Small Business Job Creation Act of 2010, S. 3103, Snowe.\n  I want my colleagues to understand that this provision is expected to \nconfer a major economic boost because it certainly speeds up the \nrecovery time on these investments. Extending this provision will help \nthe businesses modernize while aiding construction firms and their \nemployees.\n  Additionally, the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 provided for a \ntemporary reduction in the recognition period for S corporation built-\nin gains tax. When businesses move from being a corporation with two \nlevels of tax to an S corporation, they have generally been required to \nhold their ``retained earnings'' for up to 10 years. This prevents \nowners from taking the retained earnings as distributions where only \nincome taxes are owed rather than both corporate income tax at one \nlevel and then personal income tax at the second. Recent law changes \nhave shortened this holding period to 7 years, but that is still too \nlong.\n  By infusing capital, of their own retained earnings, this provision \nin the Small Business Jobs Act enabled companies to reduce the holding \nperiod from 7 years to 5 years so that companies that made the \nconversion before 2006 can redeploy this capital for use in their \nbusiness. Extending this provision also underscores how vital retained \nearnings are for small businesses.\n  A final provision would extend for one year a complete exclusion on \ncapital gains attributable to small business stock held for 5 years. \nExtending this measure will help further critical investment in our \nNation's small businesses. This is a longstanding priority of mine and \nof Senator John Kerry, former Chair of the Small Business Committee and \nmy fellow colleague on the Finance Committee. The Kerry-Snowe Invest in \nSmall Business Act of 2009 included this exclusion, which we fought to \nincorporate into the Small Business Jobs Act.\n  It is essential that we pass these small business tax extensions. I \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation so we can ensure that \nour Nation's small businesses and their employees are provided with \nmuch needed tax relief.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1801\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to carry \nout programs and activities that connect Americans, especially \nchildren, youth, and families, with the outdoors; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I speak in support of a \nbill I am introducing called the Healthy Kids Outdoor Act of 2011. This \nbill will help the development of locally-based plans that will \nencourage kids to enjoy one of our nation's most cherished past-times: \nrecreating outdoors.\n  I am introducing the Healthy Kids Outdoors Act of 2011 with the \nsupport of Senators Gillibrand, Merkley and Bennet. My friend and \ncolleague Representative Kind of Wisconsin is introducing companion \nlegislation today in the U.S. House of Representatives. I want to thank \nRep. Kind for his leadership on these issues over the years. I \nespecially want to thank him for the opportunity to steal his good idea \nand appropriate it for myself in the Senate.\n  Specifically, the Healthy Kids Outdoors Act authorizes the U.S. \nSecretary of the Interior to provide grants, one per State, to eligible \norganizations for the development of State-level outdoor recreation \nplans. Working in cooperation with local partners, the eligible \nentities will develop plans designed to ensure that States have \nappropriate programs and infrastructure in place to help Americans \neffectively connect with the outdoors. These plans supplement current \noutdoor recreation planning by emphasizing how to use outdoor \nrecreation resources and infrastructure, such as public parks, \ntransportation and health systems, to facilitate outdoor activities. \nThe plans supported by Federal funding under this act must be updated \nevery five years based on evaluations of each state strategy and \nlessons learned from their implementation. Additionally, in order to \nensure that state and local partners are contributing to this effort, \nfunding recipients must provide a 25-percent non-federal cost share.\n  Finally, this bill requires the administration to develop a national \nstrategy to get Americans active outdoors and evaluate the health \nimpacts of the State strategies authorized under the legislation. The \nnational strategy, to be developed with significant public \nparticipation, should align with the State strategies and identify \nbarriers to and opportunities for outdoor activities.\n  Why is this important you might ask, especially at a time when we are \nlooking at ways to cut spending and other programs?\n  We live in an increasingly sedentary world that makes it more \ndifficult for our Nation to reach the heights that it can achieve. \nToday's society provides more distractions from active lifestyles and \nthe natural world around us than ever before. This is particularly true \namong children, who spend on average just 4-7 minutes a day in \nunstructured outdoor play while spending an average of 7.5 hours a day \nin front of electronic media. Partially as a result of this, obesity \nhas become a major public health problem. Today, one in three children \nis either overweight or obese, whereas only about 4 percent of children \nin 1960 were. Working together, we must find proactive ways to reverse \nthis harmful trend.\n  Being overweight or obese can lead to many chronic health conditions, \nincluding heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. All of these conditions \nare costly for health care purchasers and patients, reduce quality of \nlife, and are among the top 6 leading causes of death each year. The \ngood news is that, in the vast majority of cases, obesity is completely \npreventable. Particularly for children, if we teach them good eating \nand fitness habits early in life, they will have a much better shot at \nmaintaining a healthy weight later in life. In addition, research \ndemonstrates the myriad mental health benefits of active lifestyles \nthat make use of green spaces outside the home.\n  Furthermore, spending time in the outdoors, connecting with our \npublic lands and waters and green spaces, furthers America's \nconservation legacy. For example, research demonstrates that hunters \nwho become engaged in the sport as children are among the most active \nand interested sportsmen as adults.\n  Spending time in the outdoors also supports the outdoor recreation \nindustry. We have a large and growing industry in this country of \nsupply stores, manufacturers, guides, hotels, and other important \nbusinesses that are the backbone of many rural communities. In fact, \noutdoor recreation activities add over $730 billion to the national \neconomy every year. In this time of economic uncertainty, outdoor \nrecreation is one of the bright spots in our economy.\n  Additionally, at a time when disparities in health status and health \ninsurance rates for minority populations are at an all-time high, \nparticularly in my State of Colorado, the common sense goals of the \nHealthy Kids Outdoors Act can help level the playing field for good \nhealth across America. This legislation will make it easier for all \nAmericans, regardless of cultural differences, geography or socio-\neconomic status, especially children and families, to connect with \nhealthy, active, outdoor lifestyles and the natural world. By doing so, \nwe can combat the obesity epidemic, improve public health overall and \nbolster America's proud legacy of conservation and outdoor recreation \neconomy.\n  Finally, I want to note that this bill could play a small role in \nmaking sure our children, as they reach adulthood, are qualified to \nserve in our U.S. military, if they so choose. As a member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, I have seen firsthand the studies that \nhave shown that greater and greater numbers of young adults are \nineligible to serve in the Armed Forces due to disqualifying health \nfactors such as being overweight. Nearly one in four applicants is \nrejected for being overweight, which is the most common reason for \nmedical disqualification. It's not a stretch to say that a more fit \npopulation can result in a more secure nation.\n  This legislation is a small but important step we can take to promote \nhealthy, active lifestyles supporting the use and enjoyment of our \nnatural world. I want to thank the Outdoor Alliance for Kids, whose \nmembers include many of the country's leading conservation groups and \noutdoor recreation companies, for its support and help developing this \nbill. I also want to thank the Campaign to End Obesity for their \nendorsement of it. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nadvance this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1802\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Healthy Kids Outdoors Act of \n     2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Children today are spending less time outdoors than any \n     generation in human history, as evidenced by studies that \n     show children enjoy half as much time outdoors today as they \n     did just 20 years ago, while spending more than 7\\1/2\\ hours \n     every day in front of electronic media.\n       (2) The health of our children is at risk as evidenced by \n     the growing obesity crisis where, during the 20-year period \n     between 1991 and 2011, the childhood obesity rate has more \n     than doubled and the adolescent obesity rate has tripled, \n     costing the economy of the United States billions of dollars \n     each year.\n       (3) Our military readiness is declining as nearly 1 in 4 \n     applicants to the military is rejected for being overweight \n     or obese, which is the most common reason for medical \n     disqualification.\n\n[[Page S7132]]\n\n       (4) Research has shown that military children and families \n     are facing increased stress and mental strain and challenges \n     due to multiple, extended deployments. Military family \n     service organizations have developed programs that connect \n     military children and families with positive, meaningful \n     outdoor experiences that benefit mental and physical health, \n     but they lack sufficient resources to meet increasing demand.\n       (5) In addition to the negative economic impact of \n     childhood obesity, the outdoor retail industry, many local \n     tourist destinations or ``gateway communities'', and State \n     fish and wildlife agencies rely on revenue generated when \n     individuals spend time outdoors to create jobs in local \n     communities.\n       (6) Over the past several years, urbanization, changing \n     land use patterns, increasing road traffic, and inadequate \n     solutions to addressing these challenges in the built \n     environment have combined to make it more difficult for many \n     Americans to walk or bike to schools, parks, and play areas \n     or experience the natural environment in general.\n       (7) Visitation to our Nation's public lands has declined or \n     remained flat in recent years, and yet, connecting with \n     nature and the great outdoors in our communities is critical \n     to fostering the next generation of outdoor enthusiasts who \n     will visit, appreciate, and become stewards of our Nation's \n     public lands.\n       (8) It takes many dedicated men and women to work to \n     preserve, protect, enhance, and restore America's natural \n     resources, and with an aging workforce in the natural \n     resource professions, it is critical for the next generation \n     to have an appreciation for nature and be ready to take over \n     these responsibilities.\n       (9) Spending time outdoors in nature is beneficial to our \n     children's physical, mental, and emotional health and has \n     been proven to decrease symptoms of attention deficit and \n     hyperactivity disorder, stimulate brain development, improve \n     motor skills, result in better sleep, reduce stress, increase \n     creativity, improve mood, and reduce children's risk of \n     developing myopia.\n       (10) Children who spend time playing outside are more \n     likely to take risks, seek out adventure, develop self-\n     confidence, and respect the value of nature.\n       (11) Spending time in green spaces outside the home, \n     including parks, play areas, and garden, can increase \n     concentration, inhibition of initial impulses, and self-\n     discipline and has been shown to reduce stress and mental \n     fatigue. In one study, children who were exposed to greener \n     environments in a public housing area demonstrated less \n     aggression, violence, and stress.\n       (12) As children become more disconnected from the natural \n     world, the hunting and angling conservation legacy of America \n     is at risk.\n       (13) Conservation education and outdoor recreation \n     experiences such as camping, hiking, boating, hunting, \n     fishing, archery, recreational shooting, wildlife watching, \n     and others are critical to engaging young people in the \n     outdoors.\n       (14) Hunters and anglers play a critical role in \n     reconnecting young people with nature, protecting our natural \n     resources, and fostering a lifelong understanding of the \n     value of conserving the natural world.\n       (15) Research demonstrates that hunters who become engaged \n     in hunting as children are among the most active and \n     interested hunters as adults. The vast majority of hunters \n     report they were introduced to hunting between the ages of 10 \n     and 12, and the overwhelming majority of children are \n     introduced to hunting by an adult.\n       (16) A direct childhood experience with nature before the \n     age of 11 promotes a long-term connection to nature.\n       (17) Parks and recreation, youth-serving, service-learning, \n     conservation, health, education, and built-environment \n     organizations, facilities, and personnel provide critical \n     resources and infrastructure for connecting children and \n     families with nature.\n       (18) Place-based service-learning opportunities use our \n     lands and waters as the context for learning by engaging \n     students in the process of exploration, action, and \n     reflection. Physical activity outdoors connected with \n     meaningful community service to solve real-world problems, \n     such as removing invasive plants or removing trash from a \n     streambed, strengthens communities by engaging youth as \n     citizen stewards.\n       (19) States nationwide and their community based partners \n     have some notable programs that connect children and families \n     with nature; however, most States lack sufficient resources \n     and a comprehensive strategy to effectively engage State \n     agencies across multiple fields.\n       (20) States need to engage in cross-sector agency and \n     nonprofit collaboration that involves public health and \n     wellness, parks and recreation, transportation and city \n     planning, and other sectors focused on connecting children \n     and families with the outdoors to increase coordination and \n     effective implementation of the policy tools and programs \n     that a State can bring to bear to provide healthy outdoor \n     opportunities for children and families.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title IV of the Supplemental Appropriations \nAct, 2008 to provide for the continuation of certain unemployment \nbenefits, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Emergency \nUnemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2011 to ensure that millions \nof unemployed Americans will not lose desperately needed unemployment \nbenefits and to provide relief to states and employers that are facing \nautomatic penalties for overdrawing on their unemployment insurance \ntrust fund during the worst unemployment crisis in modern history. I am \npleased to be joined by my colleagues Senators Durbin, Whitehouse and \nLevin.\n  Fourteen million Americans are looking for work and the average \nlength of unemployment is 40 weeks. Rhode Island has endured especially \nhigh and persistent rates of unemployment. If Congress fails to extend \nunemployment benefits or if benefits lapse for as little as a month--\n10,000 Rhode Islanders and 2 million Americans nationwide will fall \nthrough the safety-net and lose benefits. This would have far reaching \nimpacts on families, communities, and businesses. It would seriously \nendanger our economic recovery as a whole.\n  The legislation would continue funding for the Federal unemployment \nprograms for jobless workers through 2012 by extending the Emergency \nUnemployment Compensation Program and making improvements to the \nExtended Benefits Program.\n  The bill will also provide relief for States and employers that have \nbeen hit the hardest by our unemployment crisis and whose unemployment \ntrust funds have been subjected to historic levels of stress by \nproviding a 1 year moratorium on interest payments for States and tax \nrelief for employers in States with outstanding unemployment trust fund \nloans.\n  Requiring States to make such interest repayments now, at a time when \nthey face massive budget deficits and the economy is still weak does \nnot make economic sense. Nor does requiring businesses to pay an \nadditional tax of $21 per employee for the 2011 tax year.\n  This bill would provide immediate relief and certainty to 23 States \nwith outstanding loans and all of their employers facing automatic tax \nincreases that are otherwise set to be assessed as soon as January 31, \n2012.\n  For States that have remained solvent during this crisis, they would \nreceive a 2 percent interest bonus on trust fund reserves. This \nreflects the need to start moving in the direction of replenishing and \nmaintaining solvent unemployment trust funds, which is why I joined \nSenator Durbin in introducing the Unemployment Insurance Solvency Act \nearlier this year.\n  Unfortunately, today's legislation is necessary because Republicans \nhave blocked passage of the President's American Jobs Act. The American \nJobs Act proposed extending the EUC and EB programs along with \nincorporating several important reforms to the Ul system. These reforms \nwould provide enhanced assistance to the long-term unemployed in their \njob search and ensure benefits are being administered properly. Indeed, \nas we look to extend unemployment benefits to those who have been \nharmed by this economy through no fault of their own and aid States and \nemployers, we must be mindful to enhance the integrity of the \nunemployment system and prevent improper payments, which hurt taxpayers \nand ultimately erode benefits for those\n\n[[Page S7134]]\n\nthat are most in need. It is my hope that Congress and States, which \nare responsible for administering these programs, continue to improve \nthe integrity and functioning of our Ul system.\n  We know what policies will strengthen our recovery. Extending \nbenefits and addressing solvency are among them and I urge my \ncolleagues to join us in cosponsoring and pressing for action on this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1804\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency from rejecting or otherwise determining to be \ninadequate a State implementation plan in any case in which the State \nsubmitting the plan has not been given a reasonable time to develop and \nsubmit the plan in accordance with a certain provision of the Clean Air \nAct; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, few things provide me with greater \ncharity than conversations I have with people back home in Nebraska. I \nrise to discuss a few of those conversations I had just last week \nduring our work period back home. I used this opportunity to meet with \nelectricity providers serving Nebraskans across the great State of \nNebraska, from the more populated areas such as Omaha, to smaller \ncommunities such as Hastings, NE.\n  It will come as no surprise, I believe to anyone, that the focus of \ntheir frustration, their anger is with the EPA. They feel they have \nbeen treated unfairly. They feel the Agency has not been straight \nforward or transparent. They feel they now have a target on their \nbacks, and they know that compliance with the latest EPA regulatory \nbombshell is going to have a crushing impact on the communities they \nserve.\n  Their latest concern is a rule known as the cross-state air pollution \nrule or cross-state. The rule addresses airborne emissions that EPA \nclaims cross State lines and may affect air quality in another State. \nEPA issued the final rule in July of this year. Let me repeat that. EPA \nissued the final rule in July of this year and then demanded compliance \nby January 2012.\n  That is 6 months. That is an impossibility and EPA knows it. Here is \nwhy it is an impossibility. This is especially relevant to my State. \nNebraska was not included in the old version of the same rule, the so-\ncalled clean air interstate rule. We were not a part of it. The final \nrule changed dramatically from the proposed version.\n  For example, the required reductions increased dramatically from the \nproposed rule that was published in July of 2010. So Nebraska first \nfound itself subject to this type of EPA rule in the proposed rule in \nJuly of 2010. Then the final rule arrives a year later and, boom, it is \na dramatically different rule--more severe reductions in compliance in \nan almost laughable 6 months.\n  Basically, Nebraska gets a final rule thrust upon them and no \nopportunity to comply. That could not be more unjust. Draconian changes \nmade in a final rule that depart so significantly from the proposed \nrule defeat the very purpose of our laws that prescribe how agencies \nare supposed to make rules. I ran one of those agencies as Secretary of \nAgriculture.\n  This process makes a mockery out of the rulemaking process. It makes \npublic comments absolutely meaningless. What good does review of a \nproposed rule do when the final rule is so radically different from the \noriginal proposal? It also means the community regulated cannot plan \nand cannot fix the problem.\n  This is our government we are talking about. Utilities cannot go to \ntheir ratepayers and say: Look, we have to make changes. It is going to \ntake some time and money, but here is our plan and here is how much it \nwill cost as a ratepayer. EPA has totally shoved aside the traditional \nrole that some State regulators play as an EPA partner in establishing \nclean air plans known as State implementation plans. In fact, in this \ncase, the EPA established a Federal implementation plan, a one-size-\nfits-all national plan that completely rejects State efforts to manage \ncompliance.\n  Our power providers and regulators are echoing this same message. \nThere just is not enough time for them. Instead of 3 or 5 or 10 years \nthat is needed, by administrative fiat, EPA has said: They get 6 months \nto rebuild a powerplant. Let me be crystal clear about what Nebraska's \npower providers did and did not do.\n  They did not say: We cannot change and we will not change. They did \nnot say: Just leave me alone. What they did say to me, very clearly, \nis: We cannot waive a magic wand. We cannot do the impossible. We \ncannot put together the finance plan in 6 months. We cannot put a \nrequest for bid out and get the work done in 6 months. We cannot get a \ndesign plan written by a competent engineering firm. We cannot arrange \nfor a plant shutdown. We cannot get the construction crews to our \nfacility, especially as cold weather sets into our State between now \nand January 1 to rebuild the powerplants. It simply is not humanly \npossible.\n  What options are possible? Someone listening to me might ask: What \noptions do they have? Unfortunately, the\n\n[[Page S7136]]\n\nfirst thing our providers are doing is just trying to understand the \nrule. That in itself is no small task, because as I explained, the rule \nis essentially brand new. The ink is barely dry. The EPA did a head \nfake. They said: Here is the rule and then completely changed it in the \nfinal rule.\n  Secondly, electricity providers are making plans--get this. They are \nmaking plans all across this country to decrease electric generation \nbecause of this rule. In Hastings, NE, ratepayers have been told to \nexpect an increase in operating costs of at least $3.8 million per \nyear. Including costs of retrofits for this rule and two others that \nare in the works by EPA, Hastings figures $40 to $50 million will be \nspent over the next 5 years.\n  Think about that for a second. Imagine $40 to $50 million for a \ncommunity of 25,000 people. That is for Hastings and only if the \nutility can figure out how it can get it done. Guess who bears the \nbrunt of these costs. Every Hastings resident with an electricity \nmeter--not shareholders. This is not a big electric company. No \nshareholder equity will be drawn down, no preferred stock to be newly \nissued. We are, in our State, a 100-percent public power State. Just \nthose folks in Hastings, NE, because they got swept into an EPA rule \nlast July with a January deadline. Fremont, NE, another great Nebraska \ncommunity caught in the crosshairs, has indicated the cross-state rule \nand two other EPA rules will cost customers about $35 million over the \nnext 3 years.\n  In New York City or Washington, DC, $35 million may seem \ninsignificant. But to the 25,000 residents of Fremont, NE, it is a huge \ndeal. Similarly, the cross-state rule will cost the Nebraska public \npower district, our largest electricity provider, about $6 million next \nyear in reduced revenue, as well as mandating about $40 million in \ncosts before the end of 2012. Electricity providers across the State \nare all looking at purchasing power from other generators. The only way \nthey can get compliance now is to reduce generation.\n  Of course, many neighboring utilities in the State are subject to the \nsame final rule. Guess what. This is the problem across the country. So \neverybody is in the hunt, and the short compliance timeframe is likely \nto drive the price of energy even higher. Another option includes \npurchasing pollution credits on the open market. No one knows how much \nit will cost because the same comprised timeline affects the markets \nfor credits.\n  People may have also noticed I have not mentioned the bid, the \ndesign, the implementation, the installation of pollution control \nequipment as a compliance strategy, because in our State, that \npossibility is not an option for us because of the EPA's timeline. Six \nmonths is not enough time, especially when the labor, the technical \nknowledge, the contractors, the financing are all being chased by our \nutilities subject to the same rule.\n  Is it any wonder people are frustrated? Is it any wonder at all? That \nis why today I am introducing legislation that addresses the way the \nEPA handled this rule. My bill takes a couple reasonable steps to \naddress this unfair treatment, not only in my State but in 27 other \nStates. First, under my bill, EPA is prohibited from dictating Federal \nimplementation plans unless the Agency has given the State a sufficient \namount of time to develop a plan.\n  The State must be given 2 years to put a plan in place. In addition, \nif my bill is enacted, EPA cannot choose to reject a State's plan if, \nas a result, compliance would immediately follow. In other words, my \nbill prohibits EPA from jamming States by rejecting their plans and \nrequiring an unreasonable compliance timeframe. Finally, my bill says \nEPA's compliance deadlines are set aside for 3 years while States get a \nchance to put this together. The message of my bill is straightforward: \nDo not freeze out States. Do not jam us with a compliance schedule that \neverybody knows will not work.\n  Nebraskans, similar to everybody else, are tired of being treated as \nsecond-class citizens by an agency that has run amuck. I suspect the \nsame is true of 27 other States. Nebraskans simply cannot believe EPA \nis hitting the accelerator on a rule that will drive up electricity \nbills in more than half the country with no way for States to comply.\n  I share their frustration. The EPA is in a constant thirst for power. \nI urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation, to introduce one \nsmall dose of common sense to this out-of-control agency.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 1807.

A bill To amend the Public Health Service Act to revise and \nextend the program for viral hepatitis surveillance, education, and \ntesting in order to prevent deaths from liver cancer, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, there is a silent epidemic in our country \nthat today threatens the lives of more than 5 million Americans. Of \nthose people afflicted with this disease, 150,000 will not survive this \ndecade. In 2008 alone, an estimated 56,000 Americans were newly \ninfected while as many as 75 percent of all infected people did not \neven know that they carried this disease. Without further preventative \naction, this growing health threat will only cost more lives and \nhundreds of billions in additional health care expenses. This ticking \ntime bomb is viral hepatitis.\n  That is bad news. But there is also cause for hope.\n  Treatment already exists that can eradicate hepatitis C in close to \n75 percent of people with the disease. Another treatment reduces the \nlevel of hepatitis B in over 80 percent of those treated. There has \nbeen a vaccine against hepatitis B for decades that has left millions \nimmune to that strain of virus. We understand how viral hepatitis is \nspread, how it can be prevented, and how to test people for infection. \nThere have just been a string of significant medical advances that will \nimprove the effectiveness of viral hepatitis screening and treatment.\n  It is clear that we already have the tools at our disposal to \nprevent, treat, and control the vast majority of these infections, now \nwhat we need is a coordinated strategy to put these tools to work.\n  That is why I am introducing the Viral Hepatitis Testing Act of 2011, \nwhich appropriates $110 million over five years to improve education, \ntesting, and care for viral hepatitis across Massachusetts and in local \ncommunities around the country. This legislation is a down-payment on a \nnational effort to fight and ultimately eradicate hepatitis B and C in \nAmerica. I hope\n\n[[Page S7138]]\n\nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in cosponsoring \nthis effort.\n  Viral hepatitis is known as a silent killer because it can stay a-\nsymptomatic for years before it leads to serious liver disease. It is \nthe most common cause of liver cancer and yet doctors and patients \nalike are often largely uninformed about this disease. Hepatitis B is \n100 times more infectious than HIV and has spread to an estimated 2 \nbillion people worldwide while hepatitis C has reached about 170 \nmillion people. Chronic viral hepatitis is widespread and it is \ndangerous.\n  Last year, the Institute of Medicine released a report outlining a \nnumber of specific recommendations on how to combat viral hepatitis. To \nbuild on those recommendations, Assistant Secretary of Health Dr. \nHoward Koh convened a task force and developed a detailed, \ncomprehensive action plan to combat the pervasive spread of this \ndisease. These recommendations served as the foundation for the \nlegislation I am proposing today.\n  As of today, there is no coordinated national strategy in place to \nfight viral hepatitis. The action plan put forward by Dr. Koh and his \nteam seeks to rectify that problem by incorporating standardized viral \nhepatitis prevention and treatment programs into the health care \ninfrastructure that already exists. The bill I introduced today would \nquickly implement a number of these programs and provides the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services with the resources to act.\n  The first step in prevention is determining who is infected with the \nvirus so they can receive the appropriate care and will be less likely \nto pass on this disease to others. In order to determine the prevalence \nof the problem and to increase the number of people who are aware of \ntheir infection, The Viral Hepatitis Testing Act calls for HHS to work \nwith the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality, and the Preventive Services Task Force \nto develop and implement effective surveillance and testing protocols. \nWhereas 75 percent of people carrying viral hepatitis today do not even \nknow they are infected, improved testing could flip that disturbing \nstatistic on its head in just 5 years.\n  It is also a sad reality that a number of minority populations are at \ngreatly increased risk for contracting viral hepatitis. Asian-Americans \nand Pacific Islanders account for over half of chronic hepatitis B \ncases. African Americans, Latinos, and American Indians and Native \nAlaskans also have disproportionately high rates of these viruses. \nAdditionally, without the proper preventative care, there is a high \nlikelihood that pregnant women who carry the virus will pass it on to \ntheir unborn children.\n  For those reasons, the legislation I introduced today also focuses on \nscreening and treating high-risk populations and pregnant mothers for \nviral hepatitis. Educational programs targeting high-risk groups will \nempower people to protect themselves from contracting hepatitis, and \nensuring that people who have viral hepatitis receive the appropriate \nfollow-up care will further help to prevent the spread of this \nepidemic.\n  Additionally, providing doctors with the proper training on the \ncauses, symptoms, and treatments would also go a long way toward \nstemming the tide of transmission and improving outcomes for patients \nwho have contracted the disease. This legislation makes supplemental \nviral hepatitis training for health care professionals a priority.\n  To do the things we need to do in order to save lives and control \nthis deadly epidemic, we are going to have to make a relativelodest \ninvestment. The Viral Hepatitis Testing Act appropriates $110 million \nover 5 years that will go toward implementing the educational, \nscreening, and treatment measures required under this act. Rather than \ncreating a whole new hepatitis prevention apparatus, this funding will \nbe used to integrate these new and improved procedures into the \nexisting health care infrastructure through grants to public and \nnonprofit private entities, including States, Indian tribes, and \npublic:private partnerships.\n  The human benefits of this legislation are undeniable--these \nprovisions will reduce transmission, improve the quality of life for \npeople with viral hepatitis, and prevent the deaths of countless \nmothers and fathers and children. It is also undeniable that this is a \nwise investment of resources and good policy. These investments are a \nclassic case of using limited resources to maximum impact, as we invest \na modest amount of money today in order to save lives, pain, and tens \nof billions of dollars tomorrow.\n  Today, hepatitis B costs patients around $2.5 billion per year. With \nbaby boomers aging into Medicare and accounting for an estimated two \nout of every three cases of chronic hepatitis C, medical costs for \ntreating this disease are expected to skyrocket from $30 billion to \nmore than $85 billion in 2024. Late diagnosis is a significant driver \nof costs, as more expensive procedures and treatments are required the \nfurther the infection has progressed. To put this in even starker \nterms, the cost of the hepatitis B vaccine ranges from $75 to $165, \nwhile treatment can cost up to $16 thousand per year for a single \nperson, or up to $110 thousand per hospital visit, should the disease \ndevelop into liver cancer.\n  Viral hepatitis is an increasingly significant issue for \nMassachusetts. The Department of Public Health reports over 2,000 cases \nof newly diagnosed chronic Hepatitis B infection and 8,000 to 10,000 \ncases of newly diagnosed chronic Hepatitis C infection each year. Viral \nhepatitis is the highest volume of reportable infectious diseases in \nthe state. Additionally, there continues to be a striking increase in \ncases of hepatitis C infection among adolescents and young adults in \nthe State, which suggests that there is a new epidemic of the disease \ntaking hold.\n  Until recently, the Massachusetts State Legislature provided $1.4 \nmillion for surveillance to detect outbreaks and behaviors of concern \nas well as for targeted screening and treatment of high-risk \npopulations. Today, however, as this public health threat spreads, all \nof that funding has been eliminated due to budget cuts. Massachusetts \nreceives just $104,305 from the CDC for an Adult Viral Hepatitis \nPrevention Coordinator. This is a valuable position but it is not \nnearly enough to support core public health services. The Viral \nHepatitis Testing Act will allow Massachusetts to invest in a \nsustainable infrastructure that would improve health care for our \ncitizens.\n  The choice is ours: we can either invest in preventative programs and \nmore robust screening now or we can just let this epidemic continue to \nproliferate around the country and foot the bill later for the \nexpensive surgical procedures, medicines, and hospital bills that will \nonly continue to grow.\n  Without action, thousands more Americans will die year from preventa \nseases. We know what we need to do; now it is up to us to do it. Let us \nnot make excuses. Let us lower health care costs for American families, \nimprove the quality o our care, and save lives. I again urge my \ncolleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/03/senate-section/article/S7138-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7138-S7139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 310--DESIGNATING 2012 AS THE ``YEAR OF THE GIRL'' AND \n     CONGRATULATING GIRL SCOUTS OF THE USA ON ITS 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself and Ms. Collins) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Mikulski in \nsubmitting a resolution honoring the 100th anniversary of Girl \nScouting. In March of 2012, the Girl Scouts of America will celebrate a \ncentury as the world's preeminent organization dedicated solely to \nhelping young women develop the character and skills for future \nsuccess.\n  The Girl Scouts have a tremendous history that should be celebrated \nand remembered. Since this organization was founded in 1912 in by \nJuliette Gordon Low, more than 50 million American girls have learned \nthe values of integrity, leadership, and volunteerism. Today, there are \nmore than 3.7 million members in 236,000 local troops throughout the \nUnited States and its territories, Girls Scouts has a global reach, \nwith more than 10 million members in 145 countries. As the program \ncontinues to inspire, challenge, and empower young women across our \nNation and around the world, its members are seeking to come together \nand recognize its 100th year of creating challenges, opportunities, and \nunforgettable memories.\n  In 2009, I introduced the Girl Scouts USA Centennial Commemorative \nCoin Act with Senator Mikulski. Our bill, which passed both the House \nand Senate unanimously and was signed into law by the President, \ndirects the Secretary of the Treasury to mint commemorative silver-\ndollar coins, which will be issued in 2013. Proceeds from the coin \nsales will benefit the Girl Scouts Centennial Year activities and the \npreservation of the Juliette Gordon Low Birthplace so that future \ngenerations of Girl Scouts will be able to pay tribute to the history \nof this notable organization.\n  With more than 16,000 girl and adult members, Girl Scouts of Maine is \nmy State's preeminent organization dedicated solely to girls, all \ngirls, where, in an accepting and nurturing environment, girls build \nthe character and skills for success that last a lifetime. I thoroughly \nenjoyed my years as a Girl Scout in my hometown of Caribou, ME, \nincluding the two summers I spent at Camp Natarswi, so it gives me \ngreat pleasure to join in celebrating this important anniversary. On \nbehalf of Girl Scouts in Maine and across America, I am pleased to \nintroduce this resolution in celebration of 100 years of Girl Scouting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/03/senate-section/article/S7139-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 311--TO AUTHORIZE THE PRINTING OF A COLLECTION OF THE \n                 RULES OF THE COMMITTEES OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S.

WATER INFRASTRUCTURE JOBS AMENDMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the State water pollution control and State drinking \n     water revolving funds create jobs, repair crumbling \n     infrastructure, and protect public health;\n       (2) the State water pollution control and State drinking \n     water revolving funds invest in short- and long-term \n     improvements in communities across the United States, \n     providing significant environmental, economic, and public \n     health benefits;\n       (3) the water infrastructure of the United States is \n     approaching a tipping point, as each day, the poor condition \n     of water infrastructure of the United States results in \n     significant losses and damage from broken water and sewer \n     mains, sewage overflows, and other negative impacts of a \n     water infrastructure system that is nearing the end of the \n     useful life cycle of the system;\n       (4) the most recent infrastructure report card of the \n     American Society of Civil Engineers gave the water \n     infrastructure of the United States a D-, the lowest of any \n     category;\n       (5) the Environmental Protection Agency estimates for the \n     next 20 years put wastewater needs at $187,900,000,000 and \n     drinking water needs at $334,800,000,000;\n       (6) investments in water infrastructure provide significant \n     economic benefits and enjoy a strong return on investment;\n       (7) the United States Conference of Mayors notes that each \n     public dollar invested in water infrastructure increases \n     private, long-term Gross Domestic Product output by $6.35;\n       (8) The National Association of Utility Contractors \n     estimates that $1,000,000,000 of water infrastructure \n     investment can create more than 26,000 jobs; and\n       (9) the Department of Commerce estimates that each job \n     created in the local water and sewer industry creates 3.68 \n     jobs in the national economy, and each public dollar spent \n     yields $2.62 in economic output in other industries.\n       (b) Capitalization Grants.--Of the total amount made \n     available by this Act, 4 percent shall be made available to \n     the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency \n     (referred to in this section as the ``Administrator'') to \n     establish water infrastructure grants, of which--\n       (1) \\2/3\\ shall be for capitalization grants for State \n     water pollution control revolving funds under title VI of the \n     Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.);
