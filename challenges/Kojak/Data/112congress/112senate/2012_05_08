Mr. President, over the last 2 weeks, Senate Republicans \nhave repeatedly claimed they support efforts to keep interest rates low \nfor Federal student loans. In fact, Presidential nominee Mr. Romney has \nsaid the same. There is only one way to prove this, and that is to end \nthe needless filibuster of Democrats' plan to stop rates from doubling \nthis summer.\n  Democrats have proposed legislation to freeze student loan interest \nrates at current levels for a year without adding a single penny to the \ndeficit. Our plan adds no new taxes. I repeat, Mr. President: Our plan \nadds no new taxes. It would simply stop wealthy Americans from avoiding \nthe taxes they already owe. Our legislation would prevent 7 million \nstudents from paying $1,000 more over the life of each of their loans. \nYet Republicans appear poised to filibuster this worthy measure. They \nare sending a clear message they would rather protect wealthy tax \ndodgers--and that is what they are--than help promising students \nachieve their dreams of higher education.\n  Republicans will try to explain away their ``no'' votes by claiming \nthey oppose the way the legislation is paid for. They propose radical \ncuts to a preventive health care fund instead--a proposal they know we \noppose.\n\n[[Page S2934]]\n\n  Mr. President, we have already cut that plan to the bare bones. We \nhave used this on other programs to cut and we have done it in the \nright way. Any fluff that was in that program is gone. Some say we have \ncut far too much out of it.\n\n  The prevention fund is, as we speak, helping States fight chronic \nillnesses such as heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes. These \nchronic diseases I have just mentioned are responsible for 7 out of 10 \ndeaths in America today. Imagine, 7 out of 10 deaths are caused from \nheart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes. Yet Republicans want to \nuse this program to pay for the student loan interest rate \nstabilization--a program that stops these diseases from going forward. \nIt is a preventive program.\n  These diseases are responsible for three-quarters of the Nation's \nhealth care spending. So anything we can do to cut those back is the \nright thing to do. Common sense indicates we need to be treating those \n26 million Americans with diabetes. Around America today there are 26 \nmillion people who are taking medicine for diabetes, and it is sad to \nsay that includes a rapidly growing number of children. These 26 \nmillion people use up much of our health care delivery system, and \ndiabetes increases the risk of developing other costly, life-\nthreatening, chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, kidney \nfailure, and many other maladies that come from simply having diabetes.\n  This prevention fund the Republicans want to use to pay for this \nstabilization program for student loans also pays for successful \ntobacco cessation programs that avert billions of health care costs to \ntreat emphysema, heart disease, and cancer, among others. It finances \nimmunizations for preventable childhood illnesses such as measles and \nwhooping cough.\n  These diseases are back because there have been too few \nimmunizations. Last year, measles reached a 15-year high in our \ncountry. After nearly being wiped out in the 1950s, whooping cough has \nresurfaced. There have been major articles--I read one--that are \nstunning. As a kid, I received a whooping cough shot. I hadn't heard of \nit, but it is back. This is a terrible disease that we now have in \nAmerica. As I say, it has come back. It produces violent coughs that \ncan go on for as much as 6 months. People can die as a result of \ncoughing so hard. There has been a real bad outbreak of whooping cough \nin California, and the disease in America has reached its highest rate \nin 50 years. Yet the Republicans want to cut back on these \nimmunizations. That is not a good idea.\n  These diseases I have talked about are completely preventable with \nthe proper immunizations the prevention fund supports. Yet Republicans \nwant to axe investments in preventive care that save the country money \nand save lives. We have already made cuts, as I have indicated, \ndifficult cuts to this program. We cannot afford to make more drastic \ncuts that would put Americans' health at risk.\n  While we do not support Republicans' plan to cut programs that combat \ndiabetes, heart disease, or cancer, we are happy if they want a vote on \nsome alternative. But let us get on this bill. Republicans need to stop \nfilibustering our legislation--in this instance, the Stop Student Loan \nInterest Rate Hike Act. If they want some other way to pay for it, let \nus take a look at it. Let them offer it. The stakes are too high to let \npartisanship get in the way.\n  The average student graduates with $25,000 in debt. These young \npeople are running up these loans because they want to, because \neducation is so important in our country. But too many young people are \nputting off buying a house, starting a family, or opening a business \nbecause they are saddled with this crushing student loan debt. We don't \nneed to load that burden even more. Democrats are determined to protect \nmillions of students from increasing interest rates--almost 30,000 in \nNevada alone.\n  If Republicans truly share our goal, they will vote to advance this \nlegislation today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/08/senate-section/article/S2934-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is not exactly a State secret that \nSenate Democrats have turned the floor into an extension of the Obama \ncampaign over the past few months, and that what happens here these \ndays has a lot more to do with what some political consultant out in \nChicago thinks is good for the President's reelection than what the \nAmerican people think would be good for the country as a whole.\n  Separation of powers notwithstanding, the Democrats' top message man \nrecently admitted Senate Democrats and the White House are ``attached \nat the hip,'' meaning, of course, the Senate has ceased to be a place \nwhere problems are resolved and has become instead a place where \nDemocrats produce campaign material.\n  Today's vote on student loan rates is a perfect example of this \ncynical election year strategy in action. Rather than working with \nRepublicans to help young people in this country weather the effects of \nthe Obama economy, Democrats have sought to distract them from it. \nNever mind the fact that Democratic leaders supported the bill that \nwill cause interest rates on certain college loans to spike on July 1. \nNever mind the fact that President Obama was so concerned about this \nissue when this legislation passed he didn't even show up for the vote. \nNever mind the fact that Democrats have known this problem was coming \nfor literally years but deliberately waited until 2 months before their \ntemporary fix was due to expire to do anything about it.\n  Never mind any of that. What matters now for Democrats is they find a \nway to drive a wedge between Republicans and a constituency they are \nlooking to court ahead of the November elections. That is what today's \nvote is all about for them.\n  For Republicans, well, we don't think young people should have to \nsuffer any more than they already are as a result of this President's \nfailure to turn the economy around. We just disagree we should pay for \na fix by diverting $6 billion from Medicare and raising taxes on the \nvery businesses we are counting on to hire these young people.\n  But as I said, solving the problem isn't what this is about for \nSenate Democrats and the White House they are coordinating with. \nFinding a solution to this problem actually isn't difficult at all. \nWhat is difficult is getting Democrats to agree to it in an election \nyear. For them, it is about putting the other party on the spot.\n  Look, Republicans have a solution to this problem. We have asked for \na vote on it. Even Senator Harkin, who opposes our approach, thinks we \nshould at least get that vote. But following the President's lead, \nSenate Democratic leaders have decided to put the finger of blame \ninstead on us instead of solving the problem--which, of course, is \ncompletely ridiculous.\n  Here we are nearly 3\\1/2\\ years into this President's first term, and \nhe is still blaming his predecessor. He got nearly everything he wanted \nfor 2 years. He borrowed and spent trillions. He took over the student \nloan industry. He took over health care. He imposed his regulations. It \nis his economy now. Yet he is still blaming others.\n  My view is, if you are going to ask the American people to take \nresponsibility for their actions, pay their fair share, and play by the \nrules, it is time the President led by example and did the same.\n  Three months ago, the President told the American people that it is \ntime to apply the same rules from top to bottom. The President said: No \nbailouts, no handouts, and no cop-out. An America built to last, he \nsaid, insists on responsibility from everybody. Yet day after day, week \nafter week, what do we get from Democratic leaders in the Senate and \nfrom the President himself but more cop-outs.\n  Here is the real issue behind today's votes. Right now, more than \nhalf of college graduates cannot find a decent job. Close to half of \nthem are back at home living with their parents. As a Wall Street \nJournal article from late last year put it: The U.S. labor market may \nbe in a malaise, but young adults are in a crisis.\n  The real solution, of course: progrowth policies that make it easier\n\n[[Page S2935]]\n\nfor U.S. businesses to hire. But in the short term, Republicans are \nready to offer temporary relief, just as we did for working Americans \nearly this year by extending the payroll tax holiday.\n  To pay for this fix, Republicans propose to end an ObamaCare slush \nfund that Democrats and the President himself have already drawn from \nto cover other expenses.\n  This is a pay-for Democrats and the President have already used.\n  This is perfectly reasonable. It is a solution to a problem both \nparties want to address. It passed the House with bipartisan support. \nIf Democrats want to solve the problem, they should embrace it too or, \nat the very least, offer a bipartisan solution of their own. The White \nHouse has done neither.\n  The real enemy of recent college graduates is this President's \neconomic policies. Until Democrats are willing to admit that, we will \nkeep falling behind. And the real losers will be the young people we \nshould be working together on a bipartisan basis to help.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/08/senate-section/article/S2935-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 2343, \nwhich the clerk will report by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to S. 2343, a bill to amend the Higher \n     Education Act of 1965 to extend the reduced interest rate for \n     Federal Direct Stafford Loans, and for other purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 12 noon will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees, with the majority controlling the first 30 \nminutes and the Republicans controlling the second 30 minutes.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are here today because unless Congress \nacts, the interest rate for many of our students--over 100,000 of them \nin my home State of Washington--is going to double in 55 days.\n  On July 1, the law we passed that held rates on federally subsidized \nStafford loans to 3.4 percent will end, and rates are going to jump \novernight to 6.8 percent. That is going to add $1,000 to the cost of \nloans for these young people, and it is going to be another huge strain \nfor students and families who are already fighting to afford college \nand still struggling in this tough economy.\n  This isn't an abstract issue for me. For me it is very personal. Pell \ngrants and student loans were what allowed my six brothers and sisters \nand me to go to college when my dad got sick and had to leave his job. \nThey were what made college affordable for us, and they were what \nallowed each one of us to pursue careers and give back to our \ncommunities. Because our government was there for us, at a very tough \ntime for us, those seven kids in my family grew up to be a firefighter, \na lawyer, a computer programmer, a sports writer, a homemaker, a \nmiddle-school teacher, and a United States Senator--a pretty good \ninvestment by our country. And our family's story is not unique.\n  In fact, last week I went across my home State of Washington \nlistening to student after student describe the real-life impacts this \ninterest rate hike will have on their livelihood. The Columbian, a \nnewspaper in Vancouver, Washington, wrote a story on the roundtable I \nheld last week with local students. As the Columbian reported: the rate \nhike would impact students like Dora Hernandez, a first-generation \ncollege student at Washington State University in Vancouver. They \nreported that: Dora became a mother at the age of 18, 2 months after \nshe graduated from high school. She worked two to three jobs at a time \nto support herself and her child. It was at one of those jobs working \nthe concession stand on a college campus that inspired her to improve \nher own life by earning a postsecondary degree. She received some \nfinancial aid, but she will still have $29,000 in student loans to pay \nback when she graduates this month, she told me, proudly standing right \nin front of that concession stand she used to work at. She has no job \nlined up yet. She said:\n\n       I was flabbergasted to find out how much student loan debt \n     I've accrued. Honestly, I'm scared. I hope Congress finds a \n     way to keep interest rates on student loans down for students \n     like me.\n\n  The Columbian also reported the story of Diane Robinson, a 24-year-\nold single mom who told me she decided to enroll at Clark College after \na divorce left her with absolutely nothing. She told me:\n\n       I would not be here without the loans. It would be \n     impossible.\n\n  Through her tears, Diane told me that she was raised to repay her \ndebts and worries about her looming student loan payments every single \nday. She said:\n\n       If there is an increase on student loan interest rates, it \n     will compromise my quality of life. Repaying the debt I have \n     accrued will be essential for me to have a happy future.\n\n  For millions of Americans, affordable college has been the ticket to \nthe middle class. And for millions of small business owners, finding \nlocal workers with the education skills they need has been what has \nallowed them to expand and grow in our communities. We cannot afford to \nlet that slip away. We can't allow access to college to become \nunattainable for so many of our families. As we all know, college costs \nare rising too quickly right now anyway. In fact, since 1985, the cost \nof a college education has increased by 559 percent because States have \nhad to cut back their support for higher education and operating costs \nhave increased. Student loan debt has spiked, and for the first time in \nU.S. history, the national student debt burden has surpassed $1 \ntrillion. That is more than the total amount of credit card debt.\n\n  So the last thing our students right now need--the very last thing--\nis for interest rates on this critical loan program to double. We \ncannot afford to allow that to happen. At a time when mortgage rates \nare under 4 percent, we should be doing everything possible to keep \nrates low for students today. In fact, we should be investing in our \nfuture and trying to get more high school students to continue their \neducation. We should not be doubling interest rates on a critical loan \nprogram that students count on. It does not make sense.\n  The Stop the Student Loan Interest Rate Hike Act that is before us is \na commonsense measure that will prevent a rate hike on more than 7.4 \nmillion college students, and it pays for it by closing a tax loophole \nthat allows certain wealthy professionals to dodge paying their fair \nshare of taxes. So I hope we can move to this today.\n  I want to add, it is not just the students I talked about, Dora and \nDiane, who are speaking out against this rate hike. In fact, if our \nRepublican colleagues do decide to block our ability to go to this bill \ntoday, I know that students all across our country are going to \ncontinue to make their voices heard about this--whether it is in person \nor in letters or on Twitter or on Facebook--and we will bring those \nstories right here to the Senate over and over until Republicans see \nthat the students of America are not going to take no for an answer on \nthis critical issue that will affect their lives far into the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I rise in support of the same \nlegislation, and I appreciate the work of Senator Murray and Senator \nKlobuchar.\n  I introduced this legislation with Senator Harkin of Iowa and Senator \nReed of Rhode Island, and in the last couple of weeks I have been to \nthe Cayuga County Community College, a community college in Cleveland, \nOhio State University, Wright State University near Dayton, and the \nUniversity of Cincinnati. There were student bodies, student government \npeople in both political parties there. There is virtually universal \nsupport among students for this legislation. We have no business \nletting the interest rate double. The vote that will take place in less \nthan 1 hour gives us an opportunity to help students in a huge way.\n  The average Ohio graduate of a 4-year university has a $27,000 \nstudent debt. If we are going to pile more\n\n[[Page S2936]]\n\nmoney on that debt by allowing the interest rate to go from 3.4 to 6.8 \npercent, it means that student is less likely to be able to buy a \nhouse, less likely to probably start a family, and less likely to be \nable to start a business. It saps wealth from our community. If we can \nkeep this interest rate at 3.4 percent, it will pay dividends much more \nthan the cost of this.\n  I would close by saying this was a bipartisan arrangement. Back in \n2007, when Senator Klobuchar and I were in our first year in the \nSenate, President Bush signed legislation brought forward and passed by \na Democratic Senate and a Democratic House, with Republican support. So \nit had broad bipartisan support to lock in 3.4 percent for 5 years. Why \nare people making it partisan now?\n  The fact is we should pass this legislation today. We should pay for \nit in a way by closing these tax loopholes that are called the Newt \nGingrich-John Edwards tax loopholes, where both of them--Newt Gingrich, \na Republican, and John Edwards, a Democrat--in their private sector \nlives have legally been able to avoid tens of thousands of dollars in \ntaxes. Lobbying firms, consulting firms, all have used this loophole. \nGovernor Romney wanted to close this loophole when he was Governor of \nMassachusetts. It is something we should move forward on and put the \npartisanship aside and pass this. This is good for individual students, \njust like the GI bill after World War II was good for millions of \nindividual students. Look what it did for our society as a whole. It \nmade us a richer country, a more prosperous country, a more egalitarian \ncountry. What is not to like about that? That is why we should pass \nthis legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Stop \nthe Student Loan Interest Rate Hike Act.\n  I want to first acknowledge my colleague Senator Brown of Ohio for \nhis leadership. They have Ohio State, we have the University of \nMinnesota, and both of us have met with students from these States who \nhave told us firsthand what they are experiencing every single day. I \nhave talked to students at the University of Minnesota and Minnesota \nState in Mankato, where my father-in-law taught for many years, and \nthey have told me about their own situations, where they may have five \nsiblings and there is absolutely no way their parents, both of whom are \nworking, can afford to send their kids to college without loans.\n  I have talked to a young woman in Mankato whose mom was helping with \nthe tuition, and then suddenly her mom lost her job and she couldn't \nhelp anymore, parents who have gone out on disability who can no longer \nhelp anymore.\n  We have to ask ourselves as a country, when those things happen, when \nyou have a student who may be the first in their family to ever go to \ncollege, are we going to turn our back on them and say: No, we don't \nwant you to go to college? Well, that is not going to work in our \ncountry. That is not going to work, because in Minnesota the numbers \njust came out, and up to 2018, of all the new jobs created, 70 percent \nare going to require some kind of postsecondary education. Half of them \nare going to require 1-year to 2-year degrees, the other half are going \nto require 4-year degrees or more. We know those facts. We know how we \nare going to be able to compete in this world, and that is by having \neducated workers. To do that, we cannot turn our back on the students \nwho may be in a situation where they can work part time.\n  There was one girl I met at the University of Minnesota who was \nworking a 50-hour paid job every week in addition to the classload, in \naddition to going to school. These students are working hard, and we \nmust make sure they are able to complete their college and complete \ntheir degrees. College tuition and fees have been rising more rapidly \nthan household income over the last two decades, and it is becoming \nmore and more difficult for students and their families to afford these \ncosts.\n  We know that student loan debt has reached record levels. College \nseniors owed an average of $25,000 in student loan debt upon graduating \nin 2010, with a total loan debt reaching $1 trillion. This is what we \nare dealing with.\n  I know when I had student loans I paid them off, and, Mr. President, \nyou will be happy to know that I met my husband right after I had paid \noff my loans and he still owed over $20,000 in student loans, but I \nmarried him anyway. I have had firsthand experience in what it is like \nto pay off these loans but never in these amounts our students today \nare facing. While it is normally good to be above average, my home \nState is, unfortunately, above average in student loan debt. We rank \nfourth in the Nation. The average Minnesota student graduates from \ncollege with more than $29,000 in loan debt.\n\n  As college costs skyrocket and student loan debt climbs, we have to \nconsider what this means for students today and what effect this will \nhave on our future. At a time when our global economy demands more of \nour workforce, we must focus on the foundation of our future \nprosperity, and that is education, particularly in science, technology, \nengineering, and math. To advance in those fields, you need at least a \n2-year degree or a 4-year degree. We know that. We must do more to \nexpand higher education opportunities and make college affordable for \nour students. It is one of the best investments we can make in the \nlong-term success for America. That is because education doesn't just \npay off for students, it also pays off for our country in the form of a \nskilled workforce and a competitive economy.\n  We have seen this in my own State, where we are home to one of the \nbest skilled, most educated workforces in the country. That is the \nreason we are first per capita for Fortune 500 companies. I can tell \nyou it is not the weather. These companies did not elect to move to \nMinnesota and to stay in Minnesota because of our winters. They came in \nlarge part because of the educated workforce, because we had people who \ncould do the jobs and create the inventions. At 3M, Minnesota Mining \nand Manufacturing, they have as many inventions as they have employees. \nThey average one invention for each employee. That is a fact. Look at \nthe numbers. Why is that? Because we have the educated workforce to \nfill those jobs.\n  We also know that students today, both those in college and those who \nare considering college, face many unexpected obstacles, including the \npressure to pay for higher education. As I mentioned, when I visited \nstudents at the University of Minnesota and also Minnesota State at \nMankato, I heard firsthand about their experiences and how hard they \nwere working to get those degrees. These students face many hardships \nand many sacrifices, but they continue to move forward and they are \ndetermined to get their education. The reality is that students can \nwork, save money, and be totally responsible about saving for and \npaying for college, but life can bring unexpected challenges, and \nstudents need help through access to low-interest loans. That is all we \nare talking about here, low-interest loans.\n  Interest rates on Stafford student loans are set to double from 3.4 \npercent to 6.8 percent on July 1 of this year. Unless Congress \nintervenes, 7 million students will see higher interest rates on their \nstudent loans--a dramatic increase in the interest rate that does not \nmake sense at a time when the economy is still struggling to recover \nand students are facing ever higher college costs and young graduates \nare having a hard time finding jobs. I know how valuable these loans \nare to students, and that is why I am a cosponsor of the Student Loan \nAffordability Act, which would prevent the rate hike and ensure college \nremains affordable. That would affect this doubling of the interest \nrate for, in my State alone, 200,000 students. Think what we want those \n200,000 students to do. We want those students to be out there \ninventing the next Post-it note for 3M. We want them out there \ninventing the next pacemaker. We want them out there inventing the next \nGoogle. That is what this is about. That is how our economy has run. We \nare a country that makes and invents products, makes them and exports \nthem to the world. The only way we do that is with affordable \neducation.\n  I have heard from hundreds of Minnesotans who say the costs are \nputting a strain on their families and making college seem out of \nreach. This is unacceptable, and we must act now.\n\n[[Page S2937]]\n\n  I know this firsthand, as I explained, not only from what I have seen \nin my State, what I have seen in the interrelationship between \neducation and business, but in my own life. My grandpa was an iron ore \nminer. He worked 1,500 feet under the ground in the mines in north \nMinnesota. He never graduated from college. He never even graduated \nfrom high school. He saved money in a coffee can in the basement of \ntheir little house, this small house where they literally only had a \nshower in the basement. He saved money in that coffee can to send my \ndad and his brother to college. They were the first in that family of \nSlovenian immigrants--the first to go to college. They went to college. \nMy uncle became an engineer living in Rochester, MN. My dad went to the \n2-year junior college, got a degree from what is now Vermilion \nCommunity College, then went on to the University of Minnesota, got his \njournalism degree, joined the AP, and then went on to the Minneapolis \nStar and Tribune, where he became an award-winning journalist. He \ntraveled the world. He got to interview everyone from Ginger Rogers to \nMike Ditka to Ronald Reagan. That is my dad's life, and it all started \nbecause his parents believed in education but, most importantly, his \ncountry believed in education--the United States of America. That is \nwhat this issue is about. It is about progress, it is about families, \nand it is about moving this country forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, we just passed the deadline for students \nto decide where they are going to college this fall. This is one of the \nbiggest financial decisions students will ever make. Nationally, \nstudent loan debt is over $1 trillion. It is higher than credit card \ndebt. Over 60 percent of the class of 2010 graduated with outstanding \nstudent loans, college graduates. In Minnesota we are fourth in the \ncountry for the level of debt college graduates take with them. It is \n$29,000. This is hurting us as a nation in competition with other \ncountries. It was not too many years ago that the United States was No. \n1 in the world in the percentage of its adult population that had \ngraduated from college. Now we are something like 16th. That is going \nto hurt us.\n  We have to do something about student debt. Behind every one of these \nstatistics, there are stories. I had students from the board of MNSCU--\nit is a Minnesota organization of colleges and universities--in my \noffice, and there must have been about 15 or 20 of them. I said to \nthem: How many of you work at least 10 hours a week while going to \nschool? All of them. How many of you work 20 hours a week? Most of \nthem. How many of you work at least 30 hours a week while going to \nschool? A lot of them. How many of you work 40 hours a week while going \nto school? How many of you work full time while going to school? A few \nof them, a number of them. That is no way to go to school.\n\n  Time after time when I talk to kids, I hear their stories.\n  Mike Flannery is a graduate of Hennepin Technical College. He was \nforced to take out private student loans because Federal loans were not \nenough to pay for his college costs. He graduated from his associate's \nprogram with a total debt of $34,750. Michael is now struggling to deal \nwith this massive debt load, and he told me he will likely have to drop \nout of his summer coursework due to college costs. He currently owes \n$45,250 and is still working toward his bachelor's degree.\n  No wonder it takes our students 6 years to graduate--or longer. It is \nnow not really a question; you have to graduate from college or at \nleast get a 2-year degree to get a good-paying job in this country. In \nthe next 7 years, 70 percent of jobs in Minnesota will require some \ntype of postsecondary credential. Yet right now only 40 percent of \nworking-age Minnesotans have one.\n  If we are going to compete with other countries, we have to do \nsomething about this. What can we do? We have to get long-term costs \nunder control. There is a lot to do there, but that is the long term. \nIn the short term, at least we should do no harm. On July 1 Stafford \nloans, subsidized Stafford loans are set to double, from 3.4 to 6.8 \npercent. That is unconscionable.\n  This legislation was written in 2007, and that said it would double. \nIf you look at interest rates, what they have done from 2007 to now, \nthey have just shot down. This makes no sense whatsoever. This is going \nto affect over 7.5 million students nationwide, over 200,000 in \nMinnesota. If we fail to take action, this will cost every student in \nMinnesota about $1,000 in increased loan costs over the life of the \nloans. That is real money.\n  We have an offset here we have tried to do. It is about S \ncorporations. I don't want to get into the details of this. Basically \nwhat it is--let's say you have an S corp. You are a businessman, and at \nthe end you take your salary and profits, and most honest businessmen \npay taxes on all of that, including their withholding tax, their FICA. \nSo you pay FICA on $107,000, approximately, in withholding tax. That \npays into Social Security and Medicare. That is what FICA is.\n  There are others who take advantage of a loophole. It is a loophole. \nIt is legal. Let's say you are a businessman and you make $300,000. \nWell, you pay yourself a salary of $40,000 and you pay your FICA on \nthat. Then at the end of the year you take out the profits. Now, these \nprofits are not capital gains. They pocket the business's profits \nwithout paying payroll taxes. This is as clearly a loophole as anything \nthat exists in our Tax Code. This is exactly the type of loophole that \neveryone, not just our friends on the other side of the aisle but that \nwe are talking about taking out of the Tax Code so that we can maybe \nnot raise marginal rates as much or, on the other side, they say we can \ntake out the loopholes and lower it. If you can't get rid of this \nloophole, there is no loophole you can get rid of. This is so obviously \na wrongheaded loophole. That extra money they take at the end of the \nyear, it is not considered capital gains, it is income. They pay the \ntop rate on that income--it is above the top rate. This offset would \naffect only people making over $250,000.\n  We need to pass this legislation. This is a loophole we need to close \nbecause it just makes sense. It is a loophole that I don't think anyone \ncan really defend. I really don't. I would love to hear someone try to \ndefend this one. Again, I have heard over and over that we just have to \nclose some loopholes, these crazy loopholes. This is the one we need to \ndo so our kids can have a manageable debt, so they are not paying \nexorbitant costs on their debt.\n  We have to be realistic about all of this, about what it takes to \nmake it in this country. You need a college education or you need some \npostsecondary education. We have a skills gap in this country we need \nto close. Kids are borrowing and borrowing, and we are doing this \ngeneration a disservice. We have to look at reality.\n  I heard Mitt Romney the other day in Ohio. He said to kids: Look, \ntake a chance on yourself. Borrow money from your parents to start a \nbusiness.\n  That is not what is happening in this country. Kids cannot accumulate \nan average of $29,000 in debt and still be able to borrow from their \nparents. If they could borrow from their parents, they wouldn't have an \naverage of $29,000 in debt; they would be borrowing from their parents.\n  The reality is we are putting a burden on our children that we should \nnot be putting on them. We should close this loophole that there is no \nrhyme or reason for so these students can be paying a reasonable \ninterest rate and not some exorbitant interest rate. This is just \ncommon sense.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote for this bill \nand then we can move on to some other things.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Today the Senate will vote on a vital piece of legislation \nthat I am proud to cosponsor, to prevent the rise in interest rates on \nneed-based student loans. Without action, millions of students across \nthe country will see their interest rates double on their subsidized \nStafford loans on July 1. At the very least, these students deserve a \ndebate on this vital pocketbook question that affects millions of young \nAmericans and their families.\n  I have always strongly believed in the importance of a college \neducation. I was the first in my family to have the opportunity to go \nto college. Every young person should have the chance to pursue higher \neducation. Education is a path out of poverty, a road to personal \ngrowth, and an access ramp to\n\n[[Page S2938]]\n\nprofessional accomplishment and economic security. Everyone wins when \naccess to education expands.\n  It should go without saying that student loan costs should not rise \nso high that students cannot repay. Yet in recent years, average \ncollege tuition rates have increased faster than inflation, far \noutpacing student financial aid. Since 1985, the cost of attending \ncollege has increased by 559 percent, and last schoolyear alone, \ninstate tuition and fees at public 4-year institutions averaged 8.3 \npercent higher than the previous year.\n  I hear from Vermonters constantly about their struggles to afford \ncollege and their concerns about student loan debt after they graduate. \nSkyrocketing tuition is making it increasingly difficult for families \nto afford higher education. Many students are forced to take on \nsignificant debt, and too often they are not able to complete college \nbecause of soaring costs. For those students who do go on to graduate, \nrecord student loan debt has made getting ahead in today's job market \nnext to impossible for many students. Unfortunately, along with the \npressure from student loan debt has come an increase in default rates \namong borrowers, which will affect a student's financial stability for \ndecades.\n  Especially during these difficult economic times we need to be doing \nmore to address the rising costs of higher education and the growing \nneed for student financial aid. We have made significant investments in \nhigher education and making college more affordable in recent years \nthrough historic investments in the Pell Grant Program, moving to a \nuniversal system of direct loans, and through the President's recent \nExecutive order to reduce monthly payments for low-income borrowers. \nWhile these measures have certainly helped students, more must be done \nto ensure every American has access to a college education.\n  While there is agreement on the need to prevent the interest rate \nincrease, division remains on the way to finance the yearlong \nextension. The House passed a bill largely along partisan lines that \nwould fund the student loan measure by eliminating the Prevention and \nPublic Health Fund, created under the affordable care act. Prevention \nfunding is vitally important in helping to lower health care costs and \nimproving the health of Americans through chronic disease screenings, \ntobacco education, and immunization programs. An estimated 15 percent \nof college seniors have chronic diseases and could benefit from this \nfunding. We should not force on students a choice made by Congress, not \nby students, between disease prevention and lower interest rates.\n  The solution we offer is far better for students and for the Nation. \nThe bill to which I hope we proceed today would prevent student loan \ninterest rates from doubling by closing a loophole in the Tax Code. \nRight now, certain businesses can avoid paying employment taxes on \ntheir employees' paychecks. This measure would ensure that businesses \nemploying individuals making over $250,000 would be subject to the same \nMedicare and Social Security taxes every business must pay. This is a \ncommonsense reform that we should all support.\n  Each opportunity for a young American to earn a college education is \nalso an opportunity for the Nation's future. Our country's ability to \ncompete in the global marketplace in the future depends on our \nchildren's ability to finance their education. This does not need to be \na partisan issue and should be one where we can find widespread \nagreement.\n  We must not tell the 7.4 million students who rely on subsidized \nStafford loans that their interest rates will double because protecting \na tax loophole is more important than their ability to afford college. \nI urge every Senator to help us move ahead today to support our \nstudents, their futures, and our country's future.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I rise in support of efforts to prevent an \nincrease in the student loan rates.\n  For millions of Americans, education is the key to success and a \nbetter future for themselves and for their families. Workers with a \nbachelor's degree today earn about 70 percent more each year than those \nwith only a high school diploma. We all want a better life for our \nchildren and for our grandchildren, and for many of them, a college \neducation is part of achieving that goal.\n  However, higher education carries an increasingly substantial \npricetag. One of my children has already completed her higher \neducation, both my sons are currently in college, and my youngest is \npreparing for her posthigh school education. I know firsthand the \nfinancial strain on both the college students and their families.\n  The inflation-adjusted cost of college has almost tripled over the \nlast 25 years, while median family income over the same period of time \nhas risen only about 10 percent. Fees keep rising rapidly, soaring 8.3 \npercent last year at public universities and 4.5 percent at private \ninstitutions. In 2009, more than half of all public college graduates \nwere in debt, with an average loan burden of nearly $20,000. For \nprivate college graduates, the percentage and amount of debt is even \ngreater. The loan burden itself is substantial, and the last thing \ngraduates need to worry about is high interest rates on these loans.\n  I was proud to vote for the initial efforts to keep student loan \ninterest rates low back when I was serving in the House in 2007. Now I \nam a proud cosponsor of the Interest Rate Reduction Act which has been \noffered by my friend, the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander. This \nlegislation prevents student loans from doubling from 3.4 percent to \n6.8 percent, and I truly hope Congress will be able to come together \nwith a bipartisan agreement soon to prevent this increase from going \ninto effect on July 1.\n  While student loan rates should be addressed, I am even more worried \nabout the overall economic climate facing college grads. Recent reports \nfound that more than half the bachelor degree holders under the age of \n25 last year, which was 1.5 million young Americans, were jobless or \nunderemployed. Of the 1.5 million languishing in the job market, half \nwere underemployed. These young would-be professionals are either \nunemployed and unable to start paying their loans or have a job that \nmay only provide enough for them to barely scrape by paycheck to \npaycheck. Instead of becoming the workforce of the next generation, the \nmajority of recent graduates are finding their personal lives and \nfinances mired in this ailing economy. Parents who have been laid off \nor who have seen their savings diminish have not been able to help \ntheir children through their education as they may have planned or \nwanted to. Our children and grandchildren are paying the price for \nWashington's failure to lead our Nation out of this economic crisis.\n  Addressing student loan rates is important and we need to accomplish \nthat work promptly, but our work for America's colleges students and \nrecent graduates is far from over. Congress should be doing something \nevery day to provide more stability and certainty for businesses so \nthey will create jobs and hire these graduates. We need to pass a \nbudget and review expiring tax provisions. We need to get bureaucratic \nredtape out of the way and let American job creators do what they do \nbest. Let's not put off until tomorrow what we can do today to make \nsure good-paying jobs will be available for graduates who have worked \nso hard to provide for a better future and let's pass a bipartisan \nmeasure that keeps student interest rates low.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Will the Senator suspend his \nrequest?\n  Mr. HELLER. I will.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the issue that is \ncurrently under debate; that is, student loan interest rates.\n  For many students across this great country, the month of May marks \nthe end of the school year and, for some, it\n\n[[Page S2939]]\n\nmeans graduating after years of hard work and moving on to another \nchapter in their life. Americans have always been people who celebrate \nhard work and the doors that hard work open for all of us.\n  Our country was founded on the promise that people could come here to \nfind the opportunity to realize their dreams. So one of the most \ndevastating consequences of the recent economy is that college students \nare beginning this new chapter in their lives when opportunities are \nharder and harder to come by. Sadly, today's college graduates are more \nlikely to end up unemployed or underemployed and struggling with \nstudent loan debt at the same time. They are more likely to end up with \nthose circumstances than they are to land their dream job.\n  Unfortunately, college costs have been increasing faster than the \ncost of living. Sixty-five percent of graduates who got a bachelor's \ndegree in 2010 graduated with debt. So as our economy continues to lag, \nstopping interest rates on subsidized Stafford student loans from \ndoubling could provide much needed relief. That is why I am a cosponsor \nof legislation introduced by my colleague Lamar Alexander which extends \nthe current 3.4-percent interest rate for an additional year. It needs \nto be done.\n  It cannot be denied that access to education is imperative to \nensuring a prosperous future for Nebraska's young people and for all \nAmericans. It should be our goal to foster an economic atmosphere where \njobs will flourish, our economy thrives, and opportunities abound for \nyoung people and, for that matter, for all Americans. That is why I am \nso disappointed that today we will vote on a bill that takes such a \ndifferent approach to paying for the student loan interest rate \nextension.\n  The bill we will vote on taxes small businesses and raids funds that \nwould otherwise go to shore up the Social Security and Medicare trust \nfunds. Providing relief for students, protecting seniors' benefits, and \nfueling our Nation's job engine should not be mutually exclusive goals. \nWe should not be pitting one sector of our population against another. \nYet that is what we will do later on today.\n\n  This bill sacrifices one of those goals I just mentioned and puts \nanother in jeopardy to achieve a third. I believe that is \ncounterproductive. Why? In part because the future of our young people \nis so dependent on the availability of jobs in America.\n  This bill would raise taxes on job creators at a terrible time. The \nU.S. economy only grew by 1.7 percent in the last year, and our \nunemployment rate has been over 8 percent now for 39 consecutive \nmonths. Taxing job creators has a chilling effect on hiring. It isn't \nstraightforward to promise students the American dream while making it \nharder for them to get a job--often the first step toward realizing \ntheir dreams.\n  The bill is also enormously unfair to seniors. By diverting tax \nrevenues that would otherwise go to Social Security and Medicare, it \nignores the warning flags we just received yet again about these \nprograms. A recent trustees' report verifies that both these programs \nare on unsustainable paths. Medicare is projected to be insolvent by \n2024 and Social Security by 2033--two dates that are well within sight. \nBut instead of helping to strengthen these programs for the future, \nthis bill spends the money elsewhere. The legislation ignores reality \nand, sadly, that has been all too familiar.\n  The health care law also siphoned funding from Medicare to the tune \nof $\\1/2\\ trillion. This money was used to pay for new entitlements in \nthe law, not to extend the life of Medicare. The law's supporters have \nsometimes claimed it somehow did both--that magically we could count \nthe same dollar twice--but anyone who looked at that disagreed with it, \nand basic math tells us we can't save and spend the same dollar two \ntimes. That was just one of many budget gimmicks used to mask the true \ncost of the health care bill.\n  Student loans help shoulder the massive cost of the health care law \nas well. That law, interestingly enough, nationalized the student loan \nindustry, generating $60 billion over the decade, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office. But instead of using that money to address \nthe doubling of student loan interest rates that was on the horizon, \nCongress and the President spent a portion of that money to help pay \nfor the health care law--simply amazing. It is just one more example of \na government that claims to know best when their only remedy is to rob \nfrom Peter to pay Paul. Sadly, the misguided government solution we \nwill vote on today will be counterproductive for our job creators, for \nour economy, and for our Nation's job seekers, our soon-to-be \ngraduates.\n  But don't take my word for it. There is a long list of organizations \nrepresenting millions of employers and hard-working employees sounding \nan alarm over the tax increase being proposed in the bill we will vote \non today. They are the people who build our homes, fix our air-\nconditioners, run the corner convenience store, own restaurants, print \nthe flyers we distribute and the church bulletins we receive on Sunday. \nThey all say the pay-for in this bill is bad policy. They don't buy the \nnotion that it is a simple tax clarification. They identify it in plain \nEnglish as a permanent payroll tax increase.\n  They go on to say in a letter to Senate leaders that a payroll tax \nincrease should not be diverted from Medicare and Social Security to a \ntemporary program. That letter, dated May 3, 2012, to Senators Reid and \nMcConnell and signed by dozens of organizations is in my hand and was \nprinted in yesterday's Record.\n  Senator Alexander has proposed a good option that doesn't slap the \njob creators with a tax increase and doesn't divert funds that would \notherwise go to Medicare and Social Security, and I support his \nproposal. I would also be open to supporting other pay-fors other than \nthe irresponsible one we will face today. It is time to look for \npractical solutions that can actually pass the Senate and help the \nAmerican people. Americans are getting sick and tired of election-year \nvoting where we face legislation that we all know is designed to fail \nwith this singular focus of generating good campaign talking points. \nWhile extending the student loan interest rate is important, a \nprosperous future depends on more than just that low interest rate. \nYoung Americans would have greater prospects for the future in an \neconomy that generated jobs and its growing income. The budgets would \nbe less drained if the price of gas and health insurance didn't \ncontinue to escalate, and they would have more stability down the road \nif their future wasn't threatened by strained entitlement programs and \na Federal debt that is now larger than the entire Nation's economy.\n\n  Lately, instead of solving these problems, legislation simply looks \nfor yet another scapegoat, another political gotcha, a bill that is \ndesigned to fail to get a 30-second spot. Here in the Senate we should \nnot be in the scapegoat- or gotcha-finding business. We should be in \nthe solution-finding business. That is why I am proud to cosponsor \nSenator Alexander's legislation that does the right thing for our \ncountry's students. This bill provides relief for students during a \ndifficult economic time, and it uses money from a fund created from the \nhealth care law to pay for the extension. Identical language has \nalready passed in the House, and it is here for the Senate to consider.\n  The President has already signed legislation into law using this very \nhealth care fund as an offset. The President even included cuts to this \nfund in his own deficit-reduction proposal. But now, when it is \npolitically expedient to oppose those cuts, he has conveniently changed \nhis mind. Well, these flip-flops don't go unnoticed by the American \npeople.\n  I hope we can consider Senator Alexander's legislation soon and the \nPresident will reconsider his threat to veto it. There has been a lot \nof finger pointing on this issue, but in reality everybody agrees \ninterest rates on the Stafford loan should not double when the economy \nis struggling. The only disagreement is over how to pay for the relief. \nIt is unfortunate that an area with so little disagreement has yet \nagain morphed into a political football.\n  Sadly, with this being a Presidential election year, I fear there \nwill be more of this political gamesmanship. But I stand ready to work \nwith anyone interested in solving the problem.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S2940]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the student \nlending program that I understand we may be voting on a little bit \nlater today. I want to first say, like my colleague, I have talked with \na number of students in Tennessee and people who used to be students in \ncollege who have a tremendous amount of loan obligation they have to \ndeal with. Our hearts go out to folks whose careers start with a large \namount of debt, and we hear lots of stories about the size of this \ndebt.\n  So I want to start by saying that I certainly empathize with much of \nwhat is happening in the student lending program as it relates to the \nrecipients on the one hand. On the other hand, as it relates to how we \ndeal with this issue, which also relates to these young people--I mean, \nat the end of the day, these massive deficits we are piling up are also \ngoing to be an obligation to them in one form or another. I want to \nspeak to that for one moment.\n  First of all, I want to say that my friend from Tennessee, the senior \nSenator, has done as good a job as any of laying out what is driving \ntuition costs in the first place. The reason students are having to \nborrow so much money to go to college these days is due to what we have \ndone in Washington. What I mean by that is if we look at the Medicaid \nPrograms in West Virginia or Tennessee, what we have seen over the \ncourse of the last couple of decades is that Medicaid costs have been \nrising dramatically in our own States. Because State governments are \nforced to fund these huge Medicaid costs, they don't have the same \nresources available to fund public higher education.\n  So what is happening is these State governments, which are compelled \nby us, by the way, to fund these Medicaid Programs--let me make a \npoint. Most people realize that with the passage of the health care \nbill a couple of years ago, we are going to have upwards of 25 million \nmore Americans across this country on Medicaid. That was the largest \npart of the health care expansion that took place.\n  In my own State of Tennessee they have already projected over a 5-\nyear period that it is going to cost them over $1 billion to fund what \nthis Congress mandated as it relates to health care just a few years \nago. That is $1 billion that is not going to be available for higher \neducation. So when we campaign around the country and talk about \nwanting to deal with student lending, I think we ought to be looking at \nCongress because Congress is actually the one driving the exorbitant \ntuition rates in the first place by these mandates that we are placing \non State governments. It is kind of appalling.\n  As a matter of fact, in our own State, at a time when Medicaid costs \nrose 15 percent, in order to make our State's budget balance the State \nlegislature invested 15 percent less in higher education. Again, what \nis happening is young people--such as the ones who are sitting in front \nof me--are having to pay exorbitant tuition costs because the States \naround our country are not able to invest in higher education. \nTherefore, it is being sloughed off on the backs of students as they \nenter college.\n  Let's talk about the loan program itself. First of all, a loan \nprogram that charges 6.8 percent, which is what the program is getting \nready to do, loans money to all comers--in other words, everybody who \ncomes to get a loan--and there is no collateral in place. It is not \nlike a home mortgage where there is collateral. There is no \ndownpayment. As we know, these loans don't begin to be repaid until \nyears down the road. The U.S. Government is not even breaking even at \n6.8 percent. So this whole notion that this student lending program--\nagain, as part of the health care bill--was going to create $50 billion \nor $60 billion to fund a new health care entitlement was wrong in the \nfirst place. With the interest rate at 6.8 percent there is no way \ntaxpayers are coming out even. It is not possible.\n  As a matter of fact, CBO issued a report in March that said if they \nused fair accounting standards at the 6.8 percent level, the Federal \nGovernment was actually subsidizing student loans by 12 percent. So \nthis whole notion of saying, well, the U.S. Government's borrowing \ncosts is low, and therefore we ought to be making loans at 3.4 \npercent--by the way, I would love for us to be able to offer rates as \nlow as we can to students. But the fact is we are already losing money \nat the 6.8-percent level. There is no way, with no money down, no \ncollateral, payments being made down the road, taking all comers, and \ndefault rates that will exist that we could possibly be coming out at \n6.8 percent. I think CBO has clearly stated that by virtue of the \nreport that came out in March.\n  Let me come up with a third point. What we are getting ready to do is \nto discuss a bill that spends $6 billion of our taxpayer money, and \nCongress is considering spending the $6 billion in this 1 year to give \nstudents who apply--futuristically, by the way. This has nothing to do \nwith students who are already in college today and have student \nlending. But for this 1 year, for loan originations to student lending, \nwe are going to keep the rate at 3.4 percent, which is going to cost an \nadditional $6 billion this year.\n\n  So what is Congress considering? Congress is considering paying for \nthat $6 billion over the next 10 years. So instead of saying we are \ngoing to spend $6 billion and do what most Americans have to do on a \ndaily basis--if we are going to spend a dollar this year, we have to \nsave a dollar someplace else--what is Congress considering? Spreading \nthe cost over the next 10 years. What is that going to do? Accumulate \nadditional tremendous debt. What is that going to do for the students \nwho are now seeking these loans? Candidly, it piles up additional money \nthey are going to have to pay back.\n  Let me close by saying this: I know this is campaign season. I know \ncandidates on both sides of the aisle are around college campuses in \nthis country talking to students about their future. What I find \nunbelievable--and I think these students, by the way, are a lot \nbrighter than people give them credit for as they are campaigning \naround on college campuses. But, basically, I think these students \nunderstand that as politicians are going around trying to offer them \ndeals, they understand that at the same time Washington is piling up \ntremendous amounts of debt on these students, and not only are they \ngoing to have their student loans to repay, but they are going to have \nall of the trillions and trillions of dollars of debt that Congress is \nadding on in order to curry favor with citizens of all walks of life in \nour Nation. That is what happened in Western democracies. We are seeing \nit play out right now in Europe.\n  But what I think these students are quickly figuring out is that we \nare really not giving them anything. Basically, we are taking with the \nother hand. I think the numbers will carry this out. If, in fact, we do \ndeal with this pending student lending program over the course of the \nnext 6 weeks--and my guess is we may well do that--I hope we will be \nhonest with these college students and at least pay for this \nexpenditure by not spending money on something else so we are not, in \nessence, giving them something today but taking away something much \nbigger from them over the long haul.\n  I yield the floor. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the vote we will take today will affect \nmillions of Americans. If we do not enact legislation before July 1 of \nthis year, approximately 7.4 million students will see the interest \nrate on their student loans double.\n  Nearly 200 student government leaders, representing more than 2.5 \nmillion college students across the Nation, have asked us to come up \nwith a bipartisan solution to keep the interest rate from doubling this \nJuly.\n  Hundreds of thousands of students, parents, educators, and concerned \ncitizens have called and written to their\n\n[[Page S2941]]\n\nSenators and Representatives with a simple message: Don't double the \nrate.\n  For them, student loan debt is not a trivial matter. It is a matter \nof going to school, and it is a matter, ultimately, of the jobs they \ntake and their ability to pay off those loans during their working \nlife.\n  Without action, students will pay, on average, an additional $1,000 \nfor every year they have to take student loans, if we let this rate \ndouble.\n  Two-thirds of the class of 2010 graduated owing student loans, with \nan average debt of over $25,000. They are walking out of school with a \ndegree and a huge debt. If we do not fix this problem, beginning today, \nthat debt will be larger for their successes in the years ahead.\n  Student loan debt collectively has passed the $1 trillion mark--\nexceeding credit card debt. In fact, there are some who speculate this \nis the new bubble that is coming upon our economy. This is a serious \nissue.\n  The good news is that there seems to be for at least the principle of \npreventing this increase--an emerging bipartisan consensus that we \nshould not allow the rate to double. The bad news is that my colleagues \non the other side have chosen to use the student loan interest rate as \nanother opportunity to attack health care. They have proposed to pay \nfor the extension by cutting funds to the Prevention and Public Health \nFund, reducing access to immunizations and services that seek to \nprevent cancer, diabetes, heart disease, to name a few.\n  The President has already said he would veto this attempt to pit \nhealth care against education--health care, which benefits all, but \nparticularly benefits those low-income and middle-income American \nfamilies and, of course, these education programs that are a lifeline \nand a mainstay for middle-income Americans.\n  The other aspect of attacking this prevention fund is, in the long \nterm, if we are ever going to get our hands around the cost of health \ncare in this country--and both sides recognize this is one of the \ncritical obstacles we face in the future--we have to have better \nprevention. It is difficult to understand how people can say: Let's not \ndo prevention, but we have to cut health care costs. If we could have \nan effective prevention program, we could, indeed, over years, and with \nincreasing success, reduce or at least begin to flatten that proverbial \nhealth care cost curve.\n  It is interesting to note, the other side is proposing to use health \ncare to pay for this proposal to help middle-income families, but they \ndo not always insist on paying for everything they want to do. They \nwill, frankly--and, I think, eagerly--extend the Bush tax cuts without \nany pay-for. The House recently passed the so-called Small Business Tax \nCut Act with no offsets. And that costs $46 billion--nearly enough to \npay for the student loan interest rate at 3.4 percent permanently.\n  Following this logic, students and their families across the country \nare probably wondering: Well, why isn't the risk of doubling their \ninterest rate treated the same way as benefiting the wealthiest \nAmericans through tax cuts and businesses through tax cuts? Don't they \ncount as much? Shouldn't they count as much?\n  We propose to pay for this 1-year extension by closing an egregious \nloophole in the Tax Code that has enabled certain high-wage earners to \navoid paying their fair share into Social Security and Medicare by \nmisclassifying their wages as profits through subchapter S \ncorporations. It is a very small subset of corporations that are doing \nthis, and our proposal is targeted.\n  This is not the small manufacturing plant that is organized as a \nsubchapter S corporation or the pharmacy or the lumber dealer. These \nare consultants, these are high-paid attorneys, these are professionals \nwho have chosen to put between themselves and their company or their \npartnership in another entity purely for the purpose of minimizing \ntheir payroll tax exposure. That is a loophole that should be cut \nregardless of other measures we are considering.\n  Essentially, this is a very small group of people, as I said. In \norder to be subject to this proposal, you would have to have 75 percent \nor more of your gross revenues from professional services. This does \nnot apply to the manufacturer or the merchant. It is lawyers, \naccountants, lobbyists, and similarly positioned individuals. And it is \nfurther restricted to only those who earn more than $250,000 filing \njointly. So this is not the struggling underpaid professional. These \nare people who are doing reasonably well in this very complicated and \ncompetitive society.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, in 2009 about 15 \npercent of all S corporations were service businesses as defined in \nthis bill. Yet this small subset is responsible for billions of dollars \nin lost revenue to Medicare and Social Security.\n  In a 2009 report, the Government Accountability Office found that in \nthe 2003 and 2004 tax years, individuals used this loophole to \nunderreport over $23 billion in wage income.\n  This is a loophole that should be closed. I hope my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle will take a serious look at it and join us in \nsupporting this bill.\n  We have 54 days to prevent the interest rate from doubling on \nsubsidized student loans. We have no time to waste.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in a little over a half an hour we will \nhave a vote on whether we are even going to proceed to the bill that \nwill keep interest rates on our subsidized Stafford loans at 3.4 \npercent for the next year or whether they will go up double on July 1.\n  This is just a vote on going to the bill. For the life of me, I \ncannot understand why the Republicans do not even want to go to the \nbill. Well, perhaps they are afraid if the vote really comes down to \nthe bill itself and the, quote, offset, that maybe some of my friends \non the other side of the aisle will think that students may be a little \nbit more important than a few wealthy people in this country who are \nnot paying their fair share of taxes. But they are going to hide behind \nthis motion to proceed. So that is what the vote is at noon. Are we \ngoing to even go to the bill so we can debate it, offer amendments, \nvote it up or down? Republicans do not even want to go there. They do \nnot even want to proceed to the bill.\n  They have clouded it up in a lot of rhetoric about offsets and how we \nare going to pay for this. It comes down to a choice. We have a serious \noffer, a serious offer, a serious offset, one which is widely \nrecognized as a terrible loophole. By closing that loophole--which \naffects a microcosm of individuals in this country--we are able to pay \nfor keeping the interest rate at 3.4 percent for another year.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle say, well, they want to \nkeep the 3.4-percent interest rate, but they want to pay for it by \neliminating--eliminating--killing the Prevention and Public Health Fund \nthat goes to help make sure our kids do not get diabetes, to make sure \nwe fight obesity, that we cut down on smoking in this country, that we \nmake sure kids get their vaccinations--all the things that go to save \nus money in health care. That is the prevention fund. They want to take \nthat money away from there. They want to end that program. That is \ntheir offset.\n  Well, if that is what they want, fine. But let's get to the bill. If \nthey want to offer that as an offset, fine, we will vote on it. But \nthey do not even want to go to the bill. Their priorities are not the \nstudents. Their priorities are protecting a small class of individuals \nin this country who use the Tax Code to avoid paying their fair share \nof Social Security and Medicare taxes.\n  We have heard all about: job creators, job creators; oh, we Democrats \nare going after these job creators. Well, the offset we have only \naffects subchapter S corporations, and only subchapter S corporations \nthat have three or less stockholders--three or less. These are usually \nfamily members. They do not create any jobs--three or less. If you have \nfive or ten or more, you are not covered by this; only if you have \nthree or less, and only--only--if you have more than $250,000 a year in \nincome. It is very narrowly drawn, very narrowly drawn. But the Joint \nTax Committee scores this saying that over 10 years, by closing this \nloophole, we put $6 billion into the Medicare trust fund and $3 billion \ninto the Social\n\n[[Page S2942]]\n\nSecurity trust fund. So there is $9 billion there of money where people \nusing this loophole--a few people using this loophole--are able to \nescape paying their share of Medicare and Social Security taxes.\n  We are saying, let's close that loophole. Let's use those savings, \nput them into the Medicare and Social Security trust funds. Under the \nscoring system here, any revenue that is raised or mandatory cuts go to \noffset any increases in mandatory spending. Well, that is kind of \nbudget jargon around this place. All it means is, by closing this \nloophole, we are able to do two important things: one, put more money \ninto the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, and keep the \ninterest rate for students at 3.4 percent for another year. Not a bad \ndeal. I think a very good deal. But my friends on the other side are \nnot going to go there. They want to kill the Prevention and Public \nHealth Fund.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor at this time and reserve \nthe remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I can understand the Senator from \nIowa's concern about the reduction of the prevention and public health \nfund, which he put in the health care bill. I know he has a \nlongstanding interest in that subject.\n  But let's be clear about this. It is not just Republicans who think \nthat fund isn't the best use of taxpayer money; it is almost all the \nDemocrats on that side of the aisle. In February, the Middle Class Tax \nRelief and Job Creation Act was passed. It was voted on in the Senate, \nand every Democrat except six voted to take $5 billion out of the \nprevention and public health fund we are talking about to pay for it. \nIt is not only the Democrats on that side who have supported taking \nfrom the fund, it is the President of the United States.\n  President Obama, in his Fiscal Year 2013 budget proposal, proposed \ntaking $4 billion away from the fund, and then in his 2011 deficit \nreduction package, he proposed taking $3.5 billion from the fund. So it \nis a bipartisan proposal. We are a government that is borrowing 40 \ncents of every $1 we spend. If we are going to spend some money, we \nhave to save some money, at the very least.\n  What we are proposing on the Republican side is the same goal the \nDemocrats have, the same goal that both President Obama and Governor \nRomney have, which is to take this 3.4-percent interest rate for new \nsubsidized loans, for 40 percent of students who take out loans, and \nextend it at that rate for another year, while we also take a look at \nwhat the long-term prospects could be. We agree on that. We agree that \n3.4 percent ought to continue to be the rate on new loans for another \nyear. The President agrees. Governor Romney agrees.\n  We don't agree with Senator Reid's proposal on how to pay for it. We \nhave suggested paying for it by reducing spending in the health care \nlaw and reducing it in a way that all but six Democratic Senators have \nsupported or at least from the fund they have supported reducing before \nand from the fund the President has supported reducing before.\n  Why are we suggesting saving from the health care law? There is a \nreason for that. It is because those who passed the health care law are \novercharging students on student loans in order to help pay for it. \nHere is why I say that. The government is borrowing money, according to \nthe CBO and the way it scores student loan spending today, at 2.8 \npercent and loaning it to students at 6.8 percent. The truth is, that \n6.8 percent is a pretty good interest rate for a student who is maybe \nunemployed today. My colleague from Tennessee, Senator Corker, was here \ntalking about that earlier. There might be other ways of looking at \nthis spending differently. But the way the Congressional Budget Office \nscores this spending today, it says the government is borrowing money \nat 2.8 percent and loaning it at 6.8 percent and that the government is \nmaking, in effect, a profit--that is my word--because the CBO says that \nbased on the amount of money the government is receiving from the \nstudent loans, it makes a profit or a savings of $61 billion over 10 \nyears.\n  What did our friends on the other side do with that $61 billion? The \nSenator from Iowa very carefully explained that yesterday. They spent \nit--all except $10 billion, which they used for deficit reduction. They \ncould not keep their hands off it. They spent $8.7 billion of that \nexcess money from student loans to help pay for the health care law.\n  We are saying that if we are looking for money to keep the interest \nrate at 3.4 percent, if we are trying to help students, why don't we \ngive back to the students the money we are taking from them to pay for \nthe health care law. We are overcharging students, according to the way \nthe CBO looks at the loans, by $8.7 billion to help pay for the health \ncare law. We propose in our bill to freeze the rate at 3.4 percent, \ngive the students back the money we are overcharging them, and use the \nexcess money--over $6 billion--to reduce the deficit, which we need to \ndo at a time when we are borrowing 40 cents of every $1 we spend.\n  That is what the Interest Rate Reduction Act I have proposed does. It \nfreezes it at 3.4 percent and gives back to students the money the \ngovernment is overcharging them on student loans to pay for it. That is \nthe same bill the House of Representatives passed. If we can get a vote \non that here and pass it in the Senate, we can send it to the \nPresident, and he could go around the country saying he has worked with \nthe Congress and has produced a way to help students save money.\n  The President needs to also say a couple more things. It is not much \nmoney--$7 a month on average student loans. But this is the political \nseason, and students need to be aware of that. I have talked about \ntuition going up and student loans going up. But if we do what we have \nagreed we should do, what the House has already voted to do, and freeze \nthis interest rate on 40 percent of new student loans at 3.4 percent \nfor 1 year, it saves the average student on the average loan $7 a \nmonth. That is for 10 years. It adds up eventually to $830, but it is \n$7 a month. We should talk about the rest of the story too.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair. The rest of the story is about why \ntuition is going up. As a result, why are loans going up? There are \nseveral reasons. The main reason, which every college president and \nevery Governor knows--and the Presiding Officer who was the Governor of \nWest Virginia--college tuition is rising at public universities and \ncommunity colleges across the country, where three out of four of our \nstudents go, is because of Federal Medicaid mandates on States that are \nsoaking up dollars that would otherwise go to the University of West \nVirginia, the University of Tennessee, the University of Iowa, and \nother public institutions. Every college President knows that and every \nGovernor knows that. That didn't just start 3 years ago. That was going \non when I was Governor 25 or 30 years ago. I even came to Washington \nand said to President Reagan: You take all of Medicaid and we will take \nall of kindergarten through the 12th grade education. We want out of \nthis situation every year of having to use State dollars to fund one-\nthird or whatever you think we ought to be paying for Medicaid.\n  If we had made that swap 30 years ago, if the Federal Government had \ntaken over all of Medicaid and the States had taken over all of \nkindergarten through the 12th grade education, the States would have \ncome out about $4.5 billion ahead. If we made it today, if the Federal \nGovernment took all of Medicaid and the States took all of elementary \nand secondary education, the States would have $92 billion extra to \nspend. Where would it go?\n\n  I know that a lot of it would go to education--maybe most of it--\nespecially to higher education and to public universities. The reason \nstudents are fasting and striking in California, when tuition is going \nup, is because California has reduced spending to its public \nuniversities by $1 billion since 2008. What the students don't seem to \nknow is that the reason California has had to reduce spending to its \npublic universities is because Washington has insisted that California, \nTennessee, West\n\n[[Page S2943]]\n\nVirginia, Iowa, and every other State increase their share of spending \non Medicaid, and that soaks up the money that would otherwise go to \npublic universities and community colleges.\n  In my own State, last year, Medicaid spending was up 16 percent and \nhigher education spending was down 15 percent. What was the result? Up \nwent tuition 8 percent and up went student loans. So it is a good \nthing, I suppose, that Democrats and Republicans and Governor Romney \nand President Obama have all agreed that for 1 year we want to freeze \nthe rate on new subsidized Stafford student loans at 3.4 percent and \nsave the average students who get those new loans $7 a month.\n  What students and families who are struggling to pay for college need \nto know is that until we repeal this health care law or until we repeal \nthese Medicaid mandates on States, those college tuition rates will be \ngoing through the roof. The Kaiser Family Foundation says States, which \nnow spend about 1 out of every 4 State tax dollars on Medicaid, will \nsee a 29-percent increase on average in the next year as the health \ncare law goes into effect. Where do you suppose that 29 percent \nincrease will come from? It will come from the State budgets. The \nGovernor will sit there and choose primarily between spending for \ncommunity colleges and universities. More of it will go to Medicaid and \nless to community colleges and universities. So their quality will go \ndown and their tuition will go up. The students will be fasting in \nCalifornia and they will be thinking it is their legislators in \nCalifornia who are the problem, while it is really the legislators in \nWashington, DC who are the problem because they are the ones imposing \nthe Medicaid mandates on states.\n  I have tried to be fair in saying this problem is not an invention of \nPresident Obama's and of the new health care law; this has been a trend \nfor 25 or 30 years. But President Obama and the new health care law \nhave made this problem worse. This debate, while it may save students \n$7 a month in interest payments and while we think the fairest way to \ndo it is to take the money we are overcharging them and give it back to \nthem, this debate at least highlights the issue I hope I hear the \nPresident and Governor Romney talk about this fall, which is about who \nis responsible for rising college tuition and student loan debt.\n  I believe the main person and main group responsible are those who \ninsist on continuing Medicaid mandates on States that soak up the \ndollars that should be going to public colleges and universities.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the rest of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes. The other side has 9 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I always enjoy engaging in good debate \nwith my friend from Tennessee. He is a very thoughtful Senator, a very \nthoughtful member of our Committee too, and a good friend. Having been \na former Secretary of Education, he has a depth and wellspring of \nknowledge about education, and I respect that greatly.\n  We obviously see things a little bit differently, but that is the \nnature of the animal here. I say to my friend that without getting into \na point-by-point rebuttal, I wish to make it clear the President did \nput in his budget taking some money out of the prevention fund. I \nassume my friend knows I was not much in favor of that proposal. Then \nit was used later on to extend the unemployment insurance and also the \npayroll tax cut until the end of this year. That money was used for \nthat. I was not very supportive of that. I thought we should have taken \nthe money from elsewhere. At least the President has said that is it, \nno more. We will take a nick out of that prevention fund but no more. \nThat is why he issued a statement of administration policy saying he \nwould veto this bill if it had any cuts to the Prevention and Public \nHealth Fund.\n  I used the analogy a while ago that the cut the President proposed, \nwhich was supported on our side, to extend the payroll tax cuts to the \nend of the year, I likened that to taking a couple pints of blood--we \ncan take a couple pints of blood and still get our health back and go \non. The proposal of my friend from Tennessee takes all our blood or all \nthe prevention fund money. When we do that, we are dead. That is the \nanalogy I have used. They took a couple pints of blood, which I was \nopposed to, but the prevention fund is still alive and healthy and is \ndoing its job. It is going to do even more of its job in the future, as \nlong as we don't take any more money out of it, and the President has \nsaid he will not do that.\n  I wanted to make that clear. That happened one time; no more. Even \nthough Senators supported it on our side--and there were people who \nsupported that on our side--they have said no more; we are not taking \nmore out of that fund.\n  Lastly, I cannot help but also talk about this $61 billion the \nSenator from Tennessee keeps talking about. As I said yesterday, he is \nright in one way; that we did spend it. The question is, What did we \nspend it on? Well, as I said, $36 billion went to increased Pell \ngrants. I don't think my friend from Tennessee would want to cut Pell \ngrants. I think he is a pretty good supporter of Pell grants. That is \nwhere $36 billion of that went. And $750 million went to the College \nAccess Challenge Grant Program, $2.55 billion went to historically \nBlack colleges and universities, and $2 billion went for community \ncolleges. So my friend may be right. Maybe we could reduce those \ninterest rates a little bit. But what that money is being used for is \nbasically students.\n\n  Now, I will be honest about this. Ten billion dollars went for \ndecreasing the deficit. I don't think my friend from Tennessee would be \nopposed to that. And $9.2 billion went to other health care programs, \nincluding requiring dependent coverage in the health care bill. In \nother words, how many students now are covered under their parents' \npolicies until they are age 26? They didn't have that before. Now they \nhave it. So some of this money was used to invest in that or community \nhealth care centers. Yes, we did do that by providing some of the money \nfrom that--$9.2 billion of that--for some specific types of items in \nthat health care bill.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, I just have to ask a question. Are we having a \nhealth care debate here or an education debate? I thought we were \ntalking about education. We are talking about whether student loan \ninterest rates on subsidized Stafford loans are going to double on July \n1. Now it has morphed into some kind of big health care debate.\n  I have heard it said that the other side wants to keep the interest \nrates at 3.4-percent for a year. OK, fine. The question is, How do we \npay for it? That is really the question. We have offered in good faith, \nI believe, a serious proposal: closing the loophole that affects a very \nsmall sliver of people in this country who are using this sort of a fog \nsurrounding Subchapter S corporations to escape paying their fair share \nof Medicare and Social Security taxes.\n  Yesterday, someone on the other side said: Well, we can audit them. \nWe can do IRS audits.\n  The IRS only audits one-half of 1 percent of subchapter S corporation \nfilings. So if there is kind of a fog out there and I get to decide as \na taxpayer, as a subchapter S corporation, whether I get paid or \nwhether it is dividends, what am I going to say? Dividends. Because my \nodds are 95.5 percent that they are never going to audit me--95.5 \npercent. Those are pretty good odds.\n  That is why the Joint Tax Committee said that by closing this \nloophole--by closing this loophole--we save over $9 billion, put into \nthe Social Security fund and Medicare fund, and at the same time be \nable to keep the interest rate for students at 3.4 percent. That is a \nserious offer. The offer from the other side is not serious. They want \nto kill the prevention fund. That is not serious at all, but that is \nwhere they are coming from.\n  Well, I say let's have a vote. Let's at least move the bill. That is \nwhat the vote is at noon, is moving the bill, getting it out there so \nwe can have a debate on the bill and how we pay for it. Obviously, my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle don't even want to bring up the \nbill. They do not want to bring it up. They are going to vote against \ncloture, against bringing up the bill to even discuss it and vote on \nit.\n  Mr. President, I will close by urging all Senators to support the \ncloture motion so that we can get to the bill and\n\n[[Page S2944]]\n\nstudents and their families will know that we are serious about this \nand that on July 1 their interest rates are not going to double on our \nmiddle-class families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments and the \ncourtesies of the chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor \nand Pensions, and I recognize his leadership and his interest in these \nsubjects.\n  The Senator asked the question: who connected health care to student \nloans? It was the Democrats who connected health care to student loans. \nThink about this. Here we were debating a new health care law a few \nyears ago, and what happened? The Democrats--the majority--said: While \nwe are at it, while we are supposedly fixing health care, we are going \nto take over the entire student loan program. We are going to take \nArnie Duncan, who is a terrific Secretary of Education, and we are \ngoing to make him banker of the year, banker of the century, and we \nwill put him in charge of making more than $100 billion in new loans \nevery year to students all over America.\n  So as a part of the health care law, they got rid of the student loan \nprogram, most of which was handled by people you would expect to be \nmaking loans--that is, banks--and put it all in the government. They \ndid that on the theory that the banks were making too much money.\n  It reminds me of people who think that if it can be found in the \nYellow Pages, the government ought to be doing it. Autos, student \nloans--just put it all in the government.\n  So if we are going to do that, if we are going to connect the two, \nstudent loans and banks--and then the Congressional Budget Office comes \nalong and says: Well, OK, if the government takes over the student loan \nprogram, it will save $61 billion, that $61 billion ought to go to the \nstudents who are getting the loans. That is my view. That is our view. \nAnd the Congressional Budget Office estimates that if we applied that \n$61 billion savings to student loans, we could have reduced the \ninterest rates to about 5.3 percent and save the average student $2,200 \nover 10 years.\n  So it wasn't anybody on this side of the aisle who suggested during \nthe health care debate that we ought to suddenly say: While we are at \nit, let's take over the student loan program.\n  All we are saying today is this: We agree with President Obama, we \nagree with Governor Romney, and we agree with the House of \nRepresentatives that the interest rate for new subsidized Stafford \nstudent loans should stay at 3.4 percent for the next 12 months. That \nwill save the average student about $7 a month in interest payments. \nThe only difference we have is how we propose to pay for it. The \nDemocrats want to raise taxes on people and small businesses who are \ncreating jobs while we are still in the midst of the greatest recession \nsince the Great Depression. We say that since the government is \nborrowing money at 2.8 percent and loaning it to students at 6.8 \npercent and since the Congressional Budget Office said there was a \nsavings of $61 billion when the Federal Government took over the \nstudent loan program and that $8.7 billion of the savings went to pay \nfor the health care law, we ought to take the money the government is \novercharging students and use it to pay for keeping this rate lower for \nanother year. That is what we Republicans are saying and is where we \nhave a difference in opinion with the other side.\n  So I hope my colleagues will vote no on the motion to proceed. We \nhave a different proposal that we believe is superior and is the same \nas the one that passed the House. We would like a chance to offer the \nInterest Rate Reduction Act and give the students the benefit of our \nproposal, which will give the overcharged money back to them. We would \nlike to have a vote on that.\n  Therefore, I recommend that we keep the rate at 3.4 percent; that we \nuse the money we recognize as the savings we are taking from students, \nby overcharging them for student loans, as the best way to pay for it. \nHopefully, the majority leader will allow us to consider the Interest \nRate Reduction Act that we have proposed.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise to express deep disappointment in \nthe\n\n[[Page S2945]]\n\nvote that just took place a few hours ago where our Republican \ncolleagues voted to filibuster our efforts to make sure student loans \nin this country do not double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent in July.\n  I think everybody understands that young people in our country today, \nin the midst of this terrible recession, are facing extraordinary \nchallenges. They are paying three to four times as much as their \nparents paid for a college education regardless of whether they attend \na private or public college. When they receive their diplomas, they \nhave no guarantee, given the state of the economy today, that they are \ngoing to be able to get a job and earn the income to pay off those \ndebts.\n  Given the challenges college students are facing today, the least we \ncan do is to keep student loan interest rates at a low rate for another \nyear. The interest rate on subsidized Stafford loans has been steadily \nreduced since Congress passed the College Cost Reduction and Access Act \nof 2007. But if Congress does nothing, interest rates on subsidized \nStafford loans are set to double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent on \nJuly 1, 2012.\n  When we talk about Stafford loans, we are talking about loans for \nstudents from low- and moderate-income backgrounds. Subsidized Stafford \nloans are need based and targeted to students who otherwise might not \nbe able to attend college. Nearly one-third of undergraduates have \nbenefited from these low-interest Federal loans. If the interest rate \ndoubles this year, the rate hike will impact up to 9 million students, \nand we must not allow that to happen.\n  Among the students who will be impacted are 19,000 young people from \nthe State of Vermont. In my State nearly 70 percent of college \ngraduates are carrying student loan debt--70 percent. On average that \ndebt is $30,000, which puts Vermont at the sixth highest student loan \ndebt load in the country.\n  Everybody understands that in order to get ahead in the economy \ntoday, it is very important that one has a college degree. The cost of \ncollege education is soaring. In the State of Vermont--and I have \ntalked to many of these young people in my State and throughout this \ncountry--students are leaving college deeply in debt. Nineteen thousand \nstudents in the State of Vermont are on Stafford loans. If interest \nrates double from 3.4 to 6.8 percent, it will make their current \nsituations, which are very difficult, much worse.\n  So I hope our Republican colleagues will end their filibuster. I hope \nwe can get back to work as soon as possible in passing a bill which \nwill maintain Stafford loan rates at 3.4 percent.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the time from 2:15 until \n5:15 be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their \ndesignees and that all quorum calls during that period also be equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before I speak about the details of the \nimpact of not helping students in this difficult economic climate with \nstudent loans that they can afford, I wish to say that I was stunned \nthat my Republican friends refused to give us a vote to proceed to the \nissue.\n  I think every student in America should turn their focus on this \nChamber because the Republican Party made it impossible for us to lower \nthe student loan rates today. They made it impossible. This is going to \nmean thousands of dollars over the life of a student's loans. So while \nthe Republicans are calling for major tax cuts for billionaires and \nmillionaires of $100,000, $200,000 a year in cuts, they don't have the \nheart to help middle-class students get a break on their interest rates \nfor higher education. I find it appalling.\n  If anyone wants to know the difference between the parties, start \nwith this. Whom do we fight for when we are here? We all say we are for \nthe next generation. We all have the speeches--oh, they are terrific; \nthey are beautiful--each party. But when push comes to shove, who is \nvoting to help our students get an interest rate they can afford so \nthey are not shackled to a high interest rate at a time of historic low \ninterest rates? Democrats are on their side. All we have to do is look \nat the vote today if nothing else. One does not have to understand any \nmore than the Republicans blocked us from debating the importance of \nlowering interest on student loans.\n  So I will be back to put in the record individual stories from my \nconstituents. But let's wake up, America. Parents, wake up. Students, \nwake up. The Democrats proved today that we are on your side. The \nRepublicans proved they are not. Period. That vote says it all. It is \nnot complicated. They will make it complicated. They will talk about \nprocedure and this and that. The bottom line is the bottom line. The \nRepublicans voted not to allow us to vote on ways and methods to lower \ninterest rates for our students. So don't be fooled. We will hear \nspeeches on why they voted no, and they will come up with things. The \nbottom line is they wouldn't even let us debate this issue. I am \nstunned. I assumed we would be on this bill.\n  So when Americans look at the Senate floor and don't see much \nactivity except for a few of us coming to speak, and they thought today \nwas the day we were going to vote to lower interest rates on student \nloans, wake up to reality. It is called a filibuster. We were stopped \nby the Republicans once again, just as they have stopped us time and \ntime again. They come to the floor with every reason one can imagine.\n  We have news. We have two independent scholars who wrote a very \nimportant paper. They are nonpartisan. What they said in this paper is \nthat they used to think it was both sides that were stopping progress. \nNow we know it is one side. It is the Republican side. Today is yet \nanother example. I hope everyone within the sound of my voice--and we \nwill hear stories about what is happening, and I hope people will write \nus all and e-mail us with their stories and tell us what it means to \nthem to have to spend thousands more unnecessarily on student loans. \nGive us the stories. Let us tell the stories.\n  I hope Americans will send us those stories, and I hope we will send \na message to those who voted to filibuster this very important \nlegislation today that they are not on the side of the American people. \nThey are not on the side of working families. They are not on the side \nof the middle class. They are not on the side of economic progress. \nThey are not on the side of economic growth.\n  I thank the President for the time, and I yield the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Wow. That was interesting. I remember \nwhen the Senator who just spoke before me, before we left for our \ndistrict work period, was praising the Republicans for working with \nher--one Republican specifically--and about how appreciative she was \nfor working together and taking the time in a bipartisan manner to move \nforward on a very important piece of legislation that she was \nspearheading. We didn't filibuster that. We didn't filibuster the \npostal bill or the Violence Against Women Act or the crowdfunding bill \nor the insider trading bill. But all of a sudden we are filibustering \nnow.\n  The bottom line is we want to have the opportunity to have an \nalternative proposal and to have a full and fair debate. I think the \nAmerican people are smart. I know the American people are smarter than \nthat.\n  I stand before my colleagues today to reference that most students \nand parents know in July the fixed interest rates on subsidized \ngovernment student loans are set to double. That was very eloquently \npointed out just now. But let's be clear. The vast majority of the \nMembers of this body want to prevent that from happening. I think that \nis a no-brainer.\n  Unfortunately, today we voted on a bill that is not bipartisan. It is \nvery clear it is not bipartisan to raise taxes on subchapter S \ncorporations, which are the people who are doing some of the very \nserious job creation in this country. It is not going to pass the\n\n[[Page S2946]]\n\nHouse, and it is not going to pass muster with the American people. It \nwas not negotiated in good faith, and it has no chance of passing in \nthe House of Representatives, as I said.\n  Once again, we are preparing for an unnecessary political battle. \nThat is kind of what happens. We have a rough spot with a political \nbattle, then we do two or three things that are good. Then we get stuck \nagain, and then we do two or three things that are really good. It is \nunnecessary. We need to work in good faith and negotiate a compromise \ninstead.\n  A 100-percent Democratic bill isn't going to pass, I say to my \ncolleagues. A 100-percent Republican bill isn't going to pass. It needs \nto be a bipartisan, bicameral bill that the President will sign. That \nis how we passed some of the most important pieces of legislation \ndealing with ethics on the insider trading bill that I was proud to \nsponsor with Senator Gillibrand in a bipartisan manner. We got it \nthrough and out of this Chamber and passed and signed by the President \nin record time.\n  We just passed the postal bill, the Violence Against Women Act, the \ncrowdfunding, the jobs package. We need to work in the same manner on \nthis matter.\n  With so many recent graduates unemployed or underemployed, Members of \nCongress need to work together to keep the interest rates where they \nare currently. Rather than wasting time trying to blame the other side, \nlet's try to build some bridges as we did before we left--or I thought \nwe had done. I was looking forward to coming back after the week off \nand getting right back at it and working on important things such as \ncybersecurity and the student loan issue.\n  So let's allow people of good faith to figure out how to solve these \nvery real problems. That is why today, as I have referenced to many of \nmy colleagues in our weekly caucuses and through e-mail, I am offering \na bill that would extend the 3.4-percent rate for another year, without \nraising taxes, as is being proposed, or cutting sacred programs, which \nis also being proposed.\n  My bill, the Subsidized Stafford Loan Reduced Interest Rate Extension \nAct, would extend the subsidized rate for a year. To pay for it, I \nsuggest using a noncontroversial option: reducing Federal improper \npayments.\n  We have all heard about the amazing amount of waste that goes on just \nby paying people who are dead who should not be getting their payments \nand also paying other entities that have either already been paid or \nare being improperly paid. It is millions and--sorry, billions and \nbillions of dollars.\n  The bill establishes a governmentwide ``Do Not Pay List,'' and \nrequires new audit pilot programs across Federal agencies to provide \nmore tools to battle back and make sure we can recapture those moneys.\n  Let me give a few examples of the improper payments so the folks up \nthere in the gallery listening and those who are watching on TV can \nkind of reference it. These are payments I hear about working as the \nranking member of the Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management--a \ncommittee where Senator Carper and I have been diligently working in a \nbipartisan manner, once again, to try to solve problems.\n  Medicaid, which is the primary source of health coverage for over 50 \nmillion Americans, made an estimated $21.9 billion of our tax dollars \nin improper payments in 2011. The Federal-State Unemployment Insurance \nprograms made an estimated $13.7 billion in improper payments in 2011.\n  SSI made an estimated $4.6 billion in improper payments in 2011.\n  I think, if I am not mistaken, we are looking for $6 billion to pay \nfor this student loan extension. I just referenced almost $38 billion, \n$39 billion. We need $6 billion. That is it.\n  We spend over $1 billion in payments that are sent to dead people, as \nI said. Mr. President, $1 billion we pay. Can you believe that? We pay \n$1 billion to people who are dead. There are billions in payments that \nare sent to the wrong recipient, billions in incorrect amounts sent to \nthe right recipients, and billions in payments where documentation is \nmissing and where the recipient is not using the funds for the intended \npurpose.\n  All we have to do is be marginally successful--just marginally \nsuccessful--to recover the $6 billion we need to pay for this very \nimportant student loan program. When government is so wasteful, raising \ntaxes should not always be the first thing we look at.\n  How about reestablishing the trust with the American taxpayers--the \npeople who are listening in the gallery and on TV. Why is it every \nsingle time we are going to raise taxes on one particular group or \nanother? This time we are going after the small business owners, the \nsubchapter S corporation owners.\n  I am not saying my bill is the only answer. But it does provide a \nneutral starting point for both sides to come together in a truly \nbipartisan manner, as we have done before, to find a solution with \nwhich we can all live. I am willing to work with my colleagues, and I \nam willing to consider all options that will allow us to move forward. \nIf we fail to act, we will burden our students who are going to college \nwith an extra $1,000 in student loan interest--just because we could \nnot find a compromise. Pretty simple.\n  The student loan situation, as we are all discussing and has been \ndiscussed throughout this country through various media outlets and the \nlike--and they are focusing more and more and more on this issue, which \nI think is critical--we need to start a national conversation about \naddressing the primary issue affecting families with kids in college: \nthe cost of annual tuition, room and board.\n  Between 2000 and 2010, the cost of tuition, room and board rose 36 \npercent, and that is after adjusting for inflation. That means students \nare now paying one-third more for the same education they would have \ngotten 10 years ago. Looking at previous decades shows a similar trend: \nFrom 1990 to 2000, the increase was 26 percent; from 1980 to 1990, it \nwas 37 percent.\n  Why are students paying so much more for the same education? As we \nknow, it is a huge problem for families.\n  While tuition is skyrocketing, there is still a total lack of \ntransparency when it comes to schools' financial decisions. If the \nrecent reports of outrageous administrator and faculty compensation \npackages are any indication, it would seem students and parents--\nstudents and parents--are funding administrators' and faculty members' \nmillion-dollar salaries.\n  Instead of being surprised by every new expose of outrageous pay \npackages, I propose increasing transparency by requiring schools to \npost their financial disclosures online, right in front, right on their \nWeb sites, so everyone can see them. This would not be hard to do. In \nfact, the IRS already requires nonprofit institutions of higher \neducation to file the IRS Form 990 yearly, which includes disclosure of \nthe compensation packages for the highest paid employees. It also \nprovides a financial snapshot of schools' finances and also how schools \nchoose to spend tuition dollars.\n  Making the information available so easily online will increase \ntransparency and allow students and parents and the general public to \ncheck the schools' spending decisions--way before they make headline \nnews. On the outrageous pay issues, sunlight may help begin to solve \nthe spending problem associated with the high cost of education.\n  No one disputes the importance of a college education, but we are \nsetting our students up for failure by giving them above-market student \nloans and not requiring our schools to be transparent about their \nfinancial operations.\n  So my suggestion is, let's work together. Let's not fail our \nstudents. It is time we finally focused the Federal Government on how \nwe can set our students up for success instead of failure.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, here we are with an empty Senate Chamber, \nwhile families across the country are wondering whether they are going \nto have to come up with more money to pay higher interest rates on \nstudent loans beginning July 1. It is going to happen unless we take \naction.\n\n[[Page S2947]]\n\n  We have tried to take action, but, frankly, my friends on the other \nside, the Republicans, won't even let us go to the bill. We had our \nvote almost 3 hours ago. We recessed for our party conferences, as we \ndo every Tuesday. Here we sit, without being able to even proceed to \nthe bill because the Republicans voted against closing down debate and \nmoving to the bill and offering amendments and having an up-or-down \nvote.\n  The pattern is all too familiar, as we know, over the last few years: \nmore and more filibusters, more and more cloture motions to end the \ndebate. It is unfair to families and students all over America.\n  Here I address my comments to students. They are the ones who are \ntrying to get a higher education, because they know that is the \npathway, the gateway to middle-class America. Young people today know \nthat the jobs of the future will require a higher education. They \nunderstand that. So many are scrambling to put together resources to \npay for college. We had a young woman this morning, Clarise McCants, \nwho spoke with us. She is the first in her family to go to college. She \nis from Philadelphia, and she goes to Howard University. She comes from \na very poor background and a poor family. She relies on Pell grants, a \nwork-study program, and summer work jobs, plus her subsidized loans. If \nI am not mistaken, she has somewhere in the neighborhood of $13,000 or \n$15,000 right now in debt. The last thing Clarise McCants needs is to \nhave an additional $1,000 a year put on her student loan interest. That \nis what will happen on July 1, unless we act here. It is unfair to her \nand to millions of students all over the country that we sit here and \ndo nothing, while they wonder whether they are going to have to pay \nmore in interest charges on July 1. It is unfair.\n  We have on our side a solid proposal to keep the interest rates down \nfor the next year at 3.4 percent, where they are now, rather than \nhaving them double to 6.8 percent. To do that, to pay for it, we have \nproposed that we close a glaring loophole in the Tax Code that applies \nonly to subchapter S corporations. A lot of people say, what does that \ngobbledygook mean? A subchapter S corporation is for very small \ncorporations. Compared to the giant corporations you normally think of, \nthey are very small. Within that small universe of subchapter S \ncorporations, as they are called, there is even a smaller universe. \nThat small universe is comprised of professionals such as lawyers and \naccountants, people who give advice and do their own work, and they \nform a small corporation.\n  Because of the fog that surrounds whether someone is paid a salary or \nis paid from dividends, many people who form these subchapter S \ncorporations are not paying their fair share of Social Security and \nMedicare taxes. We have proposed that we draw a bright line so that \npeople know whether they are getting paid a salary or wages, or whether \nit is coming out of dividends. The Joint Tax Committee says this will \nraise for us $9 billion over the next several years. That is enough to \nhelp us pay for keeping the interest rates low. Our proposal is three \nthings: closing the tax loophole, it puts more money into the Medicare \nand Social Security trust funds, and third, it helps us keep interest \nrates low for students in this country.\n  You would think that would be a no-brainer. I think most people would \nsay that is kind of a no-brainer. But our friends on the Republican \nside refuse to let us even bring the bill up for debate and a vote. My \nRepublican friends have suggested a different way of paying for this. \nThey want to protect those few people in the subchapter S \ncorporations--very wealthy people--from paying those taxes. They have \nsuggested--the Republicans--that instead we take all the money to pay \nfor keeping interest rates low out of the Prevention and Public Health \nTrust Fund--it is known as the prevention fund--which is in the \nAffordable Care Act. Again, that would drain all the money out. It \nwould completely eliminate the program.\n  I suggest that people look at today's headline in USA Today this \nmorning. It says that 42 percent of the adult population by 2030 is \nexpected to be obese. Out of that, one out of four will be severely \nobese. The same report was also in the Washington Post this morning. \nThe study predicts that 42 percent of Americans will be obese by 2030, \nwhich will shorten life, and they will incur large medical expenses. In \nfact, if obesity stays at its current level and doesn't increase, the \nsavings and projected health care costs will be considerable--about \n$550 billion, $\\1/2\\ trillion. That is what the prevention fund is \ndoing. It is out there working every day--it has only been in existence \na couple years now--putting things in place to prevent people from \nbeing obese, to prevent kids from getting the adult onset of diabetes \nat 10, 11, and 12 years of age. In 1980, only 15 percent of Americans \nwere obese. Today, it is about 34 percent.\n  What if we had in place in the 1980s, 1990s, and in the last decade \nthe prevention fund that we have, which does all of the things \nnecessary to help people make healthy choices and lead healthy lives \nand not become obese? Think of the savings we would have in our health \ncare system today if we had a prevention fund like that in 1980, and \nrather than having 34 percent obese people in America today, we had 15 \nor 16 percent. Well, projecting that forward to 2030, if we don't act \nnow, 42 percent will be obese. Again, it will cost us $550 billion in \nthe next 20 years.\n  Preventing this, which we know we can do--we have evidence-based \nproof that certain interventions and programs work. Not only does it \nkeep obesity down, but diabetes and heart disease, and related \nillnesses will be lessened, thus saving us even more money. The \nprevention fund is what the Republicans want to kill, eliminate. I \nthink that is disappointing and disturbing, after all that we know and \nhave seen in the past on prevention and public health and what we can \ndo to prevent illness, obesity, and diabetes in children, to say we are \nnot going to put the resources forward to prevent that.\n\n  We know that for every dollar we invest in prevention, we are reaping \nanywhere from $3 to $10, or more, in the first couple years. Here we \nare at an impasse again. Once again, the Senate is at an impasse \nbecause we cannot move to a bill. We can't amend it, vote on it, or \ndebate it--other than talking about it right now as I am doing. The \nRepublicans refuse to let us even get to the bill.\n  We will continue to tell the American people what is at stake here \nand what the differences are. These are policy differences. The \nAmerican people should know what those policy differences are. The \nRepublicans say they want to keep the student interest rate at 3.4 \npercent. We say we do, too. Well, OK, what is the difference? The \npolicy difference is in how we pay for it, how we pay to make sure we \nkeep the interest rates low.\n  I think the logical thing would be to have the bill come to the \nSenate floor and offer amendments. If the Republicans want to offer an \namendment to take the money out of the prevention fund and kill and \neliminate the fund, let them do it, and we will vote on it; we will see \nif we have the votes to do that. They can debate it if they want, and \nwe will be glad to debate and discuss closing this tax loophole on \nsubchapter S corporations. I think that would be a healthy debate and a \npolicy difference that the American people should see, and they can \ndecide between the two sources of how we are going to pay for this.\n  We are going to continue to talk about this because I think the \nAmerican people should know what is at stake here in this filibuster \nthat we have in front of us right now. I know my friends on the other \nside say that President Obama wanted to take some money out of the \nprevention fund. Well, that did happen, in order to extend for 1 year \nthe unemployment insurance provisions and also the payroll tax cut this \nyear. They seem to think that since we have already taken some money \nout of the prevention fund, we can kill the whole thing.\n  My analogy this morning was that it is one thing to take a couple \npints of blood, but it is another to take all your blood. So they took \nsome nicks out of the prevention fund, which I didn't support, but the \nfund is still healthy, alive, and doing its job. It could do more if it \nhad more money. Nonetheless, it is still there doing its job.\n  The Republicans are saying drain all the blood out and kill the whole \nthing. I don't think the American people want to go there. It seems to \nme that it doesn't make common sense that we\n\n[[Page S2948]]\n\nwould pit the health of the American people--and women's health \nespecially, children's health, and the elderly, who are benefitting \nright now from this prevention fund. There are immunizations, childhood \ncheckups, and provisions that go out into communities for healthier \nliving in our communities. There is better nutrition for our kids in \nschools, fresh fruits and vegetables, and more physical activity. That \nis all in the prevention fund. That is what they want to do away with. \nIt is too bad that they are trying to pit the health of women and \nchildren and the future against students. That is not right.\n  As I have said many times--and keep saying--I have heard from the \nother side that we are going after job creators. If we raise the taxes, \nyou see, on subchapter S corporations--if we close that loophole, we \nare hurting job creators. First of all, the provisions in our bill on \nsubchapter S only affect a corporation with three or fewer \nstockholders--hardly job creators. I mean, if somebody wants to start a \ncorporation with 5, 10, 15, 20, that is different. This doesn't touch \nthem. It only touches someone who has less than three shareholders, if \ntheir income is over $250,000 a year as a joint filer, and if they are \na subchapter S corporation.\n\n  Some say: Well, you know, they can get audited. I had an example I \nused the other day of a person who was claiming he didn't have to pay \nSocial Security and Medicare taxes because he wasn't a subchapter S \ncorporation. The individual was pretty ingenious. He had set up a \nsubchapter S corporation, and he contributed--donated--his time.\n  In exchange he got dividend payments--profits--from this subchapter \nS, as did his wife and his child. There were three--he, his wife, and \nchild, and he did not pay Social Security taxes. Well, he happened to \nget audited, and the Justice Department took him to court, to Tax \nCourt, and the Tax Court found out he really was being paid. He was \nmaking a salary, an income, and he had to pay Social Security taxes on \nthat.\n  Well, when I used that example, my friends on the Republican side \nsaid: Well, that is just it. All we have to do is just audit them, and \nwe don't have to close this loophole. I had to point out that only \\1/\n2\\ of 1 percent of all filings of subchapter S corporations are ever \naudited. So if someone is out there and there is not a bright line as \nto whether they are salaried or are getting dividends--it is kind of a \nfog out there--why wouldn't they err on the side of saying: I don't \nhave to pay those taxes because the odds are 99.5 to 1 they will never \nget audited. Those are pretty good odds--99.5 percent of the time no \none is ever audited. If they are audited, they get a slap on the wrist, \npay a little fine, and move on.\n  So what our bill does is to provide certainty. It provides certainty \nto subchapter S corporations that if they fall on this side of the \nline, they are salaried, if they have less than three shareholders. If \nthey fall on the other side, they can get dividends, and that way they \ndon't have to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes. Quite frankly, I \nthink that would be in the best interest of everyone, including the \nsubchapter S corporations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe article that appeared in the Washington Post this morning by David \nBrown--the study that predicts 42 percent of Americans will be obese in \n2030.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From The Washington Post, May 7, 2012]\n\n      Study Predicts 42 Percent of Americans Will Be Obese in 2030\n\n                            (By David Brown)\n\n       In 2030, 42 percent of American adults will be obese, and \n     about one-quarter of that group will be severely obese, a \n     condition that shortens life and incurs large medical \n     expenses, a new study predicts.\n       This view into the future is less ominous than one \n     published four years ago that predicted that 51 percent of \n     the population would be obese in 2030. Nevertheless, the \n     trend fortells a huge drag on the health and economic welfare \n     of the United States.\n       ``If we don't do anything, this is going to really hinder \n     any efforts to contain future health-care costs,'' Justin G. \n     Trogdon, an economist and one of the authors of the \n     projection, told experts Monday at the start of the two-day \n     ``Weight of the Nation'' conference in Washington.\n       However, if obesity stays at its current prevalence--34 \n     percent of adults--and does not increase, the savings in \n     projected health-care costs will be considerable, about $550 \n     billion, the authors said. The most recent evidence, in fact, \n     suggests that obesity rates are plateauing.\n       ``Regardless which is correct, we still have a very serious \n     problem,'' William H. Dietz, head of the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention's obesity program, said of the \n     scenarios.\n       Obesity related ailments--diabetes, heart disease, kidney \n     failure--consume at least 9 percent of health-care spending \n     in the United States. Some researchers believe the cost may \n     be twice that estimate. Total health spending is about $2.6 \n     trillion a year.\n       The new study, published in the American Journal of \n     Preventive Medicine, used obesity prevalence data from 1990 \n     through 2008 to extrapolate future trends. The information \n     came from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a \n     federally funded telephone survey. People underestimate their \n     weight when asked on the phone; that fact was compensated for \n     in the mathematical model.\n       The researchers also incorporated variables, measured in \n     each state, that affect obesity rates. These included the \n     price of gasoline, which discourages walking when it is low; \n     access to the Internet (and other technologies), which \n     encourages sedentary behavior as it increases; and \n     restaurants per 10,000 people, which increases eating out and \n     weight gain when the number goes up.\n       In 2030, 42 percent of people are projected to be obese, \n     and 11 percent severely obese. Obesity is a body mass index \n     (BMI) of 30 or more, which is 186 pounds for someone 5 feet, \n     6 inches tall. Severe obesity is a BMI of 40 or more--248 \n     pounds for someone that height.\n       Cynthia L. Ogden, an epidemiologist at the CDC, told the \n     conference that, in general, obesity rates changed little in \n     the 1960s and 1970s, rose steeply in the 1980s and 1990s, and \n     have been leveling off in the past decade.\n       For men, obesity prevalence doubled but has changed little \n     in the past eight years, with no difference between blacks, \n     whites and Mexican Americans (which are the three groups for \n     which there are good data). For white women, the obesity \n     prevalence has not changed in 12 years. It has risen slightly \n     in black women and Mexican American women, although that \n     increase mostly occurred early in that 12-year period.\n       There are some exceptions to this general picture of \n     stability.\n       Obesity is rising in higher-income men. Severe obesity is \n     increasing in both sexes. It was 6.2 percent in women in 1999 \n     and 8.1 percent in 2010. For men, it was 3.1 percent in 1999 \n     and 4.4 percent in 2010.\n       Eric A. Finkelstein, a researcher at Duke University who \n     led the new study, said that just in the past 50 years has it \n     been possible for millions of people to be both sufficiently \n     inactive and to have access to enough food to become severely \n     obese.\n       ``The world has changed in ways that allow people to be \n     that overweight,'' he said.\n       The reason for the plateauing of the obesity prevalence is \n     uncertain. It almost certainly reflects many factors, \n     including an approach to a natural limit of the epidemic and \n     the success of efforts to fight it by encouraging exercise \n     and educating people about better eating habits.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I hope the Republicans will talk among \nthemselves. I hope they will listen to the students and their families \nwho don't want to be hung out there this week and next week and on and \non and on not knowing whether they are going to have to pay higher \ninterest rates on their student loans. Let's have cloture. Let's bring \nup the bill, and then let's vote on it. If they have amendments, fine, \nwe will vote on them. But at least let's move the bill.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       EPA Rules and Regulations\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I would like to spend a little time \ntoday talking about what has become known across the country as the \nObama economy. This administration, after nearly 4 years, has failed to \nget this country and to get our economy moving again. Even worse, as I \nlook at it, this administration seems to be taking steps that appear to \nbe methodically and deliberately sabotaging certain parts of our \nNation's economy. They are doing this in sectors of the economy that, \napparently, to me, they just don't like. And they are doing it by \nissuing thousands and thousands of pages of redtape on the very people \nin this country who have successfully created jobs for Americans in the \npast.\n\n[[Page S2949]]\n\n  This administration has finalized 1,330 rules that have been deemed \neconomically significant. They have proposed over 1,300 additional \neconomically significant rules. So what does this mean, the words \n``economically significant''? Well, those are rules that have an annual \nimpact on the economy of $100 million or more.\n  Fifty-seven coal-fired powerplants have already announced their \nclosure because of the cumulative effect of these rules on just this \none industry. The EPA is proposing regulations on whole sectors of the \neconomy, whether it is issuing new storm water regulations for existing \nbuildings to requiring costly Clean Water Act permits. They are doing \nthis for ditches on family farms.\n  Thousands of American jobs have already been lost, and others are on \nthe chopping block due to these rules. These are not new laws that have \nbeen passed but are rules coming from this administration. Each time \nthe EPA claims the benefits of the rules vastly outweigh the costs. The \ncosts are real in terms of real dollars to the economy, but the \nbenefits are unknown. The administration claims the benefits are in so-\ncalled ``saved future health care costs.'' That is how they define it, \n``saved future health care costs.''\n  The EPA and this administration have a history of understating the \ncosts and of overstating, in my opinion, the benefits. The EPA's math \non the benefits and the costs of their rules is not even close to being \naccurate. This has been verified in testimony before the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, on which I serve as a member.\n  The EPA rules that set new burdensome limits on emission of \npollutants, such as carbon dioxide, mercury, and sulfur dioxide, can \nhave serious costs to plants and factories that then have to update \ntheir facilities with costly equipment or simply close to be under the \nnew standard, and these are new standards--not the old standards but \nnew standards.\n  Those reductions yield few quantifiable benefits to the economy. That \nis not me saying that, it is the EPA's own models. They admit the \nreductions yield very few quantifiable benefits to the economy. The \ncosts are usually significant to the businesses in terms of actual \nexpenses, as well as to the public in terms of people looking for jobs \nand in terms of jobs that are lost.\n  The EPA knows no one would buy into their rules with such high \npricetags. So in order to inflate the so-called ``benefits'' of their \nrules, the EPA says: As a result of having less emissions from plants \nand factories, there must also be reductions in particulate matter, or \ndust, at the same time. They then make the inaccurate conclusion that \nreductions in dust will somehow yield billions of dollars in health \nbenefits because folks will have healthier lungs and visit the doctor \nfewer times.\n  These reductions in dust are often in areas where the dust level \ntoday is already well within public health safety standards that are \nset by the EPA. So the folks aren't actually getting sick in those \nareas anyway. So if people aren't already getting sick in the areas \nwhere the EPA is trying to regulate the air, then how is it they can \nclaim they are going to save billions of dollars in fewer visits to the \nhospital by reducing dust levels even further than today's safe levels?\n  What we know now is the EPA is cooking the books. At the same time, \nthey are missing the real public health threat they, themselves, the \nEPA, is making worse; that is, the public health threat from high \nunemployment. I recently released a report entitled ``Red Tape Making \nAmericans Sick--A New Report on the Health Impacts of High \nUnemployment.'' Let me repeat that: ``Red Tape Making Americans Sick--A \nNew Report on the Health Impacts of High Unemployment. Studies Show EPA \nRules Cost Americans Their Jobs and Their Health.''\n  This is a report submitted by the Subcommittee on Clean Air and \nNuclear Safety by the minority subcommittee staff.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Key \nFindings and Recommendations and the Executive Summary of this report.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Red Tape Making Americans Sick--A New Report on the Health Impacts of \n                           High Unemployment\n\n\n   Studies Show EPA Rules Cost Americans Their Jobs and Their Health\n\n       Minority Subcommittee Staff Report; Subcommittee on Clean \n     Air and Nuclear Safety--Senator John Barrasso, M.D., Ranking \n     Member, March 2012.\n\n   EPA Red Tape Increases Unemployment While Worsening Public Health\n\n\n                    Key Findings and Recommendations\n\n       Congressional testimony and scientific research reveals \n     that unemployment from Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \n     regulations: increases the likelihood of hospital visits, \n     illnesses, and premature deaths in communities due to \n     joblessness; raises healthcare costs, raising questions about \n     the claimed health savings of EPA's regulations; hurts \n     children's health and family well-being.\n       EPA claims of health benefits from current and future Clean \n     Air Act regulations are misleading and incomplete. The agency \n     must adequately examine the negative health implications of \n     unemployment into their cost-benefit analysis before making \n     health benefit claims to the public and Congress.\n       The Full Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and \n     the Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety should \n     conduct additional hearings to responsibly investigate the \n     health implications of higher unemployment as a result of \n     federal regulations.\n\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       President Obama's Administration continues to claim that \n     new EPA Clean Air Act regulations for ozone, greenhouse \n     gases, electric utilities, domestic oil and gas producers, \n     and manufacturers deliver significant economic benefits. \n     Specifically, the agency says that these regulations will \n     yield billions of dollars in benefits for the U.S. economy in \n     the form of fewer premature deaths, sick days, hospital \n     visits, cases of bronchitis, and heart attacks.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, this is a comprehensive report, and it \ncontains expert testimony before the Senate Environment and Public \nWorks Committee from the best scientific medical research, from \ninstitutions such as Johns Hopkins, Yale University, and others. This \nkey medical research and testimony on the impact of unemployment on \npublic health is irrefutable.\n  The report concludes that high unemployment increases the likelihood \nof hospital visits, illnesses, and of premature death in communities. \nThat is high unemployment; high unemployment raises health care costs, \nraising further questions about the claimed health savings of the EPA's \nregulations. High unemployment also hurts children's health and family \nwell-being.\n  On June 15, 2011, Dr. Harvey Brenner of Johns Hopkins University \ntestified before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. \nHere is what he said:\n\n       The unemployment rate is well established as a risk factor \n     for elevated illness and mortality rates in epidemiological \n     studies performed since the early 1980s.\n\n  So this has been a well-known fact now for over 30 years. Continuing \nthe quote:\n\n       In addition to influences on mental disorder, suicide and \n     alcohol abuse and alcoholism, unemployment is also an \n     important risk factor in cardiovascular disease and overall \n     decreases in life expectancy.\n\n  I speak as a physician, someone who has practiced medicine in \nWyoming, taking care of Wyoming families for a quarter of a century, \nand I can assure you this is perfectly in keeping with my experience in \nmy years of practicing medicine.\n  Yale researcher Dr. William T. Gallo's paper on the impact of late-\ncareer job loss reports:\n\n       Results suggest that the true costs of late career \n     unemployment exceed financial deprivation, and include \n     substantial health consequences.\n\n  ``Substantial health consequences.'' He goes on to say:\n\n       Physicians who treat individuals who lose jobs as they near \n     retirement should consider the loss of employment a potential \n     risk factor for adverse vascular health changes.\n\n  What does that mean? Well, it means a stroke, high blood pressure, or \nheart disease. These are all major killers, major things that result in \ndisability and long-term health problems, increasing the cost of care.\n  Let's look now at the impact of joblessness on children. The National \nCenter for Health Statistics concluded:\n\n       Children in poor families were four times as likely to be \n     in fair or poor health as children in families that were not \n     poor.\n\n\n[[Page S2950]]\n\n\n  I have seen firsthand how economic challenges affect Americans' \nhealth and their quality of life. In my medical opinion, this country \nfaces a worsening health threat from unemployment, with well over 30 \nmonths of unemployment rates over 8 percent.\n  I have urged the EPA to seriously consider the impacts of these rules \nand the new rules they continue to come out with and how they have a \nbad impact on families--on pregnant women, on children, on the elderly. \nThe EPA has not looked at the serious health impacts their rules result \nin. The EPA continues to hide behind computer models--not real people--\nthat churn out inflated, fictitious so-called ``benefits of health.''\n  The time to get serious about public health is now. In fact, there \nwas a USA Today article published Monday of last week, and I brought a \ncopy along because it was very disturbing. On the front page of USA \nToday, Monday, April 30, 2012, the police are tying domestic violence \nto the economy. The headline reads: ``Domestic violence rises in \nsluggish economy, police report.'' The article states:\n\n       Police are encountering more domestic violence related to \n     the sluggish economy, a national survey of law enforcement \n     agencies finds.\n  These are law enforcement agencies across the country, their national \nsurvey. The article quotes Camden, NJ, police chief Scott Thompson, who \nstated it is ``impossible'' to separate the economy from the domestic \nturmoil in the city where unemployment is 19 percent. Camden police \nchief Scott Thompson went on to say:\n\n       When stresses in the home increase because of unemployment \n     and other hardships, domestic violence increases. We see it \n     on the street.\n\n  So these types of reports of increased domestic violence due to \nunemployment are not just being reported in Camden, NJ.\n  The article cites Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Washington-\nbased law enforcement think tank, who expressed serious concerns with \nthe rising violence. He said:\n\n       You are dealing with households in which people have lost \n     jobs or are in fear of losing their jobs. This is an added \n     stress that can push people to the breaking point.\n\n  I agree. It is certainly what I saw as well in my days of medical \ntraining and medical practice.\n  The health crisis from unemployment under this administration is \ngetting worse.\n  On May 4, 2012, the Christian Science Monitor, in their article on \nthe unemployment rate, said:\n\n       While the economy added 115,000 net jobs in April, some \n     350,000 Americans gave up looking for work.\n\n  So for every one new job that was added, three people gave up looking \nfor work. That has the effect of reducing the unemployment rate \nbecause, by the Federal Government's way of calculating it, those \npeople no longer count as part of the labor force. As a result, the \nshare of Americans who are part of the labor force--either working or \nactively looking for work--has reached a 30-year low. You can add those \nnumbers and look at those and say ``350,000 people'' and put that to \nthe list of folks who are now at risk for serious health impacts due to \nthe Obama economy.\n  If we want to make Americans healthy, we need to get Americans back \nto work. We need to get the EPA out of the business of making folks \nunemployed across this country. Each new job is a job that will put \nfood on the table for struggling families and help keep medical costs \nunder control. New jobs will keep thousands of Americans out of the \ndoctor's office and on the playground. Creating jobs will keep those \nnearing retirement from paying for more prescription drugs so they can \nspend more time and money on their grandchildren. Creating jobs will \nensure that the next generation will be healthier than the last.\n  Let's work together to improve public health by reducing this \nadministration's redtape that is putting so many Americans out of work. \nThe health and happiness of the American people depends upon it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Export-Import Bank\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I wish to make a few comments about free \nmarkets, free enterprise, and the role of government, particularly as \nit relates to the Export-Import Bank.\n  When people ask me if I am pro-business or pro-labor, I say I am \nneither. I am pro-freedom. Freedom is the only political principle that \ncannot be bent to serve special interests. Remember how 7-Up used to \ncall itself the un-cola? Well, freedom is the un-special interest.\n  Freedom, protected by the Constitution and the rule of law, works for \neveryone. It allows everyone--left or right, young or old, rich or \npoor--to make their own choices according to their own values.\n  Government's job shouldn't be to tilt the field for one team or \nanother but to guarantee a level playing field for everyone. That is \nwhy I am against forcing workers to join unions. I am against \ncongressional earmarks for favored groups, government bailouts for Wall \nStreet, and energy subsidies, both for oil companies and for green \nenergy companies.\n  Let's look at recent events surrounding the Boeing Company, one of \nSouth Carolina's most important employers. As a South Carolinian, as an \nAmerican, and as a guy who likes cool airplanes, I love Boeing. When \nBoeing's home State labor union ganged up with President Barack Obama's \nNational Labor Relations Board to try to sue Boeing for building a new \nfactory in north Charleston, I strongly supported Boeing's freedom to \nbuild factories wherever they please. More recently, dust has been \nkicked up over the extension of the Export-Import Bank, a Federal \nprogram that subsidizes American businesses' exports. Because Boeing \nreceives export-import subsidies and because I favor winding down the \nEx-Im Bank instead of increasing its budget, some asked if I went from \nbeing pro-Boeing to anti-Boeing. Neither. I am just being pro-freedom.\n  In both cases, my guiding principle is the same: liberty. Freedom \nisn't perfect, but it is fair. And any time government hands out \nfavors, they are being unfair to someone. When Washington picks winners \nand losers, in the end taxpayers always lose, and the Ex-Im Bank is no \nexception. The Ex-Im Bank started out decades ago with a lending cap of \n$5 million to help American companies sell into a global economy that \nbarely existed. Today, the cap has ballooned to $100 billion in a \nbooming global economy. And what have the American people gotten for \ntheir money? They have gotten $10 million in loans benefiting the now \nbankrupt Solyndra, millions of dollars in loans to another solar \ncompany to sell solar panels to itself in another country, and $600 \nmillion in loans to Enron projects before Ken Lay went to prison--all \nthis after Ex-Im has already sought its own $3 billion taxpayer \nbailout.\n  This isn't a criticism of an agency or an administration but of \ngovernment subsidies in the first place. When government stays out of \nmarkets, businesses focus on their customers; quality improves, prices \nfall, and everyone wins. When government steps in, businesses turn \ntheir attention from their customers to their Congressmen and hire \ninfluence peddlers instead of innovators. Competition sags, the pace of \ninnovation slows, prices rise, and product quality suffers.\n  Defenders say the Ex-Im Bank is needed because Europe subsidizes \ntheir exports, but Europe says the same about our Export-Import Bank. \nWe are in a bidding war with other countries for the biggest subsidies. \nStill, exporters say the cost of doing business in America is too high \nto compete. I agree. We have the highest corporate tax rate in the \nworld, so let's cut taxes. Let's reform our insane $1.75 trillion per \nyear regulatory state. Let's reform education and liberate our children \nfrom failing schools and create a better prepared workforce for the \nfuture. Let's repeal the government takeover of health care and put an \nend to predatory lawsuits filed against innocent businesses. In short, \nlet's fix the rules of our game to make all of our exports competitive \nrather than rigging them for one company or product at a time.\n\n[[Page S2951]]\n\n  Our policies should make the United States the best place in the \nworld to buy, sell, farm, manufacture, patent, invent, invest, \ninnovate, and educate--for everyone in every industry.\n  Look at what today's ad hoc economic policymaking has done to \nAmerica--where a collection of narrow special interests vies for the \nfavoritism of discredited politicians while we mount unsustainable debt \nonto the backs of our children and grandchildren. That is what I am \nagainst. What I am for is a level playing field, a set of clear rules \nthat guarantee the freedom of entrepreneurs to make and sell what they \nwant, and the freedom of customers to buy what they want.\n  I am not for big business or big labor. I am for big freedom for \neveryone.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise to address the motion to proceed \nwe are currently debating. Essentially, this is a motion to proceed to \na bill that would sustain the 3.4-percent interest rate on Stafford \nstudent loans.\n  Earlier, we had a vote to attempt to conclude the debate over whether \nwe should get to the bill. That has to have a supermajority of 60 under \nthe rules of the Senate and we didn't have that supermajority. My \ncolleagues across the aisle voted against debating whether to sustain \nthe 3.4 percent on student loans or, to put it differently, they voted \nto block this effort and preserve the 6.8 percent as the rate we will \ngo to shortly if we don't address this legislation.\n  I certainly think students at every institution in Oregon would be \nappalled the Senate isn't willing to hold a debate over the doubling of \nthe cost of student loans. This has a tremendously powerful impact on \nthe affordability of education across America. We are at a point in the \nhistory of the world where our nations are interconnected. We have a \nglobal knowledge economy. The nations that prepare their children well \nnot only will have the best future for those individual children, but \nthey will have the best economy down the road.\n  What is the impact of doubling the cost of student loans? Certainly, \nfor many students it means they will not complete their education. They \nare facing diminished job prospects, they are facing expensive tuition, \nand there are only so many part-time jobs they can take while still \nattempting to complete their coursework. At some point they will say \nthe burden is too heavy--the debt burden is too heavy--the hurdles are \ntoo high. Then we all lose. Our children will lose the opportunity to \nfulfill their potential to pursue their dreams and our economy loses \nbecause we are not the best prepared around the world.\n  Indeed, today, across America we are becoming the first generation of \nparents whose children are getting less education than we got. I would \nlike to see that debated on the floor of the Senate. I would like to \nhear a Senator stand and say they are proud of the fact that America is \nfailing its children. I would like to hear that defended because I \ncertainly have a different view. I have a view that in terms of the \nopportunity for our children and the success of our economy, we have to \naddress the issue of the affordability of college tuition.\n  The folks who can capture this issue the best are students \nthemselves, so I have come to the floor to read a letter from one of \nthe students in my home State who is making the case that we should \ndebate this issue, that we should address affordable college. Here is \nwhat he has to say:\n\n       Senator Jeff Merkley, my name is Mario Parker-Milligan. I'm \n     the student body president at Lane Community College in \n     Eugene, Oregon. My job as president gives me many \n     opportunities to discuss issues that students find important \n     to them and often I find myself lobbying or advocating for \n     issues that don't directly affect me. Today that is \n     different.\n       Today, I find myself seeing a federal and statewide \n     disinvestment in higher education institutions across the \n     nation and dramatically here in Oregon. At the same time, \n     more and more students are needing need-based aid while it \n     too is being diminished. Students are graduating from college \n     but our debt loads are increasing and we are finding fewer \n     jobs upon graduation. With all of these other barriers--low \n     federal and state investment pricing students out of tuition, \n     low financial aid leads to high student debt, and few jobs \n     upon graduation--the prospect of having Stafford Loans' \n     interest rates doubling is a haunting thought. Students are \n     continuing to pay more and get less for our education.\n       Today, the average student is graduating with twenty-five \n     thousand dollars of loan debt. I have over eighteen thousand \n     dollars of loan debt today. An interest rate of six point \n     eight percent on top of thousands of dollars we owe in this \n     economy doesn't seem smart either. I am not close to being \n     done with my education and am fearful to continue to take out \n     loans when I think of how long it will take to pay it back. \n     Students rely heavily on student loans in order to complete \n     college in a timely manner, otherwise many of us are forced \n     to work 2 3 jobs while attempting to go to college full time, \n     which usually results in prolonged stays and more debt.\n       As a member of the board of directors for both the Oregon \n     Student Association (OSA) and the United States Student \n     Association (USSA), both associations working to break down \n     barriers to higher education, I hear stories of students that \n     are having to choose whether or not they put food on the \n     table or keep lights on at home. Affordability is a leading \n     barrier to a quality education and raising interest rates \n     will only continue to price students out of an education. \n     Please vote to maintain the Stafford Loan interest rates at \n     3.4%. Don't Double Our Debt. Sincerely, Mario Parker-\n     Milligan--of Eugene, OR.\n\n  I think Mario does voice the concerns of hundreds of thousands of \nstudents across America who are working hard to complete their \ncoursework to pursue their dream--to gain the skills to provide both a \npurpose in life, a life mission, if you will, and a stable financial \nfoundation. The prospect of coming out of college with debts that come \nclose to a mortgage on a home is indeed daunting.\n  I must say, I view this through the lens of my own experience as a \nchild of a working family. My father was a millwright and then a \nmechanic, and no one in my family had ever gone to college. I was the \nfirst, and the prospect of debt was a consideration that worried my \nfamily with this unfamiliar course that I was undertaking. I feel very \nfortunate that in the end the combination of work-study, affordable \nloans, and scholarship meant that I graduated from my undergraduate \neducation without the heavy debt burden--a very modest burden--not the \nvery heavy burden students are bearing today. That indeed gave me the \nrange of options to pursue in life that I might not have had if I had \nto immediately find a job that would help me pay back those very high \nloans that students are facing. And those are the students who complete \ntheir education. So many more will find that they only make it partway \nthrough because the debt becomes too high. So I am disturbed--very \ndisturbed--that the Senate body, once known as the world's greatest \ndeliberative body, voted today not to debate this issue, not to take it \nup.\n  My colleagues may be voicing their concern about the specific aspects \nof the bill. I would say to them that they should come to the floor and \noffer amendments and we should debate those amendments. But let's not \nfail the students of America. I believe the majority leader has \nreserved the right for reconsideration, and that in a matter of a few \ndays we might well have another vote on this topic. I would ask my \ncolleagues to reconsider, to end their filibuster aimed at preventing \nus from keeping the 3.4-percent interest on Stafford loans--that they \nwould reconsider and say, yes, there is a responsibility to debate this \nissue.\n  It shouldn't just be on Stafford loans in that we also certainly have \na big challenge maintaining Pell grants and keeping those grants \ncompetitive with the rising tuition. We should debate other strategies \nabout how to make our investment in higher education more efficient. \nMaybe all those debates don't have to happen on this bill; maybe this \nbill should be restricted to Stafford loans. But for this body to \nreject the notion of debating an issue central to the success of our \nuniversity students, the success of our children, and the success of \nour economy is just wrong. Let's change that vote. Let's get on to this \nbill in due course in a short amount of time.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S2952]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I am speaking today on the need to Stop \nthe Student Loan Interest Rate Hike Act of 2012.\n  It is obvious how hard it is to pay for college these days. It is not \njust hard for poor people--and we have some programs that help poor \npeople out at the Federal level, Pell grants in particular, and that is \na good thing. But you can be making well above the Pell grant allowance \nlevel, well above the income that you need for a Pell grant, and have a \ndifficult time paying for college.\n  College is extremely expensive. The average private college cost a \nyear is over $30,000, and the average public cost has gone way up. With \nall the cutbacks at all the Federal, State, and local levels, it is \nabout $17,000. If you figure that if you are an average family anywhere \nin America making $65,000 or $70,000, $17,000 a year after you pay your \ntaxes and pay your mortgage and pay for the necessities of life is a \nheck of a lot of money. Wisely, the Federal Government has provided \nsome loans. A few years ago, under the leadership of Senator Kennedy, \nwe decided to have the Federal Government pay for those loans because \nwhen the banks did it, it ended up being far more expensive than it had \nto be. Those loans were originally 6.8 percent around when the banks \ndid it. They went down and down, and they settled to a nice level of \n3.4 percent.\n  Now 3.4 percent is still interest. Particularly these days it is not \nsuch a low rate of interest given that the cost of money is quite low, \nbut it is a lot better than 6.8 percent. But, unfortunately, the law \nthat Senator Kennedy shepherded and many of us voted for and President \nBush signed--I believe it was in 2007--expires come July 1.\n  What will that mean? That will mean millions of students throughout \nAmerica will pay a lot more interest on the loans that are a necessity \nfor going to college.\n  We all know how important college is. We all know these days the \nstatistics show that the unemployment rate among college grads is one-\nthird that of high school grads. We know that at your income level, you \nmake thousands of dollars more each year if you have a college degree. \nThere was a recent study that even showed you live longer if you got to \ncollege. I don't know what the correlation was, but it was a broad-\nbased study. It was trumpeted in many of our leading newspapers. So a \ncollege degree is very important, and one of the ways we measure \nAmerica versus other countries in terms of our future is what is the \npercentage of our kids who get a college degree. Unfortunately, that \nhas been declining. We used to be first. Now I don't think we are even \ntenth, and it is declining because of the cost of college. So a high \ninterest rate on top of the basic cost--$17,000, $36,000, whatever--is \nbad for students, bad for their families, and, frankly, bad for \nAmerica.\n  In New York, my State, 423,000 college students would pay $341 \nmillion more in loan payments if we didn't pass this legislation.\n  I would say one other thing, and that is that this affects almost all \ncollege students. You say, Well, I started college last year and I am \nat 3.4. You are at 3.4 for your freshman year if you are a freshman in \ncollege. But when you go to your sophomore year and renew your loans \nJuly 1, you are going right up to 6.8 percent. So it affects everybody \nin college except--luckily for them--the senior class that is \ngraduating this year.\n  It will also affect the new class of freshmen who are coming in, and \nI would bet many of them are watching this debate and deciding whether \nthey can go to college or they can go to the college of their choice--\none that they deserve to go to because of their grades and record and \naccomplishments--based on this bill. And so, wisely, Senator Jack Reed \nand Senator Tom Harkin and Senator Sherrod Brown have put in \nlegislation that would keep the rate at 3.4 percent.\n  When they first did this--and President Obama has been fully \nsupportive and he has talked about this at length on campuses \nthroughout America and in other places throughout America. When they \nput it in, amazingly enough most of our Republican colleagues, in \nplaces such as the Club for Growth and American Enterprise Institute, \nsaid: We are against it. Let the students pay 6.8 percent. That was \nsort of the 21st century analog of Marie Antoinette saying, Let them \neat cake, because in these days college is much more of a necessity \nthan it ever used to be, even for jobs like machine welder or auto \nmechanic. These days, our cars are filled with computers and you often \nneed some college education, at least a 2-year college education, to be \nproficient in skills that maybe 40 years ago you just needed a wrench \nfor. So it was amazing to me that so many of our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle said they were against keeping the rate at 3.4 \npercent.\n  They began to get a lot of flak, I am sure, from families across the \ncountry. So they decided they couldn't be against it, per se, and so in \nthe House they actually--and the President was making a lot of hay with \nthis and scoring a lot of points. So over in the House they then \ndecided, Okay, we can't say we are against this. Of course, we all want \nto pay for it, and so we will propose a bill that pays for it by \ncutting preventive services in health care.\n  There are two points about that. One, our preventive services in \nhealth care are needed, whether it is child immunization, whether it is \ndiabetes prevention--the fastest growing disease around--whether it is \nmammograms which wouldn't start this year but would start next year as \na result of the prevention money--prevention is vital to keeping health \ncare costs down and keeping America healthy. To say the only way we \nwill give you student loans is to take away preventive health care is \nakin to telling a family: Your little grandson cannot get immunizations \nif you want your children to be able to pay for their college. It does \nnot make sense and everyone knew it.\n\n  The second point is everyone knew it at the time. I don't think there \nwas a person in this town who thought that paying for it by cutting \nprevention would have a chance in this body. But, frankly, I think that \nis what some of my colleagues in the other body wanted. Their MO for \nthe last year and a half has been obstruct without fingerprints. In \nother words, they want to obstruct everything. They want the government \nto be a mess. They want people to be unhappy so they will change things \nin the election.\n  But they know, if they are caught obstructing, it is not going to \nwork out too well for them. In the first half of this year, I have to \ngive them credit, they carried out this strategy of obstruction without \nfingerprints quite well. Part of it is because the media likes to say \n``on the one hand, on the other hand.'' There is a very good article, \ntangential to this, by Norm Ornstein at the American Enterprise \nInstitute and Thomas Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings \nInstitution, one from a conservative group and one a more liberal \ngroup, which basically laid this out.\n  In the second half of the last year and now this year their little \nstrategy of obstructing without fingerprints is not working. It didn't \nwork on the debt ceiling. It didn't work on the payroll tax cut. It \ndidn't work on the highway bill. It didn't work on the postal bill, \nand, ``gloriosky,'' we are passing legislation because they can no \nlonger obstruct without fingerprints. Faced with the choice of being \ncaught obstructing or not obstructing, they stopped obstructing. Good \nfor America. Good for bipartisanship. If it was good for them on the \nother side, fine.\n  On this one, they are back to their old ways because they put in this \npay-for they know cannot pass. What was the pay-for we put in? We \nthought it would pass. We thought it had bipartisan support. It was one \nof the things considered in various groups in committees, bipartisan, \non how to pay for the deficit. I think this was considered in the \nAugust group of last year.\n  What we say is simply this. If you are a partnership--a big law firm, \naccounting firm--there are some of them, a small number, not most, most \ndid it the right way, but they want to avoid the payroll tax. How do \nthey do it? They say we are giving our partners\n\n[[Page S2953]]\n\ndividends as opposed to salaries, and they do not pay a payroll tax, \nthe payroll tax we all pay up to the first hundred-and-some-odd \nthousand dollars of salary.\n  That seems reasonable and fair. It was a loophole. It was called a \nloophole when John Edwards was caught doing it in his law firm, by Rush \nLimbaugh, by others as well--many conservatives. They called it a \nloophole that ought to be closed. I wish I had the language.\n  I will ask unanimous consent to add to the Record the language of \nseveral leading conservative commentators and gurus about what a \nloophole this was.\n  Anyway, we put this in and we thought they would accept it. Of \ncourse, to our surprise last night not a single Republican voted to \nmove forward and debate this bill. We will let them put their pay-for \non the floor to substitute for ours. They are not even willing to do \nthat. Leader Reid said this over and over. I just heard him say it at \n2:15 when we had a little gathering by the Ohio Clock.\n  We are here on the floor tonight, and I see the Senator from Ohio and \nthe Senator from Maryland--we are here on the floor tonight to ask \nfamilies and students throughout America to let their Senators know \nthey want this legislation passed and they want the games to stop.\n  On my Facebook page, and on the Facebook page of many of my \ncolleagues, is a description of the bill, of what people need to do. We \nask people to send us, on our Facebook pages, their stories--why they \nneed it, why it is so important to them. Senator Jeff Merkley already \nread a letter from a student from Oregon. Senator Stabenow got over 70 \nresponses already of students from Michigan. We also hope they let our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle know how important it is they \nvote for this bill.\n  The bottom line is simple. This should be a no-brainer. If there were \never an example of Washington tying itself in a knot, this is the \nissue. If our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have other pay-\nfors, we will take a look at them--but make them real. Make them truly \nsubject to bipartisan compromise as opposed to something they know we \ncannot accept.\n  I heard the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Brown, introduced \nsomething, but the CBO scored it as not bringing in any money. We have \nall agreed we should not increase the deficit to do this and we should \nfind a way to pay for it. Our preferred way is closing a loophole that \neveryone admits is abusive and a way to get around the payroll tax. But \nwe are willing to sit and listen to other suggestions from the other \nside of the aisle so we can help our college students.\n  The bottom line is we have to pass this bill. It is an extremely \nimportant bill for the future of our country because every time a young \nman or a young woman deserves to go to a college of their choice and \ndoesn't go, goes to a different one that less suits their needs because \nthey cannot afford it, they lose, their family loses, and America \nloses. Let's stop the games. Let's come together. Let's pass this bill, \nand let's make sure students of this and future generations are able to \nafford the college education that is so important to a better future \nfor their lives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I ask unanimous consent the time from 5:15 to 7 \np.m. be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their \ndesignees and that all quorum calls during that period also be equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I wish to follow up on Senator \nSchumer's call to action, if you will, because it appears that things \nthat used to be bipartisan, whether it was the debt ceiling or the \nTransportation bill or a whole host of other things, has become far too \npartisan. Back in 2007, the Republican President and Democrats in the \nHouse and Senate and Republicans in the House and Senate--but \nDemocratic majorities--froze interest rates for college loans, \nsubsidized Stafford student loans at 3.4 percent for 5 years. All we \nwant to do is we want to continue this. We want to continue it by \nclosing a tax loophole. One political party that does not seem very \nenthusiastic about freezing these rates anyway seems to be standing in \nthe way. I think the only way this is going to change is if students \nall over the country come and tell their stories.\n  They can come to my Web site, tell their stories about school \nfinancing and how difficult it has been for them. They can come to \nbrown.senate.gov/collegeloanstories and tell us their stories.\n\n  This past week, I have been to a community college in Cleveland and I \nhave been to Ohio State University in Columbus, Wright State University \nnear Dayton, and the University of Cincinnati and heard many of these \nstories. I invite students around Ohio--we are asking for them to tell \ntheir personal stories. I think, in the end, personal stories will \nconvince my colleagues they should not make this partisan. They should \nnot stand in the way. They should work with us so we can freeze this \nstudent loan interest rate at 3.4 percent because I think it will \nmatter.\n  In my State--and I know the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the State \nof the Presiding Officer, is not much different than that--the average \n4-year student in Ohio who graduates has a $27,000 accumulated debt for \ntheir 4 years of college. That means those students will have more \ndifficulty--probably will not be able to buy a home or probably will \nhave to delay it, delay getting married or starting a business. I think \nit is very immoral for us to pile more debt on top of what they already \nhave. If we want to build a prosperous society the way we did with the \nGI bill--the GI bill provided individual opportunity for millions of \nstudents in the 1940s and 1950s, young men and women returning from the \nwar, and it not only helped those millions of students but lifted the \ncountry as a whole and created a more vibrant society because we helped \nso many individuals with the GI bill in those days. This is comparable \nto that--men and women who want to go to St. Clair Community College or \nwant to go to the Mansfield Campus at Ohio State or want to go to Hiram \nCollege or Ohio University in Athens. They want to go to school. We \ncannot load this much debt onto them.\n  As we put this on our Web site, we expect students to write in and \ntell their stories. I know they will. We have five stories. I will \nshare a couple of these for today and save a couple more.\n  Bonnie of Elyria, a mother and teacher, writes:\n\n       I would really like to be able to send my three boys to \n     college. As a public school teacher, I have worked hard to \n     instill in my students the idea of continuing education. \n     However, my own children will most likely have to take out \n     student loans to pursue a college education.\n\n  Our teachers are not so well paid that they can afford to pay these \ntuition bills themselves, obviously.\n\n       With soaring tuition rates, my children will graduate \n     college with more debt than me or my husband had after \n     graduating from college more than 35 years ago.\n       This is not a good way to start a career or a life on their \n     own.\n\n  This woman gets it. She was a teacher in Ohio. She knew there was \nsort of an assault on her profession from the Governor and the \nlegislature last year when they tried to take away collective \nbargaining rights. We know teachers do not make a lot of money, and if \ntheir children are to go to school, even less-expensive schools, they \nso often need to take out student loans. We don't want to raise their \ninterest rates.\n  Katie, from Marion, writes--Marion is a community just north and west \nof Columbus.\n\n       I urge you to vote against raising Stafford loan rates. I \n     live with my fiance, who is also attending college full time, \n     and our household brings in less than $35,000 a year. I am \n     working part time in order to attend college full time. With \n     college tuition and expenses being so expensive, adding in \n     the normal cost of living, it is a struggle to make ends meet \n     every month.\n       I understand and respect the legislative process and, \n     unlike many people I know, I still have faith it can be \n     effective. I know that compromises have to be made for change \n     to occur.\n       However, I am worried that by the time everyone is on the \n     same page, the Government will have either taken so long to \n     come up with a solution or cut funding so much, that the \n     average American can no longer afford to pursue a college \n     degree.\n       . . . I hope that if nothing else, you take away from this \n     that there are Ohioans in this for the long run. We will not \n     accept anything less than what we deserve, and education is \n     not negotiable.\n\n\n[[Page S2954]]\n\n\n  The last one I will read is by RaShya, of Toledo.\n\n       I am a second year law student at the University of \n     Minnesota law school. I am a native of Toledo, OH and \n     received my BA in political science with honors and an MBA in \n     finance from the University of Toledo.''\n       I am the product of a single-parent home and a first-\n     generation college graduate. My mother is a cancer survivor \n     and my father was shot and killed when I was ten. I am the \n     eldest of three children.\n       My education has been a miracle of sorts and allowed me to \n     change the circumstances of my environment.\n       It was only possible through scholarship money and federal \n     loans. I am deeply saddened by the rate hikes that loom in \n     July of this year.\n       Making education less accessible hurts others that grew up \n     in circumstances similar to mine. This economy requires a \n     good college education but the promise of employment is still \n     uncertain.\n       Raising loan rates hurts students. Please vote to extend \n     the rate cuts that threaten to expire this July.\n\n  Those three letters so speak for themselves where students just want \nan opportunity. They are not asking for welfare or a handout, they just \nwant to keep interest rates low so they can go to college without such \na huge, onerous, burdensome debt they will never get out from under it. \nWhy would we do this to this generation? My wife was the first in her \nfamily to go to college. Her dad carried a union card, worked at the \nilluminating company. Her mother was a home care worker who went back \nto work when Connie started college to try to help them pay--and she \ngraduated.\n  She had very little help from her family financially because she was \nthe eldest of four children. She got low-interest loans, and she \ngraduated with only a couple thousand dollars of debt from Kent State \nUniversity.\n  Those days seem to be behind us. We should at least aim for that kind \nof situation today where young people get a better chance, more of a \nfighting chance when they come out of school.\n  I urge my colleagues to listen to these stories and to read some of \nthem and to vote accordingly when we bring this bill back to the floor. \nToday there was a vote, and more than 40 of our colleagues said: We are \nnot even going to allow this bill on the floor to debate. That is \npretty unconscionable to me when we hear the stories of these young \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, what is the pending order of business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in divided time until 7 p.m.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is it in morning business or are we on an issue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we voted at noon today on whether we were going to \nstart the debate on the student loan interest rate bill.\n  For those who are following it, the largest Federal loan to college \nstudents, the Stafford loan, has a current interest rate of 3.4 \npercent. That interest rate expires on July 1 and doubles to 6.8 \npercent, meaning any students taking out a loan after that date will \npay twice as much in interest.\n  The practical impact of that is fairly clear: If you were to borrow \n$20,000 to go to college through a Federal Stafford loan and paid 3.4 \npercent on that $20,000, you would find that you were paying $4,000 \nless than you would pay if you were at 6.8 percent. So it adds roughly \n20 percent to the cost of that student's loan over the life of \nrepayment. That is a significant expense.\n  Most of us are aware, or should be, that students across America are \ngoing more deeply and deeply into debt to go to college. Average \ncollege indebtedness: $24,000. But an average does not tell the story \nbecause if you have one hand over a flame and one hand in a freezer, on \naverage you have to feel just fine. But in this case, students are \ngoing much more deeply into debt than $24,000, and the interest rate on \nthe loan is significant.\n  So it would seem this is a pushover. Who disagrees with this idea \nthat lessening the burden on students in college is good for our \ncountry--because more students will seek higher education--good for the \nstudent--less of a burden when they graduate--good for their families--\nbecause many of them cosigned on these loans?\n  In fact, this is one of those rare issues where both President Obama \nand Governor Romney agree: Don't let the interest rate go up from 3.4 \npercent to 6.8 percent. So today we resumed the motion to proceed, \nwhich literally means, if adopted, we would begin debate on the student \nloan interest rate bill to keep it at 3.4 percent and not let it double \nJuly 1.\n  We heard from both sides of the aisle that everyone agreed we had to \ndo this. It sounded pretty easy. Then the vote was called. At the end \nof the vote, not one single Republican Senator had voted to proceed to \nthe debate on the bill--not one. One Senator, Ms. Snowe, voted present. \nEvery other Republican Senator who was present voted no.\n  How did this become a partisan issue? We have President Obama and \nGovernor Romney agreeing, most Americans agreeing we do not want the \ncost of student loans to go up, and it fell flat on its face on the \nSenate floor at noon today. Not a single Republican would vote for it.\n  I don't understand it. They say, well, we don't like the way you pay \nfor it. It costs $6 billion to lower the interest rate that we would \notherwise collect. We pay for it by changing the Tax Code, closing a \ntax loophole primarily used by accountants and attorneys under \nsubchapter S corporations to avoid paying their regular income tax on \ntheir income. They get through this S corporation what are called \nincome dividends and they don't pay the regular income tax rate or the \nwithholding tax that ordinary income is subject to. I think closing \nthat loophole is reasonable. It produces $6 billion and pays for the \nstudent loan interest rate to stay down. I can accept that.\n  Some on the Republican side say, no, that is a tax increase. They--\nmany of them--have categorically said we will never, ever, never vote \nfor a tax increase, no matter what it is. So they walked away from the \nstudent loan bill. They say they have a better way to do it. Senator \nReid came to the floor and said, fine, we will call the bill and you \ncan offer your way to do it. Pay for it a different way. Let's bring it \nup for debate. Let both sides debate it and let's vote on it, and then \nlet's move forward. No, they would not accept that. They all voted \nagainst proceeding to the bill.\n  For anybody who is following what is going on here, this is what is \nknown as a filibuster. The Senate is infamous for them now. We \nfilibuster everything, even bills that are bipartisan, which everybody \nagrees on. No, we are going to drag this out hour after weary hour, \neating up the time of the Senate, and people will be asking for a cable \nrefund because nothing is happening on the C SPAN channel because they \nare watching a filibuster. Not much happens. Yes, Members such as I \nwill come from time to time to give a speech and explain what is going \non, but nothing substantive is going on. We are not considering the \nbill.\n  Sadly, what we are failing to do is going to affect a lot of innocent \npeople; 7.4 million students will be affected if we don't change this \ninterest rate--365,000 in my State of Illinois. These Stafford loans, \nFederal Government loans, are mainly directed toward families in lower \nincome situations, so that students can borrow money to get through \nschool.\n  Let me confess my conflict here. I would not be standing here today \nwithout government loans. I borrowed money from the Federal Government \nto go to college and to law school under the National Education Act and \nthen paid it back; otherwise, I could not have gone to school; I \ncouldn't have afforded it. These loans are needed across the board. We \nknow it from personal experience.\n  In 2007 and 2008, 30 percent of all undergraduates took out federally \nsubsidized Stafford loans--about 1 out of 3. The average was about \n$3,400 a loan 4 or 5 years ago. This year, it is up to 8 million \nstudents. As I mentioned, 365,000-plus borrowers in my State, and, as I \nmentioned, failure to reduce that interest rate will add to the cost of \nthe loan they have to pay back. These borrowers, 7.4 million students, \nincluding\n\n[[Page S2955]]\n\n1.5 million African-American borrowers and over 986,000 Hispanic \nborrowers, will face this new penalty, this loan increase. It is clear \nto me that we should be spending time here dealing with this.\n  I learned it firsthand when I went home last week and visited \ncampuses. In Chicago, I went to DePaul. Downstate, I went to Bradley \nUniversity in Peoria. In Decatur, I went to Millikin University. In \neach place, students came forward to explain what they were facing in \nterms of student loans. I will enter into the Record the experiences \nthey shared with me.\n  One of them was Amy. Amy goes to DePaul University in Chicago and is \nan art major. Her sister Michelle came to join us at the press \nconference. Here is Amy's situation. Amy comes from a working family \nwho cannot help her pay, so she works and borrows to try to get through \nschool. She is an art major. Her student loan indebtedness at the end \nof June will be, for 4 years, $80,000. But she says that a bachelor's \nin art is not good enough and thinks she needs a master's. She thinks \nit will be another $60,000 she needs to borrow. I said: That is \n$140,000, young lady, and you are 25 or 26 years old. She will be \nborrowing not only the government loan but way beyond that into private \nloans. The government loan is 3.4 percent. The private loans for \nstudents in school range from 8 to 18 percent--much like credit card \ndebt, they are so expensive.\n  This young lady thinks she is doing the right thing. She was told go \nto school, get an education, and follow her dream. Her dream is at the \nend of a very long, expensive road and $140,000 in debt. Michelle, her \nsister, decided she wanted to be a teacher and teach grade school. She \nlooked at the indebtedness she would have to incur and decided to move \nback home to Indiana and go to the local public college and try to get \nas many credits as she could at a low price, and perhaps finish at \nDePaul when it is time. She thought: If my debt is too much, I would \nnot be able to teach or make enough money to pay my loan back. That is \na real-life story of two sisters who are doing the right thing and are \nfacing student loan debt.\n  How could we explain that we are going to raise the interest rate on \neither one of them? At this point paying back their student loans will \nmake it virtually impossible for Amy, who could be $80,000 to $140,000 \nin debt, and how is Michelle going to be the teacher we want her to be?\n  At Bradley University in Peoria, a student named Rose told me that if \nthe interest rate on her loans doubled, which will happen if the \nfilibuster continues by the Republicans, she might have to move in with \nher parents after graduation or make sacrifices in order to make her \nloan payments. Rose estimates that increasing interest rates will cost \nabout $4,000, because she plans on graduating with about $20,000 in \ndebt.\n  I also met Deshawn from Alton, IL, a freshman majoring in economics \nand political science at Bradley. He wants to be an international \nlawyer some day. He is a first-generation college student, and he \nrealizes that without student loans he doesn't have a chance to realize \nhis dream.\n  What is the difference of opinion here about how to pay for these \ndecreases in the interest rate from 6.8 to 3.4? As I mentioned, we \nwould close the tax loophole on subchapter S corporations, which are \nused by accountants and attorneys to avoid paying the ordinary income \ntax and withholding.\n  There is another proposal out of the House that I think is really \nbad. They say we should pay for keeping student loans affordable by \nreducing preventive health care programs. We have a fund that we have \ncreated that pays for, among other things, preventive care, \nchildhood immunizations. So if the money is taken out of that fund, \nfewer American children will be receiving the vaccines and the \ninoculations which we want for all of our kids to keep them safe. Is it \nimportant that kids receive these vaccinations? I think it is very \nimportant.\n\n  Senator Reid said at a press conference here that the incidence of a \nreturn of whooping cough--most people thought that was long gone--in \nthe United States is at the highest level in 50 years, and the \nincidence of the return of measles in this country is at the highest \nlevel in 15 years. Childhood immunizations are important to keep our \nkids healthy and safe.\n  There is also money in this prevention fund, which the House \nRepublicans want to cut out, calling it a slush fund, to be used for \ndiabetes prevention. You cannot pick up a newspaper or a magazine \nwithout reading about the incidence of obesity, the growing number of \noverweight children, and the increasing incidence of diabetes among our \nchildren. In fact, forms of diabetes that used to be confined to adults \nin America are now being found in children in America. They have to be \ntreated with pretty powerful drugs to overcome this disease of \ndiabetes.\n  The House Republicans say let us reduce the amount of money we are \nusing for public education and treatment to reduce the incidence of \ndiabetes and instead spend it on student loans. What a Faustian bargain \nthat is. It is a bargain with the devil. We are going to put at risk \nchildren when it comes to immunizations and diabetes, in order to help \ngrown children, young adults, pay their student loans.\n  Is that what it has come to? We are so determined to not touch the \nTax Code and the loopholes in it that we are going to risk the health \nof our children or the cost of a college education for our kids as \nwell?\n  I think the approach in the House is not defensible. I hope that at \nthe end of the day we can make sure we do this in a responsible way.\n\n\n                           For-Profit Schools\n\n  Mr. President, I want to mention 2 other things quickly. One of the \nreal problems with debt in this country relates to for-profit schools. \nGo to Yahoo or Google, put in ``college and university'' and step back. \nWhat is about to hit you is an avalanche of ads for for-profit schools. \nI don't need to recount the names on the floor. Everybody knows them. \nThese are the schools that are advertising constantly: Come to our \nschool. They run ads on television. One, I think, tells the story and \nshows a lovely young lady in a robe and pajamas, who has her laptop on \nher bed and says: You know, you can go to college in your pajamas now. \nI am going to XYZ for-profit school getting my college degree.\n  Here is what is happening: These for-profit schools are inundating \nthe Internet and recruiting young people who otherwise might not go to \ncollege, many of them, and 10 percent--here are three numbers--of kids \ngraduating from high school end up in these for-profit schools. So what \nthe for-profit schools are looking for is young people who are in lower \nincome family categories because they qualify for the most Federal \nassistance--Pell grants and Federal student loans. Ten percent of the \nstudents at the for-profit schools and 25 percent of all Federal aid \nfor education goes to these schools--more than 2\\1/2\\ times, based on \nthe number of students, the amount you might imagine.\n  Hang on, it gets more challenging. Almost half of the student loan \ndefaults in America come from for-profit schools. Why? The kids get too \ndeeply in debt and end up dropping out because the debt is overwhelming \nor they finish and get a worthless diploma and cannot find a job. That \nis the story. So the student debt in traditional schools, public \nuniversities, private, not-for-profit universities, is one thing; on \nthe for-profit side that debt is mounting, particularly through private \nstudent loans.\n  Here is the kicker, and you know this, Mr. President, because you \nstudied this issue too. Student loans are the only private loans in \nAmerica not dischargeable in bankruptcy. What it means is that you are \ncarrying it for a lifetime. You will carry it until you pay. That young \nlady $140,000 in debt could not have a clue what she has done to the \nrest of her life by getting that deeply in debt. I have students \ncontacting me with over $100,000 in debt for a 4-year education, and \nthey find out the diploma is worthless. There is one school, Westwood \nCollege, which operates out of Denver, CO, and has a campus in Chicago. \nThey are under investigation now by our State attorney general. Too \nmany young people have been watching too many crime shows, and Westwood \nCollege knows it. They call them and say how would you like a \nbachelor's degree in law enforcement. Maybe they are watching ``Hawaii \n5 0'' and ``CSI'' and they like that stuff. Good, come on out.\n\n[[Page S2956]]\n\n  I will tell you a story of one student. She went to Westwood College \nand it took 5 years to get a bachelor's degree in law enforcement. She \ntook that diploma to the police departments and sheriffs' departments \naround the Cook County area, and they said: That is not a real college. \nWe don't recognize that as a real diploma.\n  There she was with a worthless diploma and in debt $80,000 for a \nstudent loan. Now she is living in her parents' basement. She can't \nborrow another nickel to go to a real college, and she owes, obviously, \n$80,000 and is struggling with two jobs to try to pay it off.\n  There is another part of the story that we should not ignore. Many of \nthese schools, particularly the for-profit schools, realize that \nhooking the kids into this loan is not enough, so they have the parents \ncosign. Sometimes the grandparents cosign. Six weeks ago, the New York \nTimes ran a story of a woman who had her Social Security check \ngarnished because she owed on a student loan. It wasn't hers, it was \nher granddaughter's loan. She cosigned, and her granddaughter \ndefaulted, and now the grandmother has her Social Security check being \ndocked because she owes on the loan. This is a horrible situation. It \nwill be a worse situation if the interest rate on July 1 doubles.\n\n  So we have this Republican filibuster against bringing down the \ninterest rate on student loans, and yet we now have an empty floor. \nWhoever thought it was a good idea for us not to debate and not to vote \non this interest rate increase is long gone. They are not even here. I \nthink that is the real unfairness of the filibuster. If a Senator or \nSenators stop the business of the Senate and say we can't even take up \nthe bill or consider an amendment, then I think they owe it to the \nSenate to be here and explain their point of view.\n  I hope that tomorrow, when the dawn of a new day breaks and the \nSenate opens, some Republicans will come to the floor and explain this \nfilibuster on college student loans. It is unfair to the students and \nto the families of our country. People definitely need a college \neducation--many of them do--in order to succeed in life. Some need \ntraining. Even those who need skilled training may end up at a \ncommunity college or taking a course that requires a loan to get \nthrough.\n  I hope the Republicans who started this filibuster, who said we \ncannot even take up, consider, or debate the student loan interest rate \nissue, will be here tomorrow to explain why, to explain why they think \nthis is not worth the time of the Senate to debate. Until then, we will \njust languish in this filibuster.\n\n\n                             The DREAM Act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it was 11 years ago that I introduced a \nbill called the DREAM Act. Just this last week, I was back in Chicago \nto attend a fundraising dinner for a group I really respect. It is \ncalled the Merit music program. About 20 years ago, when a lady passed \naway, she left a legacy to the Merit music program, and the legacy said \nthat the money she was leaving and any money that was raised should go \ninto the public schools of the city of Chicago to offer young people a \nfree musical instrument and music lessons if they were interested.\n  This program has been an amazing success. It turns out it has created \nan avenue and opportunity many young people never dreamed of having, \nand some of them have talents that are incredible. I was there at their \ndinner last week when the violinists came in--kids from all over the \npublic schools of Chicago--and they did a magnificent job. They feel so \ngood about themselves. They develop a talent, and they have a 100-\npercent college placement rate from the Merit music program. There is a \nlinkage there. I know the Senator from Colorado, who has taken over as \nour Presiding Officer, knows this, as he was an educator in the city of \nDenver. Many of these kids for the first time realize that they are \nworth something, that they can do something and do it well. And it is \nthat confidence and pride that not only takes them through the \nexperience of playing music but the experience of life and the \nexperience of the classroom. It makes a big difference in their lives.\n  Eleven years ago I got a call from the director of the program, Duffy \nAdelson. Duffy was there last week. Duffy is a wonderful woman who has \ncommitted her life to the Merit music program. She said: I have an \nissue. One of the students at the Merit music program is an amazing \nyoung girl who plays concert piano. She has been accepted at major \nmusic schools, including the Manhattan school of Music in New York. She \nis Korean. Her mother, when she was filling out the application for the \nManhattan school of Music, came to the box that said ``citizenship, \nnationality.''\n  The girl turned to her mother--her name is Teresa Lee--and said: USA, \nright?\n  Her mom said: No. You see, I brought you here when you were 2 years \nold on a visitor's visa and I never filed any papers. Your dad is a \ncitizen, I am a citizen, and your brother and sister, who were born \nhere, are citizens, but we don't know what your status is.\n  The daughter said: What are we going to do?\n  She said: We will call Durbin.\n  Well, first they called the Merit music program, and then Merit \ncalled me, and my staff found out that the law was clear. This young \ngirl, who has spent 16 years in the United States, has to leave the \nUnited States for 10 years and then reapply to come back. She must \nleave for 10 years. That is the law. I thought to myself, the mom \ndidn't file the papers. Mom did something wrong. Why would we not let \nthis young woman do something right?\n  So when I was drafting the DREAM Act, I said: If you graduate high \nschool and you have no serious problems when it comes to convictions or \nmoral issues and you either complete service in the military or 2 years \nin college, we will put you on a path--a long path--toward becoming \nlegal and becoming a citizen. That is the DREAM Act.\n  The DREAM Act has been here for 11 years. I have tried to pass it on \nthe floor repeatedly. I can get 50-plus votes--I did the last time I \ncalled it--but the Senate has this magic number of 60, a supermajority. \nIt has even passed the House of Representatives. But I have never been \nable to put 60 votes together here.\n  Over the years, the support from the other side of the aisle has been \ndecreasing. As it decreases, it gets more difficult. Over the years, as \nwell, a lot of people have stepped up and spoken on behalf of this \nDREAM Act. Colin Powell said: We would love to have these young people \nin our military. Secretaries of Defense, such as Secretary Gates, said \nthe same thing. President Obama was a cosponsor of the bill. These are \nyoung talented people who can make a difference. But before I tell you \nthe story of one of them here, I want to tell you the end of the story \nof Teresa Lee.\n  Teresa Lee attended the Manhattan school of Music and majored in \nconcert piano. She met and married a young man who was an American \ncitizen, and that made her legal in America. And she played at Carnegie \nHall. How about that? Eleven years ago our government's law said she \nhad to leave the country for 10 years. Instead, she came to the \nManhattan School of Music, made it through, and has made a success of \nher life. There were a couple of people who stepped up and made sure \nthat success was a reality in Chicago, and they were with the Merit \nmusic program. They had literally underwritten her college education \nbecause she couldn't qualify for any help--no Federal loans or grants, \nnothing--because she wasn't a citizen of the United States. This is a \nperfect example of a talent that would have been lost or wasted if she \nhadn't had good circumstances and if we don't have the DREAM Act for \nothers who face the same thing.\n  Let me tell another story about Ayded Reyes. This is a photo of Ayded \nReyes. She is a runner. I learned about her from an article on \nESPN.com. Ayded was brought to the United States from Mexico when she \nwas 2 years old. She grew up in San Diego, CA. In high school, she was \nan honors student who played three sports and was an active volunteer \nin her community. Among other activities, Ayded volunteered at the \nChildren's Hospital and Sherman Heights Community Center, where she \ntutored students and worked with the elderly. She was also a member of \nthe National Honor Society and graduated from high school with a 3.98 \ngrade point average. This Senator wishes he could have had an average \nlike that.\n\n[[Page S2957]]\n\n  Ayded was accepted at the University of California at San Diego, but \nshe was unable to attend for financial reasons. Because she does not \nhave legal status in the United States, Ayded is ineligible for Federal \nstudent loans or any other Federal aid. Instead, she attends \nSouthwestern Community College, where she has flourished as a student \nathlete. She maintains a 3.50 grade point average, and her dream is to \nbecome an obstetrician. She has also become the top-ranked women's \njunior college cross-country runner in the State of California. Among \nother awards, she has been given Athlete of the Year at Southwestern \nCollege and Pacific Coast Athletic Conference Track and Field Athlete \nof the Year. Ayded has been offered athletic scholarships by more than \na dozen top 4-year colleges, but she can't accept them because she is \nsubject to deportation. She is not here legally.\n  I have spoken to other students who have similar challenges, whose \ndreams can't be fulfilled unless we give them a chance. Just recently, \nI heard about a student who didn't know which way to turn, didn't know \nif the DREAM Act would ever pass, and applied for a visa to take his \ncollege education and go to work in Canada. The Canadians welcomed him. \nWe need talent like that in Canada, they said. So they took him and we \ndeported him. Are we a better nation for that? Who got the best of that \nbargain? A person who was educated in the United States, succeeded in \nthe United States, and dreamed of being an American citizen is now \nliving in Canada. To me, that is not the kind of thing we need to see \nin our country.\n  As I said, just because the parents made the mistake, got something \nwrong, these young people should be given a chance to do something \nright.\n  I am going to continue to work on passing the DREAM Act, and I hope I \ncan appeal across the aisle to Republicans as well. Why is this a \npartisan issue? Don't we all believe we shouldn't punish a young person \nfor the crimes or sins of their adult parent? That is what is at work \nhere. It is a basic question of justice. These young people, such as \nAyded, grew up in America pledging allegiance to the flag, believing \nthis was their home. All they want is a chance to make their home--the \nhome of their dreams--a better place.\n  I hope my colleagues will take the time to meet some of the DREAMers. \nThat is what they call themselves now. They have Web sites. They have \nstepped out into the light of day to introduce themselves to America. \nThat is our only hope for this passing, where people come to meet these \nyoung people and realize what amazing people they are. I think they \nwill understand that giving them a chance is only fair, it is totally \nAmerican, and it is something we should do as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, at this point I yield the floor and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to express deep concern on behalf \nof families and students all across Michigan who are very upset at the \nvote earlier today where we did not get enough votes--the supermajority \nneeded to be able to get beyond the filibuster that is going on on the \nfloor by colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and therefore we \ncan't actually get to the vote on the bill that would lower or maintain \nthe lower student loan interest rates for students all across America \nand certainly in Michigan.\n  We know what will happen July 1 if we can't get beyond this. We \nactually have a majority of Members, 53 Members. I am very proud that \nall of our Members on this side of the aisle voted, in fact, to support \nthe effort to maintain the low student loan interest rate. We didn't \nhave the supermajority because it takes bipartisan votes to be able to \nget there and overcome the filibuster on the other side of the aisle. \nBut we have enough votes, and we just want to vote. We have enough \nvotes to be able to pass this bill, the Stop the Student Loan Interest \nRate Hike Act. We have enough votes, and we just need to have the \nopportunity to be able to vote.\n  What does this mean for middle-class families and students in \nMichigan and all across the country? We are at a time when middle-class \nfamilies are struggling to make ends meet and no more so than in \nMichigan, where we have gone through the deepest recession for the last \ndecade of anyplace in the country. We need to be making college more \naffordable for Michigan students and students across America and their \nparents, not less affordable. We ought to be doing what will actually \nadd to what we have done to support lower interest rates, more access \nto student loans, not taking that away, which is what is happening \nright now on the floor of the Senate because of the filibuster.\n  Higher education costs are already rising. Michigan students are \ngraduating with mountains of student debt while high school graduates \nare being priced out of the opportunity to be able to go to college. In \nfact, the average Michigan student is graduating with over $25,000 in \nstudent debt. That is a heck of a place to start when you come out of \ncollege and you are looking for a job and trying to get started in a \nprofessional life or trying to continue your professional life and at \nthe same time support your family. That is a lot of money. And we \nshould not be adding to that, because we are talking about additional \ndebt on top of that $25,000 average if, in fact, we can't pass this \nbill.\n  We have right now more than 300,000 Michigan students--those who have \nborrowed money because they believe in themselves, they believe in the \nfuture, and they want to get the skills and the degrees they need to be \nable to go into the workplace, to be successful for themselves and \ntheir families--300,000 students who are going to see their Stafford \nstudent loan interest rate double if we don't pass this bill.\n  We need a sense of urgency, like every single family feels right now \nthat finds themselves burdened by loans. They made the decision, and we \nhave been supportive of that, making loans available and lowering the \ninterest rate over the last several years so more people can go to \ncollege and be able to get the skills they need and be able to be \nsuccessful in the workplace. We should be continuing to support that \nand doing even more to help them lower the cost, not allowing the \nstudent loan interest rate to double come July 1.\n  Folks in Michigan are scratching their heads right now. Let me share \nstories I have received. I have received a lot of input, a lot of \nstories from people not only throughout today but before today, but \ncertainly folks who watched the vote this afternoon are horrified at \nwhat this means personally to them, for their children or for their \nfamilies. We have received a number of e-mails to our office, and I am \nvery thankful to people who are sharing their stories. I would like to \nshare just a few of them on the floor of the Senate.\n  Liz from Traverse City wrote:\n\n       PLEASE, please don't let them raise the interest rates on \n     student loans. I have two sons at MSU and I'm a single mom. I \n     work a full time and 2 part-time jobs and they work, and \n     without the Federal loans they wouldn't be able to go to \n     college--even with the full MET I worked on all their lives.\n\n  So she put money into a Michigan program to be able to save money and \nput money aside. But this is somebody who is working one job and two \npart-time jobs on top of her full-time job, and her sons are working, \nand they still have student loans to be able to piece it together to be \nable to go to college.\n  She said:\n\n       Please help--our 3 person family is working very hard to \n     get through school.\n\n  And I would suggest that they are. And, Liz, thank you for caring \nabout your sons and working as hard as you are working.\n  We need to make sure we don't add costs to Liz and her two sons in \nJuly. On top of everything they are doing to be able to create an \nopportunity for those two sons to be able to go to college, to be able \nto have a better life and a future for themselves, we shouldn't be \nadding costs to them.\n  Lars from Ann Arbor wrote:\n\n       As a student at the University of Michigan, I find it hard \n     to keep up with current events, but I try in earnest, and \n     this is an issue that affects me more than most others\n\n[[Page S2958]]\n\n     at this time. I'm footing the bill for my college education \n     largely myself, as my mother and father--a high school art \n     teacher and GM retiree, respectively--do what they can to \n     help in the short term. I'd like you to work on behalf of \n     keeping the interest rates lower.\n\n  So Lars is going to the University of Michigan--a great university--\nand he is footing most of his college bill himself. His mom, a teacher, \nand his dad, a GM retiree, are doing what they can to help, but he has \nto have student loans. Why on Earth would we be adding to his costs \ncome July when he is working very hard, with the support of his family, \nto be able to create a great life with a great education from a great \nuniversity?\n  Kasondra from Grand Blanc wrote:\n\n       I am not what they consider a `typical' student. I am a \n     single mom of two obtaining my bachelor's degree in Social \n     Work. As a student and as a mother, I am attempting to lift \n     myself and my family out of poverty by doing the right thing, \n     getting a college education. While it has been tough and \n     there are days I wished I could give up, I am pursuing my \n     dream, and I will be graduating with honors in one year. If \n     the rate increase happens, I cannot afford paying back my \n     student loans while raising two children. Please, do not \n     let the interest rate expire on July 1.\n\n  Kasondra, congratulations for all you are doing as a single mom of \ntwo, as you said, lifting your family out of poverty. We in Michigan \nare a tough bunch. We don't give up. But I know how hard it can be \ntrying to hold it all together during these times, and I want to thank \nyou for doing that. And you are absolutely right, it would really be \noutrageous to see the interest rate on your loans when you are \ngraduating next year with honors--congratulations for that. But to be \nable to know that you are going to at least have the interest rate on \nyour loans continue as they have been I know would be a relief and a \nhelp to you.\n  Angelica from Ypsilanti wrote:\n\n       My name is Angelica, I am a 40 year old mother of three who \n     has returned to school to finally get my degree. I have \n     recently been accepted at Eastern Michigan University and am \n     starting classes in June. Without affordable student loans I \n     would not be able to attend school. I want to make a positive \n     difference. Getting my degree will give me and my family a \n     better standard of living and get out of the terrible cycle \n     of poverty. This bill is critical to making the dream of \n     higher education a reality for Americans and ensuring our \n     workforce is prepared to compete in a 21st century global \n     economy.\n\n  Angelica, again, congratulations. As a mom of three, 40 years old, \nmaking the decision to go back to school, getting accepted, creating a \nplan for how you are going to be able to use student loans and be able \nto hold it all together financially as you are moving forward, it is \nreally outrageous to think that there is a filibuster going on right \nnow to stop us from voting on something that would help you.\n  We have the votes. This is not about whether we have the votes to \nmaintain the low interest rate. We have the votes. We are being blocked \nprocedurally from getting to the vote, and that is something that is \nvery hard for me to understand.\n  Michael in Mount Pleasant wrote:\n\n       I am a student at Central Michigan University studying \n     Information Technology and I am also putting myself through \n     school by whatever means possible. The amount of student loan \n     debt I will have to pay after a 4-year degree casts a looming \n     shadow. We are always taught to look toward the future and to \n     jump at any opportunity that presents itself as an \n     opportunity to better oneself. We as students are now looking \n     at a future filled with uncertainty. Please do whatever it \n     takes to do what you know is right, and save our future from \n     an impending financial defeat.\n\n  Well, Michael, again working very hard, has a path, knows what he \nwants to do, puts a plan in place, like most students and most \nfamilies, to figure out how he is going to be able to pay it both now \nin terms of the costs and paying back the student loans. And if we \ncan't get a vote on this bill, we are pulling the rug out from under \nMichael.\n  Jennifer in Michigan wrote:\n\n       For me, it means I'll be very unlikely to finish grad \n     school. We say the US (especially Michigan) needs to invest \n     in technology, yet they want to do things like this that will \n     result in an uneducated society.\n\n  Jennifer, I am with you. This makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, \nat a time when we know we have to outeducate and outinnovate to be able \nto outcompete in a global economy. Doing things that add costs for \nmiddle-class families, working families, to add costs for loans? You \nare bearing the brunt. You are getting a loan. You are believing in \nyourself and your future. We ought to be doing everything we can to \nsupport that, not adding more costs.\n  That is unfortunately what will happen if we cannot get beyond this \nfilibuster on the floor of the Senate, to have a real vote, a final \nvote. We have the votes. We are just being blocked from getting to the \nvote by the procedures of the Senate.\n  Kathryn in Michigan:\n\n       When I heard the interest for student loans is going to \n     double, my heart sank. How is this even possible? My daughter \n     is 21 years old, a psychology major at Western Michigan \n     University.\n\n  That is another great university in Michigan.\n\n       I am so very proud of her as any parent would be. With \n     interest rates set to double, how can these students possibly \n     even begin to think of paying these loans back? All this does \n     is discourage kids from going to college at all and once \n     again only the privileged will be allowed to succeed. Please \n     once again we need your help. There has to be a light at the \n     end of this dark tunnel for these kids and for our nation.\n\n  ``There has to be a light at the end of this dark tunnel for these \nkids and for our nation.'' I could not agree more. We have to make sure \nthe light they see is not from an oncoming train. We have to make sure \nthe light they see is actually their way through the tunnel of debt \nthat comes with college loans, and out into a future that is brighter \nfor themselves, for their families. That is the hope, that is the \npromise of college education.\n  We have a responsibility to make sure we are doing everything \npossible to support the hopes and dreams, the hard work, the sacrifice \nthat is going on in college after college, in home after home, where \npeople are making tough decisions in order to give their kids a \nbrighter future.\n  I was proud to help author the legislation in 2007 that cut the \ninterest rate to where it is now, 3.4 percent. I was pleased to help \nlead the effort as well to reform the student loan program and expand \ncollege access. Those were good things to do--not bad things, good \nthings. People have benefited. Three hundred thousand people in \nMichigan right now have benefited from that opportunity, the commitment \nwe made to support young people, people going back to college, to have \na brighter future through a college education.\n  Now is not the time to turn that around. The Stop The Student Loan \nInterest Rate Hike Act is commonsense legislation. It does not add a \ndime to the deficit. It is fully paid for. It is something that needs \nto get done now so that there is certainty for families across Michigan \nand across the country. Education really is the road to opportunity in \nthis great country and Michigan is home to world-class universities and \ncommunity colleges. They are conducting cutting-edge high-tech research \nto help transform the economy. Our schools serve to open doors and \ncreate opportunities for thousands and thousands of graduates every \nyear.\n  I am always honored when I have the opportunity to speak at a \ngraduation, as I have done this year, and to see the pride and relief \non the faces of students who have worked so hard--and their parents, \ntheir pride and the commitment they make to their children. I know how \nthat feels as a parent sitting in the audience as your kids graduate \nand walk across that stage with their diploma.\n  This is ingrained in us as Americans. It is the foundation of who we \nare, to create an opportunity for people to go to school K 12 and then \nbe able to have a chance to go on to college so they can have the best \nshot at success. That is what we have had as a foundation in terms of \nour values as a country. This is not the time to turn it back. We need \nto be making it easier, not harder, for students to achieve a college \neducation which greatly improves their chances of getting a good-paying \njob and being successful in life.\n  We are at a moment where we had a vote today where it was very clear \nwe have enough votes to pass this bill, to make sure that student loan \nrates do not double. We have enough votes to pass it. We just do not \nhave support from across the aisle, we do not have the bipartisan votes \nwe need to get to a supermajority to stop the filibuster. That is what \nis going on right now. We\n\n[[Page S2959]]\n\nneed to vote. Folks do not have to agree with it. They can vote no on \nthe final bill. Let us vote. On behalf of the people we represent, let \nus vote on the bill. On behalf of 300,000 students and their families \nin Michigan, on behalf of hundreds of thousands of others who are \nlooking for the opportunity to go to college, to be able to work hard \nand take all the risks that come with that to be able to have a better \nlife, I ask we simply allow a vote. Let us vote on this bill.\n  It is time to get on and let people know we get it, we understand \nwhat families are going through, we understand the squeeze middle-class \nfamilies are going through on every front right now, and we will make \nsure that access to college, a higher education, is not just there for \nthe wealthy and connected but that it is available to everybody because \nwe are a stronger country because of that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor the \nHispanic Museum of Nevada--Museo Hispano de Nevada--for its 20 years of \nservice to our community.\n  For the last two decades, Museo Hispano de Nevada has been guided by \nits mission: ``dedicated to promote awareness, education and resources \nof the diverse Hispanic cultures and traditions to enhance \nintercultural understanding among community members.'' This institution \nhas played a critical role in educating Nevadans about the diversity of \nLatino heritage and promoting pride and cultural understanding.\n  The Museo Hispano de Nevada has sponsored numerous field trips and \nworkshops, shedding light on the different cultural traditions of the \nLatino population and enabling future generations to learn about their \nheritage through historic artifacts and art exhibits. These programs \nand activities have served as learning tools for educating our \ncommunity about the diversity in my home State of Nevada, where 26 \npercent of the population is Latino, accounting for 46 percent of \ngrowth in the Silver State.\n  As someone who has directly witnessed the importance of having a \nmuseum dedicated to preserving the history and telling the stories of \nLatinos in my home State, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the \nSmithsonian American Latino Museum Act, S. 1868. It is my hope that a \nmuseum illuminating the richness of the Latino culture and history, as \nwell as the numerous contributions Hispanics have made to the United \nStates, will be built in our Nation's Capital in the near future.\n  I would also like to recognize Lynnette Sawyer, executive director of \nthe museum, for her outstanding leadership and commitment to the \nmuseum. I extend a warm felt thanks to the staff and countless \nindividuals who have worked over the years to make this great \ninstitution a resource for all Nevadans. Please join me in \ncongratulating the Hispanic Museum of Nevada for 20 years of great work \nhonoring the rich diversity among Hispanics and their many \ncontributions to our great State. I wish the Museo Hispano de Nevada \ncontinued success in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/08/senate-section/article/S2959-3", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2959-S2960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO RUBEN CURTIS ``R.C.'' WALKER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of a man who has \nalways been ready and willing to answer the call of distress in his \nhometown of London, KY, in Laurel County: Mr. Ruben Curtis Walker, \nbetter known by what everyone typically calls him, ``R.C.'' He has \nserved as a member of numerous first-response teams for the local \npeople of his community for almost 60 years.\n  A life-long passion for service in the rescue field began for R.C. in \n1952, when he joined the London Fire Department. He has maintained some \nkind of position there, whether volunteer or paid, ever since. R.C. has \na deep desire to extend a helping hand to those in need. He enjoyed his \njob and he enjoyed the work he was doing for his community so much, in \nfact, that in 1962 Fire Chief Gilmore Phelps noticed his display of \npassion and asked him to start the first-ever Laurel County fire \ndepartment. R.C. took on the challenge and met it with flying colors. \nHe went on to run an excellent fire department for 18\\1/2\\ years before \nfinally stepping down as chief.\n  Having always been active in his community and anxious to help out, \nR.C. didn't just devote his time to the new County Fire Department; he \nwas involved across the board in the service arena. He was deputy \ncoroner, then eventually coroner in 1966, the same year that he ran for \ncounty sheriff. He opened the Bowling-Walker funeral home in 1965. He \nhas also been deputy sheriff in Laurel County, and the county jailer \nfrom 1989 to 1993.\n  However diverse the life of R.C. Walker was, he did not stray far \nfrom the fire department. His first love was fire and rescue, and that \nis where he is most at home. Although he does not fight fires with the \ndepartment today, he does still participate in other activities with \nthe firemen, many of whom refer to him as `Pap.'\n  Mr. Walker is not only a devoted public servant, but also a beloved \nfamily man. Aside from firefighter, he holds a few other titles--like \nhusband, father, and grandfather. He and his wife of 25 years, Marie, \nhave four children, Eddie, Steven, Stewart, and Deborah Greenwall. R.C. \nis dearly cherished by all who know him. I can say with certainty that \nhis family, the boys at the fire department, and the local citizens of \nLaurel County feel safe knowing a man as honest and caring as Ruben \nCurtis Walker is watching out for them.\n  I ask my colleagues in the United States Senate to join me in \ncommemorating Mr. Ruben Curtis Walker for the great many contributions \nhe has to his local community.\n  There was recently an article printed in the Sentinel-Echo: Silver \nEdition, a Laurel County, KY local newspaper magazine, which \nhighlighted the countless accomplishments of R.C. Walker throughout his \ncolorful life. I ask unanimous consent the article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to appear in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n        [From the Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition, November 2011]\n\n                            He's Done It All\n\n                            (By Carol Mills)\n\n       He has been a first responder in many ways--firefighter, \n     rescue worker, sheriff's deputy, coroner, and jailer.\n       Ruben Curtis ``R.C.'' Walker joined the London Fire \n     Department in 1952, and has been a volunteer fireman for the \n     city or county most of his life.\n       He has also been with the London-Laurel County Rescue Squad \n     most of the time.\n       ``I've really enjoyed being a firefighter. I've always been \n     helpful on the rescue squad whether I was with the city or \n     county. I remember rescuing this fellow out of an electric \n     line. When they were clearing the bottom out to put the new \n     sanitation system in, I got a call from the funeral home they \n     found somebody they thought was dead down there. He was \n     putting a new blade on a bulldozer and he swung his boom \n     around and he got it into 6,900 volts of electricity. I \n     jumped in the truck and pulled it away from the electric \n     line. The door was open on the truck, so I took a running go \n     and jumped in.

WALKER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of a man who has \nalways been ready and willing to answer the call of distress in his \nhometown of London, KY, in Laurel County: Mr. Ruben Curtis Walker, \nbetter known by what everyone typically calls him, ``R.C.'' He has \nserved as a member of numerous first-response teams for the local \npeople of his community for almost 60 years.\n  A life-long passion for service in the rescue field began for R.C. in \n1952, when he joined the London Fire Department. He has maintained some \nkind of position there, whether volunteer or paid, ever since. R.C. has \na deep desire to extend a helping hand to those in need. He enjoyed his \njob and he enjoyed the work he was doing for his community so much, in \nfact, that in 1962 Fire Chief Gilmore Phelps noticed his display of \npassion and asked him to start the first-ever Laurel County fire \ndepartment. R.C. took on the challenge and met it with flying colors. \nHe went on to run an excellent fire department for 18\\1/2\\ years before \nfinally stepping down as chief.\n  Having always been active in his community and anxious to help out, \nR.C. didn't just devote his time to the new County Fire Department; he \nwas involved across the board in the service arena. He was deputy \ncoroner, then eventually coroner in 1966, the same year that he ran for \ncounty sheriff. He opened the Bowling-Walker funeral home in 1965. He \nhas also been deputy sheriff in Laurel County, and the county jailer \nfrom 1989 to 1993.\n  However diverse the life of R.C. Walker was, he did not stray far \nfrom the fire department. His first love was fire and rescue, and that \nis where he is most at home. Although he does not fight fires with the \ndepartment today, he does still participate in other activities with \nthe firemen, many of whom refer to him as `Pap.'\n  Mr. Walker is not only a devoted public servant, but also a beloved \nfamily man. Aside from firefighter, he holds a few other titles--like \nhusband, father, and grandfather. He and his wife of 25 years, Marie, \nhave four children, Eddie, Steven, Stewart, and Deborah Greenwall. R.C. \nis dearly cherished by all who know him. I can say with certainty that \nhis family, the boys at the fire department, and the local citizens of \nLaurel County feel safe knowing a man as honest and caring as Ruben \nCurtis Walker is watching out for them.\n  I ask my colleagues in the United States Senate to join me in \ncommemorating Mr. Ruben Curtis Walker for the great many contributions \nhe has to his local community.\n  There was recently an article printed in the Sentinel-Echo: Silver \nEdition, a Laurel County, KY local newspaper magazine, which \nhighlighted the countless accomplishments of R.C. Walker throughout his \ncolorful life. I ask unanimous consent the article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to appear in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n        [From the Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition, November 2011]\n\n                            He's Done It All\n\n                            (By Carol Mills)\n\n       He has been a first responder in many ways--firefighter, \n     rescue worker, sheriff's deputy, coroner, and jailer.\n       Ruben Curtis ``R.C.'' Walker joined the London Fire \n     Department in 1952, and has been a volunteer fireman for the \n     city or county most of his life.\n       He has also been with the London-Laurel County Rescue Squad \n     most of the time.\n       ``I've really enjoyed being a firefighter. I've always been \n     helpful on the rescue squad whether I was with the city or \n     county. I remember rescuing this fellow out of an electric \n     line. When they were clearing the bottom out to put the new \n     sanitation system in, I got a call from the funeral home they \n     found somebody they thought was dead down there. He was \n     putting a new blade on a bulldozer and he swung his boom \n     around and he got it into 6,900 volts of electricity. I \n     jumped in the truck and pulled it away from the electric \n     line. The door was open on the truck, so I took a running go \n     and jumped in. He was passing in and out, but he wasn't \n     dead.''\n       Back then, the funeral homes transported patients to the \n     hospital because the ambulance service was established on \n     Jan. 1, 1977.\n       ``It's just wonderful that I could be of help to somebody. \n     I've been through a lot of situations.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Asian and \nPacific Islander community in the United States and celebrate the \ntremendous contribution these Americans have made to our Nation.\n  There are an estimated 17.3 million residents of Asian descent in our \ncountry and 5.6 million Asian-Pacific Americans living in California. I \nam proud that our State has the largest Asian population in the \ncountry.\n  California also boasts the highest number of Asian-owned businesses \nat 508,969, and the U.S. Armed Forces has more than 265,000 Asian-\nAmerican veterans.\n  In 1977, Senators Daniel Inouye and Spark Matsunaga of Hawaii \nintroduced a resolution in the Senate and President Jimmy Carter signed \na joint resolution officially establishing Asian-Pacific American \nHeritage Week to honor the first Japanese immigrants to the United \nStates and the Chinese individuals who worked on the Transcontinental \nRailroad. In 1992, May was officially designated Asian-Pacific American \nHeritage Month.\n  This year's Asian-Pacific American Heritage Month theme, ``Striving \nfor Excellence in Leadership, Diversity and Inclusion,'' is embodied in \nthe accomplishments of numerous Asian-Pacific Americans.\n  In Congress, my colleagues, Senators Daniel Inouye and Daniel Akaka, \nare joined by California Representatives Judy Chu, Mike Honda, and \nDoris Matsui as examples of good public servants.\n  A number of California cities are led by Asian-Pacific Americans, \nincluding: Mayor Ling-Ling Chang of Diamond Bar, Mayor Edwin Lee of my \nhometown of San Francisco, Mayor Jean Quan of Oakland, Mayor Richard \nSun of San Marino, Mayor Jeremy Yamaguchi of Placentia, and Mayor \nVincent Yu of Temple City.\n  Additionally, it is appropriate to acknowledge the outstanding \ncontributions of Asian-Pacific Americans who sit on the bench in \nCalifornia.\n  Judge Edward M. Chen just finished his first year as a U.S. district \ncourt judge in San Francisco.\n  Associate Justice Goodwin Liu was recently appointed to the Supreme \nCourt of California.\n  Judge Jacqueline H. Nguyen has served with distinction as the first \nVietnamese-American Federal judge since 2009, and was nominated to the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2011. She has won confirmation to the \nNinth Circuit, which makes her the first Asian-American female Federal \nappellate judge in the Nation.\n  Public service is by no means the only area in which Asian-Pacific \nAmericans have made great strides forward.\n  National Basketball Association phenomenon Jeremy Lin, a California \nnative, has provided inspiration well beyond the Asian-Pacific American \ncommunity. From young children to adults, the Harvard-educated athlete \nhas proven to millions that no dream is too big to achieve.\n  Asian-Pacific American Heritage Month is particularly relevant in \n2012, as we recognize the 70th anniversary of the Japanese-American \nrelocation during World War II, under Executive Order 9066.\n  I remember this shameful page in our history. As a young girl, my \nfather took me to the Tanforan Racetrack, near San Francisco, which was \na staging point for Japanese Americans en route to more permanent \ndetention centers. Seeing the barbed wire, and the men, women, and \nchildren housed in horse stables and small buildings on the infield of \nthe racetrack was an experience I will never forget.\n  It is important that our Nation acknowledge mistakes, no matter how \nfar in the past. I am proud to have cosponsored and voted in support of \na resolution expressing congressional regret for decades of legislation \ntargeting Chinese people for physical and political exclusion, as well \nas reaffirming the commitment of the Senate to preserve civil rights \nand constitutional protection of all Asian-Pacific Americans.\n  The future of the Asian-Pacific American community is bright, and I \nhave no doubt it will see many triumphs in the years ahead. Today, it \nis my honor to recognize the ongoing determination, ambition, and \nsuccess of Asian-Pacific Americans during Asian-Pacific American \nHeritage Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/08/senate-section/article/S2960-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2960-S2961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TAIWAN'S PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, on May 20 the world will see an encouraging \nsight. On that day, President Ma Ying-jeou of the Republic of China \nwill be sworn in for a second term on the island of Taiwan. I was so \npleased to see yet another free, fair, democratic election take place \non January 14. I want to take a moment to wish President Ma and the \npeople of Taiwan success and prosperity as their young democracy \ncontinues to flourish and serve as an example for other countries in \nthe region.\n  The difference in governance can be striking when Taiwan is compared \nto some of its neighbors in the region. Taiwan's experiment with \ndemocracy is less than two decades old, but it has demonstrated \nspectacular progress, holding direct democratic elections in every \nPresidential election since 1996. The people of Taiwan vigorously \nexercise their right to vote--three out of every four Taiwanese \ncitizens voted in the January elections--and they feel empowered to \npetition their government, voice their grievances, peacefully assemble, \nand, in general, enjoy many of the political freedoms that Americans \nhold dear.\n  Taiwan is an important economic partner of the United States and is a \nrobust and growing market for American exports. Just last month, as \nchair of the Senate Finance Subcommittee on International Trade, I held \na hearing on agricultural export opportunities to Asia. As Asia \ncontinues to experience impressive economic growth, it is important to \nremember that Taiwan is the sixth largest destination for American \nagricultural exports. More can be done to improve bilateral trade \nbetween our two countries though, and I hope President Ma and his \ncolleagues in the Legislative Yuan will move quickly to resolve the \noutstanding issues surrounding American beef imports.\n  President Ma made good progress in his first 4 years in improving \ncross-strait relations and has worked hard to promote peace and \nprosperity in the region. I commend both sides' work in developing and \nsigning the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement between the \nPeople's Republic of China and the Republic of China. I am confident \nthat President Ma will continue to work to ensure cross-strait \nstability and cultivate an environment free from intimidation.\n\n[[Page S2961]]\n\n  The people of Taiwan have much to be proud of as they celebrate the \ninauguration of President Ma. The relationship between the people of \nthe United States and the people of Taiwan is based on shared values \nand common interests. I look forward to seeing Taiwan grow and prosper, \nand want the Taiwanese people to know that they have an unshakeable \nally in the United States as they continue forward as a young \ndemocracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/08/senate-section/article/S2961-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \naccomplishments of Martha Smith, Ph.D., who is retiring as president of \nAnne Arundel Community College, AACC, in Anne Arundel County, MD. For \n18 years, Dr. Smith has been the visionary and driving force behind \nmany of the accomplishments of AACC. Her tireless dedication and \nunwavering enthusiasm have been instrumental in bringing extraordinary \neducational opportunities to the students of AACC. Under her \nleadership, AACC has grown to meet the needs of students and employers \nin Anne Arundel County and throughout the State of Maryland. The \ncollege has focused on high-growth industries and opportunities \npresented by the base realignment and closure, BRAC, process. As a \nresult, its enrollment has increased from 40,000 to 53,000 students and \nthe number of degree and certificate programs has nearly doubled. The \ncampus locations have grown to include Glen Burnie and Arundel Mills, \nas well as nine new buildings.\n  Dr. Smith has led AACC's growth and success by keeping her finger on \nthe pulse of workforce trends, student goals, and employer needs. This \nyear, she announced nine new associate's degree programs in fields such \nas juvenile justice and early childhood education. Under her \nleadership, AACC opened the Centers for Cyber and Professional Training \nand Applied Learning and Technology and introduced a new degree in \ninformation systems security, evincing the increased demand for highly \ntrained cyber security professionals. In response to the growing needs \nof Maryland's health care and tourism industries, Dr. Smith has \noverseen the expansion of the physician assistant certificate program \nand she cut the ribbon on AACC's new Hospitality, Culinary Arts and \nTourism Institute.\n  Dr. Smith's considerable expertise and leadership in the areas of \nworkforce development and education has enabled her to serve in many \nleadership roles with local, State, and national organizations. As a \npassionate advocate for high-quality, affordable education for all \nstudents who want to pursue higher education, her role on national \ncommunity college and workforce investment boards has been instrumental \nin building partnerships and making changes that have strengthened the \ncommunity college system and enabled more students to be successful. \nDuring Dr. Smith's tenure, AACC has garnered numerous awards and \nhonors, including Community College of the Year from the National \nAlliance for Business.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Dr. Smith on her 18 \nyears of accomplishments as president of Anne Arundel Community \nCollege, in thanking her for her inspired leadership and public \nservice, and in wishing her well in her retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/08/senate-section/article/S2961-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNIZING SACO & BIDDEFORD SAVINGS INSTITUTION\n\n Ms. SNOWE.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging Congress to \n     reconsider the recommendations of the 2012 United States Air \n     Force Structure Change Report and to deliver no fewer than \n     four C 27J aircraft to the 110th Airlift Wing of the Air \n     National Guard as previously committed; to the Committee on \n     Armed Services.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 215\n\n       Whereas, The Michigan Air National Guard, being the air \n     force militia of the state, has a long and proud history with \n     the state of Michigan and the city of Battle Creek; and\n       Whereas, The Battle Creek Air National Guard Base is \n     currently home to the 110th Airlift Wing of the Air National \n     Guard, which currently hosts a flying mission of C 21 \n     passenger aircraft, and the 110th Air Operations Group, which \n     provides critical support to the 17th Air Force, or United \n     States Air Forces Africa; and\n       Whereas, The units of the 110th Airlift Wing of the Air \n     National Guard have had a history in Battle Creek, Michigan, \n     since 1947; and\n       Whereas, The 110th Airlift Wing is a tremendous source of \n     civic pride in the greater Battle Creek area, as it has been \n     one of the most decorated Air National Guard units in the \n     nation, receiving the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award in \n     1992, 1998, 2000, 2004, and 2011, an honor bestowed on fewer \n     than 10 percent of Air Force units annually; and\n       Whereas, The citizens of Battle Creek have, over the years, \n     committed unmatched support for the Air National Guard in \n     Battle Creek, including in 1984 by a 4 to 1 majority when \n     voters pledged to extend the runway from 7,003 to 10,003 feet \n     to meet the needs of the Air National Guard, in 2006 when the \n     city's economic development authority purchased 74 acres of \n     residentially zoned, vacant property to preclude \n     encroachment, and when Battle Creek proactively contributed \n     resources and sought matching funds for the construction of a \n     new air traffic control tower to address line of sight issues \n     and construct a parallel runway to enhance safety; and\n       Whereas, The defense industry, including the Battle Creek \n     Air National Guard Base, the Hart-Dole-Inouye Federal Center, \n     and the Fort Custer Army National Guard Base, is integral to \n     the local community, and its components are vital, both as \n     symbols of civic pride and as cornerstones of the local \n     economy; and\n       Whereas, The defense industry is vital to the economy of \n     the city of Battle Creek, with approximately 3,000 local jobs \n     tied to defense; and\n       Whereas, The Battle Creek Air National Guard Base \n     contributes $22.2 million in total wages and salaries and a \n     total of $26 million in gross regional product to Calhoun \n     County; and\n       Whereas. More than $22 million in taxpayer funding has been \n     invested in the Battle Creek Air National Guard Base from \n     2001 to 2011, $16.7 million of which represents the federal \n     share and $5.2 million of which was invested by the state of \n     Michigan. The 110th Airlift Wing has been the recipient of \n     $477 million in operational funding from 2001 to 2011, \n     including military construction, personnel, and operations \n     and maintenance; and\n       Whereas, The existing infrastructure and trained personnel \n     at the Battle Creek Air National Guard base are ideally \n     suited to support the C 27J, and the Battle Creek Air \n     National Guard base is second to no other location in the \n     nation for C 27J mission support; and\n       Whereas, C 27J aircraft based in Southwest Michigan, due to \n     its central location, will provide superior response \n     capabilities in FEMA Region 5 and the region served by the \n     51st Civil Support Team; and\n       Whereas, Locating an MQ 1/9 RSO element at the Battle Creek \n     Air National Guard Base instead of the previously committed C \n     27J aircraft would result in a loss of approximately 70 jobs \n     with the 110th Airlift Wing; and\n       Whereas, Delivering neither the four C 27J aircraft or an \n     MQ I/9 RSO element to the Battle Creek Air National Guard \n     Base would result in significant harm to the economy of the \n     city of Battle Creek, as well as jeopardizing the significant \n     investments made by die citizens of Michigan and the United \n     States by making the Battle Creek Air National Guard Base \n     vulnerable to future Base Closure and Realignment Commission \n     (BRAC) recommendations; and\n       Whereas, The Battle Creek Air National Guard Base has \n     already been targeted for closure by the BRAC Commission. In \n     2005, as a result of recommendations by the BRAC Commission, \n     the Battle Creek Air National Guard Base lost 161 jobs and a \n     squadron of A 10 Thunderbolt II aircraft was reassigned to \n     Selfridge Air National Guard Base. The BRAC Commission also \n     considered the closure of the Hart-Dole-Inouye Federal Center \n     in Battle Creek, which houses integral elements of the \n     Defense Logistics Agency of the United States Department of \n     Defense; and\n       Whereas, The loss of employment positions with the 110th \n     Airlift Wing at the Battle Creek Air National Guard Base \n     would have a significant impact on the local economy; and\n       Whereas, Any negative impacts on the Battle Creek Air \n     National Guard Base would also have other serious \n     consequences, including potential ramifications for other \n     organizations that utilize W.K. Kellogg Airport, including \n     the Western Michigan University College of Aviation; and\n       Whereas, The Michigan House of Representatives has already \n     urged the United States Department of Defense to deliver no \n     fewer than four C 27J aircraft to the 110th Airlift Wing of \n     the Air National Guard in Battle Creek; and\n       Whereas, Any negative impact on the 110th Airlift Wing of \n     the Air National Guard at the Battle Creek Air National Guard \n     Base will have immeasurable consequences for the city of \n     Battle Creek and the state of Michigan, both in terms of \n     economic ramifications, as well as in terms of community \n     pride and disaster readiness: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we urge the \n     Congress of the United States to reconsider the \n     recommendations of the 2012 United States Air Force Structure \n     Change Report and to deliver no fewer than four C 27J \n     aircraft to the 110th Airlift Wing of the Air National Guard \n     as previously committed or, in the event that such aircraft \n     are not currently available, to deliver an MQ 1/9 RSO element \n     to the Battle Creek Air National Guard Base until such time \n     as no fewer than four C 27J aircraft become available, and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, United States Secretary \n     of Defense, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and \n     the members of the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM 88. A memorial adopted by the Legislature of the State \n     of Florida urging Congress to repeal the Sarbanes-Oxley Act \n     of 2002; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs.\n\n                        Senate Memorial No. 1822\n\n       Whereas, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was enacted on July 30, \n     2002, in Pub. L. No. 107 204, and\n       Whereas, the stated purpose of the act is ``to protect \n     investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of \n     corporate disclosures made pursuant to the securities laws . \n     . . ,'' and\n       Whereas, this federal legislation was passed with the best \n     of corrective intentions after the discovery of corporate \n     fraud and accounting scandals that cost investors and \n     retirees billions of dollars, and\n       Whereas, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, in spite of the good \n     intentions that motivated its passage, has created an \n     extremely complex maze of federal regulations that are costly \n     and damaging to public companies and diminish the companies' \n     ability to compete against foreign financial entities that \n     are not subject to its regulations, and\n       Whereas, the costs that businesses must bear to comply with \n     the extensive provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are \n     unnecessary and crippling, disproportionately affecting \n     smaller businesses, and\n\n[[Page S2965]]\n\n       Whereas, financial market scholars have observed that the \n     Sarbanes-Oxley Act has produced the unfortunate consequence \n     of discouraging American businesses from listing with New \n     York stock exchanges and listing instead in England where the \n     markets and stock exchanges are less heavily regulated, and\n       Whereas, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is a very costly example of \n     Federal Government intrusion that imposes unnecessary \n     regulatory costs on American businesses and interferes with \n     basic free market principles, and\n       Whereas, instead of preventing fraud and ensuring \n     transparency, the extensive regulations created by the \n     Sarbanes-Oxley Act have thwarted the creation of new public \n     companies, driven business away from domestic stock markets, \n     and cost the industrial sector billions of dollars: Now \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Legislature of the State of Florida, That \n     the Congress of the United States is urged to repeal the \n     Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to remove the damaging obstacles \n     that the act has created for American public companies and \n     replace it with reasonable non-intrusive measures to protect \n     investors; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this memorial be dispatched to the \n     President of the United States, to the President of the \n     United States Senate, to the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, and to each member of the Florida \n     delegation to the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM 89. A memorial adopted by the Legislature of the State \n     of Florida urging Congress to pass H.R. 2918, the Taiwan \n     Policy Act of 2011; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                        Senate Memorial No. 1486\n\n       Whereas, H.R. 2918, the Taiwan Policy Act of 2011, was \n     introduced on September 14, 2011, and is currently pending \n     before the 112th Congress, and\n       Whereas, H.R. 2918 seeks to encourage and strengthen the \n     commercial, cultural, and other interests between the people \n     of the United States and Taiwan, as set forth in the Taiwan \n     Relations Act which was enacted in 1979 (Public Law 96 8; 22 \n     U.S.C. ss. 3301 et seq.) and which has served for 33 years as \n     the foundation of United States-Taiwan relations, and\n       Whereas, we are reminded that the Taiwan Relations Act has \n     functioned to ensure peace and stability in the Western \n     Pacific and that it continues to be a priority of the United \n     States to maintain that international stability, and\n       Whereas, this nation must be vigilant to encourage the \n     secure future of Taiwan and must do all that is within our \n     ability to encourage the military self-defense capabilities \n     of Taiwan, and\n       Whereas, economically, Taiwan is the ninth largest trading \n     partner with the United States and that trade translated into \n     approximately $57 billion in 2010, and\n       Whereas, both nations realize that it is in the best \n     economic interests of the United States and in the national \n     security interests of Taiwan that these two nations continue \n     to cultivate the intricate ties between them: Now therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Florida, That \n     the Congress of the United States is urged to pass H.R. 2918, \n     the ``Taiwan Policy Act of 2011,'' in recognition that the \n     passage of the act is a necessary step toward nurturing and \n     maintaining the diverse interests that bind the people of the \n     United States and the people of Taiwan; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this memorial be dispatched to the \n     President of the United States, to the President of the \n     United States Senate, to the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, and to each member of the Florida \n     delegation to the United States Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/08/senate-section/article/S2965-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2965-S2968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. COONS:\n       S. 2839.

The new \n     individual tax would tax all income and other proceeds used \n     for consumption and exclude all saving.\n       (2) The business tax code shall apply the same rate as the \n     individual tax code, and shall levy tax on total revenue from \n     the domestic sale of goods and services less purchases of \n     goods and services from other firms less wages, salaries, and \n     related employee costs. All credits currently applicable to \n     business income would be repealed except the Alternative \n     Simplified Credit for research and development expenditures.\n       (3) Individuals and businesses would be subject to taxation \n     solely on income generated within the United States. A border \n     tax adjustment system would be developed in consultation with \n     the World Trade Organization to neutralize tax differences \n     for goods and services entering and leaving the United States \n     proper.\n       (4) Tax reform shall be enacted with due care through \n     transition provisions to avoid insofar as possible \n     retroactive tax increases or decreases arising from the \n     accrued tax consequences of decisions made under current tax \n     law.\n\n     SEC. 505.

RESCIND UNSPENT OR UNOBLIGATED BALANCES AFTER 36 \n                   MONTHS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) any adjustments of allocations and aggregates made \n     pursuant to this resolution shall require that any \n     unobligated or unspent allocations be rescinded after 36 \n     months;\n       (2) revised allocations and aggregates resulting from these \n     adjustments resulting from the required rescissions shall be \n     considered for the purposes of the Congressional Budget Act \n     of 1974 as allocations and aggregates contained in this \n     resolution; and\n       (3) for purposes of this resolution the levels of new \n     budget authority, outlays, direct spending, new entitlement \n     authority, revenues, deficits, and surpluses for a fiscal \n     year or period of fiscal years shall be determined on the \n     basis of estimates made by the Committee on the Budget of the \n     Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/08/senate-section/article/S2977-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n          COMMITTEE ON HEALTH, EDUCATION, LABOR, AND PENSIONS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

I am pleased that the Senate will pass the Brian Terry \nMemorial Act today, and that it has the overwhelming support of my \ncolleagues.\n  Agent Terry, a native of Flat Rock, MI, dedicated his life to public \nservice and the protection of our country and its citizens. He served \nhonorably in the U.S. Marine Corps and continued his service as a \npolice officer with the cities of Ecorse and Lincoln Park in Michigan \nprior to joining the U.S. Border Patrol. He was a member of the 699th \nSession of the Border Patrol Academy assigned to the Naco Border Patrol \nStation within the Tucson Sector. Tragically, in December 2010, while \non patrol 14 miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border, Agent Terry was \nshot and killed during an armed confrontation with suspected criminals.\n  Agent Terry gave everything in the defense of our country. As we sit \nhere today, thousands of agents are putting their lives on the line to \nsecure our borders and protect our Nation. Agent Terry exemplified that \ncourage and heroism, and we honor him today with this legislation that \nwill designate the station of the U.S. Border Patrol located at 2136 \nSouth Naco Highway in Bisbee, AZ, as the Brian A. Terry Border Patrol \nStation.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support of this worthy tribute to \nAgent Terry.\n  Ms. STABENOW.
