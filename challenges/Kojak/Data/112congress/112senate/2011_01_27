The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the prior order \nof the Chair be put in place again, that there be a quorum call that \nwould begin now and that the time be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, because of the time \ndelay here, that the recess not start until 1 o'clock rather than \n12:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate very much the courtesy of my two friends, the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Udall, and my dear friend \nfrom Oregon, Mr. Merkley, for being understanding. We had some word \nchanges. We were tied up on words. Senator McConnell had to work that \nout this morning. We were able to get that done just now. I appreciate \nthat very much. He is always very thoughtful and so easy to work with.\n  Our ability to debate and deliberate without restraints of time \nlimits is central and unique to the Senate. It is supposed to be that \nway. It is in our DNA. It is one of the many traits intentionally \ndesigned to distinguish this body from the House of Representatives and \nfrom every other legislative body in the world. It has always been \ncentral to the Senate, and it always should be.\n  But when that arrangement is abused, we have to do something not \nmerely in the name of efficiency or for the sake of a political party's \nfortunes\n\n[[Page S298]]\n\nin the next election, we have to act because when abuses keep us from \ndoing our work, they deter us from working together, and they stop us \nfrom working for the American people. And within these four walls, it \ndegrades the relationships that make the Senate run.\n\n  What is special about the Senate is that this body operates by \nconsensus. It runs on a fuel made of comity and trust. When abuses \nhappen or when colleagues act in bad faith, it dilutes and degrades \nthat fuel and the Senate stalls.\n  There are nearly as many opinions on what to do about the Senate as \nthere are Senators. Senators Harkin, Udall of New Mexico, and Merkley \nhave listened to many ideas and have worked to find solutions. I thank \nthem for their time, efforts, and energy. So have Senators Schumer and \nAlexander. No one has worked harder than they have to find a way out of \nthis crisis, and I admire and appreciate their efforts.\n  Leader McConnell and I have worked alongside all of them and with \neach other to find common ground.\n  In the spirit of compromise that we are trying to restore to the \nSenate, this is how we have agreed: As to secret holds, we have to get \nrid of secret holds.\n  Last year, a single Senator held up 70 nominations. Why? Because of \nsome parochial issue in his State that had nothing to do with what we \nwere trying to do in approving nominations. The standoff finally ended \nbut only after it became public. What he did was within his right, but \nit was not the right thing to do, and the rule has to be changed.\n  Senators will no longer be able to hide, and the light of day will \nshine harder on the Senate as a body. I thank Senators Wyden, Grassley, \nand McCaskill for their leadership on this subject.\n  About nominations, we have to recognize that public servants are not \npolitical pawns. An appointment by the President to a Federal agency is \na great honor. In recent years, it has become a sentence to purgatory.\n  The Senate no longer efficiently performs our constitutional duty of \nconfirming nominees. That leaves important offices without leaders, \nleaves important duties unfulfilled, and unfairly leaves in limbo well-\nqualified nominees.\n  The Senate is responsible for confirming about 300 nominees to part-\ntime boards and commissions. Every one of these nominees to boards and \ncommissions requires the approval of the Senate. Because of that, the \nvetting process for these boards and commissions takes an inordinate \namount of time. They spend as much time as the FBI does and other \npeople who do the background checks on these part-time jobs as they do \nsomeone who is going to become an Assistant Secretary or a judge, and \nit just eats up time that is unnecessary. There is no reason for \nSenators to keep them from their posts. But that is exactly what \nhappens. It is not always the fault of the Senators.\n  We have to get rid of as many of these nominations as we can, and \nthat is what the Rules Committee leadership is recommending. Senator \nSchumer, the chairman, and Senator Alexander, the ranking member, have \ncome up with something I think is so very important. They are going to \nhelp us get rid of about one-third of these nominations, not only these \nto part-time boards and commissions but others.\n  This process needs to be changed. We will work to cut by about one-\nthird the number of executive nominations that require the Senate's \napproval. Senators Schumer and Alexander, as I indicated, are the \nleaders of this issue as far as what we have done to this point.\n  This legislation will be turned over, and they will be working with \nSenators Lieberman and Collins, who are the chairman and ranking member \nof the committee of jurisdiction at this stage, to develop legislation \nthat will do what I have outlined.\n  Third, we cannot afford to waste time for the sake of wasting time. \nOne of the minority's favorite tactics has been to force or threaten to \nforce the clerks to read amendments.\n  My colleagues will note that I said ``one of the minority's favorite \ntactics has been to force or threaten to force the clerks to read \namendments.'' I did not say ``the Republicans' favorite tactic has been \nto force or threaten to force the clerks to read amendments.'' We have \nall threatened to do it. It is wrong, and it has to stop. That is what \nwe are going to do later today.\n  To have these amendments read is nothing short of showmanship. In \nthis day and age, it is almost always totally unnecessary. In the 18th \nand 19th centuries, when Senators' offices were their desks--that is \nall they had; they did not have offices like we have. Their offices \nwere right here on the Senate floor, so hearing a clerk read aloud a \nbill was probably a more essential--and that is an understatement--part \nof the debate. Today that is no longer the case.\n  During the health reform debate two Decembers ago, while snow covered \nWashington and Christmas neared, opponents of the bill worked hard to \ndelay its inevitable passage.\n  On a Saturday toward the end of the debate, the minority forced the \nnonpartisan Senate clerks to read the entirety of an important \namendment to the bill. The reading started just before 8:30 a.m. and \nlasted until just before 4 p.m. That is more than 7 hours of time \nduring which nobody listened to the reading of a bill everyone had \nalready studied. It had been filed a long time before, and it was after \neach Senator had already decided how he or she would vote anyway.\n  We do not have time for these kinds of gratuitous delays. So the \nthird change we will make is this: If an amendment has already been \nfiled, a Senator cannot force its reading.\n  Finally, as to what we call around here inside politics, motions to \nproceed and filling the tree--let me talk a little bit about these two \nitems. I have often expressed my concerns about the procedural hurdle \nof forcing a preliminary vote simply to determine whether we can have a \nsecond vote to determine whether we can debate a bill--the vote called \ncloture on the motion to proceed. It is another one of the most \ncommonly used tactics deployed simply to frustrate progress and waste \ntime.\n  Last Congress, we had 26 cloture votes on motions to proceed. Most \nall of them were bills that were not controversial. We had to hold a \nvote on whether to hold a vote on whether to debate a bill to promote \ntourism coming to our country called the Travel Promotion Act. After \nwasting days of precious time, it passed 90 to 3.\n  We had to jump through the same hoops before we could vote on \nextending emergency unemployment benefits, which passed with 87 votes, \nand before we could vote on letting the FDA regulate tobacco, which \npassed with 84 votes, and before we could vote on updating our food \nsafety laws for the first time in a century, which passed with 75 \npercent of the Senate.\n  Democrats are bothered by how often Republicans have forced \nprocedural votes such as those on cloture on the motion to proceed. I \nknow Republicans are equally frustrated with me for filling the \namendment tree on occasion. Their argument is--and they are right--it \nprevents amendments from being offered.\n  This agreement Leader McConnell and I have reached is going to clean \nup a lot of them. Just as I will exercise restraint in using my right \nas majority leader to fill the amendment tree, he and his Republican \nconference will curtail their habit of filibustering the motion to \nproceed. Both practices should be the exception rather than the rule. \nAnd starting now, they will be.\n  I will conclude again expressing my appreciation to those parties who \nhave been so heavily involved in this effort: Senators Udall, Merkley, \nHarkin, of course my friend from Tennessee, Lamar Alexander, and Chuck \nSchumer.\n  Especially, I wish to express my appreciation to the Republican \nleader. As we have said on this floor lots of times, what most all of \nthe American public sees us doing is fighting. We are here arguing on \nbehalf of a Senator on our side or a problem we have on our side. But \nmuch of the work done in this body is done by Senator McConnell and \nmyself in my office or his office trying to work through some of these \nproblems. They take a lot of time, and they take our patience and the \npatience of the entire Senate. That is why I started my remarks this \nmorning telling everyone I appreciate their understanding as we are \ntrying to work out these issues.\n\n[[Page S299]]\n\n  We have been working on this effort a long time. These changes are \nimportant. I appreciate the attitude of my friend, the Republican \nleader, in recognizing we have to make some progress.\n  The changes we will agree to today are, one, secret holds; two, \nreducing by one-third the number of executive nominations that are \nsubject to Senate delays; three, ending the time-consuming practice of \nreading aloud amendments that have been publicly available for 3 days; \nfour, limiting the use of filibusters on motions to proceed; and, \nfifth, filling the amendment tree only when necessary.\n  I know some want us to go even further. There are just as many \narguments for not going too far. But remember this: We are making these \nchanges in the name of compromise, and this agreement itself was \nconstructed with the same respect for mutual concession.\n  Senator McConnell and I both believe our reverence for this \ninstitution must always be more important than our respective political \nparties. And as part of this compromise, we have agreed I will not \nforce a majority vote to fundamentally change the Senate--that is the \nso-called constitutional option--and he will not in the future.\n  The five reforms we are making, however, are very significant. They \nwill move us five steps closer to a healthier Senate--in the minds of \nmany, not far enough; in the minds of some, too far. But that is what \nthe Senate is all about. It is about compromise, consensus building.\n  Yes, we want the Senate to move deliberately, but if we want it to \nmove we have to find a balance that encourages us to debate but also \nenables us to legislate. We are governed by a delicate mix of rules, \nrights, and responsibilities in this body. To that mix, we need to add \nrespect.\n  The Senate should function as the Founders intended it to function \nand as the country needs it to function, not simply as slowly as the \nrules will allow it to function.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the colloquy which the majority \nleader and I are working on at the moment will reflect the entirety of \nour understanding. But with regard to comments about how we got to this \nplace, let me just say, first to my good friend from Nevada, on several \noccasions I heard both him and the President of the United States talk \nabout how much was accomplished in the last Congress. I am often \nperplexed as to which was the case. Either an extraordinary amount of \nlegislation was passed and signed or the Senate was obstructing. They \ncould not both be true.\n  I suspect the real view that most historians will have is that the \nlast Congress passed a great deal of very significant legislation. Then \nwe had a referendum on that November 2, and the American people changed \nthe equation.\n  Without getting back into that or a litany of complaints by the \nminority--the Senate has heard them before. The principal complaint the \nminority has had over the last 2 years is the number of times the tree \nhas been filled and we have been unable to offer amendments. We are all \naware of grievances on both sides.\n  As is often the case in the Senate, we have worked together through \nSenator Alexander and Senator Schumer to come to an agreement as to how \nthe Senate will go forward and the procedures that will be employed. We \nwill have votes later, consistent with the precedents of the Senate, at \nthe thresholds that are required under Senate rules. Then we will move \non with the people's business.\n  I am optimistic that my good friend, the majority leader, and I can \nconvince our colleagues that we ought to get back to operating as the \nSenate did as recently as 3 or 4 years ago. When bills came up, they \nwere open for amendments, we voted on amendments, and at some point the \nbill would be completed. I know we can do that. I think it is the right \nway for the Senate to operate.\n  I thank my friend, the majority leader, for his leadership in working \nthrough this difficult period of rules consideration.\n  I say to my colleagues in closing that the colloquy which we will \nhave will reflect the entirety of our understanding as to how we go \nforward. Then we will have the votes later which will give the Senate a \nchance to go on record about some changes that have been agreed to and \nsome that are being proposed that are not agreed to.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, first I thank both our leader, Harry \nReid, and our minority leader, Mitch McConnell, for their leadership \nand guidance. They are walking out together, and that is a good \nmetaphor for what has happened today. I thank my colleague, Lamar \nAlexander, as well. Under the two leaders' authorization, we talked \nand, of course, in constant touch with them, worked out this agreement.\n  I rise to speak in support of the bipartisan agreement on Senate \nrules reform. It is an important step forward in changing the way we do \nbusiness in the Senate.\n  Last year, the Rules Committee held six hearings on the filibuster. \nWe heard about the history of the filibuster and what happened and how \nit had gone out of control. Those hearings were requested, actually, by \na member of the Rules Committee, Tom Udall, the Senator from New \nMexico, and it is why we embarked on the hearings. And I very much \nappreciate his suggestion that we do that.\n\n  At the hearings, Democrats brought up that the majority was no longer \nable to move forward to consider bills by filibusters on motions to \nproceed, and Republicans argued that they were too often blocked from \noffering amendments by the majority filling the tree. Both sides had \nlegitimate complaints. What couldn't be disputed was that, in many \nways, the Senate was broken. It had become harder and harder for the \nbody to consider, debate, and decide on legislation and nominations \nthat it is supposed to take care of.\n  It is true what Senator McConnell said--that we had a very productive \nsession. But that doesn't gainsay the fact that there were 74 \nfilibusters and that many issues that should have been decided weren't \ndecided, and that the Senate, to many, may not be functioning in the \nway it used to, with debate being stifled by both the majority and the \nminority, and so we resolved this.\n  When I first came to the Senate 12 years ago, a senior Senator pulled \nme aside and said the role of the majority is to set the agenda. They \nput bills on the floor and they are debated. And the role of the \nminority is to offer amendments to change the legislation. We are not \ndoing that much anymore. What usually happens is we offer a bill, and \nthe minority says, we don't want it. They may say, we don't want it \nbecause Democrats have refused to allow unlimited amendments; whereas \nwe think they do not want it because they may just want to gum up the \nSenate. But whatever the reason, both sides have legitimate complaints \nhere and we are trying to resolve some of those. So clearly, the time \nfor change has come. I believe the reforms we are adopting today give \nus a very good chance to go back to the way of operating where we had \nreal debate on bills and amendments and votes on bills and amendments.\n  This won't happen overnight, and both sides will still use the \nprocedural tools available to them on the most important issues. But we \nhope it will work well enough to get us back on track. Leaders Reid and \nMcConnell in the colloquy they will put forward--which Senator \nAlexander and I participated in framing--will do two things, in \naddition to the changes that we will make. One, each will say we should \nuse the motion to proceed to block bills from coming to the floor \ninfrequently, and the majority will say we should use filling the tree \nto block amendments that might come forward on those bills \ninfrequently.\n  Obviously, we are going to have to watch to see how this works over \nthe next several months. And, obviously, there will be times when each \nside decides they have to use the right that the Senate gives them to \nblock things. But the presumption will be that in the usual course of \nbusiness we will not do that; that they will be the exception, not the \nrule.\n  A second thing that will be stated by both leaders is whoever is in \nthe majority next Congress will not try to change the rules by simple \nmajority in\n\n[[Page S300]]\n\nthis Congress or next. Some on our side were worried if we didn't try \nto invoke the constitutional option, should the other side get the \nmajority--and I don't personally think we have to worry about that or \nthat it will happen anyway, but should that happen, then they might \ninvoke it and do something else, so why not do it now? Well, both \nleaders have agreed they will not do that. Without leader support, it \nis virtually impossible for it to get done.\n  So that is a significant change, and when the colloquy is presented \nin the Record, we will see both leaders have agreed to that. I want to \nthank them for providing strong leadership and guidance throughout this \nprocess.\n  I became convinced, working with my good friend, the Senator from \nTennessee, and having plenty of conversations with my friend and Leader \nHarry Reid, and a few with Senator McConnell, that everybody wanted to \ncome to an agreement here. Everyone wanted to see the Senate work \nbetter, and that made me feel pretty good regarding what we did here.\n  Second, I want to recognize the many Senators from my party who \nworked tirelessly to identify the momentum for change, and at the head \nof the list, of course, are Tom Udall, Jeff Merkley, and Tom Harkin. \nThey worked very hard on these issues. Two of them are newer in the \nSenate--freshmen--and one has much more experience than I do in the \nSenate, Senator Harkin, and they all worked hard to see that we changed \nthe rules.\n  While the changes aren't everything they would have liked or I would \nhave liked, certainly the changes we are getting, not insignificant at \nall, are because Tom Udall started pushing this idea when he got here \nto the Senate. I think his predecessor, Clinton Anderson, had done some \nof this, and Jeff Merkley and Tom Harkin joined in the cause early on \nand actually brought us to the point where the inertia of not doing \nanything would no longer govern and we would get together to get \nsomething done.\n  There were other Senators who played a very important role: Senator \nLautenberg, with his proposals; Michael Bennet, Mark Udall, and Al \nFranken all had proposals and all played a very significant role here \nand can feel very good about the changes we have wrought.\n  I particularly want to thank Senator Klobuchar for leading the \nworking group of Senators who spent hours reviewing and refining. \nWithout all of them, I don't think the agreement would have been \npossible.\n  I would make one other point, and this is a disappointment to me, so \nI will make it for myself. One idea championed by the reform-minded \nSenators I thought made eminent sense is the talking filibuster. It \ndidn't change the balance in the Senate, it simply said that if you \nwere going to filibuster, you had to stay on the floor and talk. You \ncouldn't just be there and object.\n  The American public understands when a Senator wants to filibuster a \nbill, that Senator should be required to stand up and talk on the \nSenate floor. I strongly support the talking filibuster. We sometimes \ncall it the Jimmy Stewart talking filibuster, because everyone \nrecognizes that from the movie. I believe it would pull back the \ncurtain on the kind of filibusters we have now. We wouldn't change the \nrule of 60, but the filibustering Senator and his supporters right now \ndon't even have to show up or talk for a vote. This talking filibuster \nis one change I hope the Senate will adopt in the future because it \nmakes good sense and we should do it.\n  I don't believe we should eliminate the filibuster altogether, but we \nneed to make it real. The talking filibuster proposals would do that, \nand I hope someday we will make the talking filibuster part of the \nSenate rules, and I will vote for that resolution that will be on the \nfloor later today. Of course, it will need two-thirds to pass.\n  Finally, I wanted to thank Senator Alexander. He and I have been \nfriends before this, but we worked together being here throughout the \nholidays, vacations, and recesses, and he was creative, he was \nflexible, as always, he was congenial and, as usual, he was smart. His \nconcern for this institution helped bring the minority and the majority \ntogether, and I very much appreciate Senator Alexander's role.\n  Senator Reid outlined the other parts of the bipartisan proposal--the \nend to secret holds, which will be done by rule; the end of reading of \namendments filed for at least 72 hours, also done by rule; and the \nthird proposal is to limit the number of executive nominations--there \nare so many. About 30 percent of the total we propose to eliminate. He \nand I, and Senators Lieberman and Collins, who have the jurisdiction in \ntheir committee, will introduce a bill that we hope to move quickly. We \nhave gotten the agreement from the House that they will move the bill, \nand we should eliminate confirmation on so many of these positions that \nshouldn't require confirmation, such as members of part-time boards and \ncommissions, officials who handle legislative or public affairs, and \nthings such as that, and I want to thank Senators Lieberman and Collins \nfor that.\n  Finally, as chairman of the Rules Committee, I believe there is more \nwe can do. I want to see our efforts at reform continue. I wish to \ncontinue working on the streamlining of confirmation of nominations, \nboth executive and judicial, and our Rules Committee will continue to \nlook at that.\n  Change doesn't come often or easily to the Senate, but we are here \nbecause many Members worked hard on reform, and both parties, \ncontinuing the feeling of bipartisanship that began in the lameduck and \nI think has continued through the State of the Union speech, are \ncontinuing again today. I hope our efforts will make a difference. I \nhope the Senate will function better, and I am very hopeful that with \nthese changes, both formal and informal, they will.\n  We know there are still sharp differences within our body on issues, \nand those won't disappear. On certain bills, both sides will use every \nprocedural tactic that makes the Senate a different body than the \nHouse, but hopefully, on most, we won't.\n  In conclusion, while those of us who wanted reform in the Senate \ndidn't get everything we wanted, the Senate will be a significantly \nbetter place for the changes we are enacting. As a result of this \nagreement, there should be more debate, more votes, fewer items blocked \nby a single Senator or small minority of Senators. Make no mistake \nabout it, this agreement is not a panacea, but it is a very significant \nstep on the road to making the Senate function in a better, fairer way.\n  Again, I thank all of my colleagues who participated in this effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from New \nYork, the Senators from New Mexico and Oregon, and Senator Harkin of \nIowa for their efforts--some over many years--to achieve two goals: to \nhelp make the Senate a place that is better able to deal with the \nserious business that comes before us, and second, to preserve the \nSenate as a unique forum--unique in the world, really--as a legislative \nbody that protects minority rights.\n  This is an important step forward--the reform of the Senate--but the \nreform the Senate needs is a change in behavior, not in its rules. \nThese rules move us in the right direction, but the behavior that the \nSenator from New York spoke about and that the majority leader and the \nminority leader spoke about is what, in the end, will make the most \ndifference.\n  I have talked with many Senators on both sides of the aisle. We have \ndone a lot of talking both on the floor here and off the floor about \nwhere the Senate is today, and a great many of us feel the Senate is a \nshadow of its former self in terms of its ability to function as a \ntruly deliberative body.\n  It is hard to see how the majority can complain after a legislative \nsession where they passed health care legislation, financial reform \nlegislation, and other legislation that may have even resulted in the \ndiminishing of their numbers. They had a productive session, from their \npoint of view. But the truth is, on both sides of the aisle--on both \nsides of the aisle--we wish to see the Senate function in a different \nway.\n  The majority leader and the Republican leader have put out in a \ncolloquy what that way is, and that will govern what we do. But \nbasically, I believe it is this: We want the same thing--a Senate where \nmost bills are considered by committee, where most bills come to the \nfloor as a result of bipartisan cooperation, where most bills are then\n\n[[Page S301]]\n\ndebated and amended and then voted upon.\n  To someone who may have just tuned into the Senate, they may say: \nWell, that is a very simple solution. I thought that is what the Senate \nwas supposed to be. It is what the Senate is supposed to be. It wasn't \nso long ago that it was the standard operating procedure. Senator \nMcConnell said it was just a few years ago. He and Senator Reid have \nboth been here a number of years.\n  I remember watching the Senate--and I have mentioned this before in \nthis debate--between 1977 and 1985, when Howard Baker of Tennessee and \nRobert Byrd of West Virginia were the Republican and Democratic \nleaders. I had worked for Senator Baker before that as a legislative \nassistant. I knew Senator Byrd. Here is what went on then, and here is \nwhat could go on today: Most pieces of legislation that came to the \nfloor started in committee. That gave us a chance to see what they did \nand to improve them and to hear from voices from all over the country. \nThat legislation then came to the floor.\n  During Senator Baker's day, when he was the majority leader, he would \nrarely bring a bill to the floor unless both the Republican chairman \nand the Democratic ranking member supported it because he didn't want \nto waste the Senate's time. He knew that the Senate's 60-vote \nrequirement forces consensus.\n  People talk about the filibuster. But what we have is a requirement \nthat most important bills get 60 votes. If you are sitting with 53 \nDemocrats and 47 Republicans, you don't have to have an advanced degree \nin mathematics to figure out if you don't have some Democrats and some \nRepublicans, you don't get to 60.\n  So Senator Baker was saying back in the 1980s, bring the bill to the \nfloor if it has the Republican chairman and the Democratic ranking \nmember's support. Then the call would go out for amendments, and \nsometimes there would be 300 amendments filed.\n  The Senator from North Carolina or Tennessee might file 40. And no \none said: Whoa, stop. You cannot do that. Instead, they said: Bring \nthem on in. Sometimes there would be 300 amendments. Then Senator Baker \nor Senator Byrd would ask for unanimous consent to close off \namendments. Well, I guess because the Senators by that time were \nexhausted from writing amendments, they all agreed to it, and then they \nstarted voting.\n  Now, it got to be Wednesday or Thursday, and the party secretaries \nwould go to the Senators and they would say: I notice you still have 30 \namendments waiting. Maybe you would only like to offer 15. It might get \nto Friday, and they would say: I notice you have five left. Maybe you \nwould only like to have one. But if they had one they wanted to get, \nthey almost always got the amendment. That is what the real importance \nof this agreement is today.\n  The difference of opinion we have had that has caused us to \ndegenerate, in some cases, to a body that has not functioned as well as \nit should has been because on that side of the aisle--the majority--\npeople did not want to vote. It is like joining the Grand Ole Opry and \nsaying: I do not want to sing. Some Republican Senator might offer an \namendment that side does not want to vote on, and they say, well, we do \nnot want to vote or they say, well, we do not want to work on Friday. \nSo they go home. And they put pressure on the majority leader to use a \nprocedure called filling the tree which cuts off votes and the right to \namend. The majority leader used that power to cut off all amendments \nand debate 44 times. That's more than the last 6 majority leaders \ncombined. Then what happens over here? Well, then Republican Senators, \nnow in the minority, say: Well, we are not going to get amendments; we \nare going to start objecting. So we have what is called a lot of \nfilibusters. We say: You are counting filibusters when you cut off our \nright to offer amendments. They say: You guys over there are keeping us \nfrom doing our business. On both sides, there is some truth to what has \nbeen said.\n  So I think most Senators are happy with this result. I think they \nwill be. I hope it works. I mean, the idea would be that the leaders \nwill do their best to see that most bills go to committee, come to the \nfloor, and that when they do, if the Senator from North Carolina has an \namendment the Senator from Tennessee would rather not vote on, she \noffers it anyway if she wants to, or if I have one she would rather not \nvote on, I may offer it anyway because it is important to the people of \nmy State, even though we might be in a political minority at the \nmoment. I believe that in most cases, if most Senators in the minority \nhave that opportunity, that will help us get back to the kind of Senate \nwe want to see.\n  I wish to compliment Senator Udall, Senator Merkley, and Senator \nHarkin. I learned a long time ago in life that if you start out in one \ndirection, you do not always get exactly where you want to go, but you \ndo not get anywhere if you do not start out. I think what they have \ndone with their intelligence and diligence and persistence in this has \ncreated a period of time here where the Senate is taking some steps \ntoday that will help the people of this country know that serious \nissues--and we have plenty of them--the debt, for example, where 42 \ncents out of every dollar we spend is borrowed; jobs, for example, and \nin my State we have had 24 months of 9-percent unemployment or higher--\nthese changes will help us deal better with those issues. I will have \nmore opportunity to talk about those after lunch later this afternoon. \nI want my friends on the other side to have a chance to make their \npoints before we adjourn or take a recess for an hour.\n  Fundamentally, the steps we are taking make a difference. The one I \nam especially glad to see is the effort to make it easier for a \nPresident--any President--to staff his or her government. One of the \nproblems--and Senator Reid talked about it--is we confirm too many \npeople. It is not necessary for us to confirm the PR officer for a \nminor department. There is no need for that. The Secretary needs to go \nahead and be able to appoint that person. We need to be able to work on \nmore important issues.\n  Secondly, we have created a phenomenon in this town that I refer to \nas ``innocent until nominated.'' We have created a situation where any \ncitizen who is invited by the President to serve in his government has \nto run such a gauntlet that it is almost impossible to get to the end \nof the gauntlet without being branded as a criminal. The reason is, we \nhave a maze of conflicting forms in the executive branch, plus an IRS \naudit, and a maze of conflicting forms in the Senate. It not only \ndelays, but it traps people and it tricks people into filling out one \ndefinition of ``income'' here and another one there. We all know this \nis true. We all know it needs to be fixed.\n  We have tried to fix it before--not just some of us; the majority \nleader and the Republican leader tried to fix it, and they didn't get \nit done. Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins tried to fix it, and \nthey could not get it done. And 2 years ago, at a bipartisan breakfast \nwhich Senator Lieberman and I hosted, we had a whole group of us who \nsaid: Let's try to get this done. We talked to President Obama's \nadministration about it. They said: Sure, go ahead. We would like to \nsee that happen, either for us or for the next President. But we could \nnot get it done because of resistance in this body to giving up any \nsort of power.\n  Right now, we have a unique confluence of support for the idea of \nmaking it easier for any President to staff his or her government. The \nmajority leader and the Republican leader are solidly behind the \neffort. Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins are solidly behind the \neffort. Senator Schumer and I are working on a bill to do that, and we \nhope we can succeed. This opportunity, this window would not have \nhappened if it had not been for the work of the Senators who have been \narguing for reforms.\n  The other step we are likely to take is abolishing the secret hold. I \nthink that is a good idea. I speak from experience. When I was \nnominated by the first President Bush to be Education Secretary, a \nSenator put a hold on my name, and it took 3 months to get it off. I \nfinally found out who it was. I never knew exactly why he did it or why \nhe took it off, but it might have helped if I had known it a little \nearlier. So I think it is a good idea. The majority leader put a hold \non one of my TVA nominees, but he did it publicly. So I put a hold on \none of his nominees, and\n\n[[Page S302]]\n\nI did it publicly. And we worked it out. So there is nothing wrong with \nasserting our rights, but we might as well do it in public. I \ncongratulate the Senators for making that effort. Senator Wyden and \nSenator Grassley have been working for more than a decade on that, as \nwell as other Senators.\n  The step that says that if an amendment has been filed and on the \nInternet for 72 hours, we cannot require the clerks to read it all \nnight long--that is a very commonsense proposal. I know it will be \ngreatly appreciated by the employees of the Senate who have the job of \nreading the amendment. If they had a chance to vote, this would \nprobably be the resolution on which they would like to have a chance to \nvote yes.\n  So these are important steps in the right direction which we will \nhave a chance to talk about more today as the debate goes on. But I \nwould like to end where I began. What we need most in the Senate is a \nchange in behavior in addition to this change in rules. We need to \npreserve the Senate as a forum for minority rights. We need to preserve \nthe 60-vote requirement for major votes. That will force consensus. \nThat will cause us to work together. That will build support out in the \ncountry for the result of what we do because they can see that both \nRepublicans and Democrats think, for example, that the way we have gone \nabout trying to make Social Security solvent is a good way, rather than \none side or the other just jamming through their partisan way.\n  There is a reason it is a good idea for this not to be a body that \noperates by a simply majority as the House does. I mean, the House can \nrepeal the health care bill overnight. Bring it over to the Senate, and \nthat side says: Let's stop and think about it. The House, if it is \nDemocratic, can repeal the secret ballot in union elections overnight, \nand it did with its vote in the last Congress. But when it came over \nhere, the Republican side said: Let's stop and think about it. The \nAmerican people are better served by having these two different kinds \nof bodies, and the Senate and the American people will be better served \nboth by the rules changes we are likely to adopt this afternoon and \nespecially by the agreement by the majority leader and the Republican \nleader, which I feel confident has the backing of almost all of us, \nthat we would like to work in a Senate where most bills are considered \nby committee, where most bills come to the floor, and where Senators, \nmost of the time, have an opportunity to offer their amendments and \ndebate. To be sure, there will be times when, if it is repeal of health \ncare, that side does everything it can to exercise its rights to stop \nit, or if it is repeal of the secret ballot in union elections, this \nside will do everything we can to exercise our rights to stop it. But \nthat will not be the ordinary course of events if this works the way we \nhope it does.\n  So I hope my friends on the other side feel good about what they have \ndone. They have not achieved everything they sought to achieve, but we \nrarely ever do, particularly in a body of 100 that operates by consent \nof 100. What they have done, I believe, in addition to the rules \nchanges we are likely to adopt, is create a window in which we have had \na good, open discussion about the kind of place we want to work, the \nkind of Senate we hope would serve the American people the best, and we \nhave come to a consensus about a change in behavior, which I believe in \nthe end will be more important than the change in the rules.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, before Senator Alexander \nleaves, and I know we have our conferences, and I guess we are going to \ngo to about 1:00 today, I would like to thank him for all of his \nefforts. I really look forward to Senator Alexander being the ranking \nmember--I believe he is going to be the ranking member--on the Rules \nCommittee now that Bob Bennett has moved on to other things. He has \nparticipated in many of these hearings. I look forward to continuing \nthe exchange on rules that we have had. I do not think this is the end \nof the rules debate. I think that is why we have a full-time Rules \nCommittee to take a look at this.\n  I hope these new Senators who are listening to us today--whom you are \ngoing to talk to on your side, I am sure, in about 15 minutes--that \nthey look at our rules and offer suggestions and that we still continue \nthis discussion in the Rules Committee.\n  I thank all of the leaders who came down here today and talked.\n  Senator Reid and Senator McConnell have announced an agreement. We \nare moving forward with reforms.\n  Senator Schumer has been a real champion on rules reform. I remember \ngoing to him and asking for hearings, and he said: Well, what kinds of \nhearings are we looking at? What do we want to do? And I explained to \nhim, went through--we need to talk about the history of the filibuster. \nYou know, the filibuster was not in the original Senate. There were \nrules for 17 years where you had what was called a motion to order the \nprevious question. That is a majority motion to cut off debate. And \nthen later it was changed. So I said: We have to get the history out \nthere for everybody to see because some of these charges are not very \naccurate. And he was a champion. He allowed us to do six hearings. We \nbrought in constitutional scholars. Both sides participated, and it was \nvery productive.\n  So here we are at the beginning of a Congress, and we have been \npressing--with my good colleague and friend from Oregon--for rules \nreform through the Constitution, relying on the Constitution. In \narticle I, section 5 of the Constitution, it gives us the power and the \nauthority--a majority of us at the beginning of an organizing session--\nto determine what rules we function under for the next 2 years. That is \nthe exercise in which we have been engaged.\n\n  Both the Senator from Oregon and I realize if we hadn't utilized our \nrights under the Constitution, if we hadn't pushed this very hard and \nsaid we are trying to round up 51 Senators who will stand with us and \nsay they want change in this institution, we want to get back to being \nthe greatest deliberative body, we want to consider all the important \nbills in a timely way--budget bills, appropriations bills--by utilizing \nour constitutional option or our rights under the Constitution, we have \ncome a long way in 1 year. We have had many debates in our caucus. We \nhave had many discussions.\n  We are not exactly where the Senator and I think we should be at this \nparticular point in time. These reforms--and let me say, these reforms \nare steps forward and in some ways significant. The fact that we are \ngetting rid of secret holds, if we have that vote today and get 60 \nvotes, is a good thing. Nominations, letting the President get his team \nin place, that is a good thing. Reading of amendments, my cousin, \nSenator Mark Udall, is involved in that. The motion to proceed, the \ngentlemen's agreement on the motion to proceed and filling the tree, \nthat is a significant step in behavior to say: Let's change our \nbehavior, and then the fact that we will have votes today on S. Res. \n10, on the Merkley talking filibuster and the Harkin proposal, these \nare significant votes to be taken and significant steps forward.\n  I strongly disagree with one thing announced here, the idea that the \ntwo leaders are taking off the table us utilizing our constitutional \nrights. That was what was announced. I think we both heard it the same \nway. Leader McConnell and Leader Reid both said they are not going to \nrely on a majority vote for rules in the future, no matter who is in \npower and what is happening.\n  The beauty of the Constitution--and we all realize this--is that is a \ngood agreement for them. It doesn't apply to 98 other Senators. Each \nSenator under the Constitution has his or her right to rely on those \nconstitutional rights. I urge, as has been done every time in the past \nwhen we have had a movement for change on rules, that it be bipartisan. \nWe are seeking 51 Senators who will join with us. Because if 51 \nSenators join at the beginning of a Congress and say they want rules \nreform, they want this place to function better, they want to do the \npeople's work better, they want to take up some House bills, the 400 \nbills that died, they want to do appropriations bills in a timely way--\nall these things are very important to a better functioning Senate, and \na better functioning Senate is all about the people's work.\n\n[[Page S303]]\n\n  I know the Senator from Oregon has some initial comments. But I \nthought we could talk about the idea that we have moved a long way. We \nhave pushed the constitutional option. I don't think there is any doubt \nthat he and I are giving up on our constitutional rights. Other \nSenators can say what they want to do, but we are going to stand and \nutilize our rights as we move down the road. We are hoping we will be \nat a place where we have 51 Senators, Democrats and Republicans, who \nwill continue to look at this and find a better way to make this \ninstitution work in terms of modern issues, modern times. I think we \nare kind of stuck back in another century with some of these rules. We \nneed to bring it up to date.\n  With that, the Senator from Oregon and I are going to engage in a \ncolloquy, but I know he had some additional comments. I am happy to \nyield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I thank my colleague from New Mexico \nfor his leadership on the constitutional option. Some may ponder how it \nis that we have come to have this constitutional argument at this \nmoment. As he has noted, under the Constitution, this body is empowered \nto organize itself. That is not that those who spoke 100 years ago or \n50 years ago get to tell us how to operate but that we today in this \nChamber have the power of the Constitution to organize ourselves. There \nis little question from constitutional scholars about this \nunderstanding of the very plain words written by our forefathers as \nthey designed this institution. Indeed, they were clear, when \nsupermajority requirements were set--supermajority for overriding a \nPresidential veto, supermajority for impeachment, supermajority for \ntreaties--but a simple majority to pass bills, a simple majority to \npass amendments, a simple majority to adopt the rules by which we \nfunction. Indeed, that is exactly what the first Congress did. They \nused a simple majority to adopt their rules, and they extended to each \nother a courtesy to hear each other out, those 26 Senators coming from \n13 States. They heard each other out so they could make better \ndecisions.\n  Over time that courtesy has grown to be informally entrenched in a \nSenate rule that says shutting down debate takes a supermajority. But \nwhen that was done, it went hand in hand with a social contract to \nunderstand that such power for one Senator to shut down this body--to \nrequire a supermajority, delay action for a week--would be a power \nrarely used, a power used in courtesy and respect to other Members, \nthat it would only be used for the most important issues, the highest \nissues of concern to one's particular State or to the future of the \nNation. That social contract is what has disappeared that went hand in \nhand with the rule, with the supermajority.\n  Let me display a simple chart that shows the deterioration of that \nsocial contract. Here we are with the average number of cloture \nmotions--that is, to shut down debate--filed. The average from 1900 to \n1970 on was one per year. In the 1970s, it went to 16. We can see how \nthis grows over time until in the 1990s we were at 36, in the 2000s at \n48, and these last 2 years, 68 per year. This is the change from the \ncourtesy of hearing each other out to using a supermajority as an \ninstrument of legislative destruction to blockade a good debate, to \nblockade the will of the majority, to blockade and paralyze the Senate \nas a whole.\n  Recognizing this damage that meant that no appropriations bills were \nadopted last year, that no budget was adopted, that 400 House bills lay \ncollecting dust on the floor rather than being processed and voted on, \nthat more than 100 nominations were never acted on and that we failed \nin our constitutional duty to advise and consent, it is in recognizing \nall that--it was particularly apparent as new Members of the Senate \nobserving this--that something had to be done. That is why I was so \nimpressed when the Senator from New Mexico stepped forward and said: We \nwill use the power of the Constitution to help restore the broken \nSenate. It has been a privilege and an honor to team up with him and to \nteam up with many Members in this effort.\n  We come to this point today where, as my colleague mentioned, there \nare a number of steps forward coming out of this debate. They are \nmodest steps forward. Some of them are ones that have been debated for \nyears. I applaud Senator Wyden from my State, who worked with Senator \nGrassley and Senator McCaskill on secret holds. As Senator Wyden likes \nto note, for 15 years he has argued we should not be able to put a hold \non legislation without taking public responsibility, literally since he \ncame to the Senate. He is absolutely right. Today, I think a \nsupermajority will adopt that.\n  These other steps--not abusing the reading of amendments, reducing \nthe number of folks subject to confirmation--are steps forward.\n  But I would like Members to envision three 60-foot-high walls between \nwhere they are now and where they need to be to have the Senate work as \na body that debates legislation and votes on legislation. The first 60-\nfoot wall is cloture on the motion to proceed. The next 60-foot wall is \ncloture on an amendment. Actually, there can be any number of those. \nThe third 60-foot wall is final passage, closing down debate for final \npassage. In this agreement today, there has been a sense between the \nleaders that the motion to proceed will not be filibustered. That is \nthe first wall. That is being taken down or at least a commitment not \nto use it except in extraordinary circumstances. But that means there \nare two more major walls left in place.\n  I step back from that and ask: How much will it change for the \nSenate? If I go back to this chart, the first wall is one that has only \nbeen occasionally used. It is the second and third walls that are \ndriving the paralysis of the Senate.\n  I hope, indeed, that when the majority and minority leader talk about \nchanging behavior, when my good friend from Tennessee, Senator \nAlexander, talks about changing behavior, I hope they are talking about \nrestoring the social contract, that the filibuster would rarely be \nused. That would be a tremendous step forward. I will hold out that \npromise.\n\n  Meanwhile, recognizing that it will only happen when a Senator comes \nforward and does a frivolous effort to continue debate on an amendment \nor a bill or a nomination that is overwhelmingly supported, that it \nwill be up to leadership to say that is not acceptable. We need to \nrestore the social contract. If that change in behavior happens, that \nwould be a tremendous step.\n  Meanwhile, I echo the comments of my colleague. I cannot surrender \nthe rights under the Constitution to use a majority to continue to \npursue rules that will make our broken Senate work better. I reserve \nthat right, as does he.\n  There are many who say the Senate should be different than the House, \nthat it should be a cooling saucer. That was related to the debate in \nthe design of the Constitution, when terms were staggered so one-third \nis elected every 2 years. The country may be way over here and the \nSenate may change accordingly, but only one-third is up for election. \nThen, maybe over here the Senate changes less. In addition, this \ncourtesy, this respect of hearing each other out and pondering the \narguments of each other. But a cooling saucer is very different than \nthe routine use of the filibuster to obstruct the ability to act, very \ndifferent than the way it has been used these last 2 years to prevent \nus from doing appropriations bills, from doing House bills, preventing \nnominations from being considered. That has to end. That has to change.\n  I pledge myself to continue working, hoping that behavior will change \non its own but working with others to say, when it doesn't change, we \nneed to change, we need to change the rules to make this institution \nfulfill its constitutional responsibilities.\n  We will be breaking soon. When we come back, I hope to resume a \nconversation about some of the specific items we will be voting on \nlater today. The one I particularly wish to talk about is Jimmy Stewart \nor the talking filibuster. It is a compromise that takes into account \nthe desire that we hear each other out, the desire that we be a cooling \nsaucer but prevents an opportunity to be accountable to the public, not \nto have the silent or secret filibuster we have now but to have the \npublic and talking filibuster, where we actually debate. I will say \nmore about that when we come back.\n\n[[Page S304]]\n\n  I close by thanking all those who have been in this conversation, \ncertainly Lamar Alexander from the Republican Party and Chuck Schumer, \nwho have been working on rules to hold hearings to craft the structure \nfor our leadership, our majority leader Harry Reid and our minority \nleader Mitch McConnell, who have been in this conversation that has \nresulted in these steps forward that we are taking today. I applaud all \nthe Members who have said that as Senators sworn to uphold the \nConstitution, they have an obligation to make the Senate a great \ndeliberative body, something it once was, something it is not now but \nsomething that is in our hands to make happen again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/27/senate-section/article/S304-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

RES. 8, S. \n       RES. 10, S. RES. 21, S. RES. 28, AND S. RES. 29--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I call up S. Res. 28, the Wyden-Grassley-\nMcCaskill resolution to end secret holds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The resolution is pending.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, with the passage of this resolution, no \nlonger will it be possible for a Senator to engage in the \nunconscionable practice of secretly blocking a piece of legislation \nthat affects millions and millions of Americans.\n  The fight for more sunshine in the way the Senate does business feels \nlike it has been the longest running battle since the Trojan War. \nToday, after scores of battles, the cause of open government is going \nto prevail.\n  Over the years, Senator Grassley and I, with the strong support of \nSenator McCaskill, have been able to secure leadership agreements to \nend secrecy. We have been able to pass amendments to end secrecy and \nsend them to conference committees--where they would then magically \ndisappear. We actually, at one time, got a watered-down version of our \nlaw passed. In each case, the defenders of secrecy have found a way to \nkeep sunshine out and obstruct the public interest. When this proposal \npasses, we believe there will be real change.\n  There are three reasons why we believe our bipartisan proposal to end \nsecret holds will be different from previous approaches.\n  First, now with any hold here in the Senate, there would be a public \nowner. Every single hold would have a Senator who is going to be held \naccountable for blocking a piece of legislation.\n  Second, there will be consequences. In the past, there have never \nbeen any consequences for the Senator who objected anonymously. In \nfact, the individuals who objected would usually send somebody else out \nto do their objecting for them, and they would be completely anonymous. \nEssentially, the person who would be doing the objecting would sort of \nsay: I am not involved here. I am doing it for somebody else. So the \nentire Senate lacked transparency with respect to who was actually \nresponsible.\n  Third, the Wyden-Grassley-McCaskill proposal would deal with all \nholds, whether they reach the point of an objection on the floor or are \nobjected to when the bill or nomination is hotlined. Our approach \nrequires objections to a hotline be publicly disclosed, even for bills \nor nominations that never get called up on the floor. This is a \nparticularly important provision.\n  Senator Grassley and Senator McCaskill feel very strongly about this \nas well because most holds never reach the point that there is an \nobjection on the floor, and that is something I think has been lacking \nin this debate. They hear about discussions of people objecting on the \nfloor. Most holds never reach that point. Typically, what happens is, a \nSenator who objects to a bill or nomination tells the Senator's leader \nthat the matter should not be allowed to come up for a vote, and then \nthe leader objects to bringing up the bill when it is hotlined. Because \nof that objection, the bill or nomination never actually gets called up \non the floor. That type of hold effectively kills the bill or \nnomination long before it gets to the point of an objection on the \nfloor. So we want to make it clear this is an important distinction \nand, for the first time, we would not just be talking about objections \nthat are made on the floor.\n  I see my friend and colleague, Senator McCaskill, who has crusaded \nrelentlessly for this. Senator Grassley and I--I say to Senator \nMcCaskill we sort of feel like we have been at it as part of the \nlongest running battle since the Trojan War. I say to the Senator, your \nenergy has been absolutely crucial in this fight.\n  I would also point out--and I think we know--the defenders of secrecy \nwill always try to find a way around anything that passes. We think we \nhave plugged the holes. We think we finally made the crucial \ndifferences. But the fact that the Senator has been such a relentless \nwatchdog for the public interest, an opponent of secrecy, has been a \ntremendous contribution. I thank my colleague from Missouri and welcome \nher remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, very briefly, I am proud to join \nSenator Grassley and Senator Wyden in their long crusade on this issue. \nI am giddy, frankly. I cannot believe it. I cannot believe we are this \nclose to amending the Senate rules by a wide margin. I will predict \nthis will be a very lopsided vote, which is ironic. I do not think \nthere has ever been anything that has taken as long as this has that is \ngoing to win by as big a margin as this is going to win because people \nwere stubborn about holding on to their secrecy. It is a lot easier to \ndo business, a lot easier to get your deals if you do not have to be \npublic about it.\n  So there are very few things that you can grab a hold of in the \nSenate and actually see to the finish line, and I believe this will be \nthe finish line. But let me say one warning. If anyone thinks they can \nfigure out a way around this, all of us who have worked on this are not \ngoing to give up. So 6 months from now, if something is not moving and \nno one knows why and we figure out that one person has decided to own \nthe holds, such as the minority leader--I will just own all the holds--\nthat is not going to work, because we will come right back and we will \npoint out to the American public: Believe it or not, they are trying to \nget around this rule.\n  So a warning to everyone: If we are going to amend the rule, be \nprepared to live by it because it is the right thing to do. I think our \nstock will rise with the American people. I think the transparency is \nessential.\n  I am very proud that it appears--I will keep my fingers and toes \ncrossed because it has not happened yet--we have bipartisan agreement \nthat this nonsense is going to end.\n  I wish to thank my colleague from Tennessee, Senator Alexander, \nbecause I think he has been essential in these negotiations as it has \nrelated to an amending of the rules as it relates to the secret holds.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank our colleague, our invaluable ally \nin this fight.\n  Senator Grassley, I believe, is on his way. But the Senator from \nTennessee has had many discussions on this topic with me and other \nSenators, and I wish to thank him for all the time and effort he has \nput into it. I yield him whatever time he would like.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, Senator Grassley and Senator Wyden and \nmore recently Senator McCaskill, have pointed out the obvious fact that \nso-called holds that Members of the Senate place on nominations or \nlegislation should be public. I think that is a good idea. That has \nbipartisan support. I believe today we will change the rules to make \nthat clear, and I congratulate Senators Wyden, Grassley, and McCaskill \nfor their perseverance and persistence in pushing this ahead.\n\n[[Page S305]]\n\n  I have always been glad to be public with my holds. I remember when \nSenator Reid filibustered my TVA nominee by putting a hold on him, so I \nfilibustered one of his Nevada citizens by putting a hold on him. Then \nwe were able to work it out. But Senator Reid and I made our objections \npublic. I knew what he was doing and he knew what I was doing. That is \nimportant to build confidence in the Senate.\n  Senator Grassley is on his way over and he has been the partner with \nSenator Wyden on reforming holds for some time. I would like to say to \nSenators Wyden and McCaskill and others--as I have already said to \nSenators Udall and Merkley--that the efforts they have made to change \nthe rules of the Senate have created a window of opportunity which I \nbelieve those of us on both sides of the aisle believe will make the \nSenate a better functioning forum. These Senators will not succeed in \nall the changes they are seeking to make but this window of opportunity \nwill allow the Senate to better function as a place to discuss serious \nissues.\n  The majority leader and the Republican leader earlier today said they \nwere going to do their best to see that most bills come to the floor \nafter first going to committee. Then once bills get here we will have \namendments. I think that is what most of us want. We want a chance to \nrepresent the views we have and those we are elected to represent. \nSometimes our views are in the minority. Sometimes we are very solitary \nwith our views. Maybe we are the only one who has a particular view. \nBut we want a chance to be heard and a chance to offer amendments to \nexpress our views.\n  I think we are preserving the Senate as a forum in which that can be \ndone, but at the same time we are making it a more effective place in \nwhich to do that. I congratulate Senator Wyden and his colleague, \nSenator Grassley, and others for their efforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, while we wait for Senator Grassley, who, as \nSenator Alexander has mentioned, has been relentlessly pursuing this \nwith us for years--again and again, Senator Grassley would come to the \nfloor and make the point that a Senator simply ought to have the guts, \njust ought to have the guts, to stand and say: Look, this is important \nto me. I am the individual who ought to be held accountable. Senator \nGrassley, in that inimitable Midwestern way, always manages to get \nthese issues down to what they are truly all about. It is about \naccountability and, as Senator Grassley says, it is about guts.\n  I would also mention, what is striking about the secret hold is this \nastounding power. I think it is only fair to describe it that way. I \nknow of few powers that an elected official has that resemble the \nability to anonymously block a bill or a nomination that affects \nmillions of people. It is an astounding power, and for years and years \nit has never been written down anywhere.\n  As part of the ethics legislation that was passed a few years ago, we \nwere able to get a watered-down version of secret holds reform in \nthere. But literally to think that a power such as this--so sweeping, \nalmost unrivaled in terms of the powers an elected official has--could \nbe exercised in secret is something worth reflecting about in and of \nitself.\n  I will also tell colleagues that for those who want to get into the \nhistory of this, there are all kinds of holds. There was the revolving \nhold. There were a number of different ones. But my favorite over time \nwas the ``Mae West'' hold, which came to also be known as the ``come \nlook me over'' hold, which was almost as if a Senator was declaring \nthat they were not sure what they wanted to do with their hold, but \nsomebody ought to come up and see them sometime.\n  It just goes to show you, these kinds of practices--and this is what \nhas been good about the work done by Senator Schumer and Senator \nAlexander, my friend and colleague from Oregon, Senator Merkley, and \nSenator Udall, which has been so important--because, for the first \ntime, they have brought out into real debate what these rules are all \nabout. My hope is, this will just be the beginning of the discussion \nabout how, in the days ahead, it will be possible to bring more \nsunshine and more transparency to the Senate.\n  But Senator Grassley, who has made this point in the past about doing \nbusiness in public--that the principle at stake is accountability and \ntransparency--has made the case for a long time and has additionally \ntold Senators that since he--and there have been a number of us who \nhave always put our holds in the Congressional Record; I have not used \nthem very often. Senator Grassley has made the point that colleagues \nwill find, when they do it, it does not hurt at all. In fact, not only \ndo they not suffer any detrimental consequences, but they do it and the \npublic thinks more of them.\n\n  One final point as we wait for Senator Grassley is that I am \nparticularly interested in having holds reform enacted as part of our \nwork today because the secret hold is a huge bonanza for the lobbyists. \nThe lobbyists can, as we have seen year after year, go to a Senator and \nsay: It would be a big favor to me if you would put a hold on something \nso we can get a little more time to have a chance to make our case. \nSometimes we have competing lobbyists asking for secret holds, so we \nhave one Senator putting a secret hold on a piece of legislation and \nmaking a whole array of lobbyists happy. Sunshine will be good for the \nSenate, and it will certainly be good because it will shine the hot \nlight on some of these lobbyists' practices that we have been trying to \ndiscourage here on the floor of the Senate.\n  I have just been notified that Senator Grassley is unavoidably \ndetained. He is not going to make it to the floor at this time.\n  On behalf of myself, Senator Grassley, and Senator McCaskill, at this \ntime I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second. There is a sufficient \nsecond.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I first wish to commend Senator Wyden, \nSenator Grassley, and Senator McCaskill for their incredible \ndetermination to get this done. We thought we did it when our class of \nSenators came in. We thought we had gotten rid of the secret hold, but \nlo and behold, people found a way to work around it, and their \ndetermination has meant we are finally going to do this and we are \ngoing to do it right.\n  Secondly, I wish to thank Senator Alexander as well as Senator \nSchumer of the Rules Committee for negotiating a number of these \nchanges, as well as Senator Reid and Senator McConnell. When I think \nback over the last few months and what has happened, we had an \nincredibly productive lameduck session at the end of the last Congress. \nWe all know there is a lot of work to be done, but in the closing \nmonths of this year, we showed people--I think to their surprise--that \nwe could truly get some things done on a bipartisan basis. When the \nAmerican people unite and see a clear issue--whether it was the nuclear \narms treaty, whether it was the vote on the repeal of don't ask, don't \ntell, or whether it was the first responders after 9/11--and they see \nwhat is happening in this Chamber because they actually see a debate, \nthey see someone standing up and making their points as the Presiding \nOfficer does so well on so many issues, then they can make a decision. \nThat is all we are talking about, when we talk about these sometimes \ncomplicated and convoluted rules changes, is getting things out in the \nopen. Obviously, the first thing is to get rid of the secret holds and \npermanently end them.\n  The second important thing is filibuster reform. It is a longstanding \ntradition in the Senate that one Senator can, if she chooses, hold the \nfloor to explain her objections to a bill. We always think of Jimmy \nStewart's character Jefferson Smith in ``Mr. Smith Goes to \nWashington.'' This is where Senator Udall--and by the way, I always \nthink his voice sort of sounds like Jimmy Stewart--and Senator Merkley \nhave done such a tremendous job of pushing these filibuster reform \nissues, as well as Senator Tom Harkin, who has been working on this \nlong before our group ever came to the Senate.\n  A group of us got together with the smart proposals made by Senators \nHarkin, Udall, and Merkley to determine the best reforms and what are \nthe\n\n[[Page S306]]\n\nones we can truly get through; what is a package we can go to the other \nside of the aisle with and talk about what we need to do to get it \ndone. The agreement that has been reached includes some of the \nimportant changes we want. The first I mentioned is to get rid of \nsecret holds, but of course critical reforms to the filibuster are \nstill necessary as far as I can see. One of the things I hope we \nreconsider as we go down this road is the idea that we could actually \nmake people stand to filibuster, so that they are in this Chamber, they \nare discussing why it is so important that they hold up something, \nwhether it is a judge, whether it is the assistant secretary of Oceanic \nAffairs, whether it is a major bill or a minor bill. People should be \nable to hear the arguments and then make their own decision. By the \nway, if they have a good argument for filibustering something or if a \ngroup of Senators has a good idea, the American people will say OK, I \ncan understand why this is happening. If they are just doing it for \nreasons that don't make any sense to the people of this country, then \nthey are going to be seen for what they are doing, and that is slowing \ndown the progress of this country at a time when there are so many \nmajor issues we need to deal with in this Chamber.\n  So I am happy we have been able to reach agreement on a number of \nthese important issues. It would not have happened without the \ndetermination of the people who are here today, and I look forward to \nmore changes and agreements in the future.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to continue the debate on this set \nof rule proposals, but specifically to talk about the talking \nfilibuster.\n  There is one scene from an American movie that captures everyone's \nattention, and that is the scene of Jimmy Stewart here in the well of \nthe Senate holding forth to make his case before his colleagues and \nbefore the American people to stop a corrupt act designed to destroy a \ncamp for children. That is Jimmy Stewart in the role of Jefferson Smith \nin ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.'' He wasn't making some behind-the-\nscenes move, some backroom deal; he was out in front of the American \npeople. That is why we have brought both the end of secret holds and \nthe end of secret filibusters to the floor today.\n  The concept of the talking filibuster is that the American people \nbelieve when you filibuster, you are making a personal action, a \ncourageous action, a public action, with personal time and energy, to \nstand up and say what you think needs to be said and to fight for what \nyou need to fight for to make your State or this Nation or this world a \nbetter place. But this is not what the filibuster has become in modern \ntimes. Folks object to closing debate and they go off to dinner, have a \nglass of wine or two while they paralyze the Senate. It happened 136 \ntimes in the last 2 years. Each one of those filibusters proceeded to \nparalyze this body for a week, and yet those folks would not stand \nbefore the public here on the floor of the Senate and make their case.\n  The secret filibuster must go. It is an issue the American people \nunderstand, since they believe we will make our case before them when \nwe wish to stall the Senate on an important issue. Let's make it so. \nLet's make it so with the vote that will take place here in this \nChamber within the next couple of hours.\n  I wish to note that hundreds of thousands of people have signed \npetitions across this country. They have heard about this on the Web \nand other places. CREDO Action, Common Cause, Daily Kos and the Sierra \nClub, just those four groups generated almost 200,000 signatures \ncalling for accountability, calling for transparency, calling for us to \nmake our case before the American people so the American people can \nweigh in as to whether we are heroes or bums.\n  When we hold the vote on the talking filibuster today--I understand \nthere has been a lot of pressure applied for there to be a unanimous \nparty-line vote across the aisle against it. It troubles me. A number \nof our new Senators campaigned on transparency. They campaigned on \naccountability. They campaigned on changing the broken ways of \nWashington, and one of the first votes their leadership is asking them \nto do is toss away accountability, toss away transparency, and not help \nfix the broken Senate.\n  There are some who said we must make sure we protect the rights of \nthe minority. The talking filibuster does exactly that. We still need \n60 votes to close debate. My colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, was \njust here. If there were an issue affecting Oregon that we must oppose, \nthe two of us alone could take and hold this floor back and forth to \nmake sure this body doesn't run over the rights of Oregon as long as we \nhave the 40 colleagues with us to avoid cloture. That is the way it is \nnow and that is the way it will be under the talking filibuster.\n  I am not going to belabor this. There are others who wish to speak \nand we want to hear them. But let me say this: When we have gotten to \nthe point that we could not get a single appropriations bill done in \n2010, when we cannot address 400 House bills that lie collecting dust \non the floor, when we have 100 nominations in which we did not fulfill \nour constitutional responsibility to advise and consent, then we have a \nresponsibility to work together to change the conduct of this Senate, \nto change the rules of this Senate, so those rules are not abused in a \nfashion that undermines our performance under the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Senator from Oregon has talked \nabout the number of nominations that couldn't be considered. I am sure \nthe Senator from Oregon remembers that there cannot be a filibuster on \na motion to proceed to a nomination. All the majority leader has to do \nis bring it up. You can't debate that. If he should bring up the motion \nto proceed to a nomination, and if a Senator over here or over there \nobjected, then the motion can be put to a simple majority vote. When I \nwas nominated by President George H.W. Bush to be Education Secretary, \na secret hold was placed on my nomination. Senator Metzenbaum, as it \nturned out, had a hold on my nomination for 3 months when all it would \nhave taken for me to be confirmed was for the majority leader to bring \nmy name to the floor. Then if we had gotten 60 votes for it, we could \nhave debated for 30 hours and had a final vote on my nomination.\n  What would happen during the 30 hours? We don't have Senators going \nout to dinner except on the other side of the aisle. Because under the \ncurrent rules, in those 30 hours, one Senator gets 7 hours to speak. We \nknow a Senator can do that because a distinguished Senator from Vermont \ndemonstrated very capably that he was capable of doing that not long \nago. He did a great job. People all over the country saw it, wrote him, \nand he became a little bit of a celebrity for that day. Senators are \nstill capable of that. But if a Senator had wanted to take the whole 30 \nhours in a postcloture period, he then has to get 23 more Senators to \njoin him in taking an hour of that 30 hours. Without getting into the \ncomplications of it, if Senators fail to talk, then the majority leader \ncan say those are dilatory tactics and force any Senator who wants to \nextend the debate to be very uncomfortable. That Senator would have to \nget up to 23 Senators to come join him at some time during the speech \nand take 7 hours himself. The reason why that hasn't been done is \nbecause the majority didn't want to do it.\n  Now I am not just saying that. The master of the Senate rules, \nSenator Byrd, said it in his last testimony before our Rules Committee \nlast May.\n  He said this:\n\n       Forceful confrontation to a threat to filibuster is \n     undoubtedly the antidote to the malady.\n\n  Senator Byrd was talking about what some considered the abuse of a \nfilibuster. Most recently, before he died, Senator Byrd said:\n\n       Senate Majority Leader Reid announced that the Senate would \n     stay in session around the clock and take all procedural \n     steps necessary to bring financial reform legislation before \n     the Senate. As preparations were made and cots rolled out, a \n     deal was struck within hours and the threat of a filibuster \n     was withdrawn. I heartily commend the majority leader for \n     this progress, and I strongly caution my colleagues as some \n     propose to alter the rules to severely limit the ability of a \n     minority to conduct a filibuster.\n       I know what it is to be majority leader, and wake up on a \n     Wednesday morning in November, and find yourself a minority \n     leader.\n\n\n[[Page S307]]\n\n\n  Senator Byrd said the Senate rules provide the means to break a \nfilibuster. He went on to describe that.\n  Mr. President, I don't want to suggest to the distinguished whip, who \nknows the rules of the Senate much better than I, or to Harry Reid, the \nmajority leader, how to break a filibuster that he thinks is an abuse. \nBut they know how to do it. That takes a little trouble. You cannot go \nout to dinner and have a glass of wine, as the Senator from Oregon was \ntalking about. You have to sit on that side of the floor and have 50 \nSenators ready. You can sit there and say: I would like for the Senator \nfrom Tennessee to assert himself. And you can stay all night. I imagine \nif you do that once or twice, or if we voted on more than zero Fridays, \nwhich was the number of Fridays we voted on last year, you could \nconfront filibusters.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. After I finish my sentence, I will yield the floor to \nthe Senator from Illinois.\n  I say to my friends, what we are trying to do today is to move past \nthis time where we point out that the majority leader has cut off our \nright to amend and debate six times more than recent majority leaders. \nThat is what gets everybody stirred up over here. It is like telling us \nwe can join the Grand Ole Opry, but we can't sing.\n  We are here to let people know what the people in Tennessee and other \nStates think. We might be in the minority, but we are in the Senate \nwhere the minority is supposed to have a voice.\n  When, time after time, you bring a bill to the floor and cut it off, \nand you call that a filibuster--that is why we are upset. You are upset \nbecause as a result of that you didn't get to bring as many bills to \nthe floor as you would like. We are trying to put that all behind us \ntoday. This window of opportunity has produced what I think is \nimportant. These rules changes we are going to adopt are good and will \nmove us in the right direction.\n  The real value of this whole effort has been to cause us to think \nabout how the Senate operates and realize the best way to do it is for \nmost bills to go to committee, come to the floor, and for most Senators \nto get to offer most of the amendments they want to offer and get them \nvoted on. We might have to vote on a Friday--maybe even a Thursday \nnight or maybe even a Saturday. It might be that the majority has to \nconfront a filibuster by saying: Senator so-and-so, if you are going to \nslow us down, we are going to make you use that 30 hours. You are going \nto have to talk your 7 hours and get 23 other Senators, and we are \ngoing to be here to see that you do it.\n  My guess would be that you do that about once, maybe twice, and that \nwould end that particular problem. My real guess is if this general \nattitude that the majority and minority leaders talked about earlier \ntoday occurs, then you will see very few uses of the filibusters you \nthink are inappropriate. The Leaders described an attitude which is \nthat we are going to do our best to see that most bills come to the \nfloor, that most Senators get to offer the amendments they want, and \nthat Senators get the votes on those amendments they want. If you think \ninappropriate filibusters are occurring, according to Senator Byrd, you \nhave the means to confront them.\n  My hope is that this whole exercise not only is producing some rules \nchanges that are valuable but a change in behavior on both sides of the \naisle which will be valuable. We will wait and see.\n  I am happy to yield to my friend from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I see others standing. I will be brief and \njust say a few words in support of the so-called talking filibuster. In \nthe world of the most arcane things that people can concentrate on, \nthis book would be on the top 10 best-seller list. It is the Senate \nManual with the rules of procedure and the rules of precedents of the \nSenate. Unless you live here and work here and follow the Senate, most \npeople never, ever have any glancing occasion to even observe these \nrules, let alone pay any attention to them.\n  Why are we doing this when we have all these people unemployed in \nAmerica and we have so many challenges at home and abroad? Why are we \ntaking the time of the Senate to talk about this book and the rules \nincluded? Many of us, including my friend--and that term is sometimes \nused loosely here but I mean it literally, know what happens on the \nfloor of the Senate has an effect on America and the world. If we do \nour job well, we are going to solve some of the problems of the world. \nIf we do it poorly, the exact opposite is the case.\n  What my colleagues from Colorado and Oregon and New Mexico have urged \nus to do is to think about whether we can do things better in the \nSenate. The history of the filibuster in the Senate is an interesting \none. There was a time when any Senator could stand up and object and \nstop the proceedings of the Senate. Then Woodrow Wilson, as President, \nsuggested that we should arm the Merchant Marine so that our ships \ncould fire back if the Germans and others fired at them. He asked for \nlegal authority for that. He brought that issue to the Senate before \nWorld War I, and two or three pacifist Senators stood up and said: No, \nwe don't want these ships to have guns because that will drag us into a \nwar.\n  At that point, Wilson said: I want to take that issue to the American \npeople. Three Senators should not be able to stop that from a vote. He \ngot his way.\n  At the end of the day, the rule was initiated--the cloture rule--that \nsaid two-thirds of the body could decide to move forward even if one or \nmore Senators objected. That cloture rule of two-thirds guided the \nSenate until the 1960s, and the civil rights debate ended up amending \nthat rule from 67, under that day's count, to 60. So 60 has been the \nguiding way to end a filibuster. It has been that way the entire time I \nand the Senator from Tennessee have served in the Senate.\n  What is being suggested is fundamental. I would at least say I \ndisagree in principle with the Senator from Tennessee, respectfully, \nand here is what I believe. I think the movants of this idea believe \nthis: If the Senator from Tennessee believes in his heart of hearts \nthat something is so bad, so controversial, so wrong that he wants to \nstop the business of the Senate in considering and debating an \namendment or a bill--if he feels that strongly about the value or \nprinciple that would lead him to want to stop the Senate, what we are \nbeing told is that he ought to be willing to stand here and say why.\n  Currently, you can initiate a filibuster and close down the Senate, \nwhere for 30 hours nothing happens except the drone--the lovely drone--\nof quorum calls. People across America tune in and say: What is \nhappening there? Are they going to actually pay these men and women for \ndoing nothing another day?\n  A person who initiates a filibuster can literally leave the floor and \nhead out for dinner, and the Senate is stopped cold. What is being \nsuggested is that if you believe it, if it is important enough to stop \nthe business of the Senate, for goodness' sakes, stand up and tell us \nwhy. Defend yourself. Stand up for your principles.\n  I remind the Senator from Tennessee--I think he was a Member at this \ntime--that one of our colleagues, who will go unnamed but is from his \nside of the aisle, initiated a filibuster once which forced us to come \nin on a Saturday--as you say, it is a rare occurrence here--and to be \nhere and have over 60 votes because of his filibuster. That Senator \ndidn't show up. He initiated the filibuster and didn't stick around. He \nwas asked later about it, and he said: I had something important to do \nback home.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. After I explain my position I will.\n  That is a classic illustration of someone who initiates a filibuster \nand then takes a powder--goes out to dinner or goes home to attend an \nevent and says: Just let the Senate burn up 30 hours. I will be back \nlater.\n  What we are hearing is that it is better to say to that Senator, if \nit means that much to stop the Senate it should mean enough for that \nSenator and that Senator's colleagues to stand up and fight for that \nright. Is it worth it? Will the Senator at least take the floor and \nspeak to it?\n  The Senator from Tennessee says there is a better way: to force the \nentire Senate, during a filibuster, to be\n\n[[Page S308]]\n\nhere--all of us. So any one Senator can change and affect the lives of \nall Senators by saying we are going to stay all night. We will have \nlive quorum calls and we will sleep on cots in the marble room, and \nthat is the way to stop the filibuster. Think about that, I say to my \nfriend from Tennessee. Is this a punishment to the person who initiates \nthe filibuster? Does it even put responsibility on the person who \ninitiates it? The answer is clearly no. The burden, under the defense \nof your position, falls on the entire Senate to sit here all night long \nbecause one Senator objects.\n  I think this talking filibuster is much more reasonable. If it means \nenough to object to the Senate moving forward on the debate of an \namendment or a bill, then, for goodness' sakes, have the courage and be \nopen enough to stand at your desk and defend your position. That is not \nunreasonable. If you find that you cannot hold a number of colleagues \nto your position, let's move on. If you don't want to stand and debate \nthe issue but want to go out to dinner with your buddies, fine. But \ndon't stop the Senate while you are on your way to a nice dinner--not \nyou personally, but the person who would move the filibuster.\n  I support the talking filibuster, not because of Jimmy Stewart, who \ncreated this mental image, but I think the principle is sound and what \nour colleagues recommend would help the Senate.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, since the distinguished whip has \napparently renamed this amendment the ``which side of the aisle goes \nout to dinner'' amendment, let me ask him this: Isn't it true that if \nyour side didn't go out to dinner--since you asked to be elected to the \nSenate, you raised a lot of money, and you worked hard and defeated \nsome Republican to get here--if you really think somebody over here is \nabusing their minority rights by filibustering, then why would you go \nout to dinner, and why would you not want to be here and hear that \nperson talk and respond to him? Why would you not do that?\n  Isn't it true that Senator Byrd said that forceful confrontation to \nthe threat of a filibuster is undoubtedly the antidote to the malady? \nHe did not want us tampering with this 60-vote procedure we have that \nforces consensus.\n  My question to the majority whip is this: Why did you go out to \ndinner so often--through the Chair--when instead, you could have been \nhere, under the rules as Senator Byrd suggested, dealing with abuses to \nthe filibuster or what you consider they were?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The obvious question is, what do we accomplish by staying \nhere all night? Every 15 minutes or every hour the majority leader \ncould ask for a live quorum and Members could be asked to come vote. If \nthey don't, their voting record would reflect that. So the body would \npay the price of applying pressure--the confrontation that Senator Byrd \nspeaks of.\n  What the Senators proposing this suggest is that the person who wants \nto stop the Senate should have the burden of explaining why or standing \nand defending his or her position. I don't think that is unreasonable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I want to correct the record on something \nthat has been said on the other side of the aisle; that is, the abuse \nof the filibuster has been a response to filling the tree. In the last \n2 years, we had the tree filled once. We had 33 filibusters. In \nresponse to those filibusters, the tree was filled 9 times. We had 34 \nfilibusters, the tree filled 6 times, and a filibuster 36 times. \nObviously, 36 times was not a response to 6 times filling the tree.\n  That myth created by the opposing side is actually a myth. So while \nit is a convenient argument, it happens to be a wrong one. I think that \nis important to know.\n  I also wish to note that my colleague from Tennessee was talking \nabout postcloture discussions for 30 hours, thereby confusing the \nconversation about the filibuster on the motion to proceed, the \nfilibuster on amendments, the filibuster on a bill with a 30-hour \nrequirement on nominations. Actually, we had a proposal to reduce those \n30 hours to 2 hours. That proposal is in S. Res. 10 that will be voted \non today.\n  I do hope my colleague, in support of the principle he was putting \nout, which is that those hours should be reduced, will support S. Res. \n10, noting that is a very logical way to reduce the delay of the \nSenate.\n  My colleagues wish to speak. I will close with this comment: If you \nhave the courage of your convictions and you want to exercise the \nprivilege of shutting down the Senate for a week, then stand up and \nmake yourself accountable to the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise to speak on a particular \nproposal we will consider later today, but I wish to associate myself \nwith the Senator from Oregon, who has been tireless in pushing for \ncommonsense reforms in the way the Senate operates.\n  The majority whip made the comment in his remarks before the Senator \nfrom Oregon spoke that we want to make these changes so the Senate can \nrespond to the changing nature of the world around us and in particular \nfocus on our economy and getting Americans back to work. If the Senate \nis tied in knots, we are not going to put the policies in place that \nthese stalwart, committed Senators, including the Senator from Iowa, \nMr. Harkin, and the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Udall, so compellingly \npresented to us.\n  I know there are others who wish to speak, so I will briefly speak to \nthe proposal I have submitted that would bring us a step closer to \nfixing some of the redundancy in the rules that slow down our progress \nhere and I think ultimately make not just our constituents in our \nindividual States frustrated but Americans all across our country. Put \nsimply, this proposal would encourage Senators to file their amendments \n72 hours in advance of a vote to ensure we all have a chance to review \nthat amendment. But then it would also discourage the practice of \ndelaying a final vote by calling for an out-loud reading of the \namendment. I have heard concerns from Members of both parties about \nthis particular practice. We all want to have an opportunity to read \nthe provisions in amendments and broader bills, but it has become \nincreasingly obvious to me that we need to make changes in our rules, \nas I said, to ensure the process works smoothly.\n  My proposal would encourage Senators to file amendments 72 hours in \nadvance, and it would prevent any Senators from creating a logjam on \nthe Senate floor by forcing the text of that amendment to be read aloud \nif it is made available in advance.\n  Mr. President, you and I have been around long enough to know that in \nthe days before copy machines and the Internet, if one was serving in \nthe Senate, it was probably helpful to sit here and hear the text of \neach amendment read out loud. That practice is outdated, and it is not \nthe way the Senate operates today. Instead, our technology allows us \ninstant access to the text of amendments, and therefore there is no \ncrucial need to hear them read aloud at the last minute. Most of the \ntime, in fact, we just waive the reading and move to the final vote. \nWhen a full reading, however, has been forced, it largely brings this \nplace to a halt, as Senator Durbin pointed out earlier. The effect has \nbeen to tie the Senate in knots, and it creates a spectacle when the \nhard-working clerks, who are actually the people who make this Senate \nrun, have to stand here and read amendments, sometimes for hours, to an \nempty Chamber. That said, there have been cases in which one party \nbelieves the text of a rather large amendment has been withheld from \nthem in order to deny them adequate time to review it. I do not want to \ntake that power away from the minority to reasonably voice their \nopinions on the floor to get the information they need, which is why my \nproposal is a balanced way of fixing the Senate rules.\n  This resolution is designed to help us find common ground and prevent \nneedless delays by allowing us to prevent the live reading of an \namendment when the text has been available long enough for everyone to \nhave studied it in advance. Instead of allowing an individual Senator \nto put the Senate on hold literally for hours by forcing an amendment \nto be read, a simple majority of Senators would be able to collectively \nvote to dispense with the reading, provided that it was filed on time. \nThis is a commonsense approach. It seeks to address the concerns of \nthose\n\n[[Page S309]]\n\nwho want more time to read amendments and those who see the forced \nreading of amendments as needlessly obstructive. It is a simple \napproach, and I believe later today the Senate will approve such a \nrules change.\n  In ending my remarks, I wish to acknowledge the work of Chairman \nSchumer and Senator Alexander. There is an agreement, as I understand \nit, and we will vote on it later today. I applaud their work and offer \nmy very sincere thanks.\n  I also acknowledge Leader Reid and Leader McConnell for helping bring \nthis package to the floor today and for reaching their own agreement on \nhow to improve the way the Senate works.\n  Finally, as I did in my beginning remarks, I wish to acknowledge \nSenator Tom Harkin, Senator Tom Udall, and Senator Jeff Merkley for \nbringing true attention to a concern so many Americans have had on this \nparticular issue. Senator Merkley and Senator Durbin spoke to the fact \nthat this may seem an obscure topic to many constituents. This is \nhistoric progress we are going to make today that ultimately will make \nthe Senate function together. I know that is the mission of these three \noutstanding Senators.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Merkley be listed as a cosponsor \nof the resolution I am offering today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I close on this note: I urge \nmy colleagues to vote for the simple commonsense reform of the Senate \nrules.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise to support the Wyden-Grassley-\nMcCaskill public hold proposal. I apologize to my two colleagues from \nOregon and Missouri that I was not on the floor at the proper time. It \nis all my fault.\n  I am pleased to see this day come where the Senate will finally have \nthe opportunity for an up-or-down vote on our freestanding Senate \nresolution to require public disclosure of holds. Senator Wyden and I \nhave been at this for a long time. We have made progress at times, and \nwe have also had many disappointments where things did not quite work \nout the way we had hoped and what we thought the Senate had spoken on \nthrough even rollcall votes.\n  It has also been good to have Senator McCaskill join us in helping \npush this issue to the forefront easily. She did that--I shouldn't say \n``easily'' but recently because it has not been easy. Ending secret \nholds seems like a simple matter, doesn't it. But that has not proved \nto be the case because secret holds are an informal process. It is \neasier said than done to push them out into the open using formal \nSenate procedures. It is kind of like trying to wrestle down a greased \nhog. However, after a lot of thought and effort, two committee \nhearings, and many careful revisions, I think this resolution does a \npretty good job of accomplishing our simple goal. That goal is to bring \nsome more transparency into how the Senate does its business and, with \ntransparency, more accountability.\n  This is not the only proposal we are considering today related to \nSenate procedure, and I do not want there to be any confusion. This \nproposal is not about altering any balance of power between the \nmajority party and the minority party; neither does our resolution \nalter the rights of any of the 100 Members of this Senate.\n  Over the time I have been working on this issue, I have occasionally \nencountered arguments purporting to defend the need for secret holds. \nHowever, the arguments invariably focus on the legitimacy of holds, not \non the subject of secrecy. I want to be very clear that secrecy is my \nonly target and the only thing this resolution eliminates. I fully \nsupport the fundamental right of individual Senators to hold or \nwithhold his or her consent when unanimous consent is requested. \nSenators are not obligated to give their consent to anything they do \nnot want to, and no Senator is entitled to get any other Senator's \nconsent to their motion.\n  I think the best way to describe what we seek to do with this \nresolution is to explain historically how holds came into being, as \nSenators have heard me do before.\n  In the old days, when Senators conducted much of their business in a \ndaily way from their desks on the Senate floor, it was a simple matter \nto stand up and say ``I object'' when necessary. These days, most \nSenators spend most of their time off the Senate floor. We are required \nto spend time in committee hearings, meetings with constituents, and \nattending to other duties that keep us away from this Chamber. As a \nresult, we rely on our respective party leaders in the Senate to \nprotect our rights and prerogatives as individual Senators by asking \nthem to object on our behalf.\n  Just as any Senator has the right to stand up on the Senate floor and \npublicly say ``I object,'' it is perfectly legitimate to ask another \nSenator to object on our behalf if we cannot make it to the floor when \nconsent is requested. By the same token, Senators have no inherent \nright to have others object on their behalf while keeping their \nidentity secret. If a Senator has a legitimate reason to object to \nproceeding to a bill or nominee, then he or she ought to have the guts \nto do so publicly.\n  We need have no fear of being held accountable by our constituents if \nwe are acting in their interest as we were elected to do. Transparency \nis essential for accountability, and accountability is an essential \ncomponent of our constitutional system. Transparency and accountability \nare also vital for the public to have faith in their government. As I \nhave said many times, the people's business ought to be done in public. \nIn my view, that principle is at stake.\n  I see my colleague from Oregon. If he will indulge me, I ask \nunanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with the Senator from Oregon \nto get his thoughts as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, as Senator Grassley has said, Senator \nGrassley, Senator McCaskill, and I have always maintained that there is \nno legitimate reason for Senators to keep holds they have placed with \ntheir leaders secret for any period of time. In fact, for quite some \ntime, we have made a practice of immediately disclosing any hold we \nplace in the Congressional Record, and that has been at the heart of \nour resolution, in my judgment. Would my friend from Iowa agree?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Absolutely correct. One of the defects of the watered-\ndown secret holds provision that was included in the ethics reform bill \nin the 110th Congress was that it allowed for large windows of secrecy \nbefore disclosure was required. Our resolution states that the leaders \nshall recognize holds placed with them only if two conditions are met: \nif the Senator first submits the notice of intent to object in writing \nto the appropriate leader and grants in the notice of intent to object \npermission for the leader or designee to object in the Senator's name \nand, secondly, not later than 2 session days after submitting the \nnotice of intent to object to the appropriate leader, submits a copy of \nthe notice of intent to object to the Congressional Record and to the \nlegislative clerk for inclusion in the applicable calendar section.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Senator because I think that is an important \npoint because the bipartisan resolution clearly establishes the \nresponsibility of all Senators to go public with their holds and the \nunderstanding that the leaders will not honor secret holds.\n  In addition, a concern that has been expressed is the lack of an \nenforcement mechanism in case there is a breakdown in this process, \nthat it does not work as intended. Will the Senator from Iowa address \nthat point? I believe our resolution addresses that concern as well.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. It certainly does. Even if the process we talked about \nis not followed, once a hold comes to light in the form of an \nobjection, someone will be required to own up to that hold. It will no \nlonger be possible for a leader or their designee to object but claim \nit is not their objection. They can say on whose behalf they are \nobjecting and why not.\n  We also require Senators placing a hold to give their permission to \nobject in their name. Still, if a Senator objects and does not name \nanother Senator as having the objection, and another Senator does not \npromptly come\n\n[[Page S310]]\n\nforward claiming the objection, the Senator making the objection will \nbe listed in the relative section of the Senate calendar as having \nplaced that hold.\n\n  I yield, for a final conclusion, to the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Senator from Iowa, because with this colloquy \nhe has laid it out very well. The fact is we have been at this so that \nit sometimes feels as though it has been the longest running battle \nsince the Trojan War, given the fact we have had leadership agreements, \nwe have had amendments, and we have had a watered-down version of the \nlaw. Today, we finally have an opportunity to ensure this \nunconscionable practice of secrecy that keeps the American people, \nmillions of Americans, from learning about who is blocking a bill or a \nnomination, and that practice is finally eliminated, and I thank my \ncolleague. It has been a long fight and a pleasure to work with my \nfriend from Iowa and to have the energy and enthusiasm of Senator \nMcCaskill, who has given this cause a huge push.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Merkley as a \ncosponsor to the bipartisan Senate resolution eliminating secret holds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate the hard work of the leadership and my \npartners in this effort, Senator Grassley and Senator McCaskill. We \nwould not be here today without them. We have a strong, bipartisan bill \nthat will bring greater transparency to the process of holds.\n  There are a few matters that we wanted to clarify to ensure there is \nno confusion during the implementation. First, subsection (d) notes \nthat when a Senator makes an objection, but within 2 session days, no \nSenator submits a Notice of Intent to Object to the Record, then the \nclerk should add to the Notice of Intent to Object calendar the name of \nthe Senator who actually made the objection. Obviously, the calendar \nshould also note the name of the matter actually objected to, as well \nas the date that the objection was made on the floor. Is that my \ncolleague's understanding, as well?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. My colleague is correct and that is pretty \nstraightforward. The Notice of Intent to Object calendar should reflect \nall of the matter necessary to understand holds. If no other Senator \nhas come forth and claimed the objection, then the Senator who actually \nmade the objection should be credited with holding the matter objected \nto. It is also worth noting that this approach saves a Senator who \nactually made an open objection on the floor on his or her own behalf \nthe trouble of filing the ``Notice of Intent to Object'' with the \nclerk.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Yes, the Senator from Iowa makes a good point. Our \nresolution turns the Notice of Intent to Object calendar into a one-\nstop shop for recording information about objections made to covered \nrequests. At the same time, some have asked us--what happens if a \nmatter that had been objected to later passes? Shouldn't the clerk just \nremove the relevant information from the Notice of Intent to Object \ncalendar in that situation? It seems to me that makes sense and such \naction by the clerk would be keeping with the intent of our resolution.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree. If something has passed the Senate, then \nobviously it is not being held. The Notice of Intent to Object calendar \nshould be updated to reflect that development. Some of my colleagues \nhave raised another small wrinkle on this issue with me--what if the \nmatter passes after an objection has been made but before the 2 session \ndays have elapsed? It seems to me that in that case, the clerk does not \nneed to go through the ministerial motion of adding an item to the \nNotice of Intent to Object calendar, only to immediately remove it. \nAgain, if a matter has passed the Senate, there obviously is no hold.\n  Mr. WYDEN. That seems like a commonsense approach to me. I thank my \ncolleague for his help on secret holds. We are achieving a big victory \nfor transparency at the beginning of this Congress.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, people across this country are \nfeeling pressures from so many points of view--job loss, threatened \nlosses in the future as pressure exists on businesses, particularly \nsmall businesses across our country. They look to us in the Senate and \nin the House to help them solve their problems, but what they have seen \nhas resulted in an attitude, to a certain degree, of disdain about \nthose of us who serve in the Senate and the House of Representatives. \nThe reason it has developed that way is because they think we are not \ndoing our job. If they watch television or listen to what is going on, \nit further confirms the fact they have in mind that we are not doing \nour jobs; that we are wasting time; that we are not paying attention to \nthe country's needs.\n  That kind of a picture is appropriately formed, with the situation as \nit is. The Senate has been a roadblock to progress in our country. I \nsalute my colleagues, Senators Udall of New Mexico and Merkley of \nOregon, for the work they are doing, and the others who are associated \nwith it, and I commend the Senator from Tennessee on the other side for \nhis willingness, for his interest in establishing a consensus of view \nabout how we can improve the functioning of our body. I salute him and \ncommend him for it, and I have mentioned that to him privately. We have \nall been wrestling with this problem. But finally, I think we are \ncoming to a time when we can solve it.\n  I have spent the past year trying to improve Senate rules so we \nimprove our functioning; that we show the people in the country we are \nactively trying to solve their problems, and they will understand that \nwhen they see people on the floor debating the issues and not seeing a \nclock working without any action to support it.\n  Last year, and again this month, I introduced the Mr. Smith Act, to \nrequire filibustering Senators to come to the floor and actually \nfilibuster. The filibuster is a right that is reserved for Senators \nwhen they object to a piece of legislation that we are dealing with, \nand if they are able to get the floor, to keep it until such time as 60 \nvotes develop, which says, let us end this debate. So we know that at \nthe moment that is a tool the minority has used regularly and it brings \nthe Senate to a halt. But if the plurality--the majority--shifts, the \nsame thing is liable to happen but with the Democrats then using the \nfilibuster for dilatory reasons.\n  What we are going to do will make the body more transparent. It will \nreduce the practice of grinding the Senate to a halt for no good \nreason. Today, we will have the opportunity to vote on a couple of \nresolutions that include proposals based on the Mr. Smith Act. \nEverybody knows what the Mr. Smith situation was. Jimmy Stewart came to \nWashington and he stood for hours--an unimaginable length of time--to \ntry to get something done. It was a heroic gesture and it has lasted as \nan icon for the American people.\n  Like my bill, which we entitled the Mr. Smith bill, the proposals put \nforward by Senators Merkley and Udall come down to a simple idea: \nSenators who want to delay action on a bill or a nomination must stand \nup here and explain why we are delaying responding to the needs of the \nAmerican people. An empty Senate Chamber can't help put Americans back \nto work, protect people from dangerous weapons, or improve our \ncountry's schools. We can't invest in our railways, roads and bridges, \nother infrastructure needs, and help struggling Americans to stay in \ntheir homes if there is no Senator willing--sent here after, I am sure \nin every case, an arduous election, even though the numbers might not \nsay that--to debate the issues. Why aren't they at work? We would have \nno tolerance for schoolchildren if they continued in their absence from \ntheir classrooms doing their homework. Why in the Senate should it be \nallowed without intervention?\n  We want people to be able to see that there are Senators in this \nChamber debating the issues; that they are not clock watching and doing \nnothing to take care of the needs of the country. We are not making \nprogress on vital issues because the rules of the Senate are being \nabused. Some of our colleagues are conducting silent filibusters, which \nis a disguise for inaction. Under these silent filibusters, Senators \nare allowed to object to a bill or a nomination without ever having to \ndefend\n\n[[Page S311]]\n\ntheir position. Instead of explaining to their colleagues and the \nAmerican people why they oppose a bill, they are able to skip off to \ndinner, leaving this Chamber to total gridlock. Is it any wonder so \nmany Americans have such a low opinion of Congress? When people look at \nthe Senate and they see us stuck in a morass of dilatory activities, \nthey do not appreciate it, they do not like it, and they want action. \nThey want the people whom they have sent here, whom they voted for, \nwhom they depend upon, to do something on their behalf. If there is a \ndisagreement about whether one path is right, they will understand that \nat least we are trying to do something.\n  That is why I have spent so many months in trying to improve the way \nwe conduct business. Passing these resolutions today will assure the \nAmerican people that we are here to do their business.\n  In addition to the Merkley-Udall resolutions, we will be voting on \nother important reforms to the Senate rules today. For example, I \nsupport the measure of the Senator from Oregon, Senator Wyden, to end \nsecret holds, because the American people, again, deserve to know who \nis holding up important legislation. Transparency is something we talk \nabout constantly around here. Yet we are not willing to put it in front \nof the people. This is a much-needed reform.\n  But we need to do more to make the Senate a more effective and more \nefficient Chamber. The Senate--and I have been here a long time--was \nonce known as the world's greatest deliberative body. At some point we \ndecided--some years ago--that in order to bring the message more \nclearly to the American people we would allow television cameras to be \nhere so the American people could watch us at work. They could see us \nat work--maybe even call it supervise us at work. Well, when they see a \nbeautiful facility such as the Senate Chamber with no action going on, \nit gets to be quite depressing as far as they are concerned, and as far \nas we here are generally concerned.\n  As I said, the Senate was known as the world's greatest deliberative \nbody--the place where national conversations began and the major issues \nof the day were debated. Many of my colleagues and I want to see the \nSenate regain the respect of the American people and restore our \nreputation for serious debate and civil discourse, but we will never \nachieve this if we continue to allow our own rules to be abused. So I \nurge my friends and colleagues to join in supporting these resolutions, \nbecause if we want to help the American people get back to work, if we \nwant to restore their confidence, if we want to let them know \ngovernment is here to help and not delay, then we have to get back to \nwork too. The fact is time is being spent, but it is not being spent on \nbehalf of progress for the country.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor, and I thank my \ncolleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, who agreed to let me intervene \nwith my remarks before he spoke at the time that was agreed to.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, exactly 16 years ago, in January of \n1995, for the first time in 8 years I found myself as a member of the \nminority party here in the Senate. At the beginning of that Congress, \nRepublicans outnumbered Democrats 53 to 47; the exact same majority-to-\nminority ratio that exists today, just in reverse order. Yet even \nthough I was opposed at that time to the majority party's agenda, I \nintroduced legislation to change the Senate rules regarding the \nfilibuster.\n  My plan would have ensured ample debate and deliberation, which I \nalways hear is the stated purpose of the filibuster, but would also \nhave allowed a bill or a nominee to eventually receive a yes-or-no \nvote. Again, my proposal didn't pass.\n  I first proposed this at a conference of our Democratic Senators that \nwas held in 1994, because at that time I saw and I predicted--and it is \nin the Congressional Record that I had predicted this at that time--\nthere was an escalating use of the filibuster that was being used not \nfor debate purposes, not just to slow things down, but to actually \nprovide for a veto of pending legislation by the minority.\n  I predicted, at that time, if this arms race were not nipped in the \nbud, it would escalate because it had been escalating since the 1980s. \nDemocrats were in power. Republicans would have X number of \nfilibusters, and then when the Republicans were in power, the Democrats \nwould do the same to the Republicans. Then the Republicans would come \nback in power and the Democrats would do the same to them and back and \nforth, but each time it escalated--an escalating arms race.\n  I predicted, at that time, if we did not do something about it, it \nwas going to get worse. Unfortunately, my prediction became all too \ntrue. In the intervening years, because of the extraordinary use of the \nfilibuster, the ability of our government to legislate and to address \nthe critical problems has been severely jeopardized.\n  Sixteen years after I first introduced my proposal, it is even more \napparent that for our government to properly function, we must reform \nthe use of the filibuster. There are those who have criticized me and \nargued that Senator Harkin would not be doing this if he were in the \nminority. Well, again, that is not true. I repeat. In 1995, when I was \na member of the minority party, I first introduced my proposal.\n  The truth is, in the future, whether the Chamber is controlled by \nDemocrats or Republicans, I will continue to work to accomplish a \ncouple things. One, to provide that if there is going to be a \nfilibuster, that it is a real filibuster; that the filibuster is used \nto slow down processes, to give the minority ample time to debate and \ndiscuss and to amend, but in the end the majority rule must come to the \nSenate.\n  I thank Senator Schumer and Senator Alexander for the effort they \nmade to negotiate a package of badly needed reforms. Of course, \neliminating secret holds is long overdue. It is wrong that not only can \nthe minority block the majority from acting, but, too often, it does it \nsecretly and without any public accountability. So eliminating that and \neliminating the confirmations of many low-level executive branch \nnominees I think is meaningful movement in the right direction.\n  While I fully support these steps, they are far from the meaningful \nreforms that I think are essential to make the Senate a properly \nfunctioning legislative body. Keep in mind, we are a legislative body. \nThe filibuster was once an extraordinary tool, used in the rarest of \ninstances. Across the entire 19th century, there were only 23 \nfilibusters. From 1917, when the Senate first adopted rules on this \nuntil 1969, there were fewer than 50 in that whole timespan--less than \none a year.\n  During the 104th Congress, in 1995, when I first introduced my \nresolution, there were 82 filibusters. But it was not until the 110th \nand 111th Congresses that the abuse of the filibuster would spin wildly \nout of control. In the 110th Congress, there were an astonishing 139 \nmotions to end filibusters. In the 111th Congress just ended, there \nwere 136. That is 275 filibusters in just over 4 years. It has spun out \nof control.\n  This is not just a cold statistic of 275 filibusters. It means the \nfilibuster, instead of a rare tool to slow things down, has become an \neveryday weapon of obstruction, of veto. On almost a daily basis, one \nSenator is able to use just the threat of a filibuster to stop bills \nfrom even coming to the floor for debate and amendment, let alone a \nfinal vote.\n  In the last Congress, the filibuster was used to kill many pieces of \nlegislation that enjoyed majority and often bipartisan support. The \nreality is, because of the way the filibuster is abused today, the \nminority--the minority--has unchecked veto power over public policy. \nWhen I say minority, I do not say Republicans, I say the minority. It \ncould be the Democrats, it could be the Republicans.\n  Think about this. We are a legislative body, elected by the voters of \nthis country every 6 years to legislate, to pass legislation with the \nHouse, to send it to the President or to defeat legislation, one way or \nthe other, through our votes.\n  But it would seem to me that reason alone--reason alone--would \nsuffice to\n\n[[Page S312]]\n\nsay that legislation should be able to be passed with a majority vote. \nBut that is not what has happened in the Senate. The power to pass \nlegislation has been given to the minority. Reason alone would dictate \nthere is something inherently wrong and inherently unconstitutional \nabout this.\n  As James Madison noted when rejecting a supermajority requirement to \npass legislation, here is what James Madison said: ``It would no longer \nbe the majority that would rule: the power would be transferred to the \nminority.''\n  Unfortunately, Madison's prediction has come true. We are the only \ndemocratic body in the world--and I challenge anyone, I challenge \nanyone, to contradict me on this with proof--we are the only democratic \nbody in the world where the minority, not the majority, controls.\n  In today's Senate, democracy, of which we all claim to be such strong \nsupporters, democracy is turned on its head. The minority rules; the \nmajority is blocked. The majority has responsibility and accountability \nbut lacks the power to govern. The minority has power but lacks \naccountability or responsibility.\n  This means, as we have seen recently, that the minority can block \nbills that would improve the economy, create jobs, and then turn around \nand blame the majority for not fixing the economy. The minority can \nblock popular legislation, then accuse the majority of being \nineffective.\n  Again, I wish to note that when I refer to the minority, I am not \nsaying Republicans, I am saying the minority. Both parties have abused \nthe filibuster in the past and both will, absent real reform, abuse the \nfilibuster in the future. Although Republicans are currently in the \nminority, there is no question that control of this body will change \nagain at some point, as it always does periodically.\n  Some have argued that filibuster reform is nothing more than a \n``power grab'' by a Democratic Senator reacting to the recent elections \nin which his party lost seats. I have heard that said. Well, it is true \nit is now harder for either party to obtain the 60 votes needed to pass \nlegislation. But I wish to make clear that the reforms I advocate are \nnot about one party or one agenda gaining an unfair advantage, it is \nabout the Senate, as an institution, operating more fairly, \neffectively, and democratically.\n  I wish to repeat, I first introduced this in 1995 when I was in the \nminority. So as we say in law school, in the court of equity, I come \nwith clean hands. The truth is, as it is situated right now with \nRepublicans controlling the House, any final legislation will need to \nbe bipartisan, with or without a filibuster.\n  Let me also say, again, that for a bill to become law, it has to be \npassed by the House and the Senate in the same form--in the same form. \nThen it must go to the President. The President can veto it and then it \ntakes a two-thirds vote to override a veto. There are a lot of checks \nand balances out there. So the need for the check on legislation by the \nminority with the ultimate power to veto that is not needed--not \nneeded; in fact, inimical to a democratic institution.\n  It was former majority leader Bill Frist who said, when he normally \nshut down the body over the use of filibusters to block a handful of \njudges, again by Democrats, ``This filibuster is nothing less than a \nformula for tyranny by the minority.''\n  Further, I wish to make it clear it is not those of us who seek \nreform who are engaged in a power grab. It is those who insist on \nhanging on to an antiquated rule who are grabbing for power. It is \nthose who have taken an extraordinary tool, once used sparingly, to \nensure ample debate and deliberation and turned it into a monstrosity, \ndestroying the power of the majority to govern, turning over effective \ncontrol of the Senate to the party that failed to elect a majority of \nSenators.\n  That is the real power grab. That is the real power grab. Moreover, \ndespite the dire predictions of opponents of reform, filibuster reform \ndoes not mean the end of minority rights in the Senate. Senators of all \nparties will continue to have ample time to make arguments, attempt to \npersuade the public or a majority of their colleagues.\n  The reform proposals that are being considered fully protect the \nrights of the minority to full and vigorous debate and deliberation, \nmaintaining the hallmark of the Senate.\n  Presently, Republicans have stated the filibusters were necessary \nbecause Democrats employed a procedural maneuver to deprive them of the \nright to offer amendments, the so-called filling of the tree. Well, \nnotwithstanding the rejoinder that Republican abuse amendments, such as \noffering amendments totally unrelated to the pending matter--and there \nagain this is where you get into the chicken and egg, who did it first \nto whom? Nonetheless, I am sympathetic to the argument that the \nminority ought to have the right to be able to offer amendments. That \nis why I have included in my resolution guaranteed rights to offer \ngermane amendments--germane amendments, not an amendment dealing with \nsomething totally unrelated to the legislation on the floor--to offer \nlegitimate, germane amendments which the minority feels would improve \nor change, to the minority's liking, whatever legislation, amendment or \nbill might be on the floor.\n  Too many people, I believe, confuse minority rights with minority \nwinning. Having the right to debate and to deliberate and to offer \namendments does not mean you have the right to get your way. Being \nallowed to vote on your amendment does not mean you have a right to win \nthe vote. The minority does not deserve the right to prevail in every \ninstance.\n  The minority obviously can convince some of the majority to join \nthem. Then they become the majority on a given issue or given \namendment. That used to happen all the time around here. There is \nnothing wrong with that. But the minority, I submit, does not deserve \nthe right, under our Constitution, nor under any reasonable \ninterpretation of a Democratic legislative body--they do not have the \nright to systematically block action by the majority and to veto, to \nhave veto power, over what can even be considered on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  The fact is, provided that the minority is vested with ample \nprotections, as it is in my proposal, at the end of ample debate, the \nmajority should be allowed to act. What is so radical? What is so \nstrange about the notion that in a legislative body, the peoples' \nrepresentatives should vote up or down on legislation or a nominee?\n  As Senator Henry Cabot Lodge stated many years ago: ``To vote without \ndebating is perilous, but to debate and never vote is imbecile.''\n  I think at the heart of this debate is a central question that we are \nnot coming to grips with. Do we truly believe in democracy? Do we truly \nbelieve the issues of public policy should be decided at the ballot box \nand not by the manipulation of archaic procedural rules? I think the \ntruth is, both parties appear to be afraid of majority rule, afraid of \nallowing a majority of Senators to work their will.\n\n  At its heart, those who hang on to this outdated rule, those who \nvigorously oppose the majority having the ability to govern fear the \nAmerican people. They fear that the people's choices and wishes will be \ntranslated into action here in Washington.\n  The central question for this body is clear: Do we or do we not \nbelieve in democracy and majority rule? Elections should have \nconsequences. After ample protections for minority rights, the majority \nparty in the Senate, whether Democratic or Republican, duly elected by \nthe American people, should be allowed to carry out their agenda and be \nallowed to govern.\n  Should I be opposed to reform of the filibuster because I am afraid \nRepublicans someday will become the majority party in the Senate and \nproceed to enact their agenda? No. I believe in democracy for \nRepublicans and Democrats alike. I believe in majority rule for \nRepublicans and Democrats alike.\n  The distinguished minority leader said recently in regard to this \nproposal that Democrats ought to be concerned because a couple years \nfrom now Republicans might take over this place and would be able to \nundo a lot of the things we did--fear that somehow the Republicans will \nget the majority and be able to enact their agenda. I say to my \nfriends, God bless them. If they win the election and become the \nmajority party, they ought to govern. What are\n\n[[Page S313]]\n\nthe checks and balances? We don't know whether the President will be a \nDemocrat or a Republican. We don't know what the House is going to be. \nThere are still a lot of internal checks and balances in the committee \nstructure.\n  The minority, under my proposal, can still slow things down. I read \nin the paper that one Senator said it ought to be the right of the \nminority to slow things down. I believe that. I believe that in the \nSenate the minority ought to have the right to slow things down. That \nis why my proposal provides for that. There is ample opportunity to \nslow things down, throw some sand in the gearbox of the majority. But \nin my proposal, at the end of a period of time of 8 days, the majority \ncan govern. So one can slow it down--slow down everything, every \namendment, every bill--so compromise negotiations would still go on.\n  I hear from my side: What if the tea party gains a majority in the \nSenate? We will need to filibuster to stop them. I say to my friends on \nthis side and others, it is a sad day in America when the only way we \ncan stop the tea party or any other extreme group is through \nsubterfuge, through filibusters, secret holds, and parliamentary \ntrickery. We have to have a fundamental confidence in democracy and the \ngood sense of the American people. We have to have confidence in our \nability to make our case to the American people and to prevail at the \nballot box. We must not be afraid of the American people. We must not \nbe afraid of how they cast their votes or for whom. I am not afraid of \nthe will of the people expressed at the ballot box. That is what sent \nme to this Chamber. I should note, that used to be the operating \nprinciple of this body, but over the years, especially recently, it has \nbecome grossly distorted.\n  We all have our views on the recent election and what the American \npeople said. Everybody has a view on that. I will say what my view is. \nThe American people spoke loudly that they are fed up and angry with \nWashington, with government, and with Congress. They want change, and \nthey want an end to the dysfunction in this city. In too many critical \nareas--job creation, energy, the economy--people see a Congress that is \nunable to respond effectively to the urgent challenges of our time.\n  My proposal is basically the same as I offered 16 years ago. It would \namend the Standing Rules of the Senate to permit a decreasing majority \nof Senators over a period of 8 days to invoke cloture on a given \nmatter. A determined minority could slow things down for 8 days. \nSenators would have ample time to make arguments and attempt to \npersuade the public and a majority of their colleagues. This protects \nthe right of the minority to full and vigorous debate and deliberation, \nagain maintaining the hallmark of the Senate. At the end of ample \ndebate, however, there would be an up-or-down vote on an amendment, a \nbill, a nominee. My proposal would restore a basic and essential \nprinciple of representative democracy: majority rule in a legislative \nbody.\n  I also think there is another advantage--that it would lead to \ngreater compromise. Many have argued that it is the filibuster that \nforces compromise and collaboration. I disagree. The fact is, right now \nthe minority has no real incentive to compromise. Why should they if \nthey can totally block something and then go out and campaign on a \nmessage that the majority just couldn't get anything done? Again, the \nminority has a great deal of power but zero incentive on compromise.\n  I believe my proposal would encourage a more robust spirit of \ncompromise. If the minority knows that at the end of the day, at the \nend of 8 days, 51 votes will be enough to bring a bill to the floor or \nto end debate on an amendment or a nominee, it seems they would be more \nwilling to come to the table and compromise. And for the majority, the \nreason to compromise is because for the majority party in the Senate--\neither one, Democratic or Republican--one of the most valuable things \nis time, allocation of time. The majority always wants to save time. So \nrather than chew up 8 days on a nominee or an amendment, the majority \nwould like to get it done in a day or so. The minority, knowing that at \nthe end of 8 days, 51 votes can pass something, will say: Maybe we \nought to compromise now and get what we can out of it without dragging \nit out 8 days. Right now, there is literally zero incentive to \ncompromise.\n  I also strongly encourage colleagues to support the talking \nfilibuster proposal of Senator Merkley. They claim it is about \nsilencing the minority. The fact is, the filibuster has nothing to do \nwith debate and deliberation. It is used to prevent consideration. \nRather than serve to ensure the representation of minority views and to \nfoster deliberation, the minority uses the filibuster to prevent debate \nand deliberation. The filibuster has been used to defeat bills and \nnominees without their receiving a discussion on the floor. So the \nworld's greatest deliberative body has now become the world's greatest \nnondeliberative body.\n  I think a ``yes'' vote today on a vote for reform, for change, and \nfor a government that can effectively address our Nation's challenges \nis a vote to move ahead. It is a vote for progress--or we can vote for \ncontinued gridlock, continued obstruction, and broken government. This \nbody does not function the way it is supposed to.\n  To be sure, the Founders put in place a system of checks and balances \nthat makes it enormously difficult to enact legislation. It must pass \nboth Houses of Congress. It has to go through committees first. It must \npass both Houses of Congress, go to a conference committee, then it \ngoes to the President. He can veto it. And then it can be challenged in \ncourt. All are very significant checks.\n  I often hear opponents of reform claim that what I am proposing would \nturn the Senate into the House of Representatives because at the end of \n8 days, 51 votes could move something. I ask my friends: When did the \nSenate become defined by Senate rule XXII, which is the filibuster \nrule? I thought the Senate was defined in the Constitution. Rule XXII, \nthe filibuster rule, is not the essence of the Senate. Regardless, the \nSenate will continue to be totally different from the House. We have \ntwo Senators from small States, two Senators from large States. We are \nelected every 6 years. We have sole jurisdiction over treaties, \nimpeachments. And the Senate operates, as we know, in so many instances \nbased on unanimous consent. That will continue. So the power of one \nsingle Senator remains to object to any unanimous consent request. \nEliminating the filibuster will not change the basic nature of this \nbody, nor the constitutional structure of the Senate.\n  For most of the Senate's history, there were very few filibusters--at \nmost one or two a year. Can someone suggest that the Senate of Henry \nClay or Daniel Webster, Lyndon Johnson, Everett Dirksen, that that \nSenate was the same as the House of Representatives? Even in my short \ntime here--26 years--we used to have amendments on the floor that we \nwould debate and vote, and if you got 51 votes, you won. We don't do \nthat anymore. Under the present structure of the Senate, under the \npresent rule XXII, the way it is being used today, every measure that \npasses the Senate must have 60 votes. Whatever happened to the idea of \nmajority rule? Now one has to have 60 votes.\n  I have heard some say that if we have to have 60 votes, this \nencourages compromise to get to the 60 votes. I am all for compromise. \nI have brought a lot of legislation to the floor in my time here, and \nsome has been adopted 100 to nothing. Farm bills, appropriations bills, \nothers that I have brought to the floor, both in the majority party and \nin the minority party as the ranking member on a committee--and we \ndidn't need 60 votes. If someone offered an amendment, they had the \nright to offer an amendment and get 51 or 52 or 53 votes and win. I \nhave never stood at that desk, either as a committee chair or as \nranking member, and insisted that a bill we had on the floor had to \nhave 60 votes in order to pass. But that is what has happened in the \nSenate now.\n  Some say that promotes compromise. Anyone who has a bill or an \namendment wants to get the most votes possible, right? They want to get \nmore votes. That is the nature of legislation. But sometimes there is a \nbill or an amendment that does not lend itself to easy compromise. It \nmay be contentious. We may have to take a hard vote. Maybe it only gets \n51 votes.\n\n[[Page S314]]\n\nShould that amendment go down to failure because it got 51 or 52 or 53 \nor 54 or 55 or 58 or 59 votes? Go out and explain that to the American \npeople. Go to the next townhall meeting and say: No matter what \nhappens, you can't pass anything with 51 votes. You have to have 60 \nvotes to pass anything in the Senate. That gives the minority the right \nto veto anything. See how people react to that. When they understand \nit, they say: That is nuts.\n  We all stand for election every 6 years. If we only get 52 percent of \nthe vote, maybe we shouldn't be here because obviously there was no \nconsensus among the people who voted for us that we should represent \nthem if we didn't get 60 percent of the vote. Is that what is coming, \nthat we have to have 60 percent of the vote to even serve in the \nSenate? I know I am taking it to its extreme. I know no one is \nsuggesting that. But boiled down to its essence, what we are saying is, \nwithout adopting reform of the filibuster, yes, we as a U.S. Senate \nbelieve a minority has the right to veto anything in this Senate.\n  I would much rather be on the side that says the minority has a right \nto slow things down, the minority has the right to debate, the minority \nhas the right to amend, and the minority has a right to win those \namendments with 51 votes. But a minority should not have the right to \nveto and stop legislation.\n  That is what my proposal does: adequate time for debate, adequate \ntime for amendments, ensuring that the minority can offer an amendment, \nbut, in the end, the majority would rule. It was never intended--never, \nnever intended--that a supermajority of 60 votes would be needed to \nenact any piece of legislation, any amendment, or confirm a nominee.\n  Indeed, the Framers of our Constitution were very clear about where a \nsupermajority was required. There were only five to the original \nConstitution: ratification of a treaty, overriding a veto, votes of \nimpeachment, passage of a constitutional amendment, and expulsion of a \nMember.\n  It may come as a shock to many people, but the filibuster is not in \nthe Constitution of the United States. In fact, historically, the first \nSenate, when it met, included a rule that permitted the majority to end \ndebate and bring a measure to a vote with a majority. It was called \n``invoking the previous question.'' But they had the right to do that. \nIt was done away with by Aaron Burr, then-Vice President of the United \nStates. We know what happened to him. But that was done away with.\n  So the Senate embarked upon a little over 100 years of having no \nrules. But, then again, the Senate did not do much. They really did not \ndo much. However, in the 21st century, as a major superpower, with \nthings happening with lightning speed around the world, we have to be \nable to react a little bit more rapidly than how we reacted in the 19th \ncentury.\n  Moreover, reform of filibuster rules stands squarely within a \ntradition of updating Senate rules as needed to foster an effective \ngovernment that can respond to the challenges of the day. The Senate \nhas adopted rules that forbid the filibuster in numerous circumstances, \nsuch as war powers and the budget. Think about that. For some reason, \nthe Senate, at some point in time, said you cannot filibuster the \nbudget. Imagine that. You can filibuster other things, but you cannot \nfilibuster the budget. How about war powers? What could be more \nimportant than whether or not we go to war? It is a power granted to \nthe Congress by the Constitution, but you cannot filibuster it. Think \nabout that.\n  So we have rules that forbid the filibuster. We have passed four \nsignificant reforms of the filibuster since 1917. Today, unfortunately, \nit has become abundantly clear that we cannot govern a 21st-century \nsuperpower when a minority of 41 Senators can dictate action or \ninaction to a majority of the Senate and a majority of the American \npeople--a majority of the American people.\n  We had a bill here last year; it was called the DISCLOSE Act. The \nHouse passed it twice overwhelmingly. They sent it to the Senate. Now, \nwhat did the DISCLOSE Act say? All it did is say the Supreme Court \ndecision in Citizens United, that allowed corporate money to be \nfunneled into campaigns to defeat or support an opponent and did not \nhave to be accounted for, did not have to be made public. Many people \nsuspected there was foreign money coming in through various sources to \ninfluence campaigns in the United States because they did not have to \nreport it. So the bill came through that did not overturn the Supreme \nCourt decision. It just said: If you are going to do this, you have to \ndisclose where you got the money.\n  It passed the House. Polls showed it was supported by well over 80 \npercent of the people, a majority of Republicans and Democrats around \nthe country. It came to the Senate twice. It got 59 votes. Why isn't it \nlaw today? Because you need 60 votes--60 votes. Go back and explain \nthat at your town meetings. Go back and tell them: We don't have that \ntoday. We don't have that sunshine law because we need 60 votes, even \nthough we got 59.\n  This is not the kind of representative democracy the Founders \nenvisioned. It is not the kind of representative democracy that our \nsons and daughters have fought and died for for over 200 years. How \nmany of our young men and women in uniform today--risking their lives \nin Afghanistan, Iraq, around the globe--how many of them know they are \nrisking their lives for minority rule--for minority rule, not majority \nrule--minority rule? Very few, I submit. Very few.\n  It is time to end the paralysis, the drift, and the decline in the \nSenate. Yes, let's commit ourselves to debate and deliberation. There \nis nothing wrong with that, nothing wrong with extended debate. There \nis nothing wrong with having compromises. There comes a time when maybe \na compromise is not in the cards. But should that mean we cannot vote \non it, I say to my friends? Should that mean if we cannot get 60 votes, \nwe do not even deserve to have 51 or 52 or 53 votes? Is that what we \nare saying?\n  I have heard my friends on the other side--I think I heard; I do not \nknow exactly who it was today--say: Well, the 60 votes promotes \ncompromise. I am all for that. But what if we cannot get the \ncompromise, I say? Then are we saying we cannot have a vote because we \ncannot get 60 votes? That is, in essence, what they are saying. It is \nnot the bedrock of democratic principle to deny the majority to rule, \nto finally have a vote.\n  So there may be a lot of misinterpretations of the amendment I am \noffering: Oh, it is going to make us like the House. Nonsense. It is \ngoing to take away minority rights. Nonsense. It is going to take away \nthe right of the minority to slow things down. Nonsense.\n  What my amendment does is it says, finally, at some point in time, we \nare going to exercise our constitutional obligation.\n  I will close on this: Every 6 years we have an election and we go \ndown here and hold up our right hand and we swear an oath. We swear an \noath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States against \nall enemies, foreign and domestic, and to bear true faith and \nallegiance to the same.\n  I submit we are not living up to our oath of office in terms of \nbearing true faith and allegiance to the Constitution when, on the \nother hand, we enact rules that deny the majority the right to govern--\nwhen we deny the majority the right to govern.\n  So I say every Senator has a lot of power here. The power of a \nSenator comes not from what we can do but from what we can stop. I have \noften said that is kind of the dirty little secret of the Senate.\n  Well, I think it is time for each of us to give up a little bit of \nour power, to give up a little bit of our power for the good of the \ncountry, to give up a little bit of our power of being able to stop \nsomething in order that the majority--whomever that majority may be--\ncan carry out their agenda on behalf of the American people.\n  I do not fear--I do not fear--the voters. I do not fear the ballot \nbox. What I fear is this Senate will continue to be dysfunctional, it \nwill not be able to act, we will continue to drift, we will not be able \nto respond to the exigencies of our time, the American people will get \nmore and more frustrated and disappointed in the workings of our \ngovernment, and the end result will be a decline in America.\n  Look, I am not Pollyannaish. I know none of these proposals will \nsucceed. It\n\n[[Page S315]]\n\ntakes 67 votes, they say, to change the rules of the Senate. I believe \nthat is inherently unconstitutional. Can one Congress bind another? Can \none Congress bind all future Congresses? Can one Senate bind all future \nSenates? Can one Senate in a moment of time say we need 90 votes to \npass anything here because 90 Members happen to be of one party, so \nthey enact a rule and they say we have to have 90 votes to change any \nrule, knowing it will probably never happen again?\n  As Senator Byrd said one time--I know he is being quoted a lot around \nhere today and when it comes to these debates--we should not be bound \nby the dead hand of the past--the dead hand of the past.\n  I believe it is the inherent right of the Senate to change its rules \nby a majority vote at the beginning of any Congress. That is what it \nsays in the Constitution. Each House shall make its rules. It does not \nsay each House makes its rules and every succeeding House must abide by \nthose rules. It does not say that.\n  So I think we are left with a situation where the Senate--where the \nSenate--cannot live up to its constitutional obligation. I think it is \nalmost inherently impossible for the Senate to do so. Therefore, I \nthink we must now have to look to the courts to provide some relief in \nthis matter, just as the Supreme Court decided in Baker v. Carr that \nlegislatures could not reapportion themselves. So, therefore, they \nfound it unconstitutional.\n  I, quite frankly, think a case can be made to the courts that the \nSenate rules, as they are now applied with the 67-vote threshold, \nprevent me, a Senator from Iowa, prevent a Senator from Georgia, \nprevent a Senator from Oregon from fulfilling his or her constitutional \nobligations to their constituents, to the people who elected them, to \ntry to get legislation passed on a majority basis.\n  So, like I said, I am not Pollyannaish. I know where the votes are \ntoday. I do not know--I know my proposal will not get many votes. It \ndid not get many in 1995 either. And people say: Well, Harkin, why are \nyou doing this? Why do you do it when you know you do not get many \nvotes? I do it because I believe in it. I believe with all my heart and \nall my soul that the Senate is not operating constitutionally right \nnow. So I feel this fight must continue.\n  As I said, I now come to that point in time where I believe that \nperhaps we must look to the courts for their decision on whether the \nSenate is capable of fulfilling its constitutional responsibilities and \nobligations.\n  So I hope we do not have to go there. I hope we could adopt some of \nthese reforms, such as the Merkley amendment or my proposal. Quite \nfrankly, at the essence of it is the proposal by the Senator from New \nMexico. That is the heart of it. Can a majority of the Senate change \nits rules at the beginning of a Senate? I believe it is \nconstitutionally not only permissible, but I think we are obligated by \nthe Constitution every 2 years to adopt the rules of the Senate by a \nmajority vote and not by 67 votes.\n\n  So I close my part of the debate by appealing to the conscience of \nour Senators to think about majority rule, think about the rights of \nthe minority but think about the rights of the American people to have \ntheir voices heard here by a majority vote and not by a supermajority. \nI believe that is our constitutional obligation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I rise briefly to address a few remarks \nmade by the senior Senator from Iowa and to compliment my colleague \nfrom Tennessee. But first, regarding all of these talks about our \nFounding Fathers and our Constitution, if our Founding Fathers had not \nintended for supermajorities to determine certain acts of this \nCongress, why would two-thirds of us have to vote to pass a \nconstitutional amendment and three-fourths of the States have to vote \nto ratify one? I think that showed the intent. If our Founding Fathers \nhad not intended for minority representation to exist, I wouldn't have \ntwo Senators like California; everybody would have a proportionate \nnumber of Senators. Finally and most importantly, with regard to the \nnotion that we are the only democracy in the world to have a rule where \nmajority rules, the fact is, that may be true. We are also the richest, \nsafest, most prosperous democracy in the world, and that has a lot to \ndo with the way we govern ourselves. So I wanted to make those three \npoints.\n  I wish to congratulate Senators Wyden, McCaskill, and Grassley on \nwhat I think is a very appropriate amendment to make sure we have total \ntransparency in our process of holds in the Senate. I think that is \nright, and I think that is exactly what the American people would \nexpress.\n  Lastly, I wish to thank the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator \nfrom New York. In the last few weeks, they have done a lot of good \nwork--yeoman's work, as a matter of fact--to make sure this Senate \ndoesn't rush to judgment and make a mistake that would not be in the \ninterests of the institution or the American people. The Senate in the \nend is all about Senators putting their shoulders to the grindstone and \nmaking things work, and I think in this case the Senator from Tennessee \nhas done exactly that, and I wish to compliment him on his work.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I wish to thank all of the \nSenators who have come down for this debate. These are just a couple of \ncleanup, housekeeping things I need to do.\n  First of all, the charge was made that we are trying to make the \nSenate like the House. Rather than get in a long debate here, I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record Federalist Paper No. 62 \nand a letter from a number of scholars who testified before the Rules \nCommittee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         The Federalist Papers\n\n\n                           FEDERALIST No. 62\n\n                               The Senate\n\n                  Alexander Hamilton or James Madison\n\n       To the People of the State of New York:\n       HAVING examined the constitution of the House of \n     Representatives, and answered such of the objections against \n     it as seemed to merit notice, I enter next on the examination \n     of the Senate.\n       The heads into which this member of the government may be \n     considered are:\n       I. The qualification of senators;\n       II. The appointment of them by the State legislatures;\n       III. The equality of representation in the Senate;\n       IV. The number of senators, and the term for which they are \n     to be elected;\n       V. The powers vested in the Senate.\n       I. The qualifications proposed for senators, as \n     distinguished from those of representatives, consist in a \n     more advanced age and a longer period of citizenship. A \n     senator must be thirty years of age at least; as a \n     representative must be twenty-five. And the former must have \n     been a citizen nine years; as seven years are required for \n     the latter. The propriety of these distinctions is explained \n     by the nature of the senatorial trust, which, requiring \n     greater extent of information and stability of character, \n     requires at the same time that the senator should have \n     reached a period of life most likely to supply these \n     advantages; and which, participating immediately in \n     transactions with foreign nations, ought to be exercised by \n     none who are not thoroughly weaned from the prepossessions \n     and habits incident to foreign birth and education. The term \n     of nine years appears to be a prudent mediocrity between a \n     total exclusion of adopted citizens, whose merits and talents \n     may claim a share in the public confidence, and an \n     indiscriminate and hasty admission of them, which might \n     create a channel for foreign influence on the national \n     councils.\n       II. It is equally unnecessary to dilate on the appointment \n     of senators by the State legislatures. Among the various \n     modes which might have been devised for constituting this \n     branch of the government, that which has been proposed by the \n     convention is probably the most congenial with the public \n     opinion. It is recommended by the double advantage of \n     favoring a select appointment, and of giving to the State \n     governments such an agency in the formation of the federal \n     government as must secure the authority of the former, and \n     may form a convenient link between the two systems.\n       III. The equality of representation in the Senate is \n     another point, which, being evidently the result of \n     compromise between the opposite pretensions of the large and \n     the small States, does not call for much discussion. If \n     indeed it be right, that among a people thoroughly \n     incorporated into one nation, every district ought to have a \n     PROPORTIONAL share in the government, and that among \n     independent and sovereign States, bound together by a simple \n     league, the parties, however unequal in size, ought to have \n     an EQUAL share in the common councils, it\n\n[[Page S316]]\n\n     does not appear to be without some reason that in a compound \n     republic, partaking both of the national and federal \n     character, the government ought to be founded on a mixture of \n     the principles of proportional and equal representation. But \n     it is superfluous to try, by the standard of theory, a part \n     of the Constitution which is allowed on all hands to be the \n     result, not of theory, but ``of a spirit of amity, and that \n     mutual deference and concession which the peculiarity of our \n     political situation rendered indispensable.'' A common \n     government, with powers equal to its objects, is called for \n     by the voice, and still more loudly by the political \n     situation, of America. A government founded on principles \n     more consonant to the wishes of the larger States, is not \n     likely to be obtained from the smaller States. The only \n     option, then, for the former, lies between the proposed \n     government and a government still more objectionable. Under \n     this alternative, the advice of prudence must be to embrace \n     the lesser evil; and, instead of indulging a fruitless \n     anticipation of the possible mischiefs which may ensue, to \n     contemplate rather the advantageous consequences which may \n     qualify the sacrifice.\n       In this spirit it may be remarked, that the equal vote \n     allowed to each State is at once a constitutional recognition \n     of the portion of sovereignty remaining in the individual \n     States, and an instrument for preserving that residuary \n     sovereignty. So far the equality ought to be no less \n     acceptable to the large than to the small States; since they \n     are not less solicitous to guard, by every possible \n     expedient, against an improper consolidation of the States \n     into one simple republic.\n       Another advantage accruing from this ingredient in the \n     constitution of the Senate is, the additional impediment it \n     must prove against improper acts of legislation. No law or \n     resolution can now be passed without the concurrence, first, \n     of a majority of the people, and then, of a majority of the \n     States. It must be acknowledged that this complicated check \n     on legislation may in some instances be injurious as well as \n     beneficial; and that the peculiar defense which it involves \n     in favor of the smaller States, would be more rational, if \n     any interests common to them, and distinct from those of the \n     other States, would otherwise be exposed to peculiar danger. \n     But as the larger States will always be able, by their power \n     over the supplies, to defeat unreasonable exertions of this \n     prerogative of the lesser States, and as the faculty and \n     excess of law-making seem to be the diseases to which our \n     governments are most liable, it is not impossible that this \n     part of the Constitution may be more convenient in practice \n     than it appears to many in contemplation.\n       IV. The number of senators, and the duration of their \n     appointment, come next to be considered. In order to form an \n     accurate judgment on both of these points, it will be proper \n     to inquire into the purposes which are to be answered by a \n     senate; and in order to ascertain these, it will be necessary \n     to review the inconveniences which a republic must suffer \n     from the want of such an institution.\n       First. It is a misfortune incident to republican \n     government, though in a less degree than to other \n     governments, that those who administer it may forget their \n     obligations to their constituents, and prove unfaithful to \n     their important trust. In this point of view, a senate, as a \n     second branch of the legislative assembly, distinct from, and \n     dividing the power with, a first, must be in all cases a \n     salutary check on the government. It doubles the security to \n     the people, by requiring the concurrence of two distinct \n     bodies in schemes of usurpation or perfidy, where the \n     ambition or corruption of one would otherwise be sufficient. \n     This is a precaution founded on such clear principles, and \n     now so well understood in the United States, that it would be \n     more than superfluous to enlarge on it. I will barely remark, \n     that as the improbability of sinister combinations will be in \n     proportion to the dissimilarity in the genius of the two \n     bodies, it must be politic to distinguish them from each \n     other by every circumstance which will consist with a due \n     harmony in all proper measures, and with the genuine \n     principles of republican government.\n       Secondly. The necessity of a senate is not less indicated \n     by the propensity of all single and numerous assemblies to \n     yield to the impulse of sudden and violent passions, and to \n     be seduced by factious leaders into intemperate and \n     pernicious resolutions. Examples on this subject might be \n     cited without number; and from proceedings within the United \n     States, as well as from the history of other nations. But a \n     position that will not be contradicted, need not be proved. \n     All that need be remarked is, that a body which is to correct \n     this infirmity ought itself to be free from it, and \n     consequently ought to be less numerous. It ought, moreover, \n     to possess great firmness, and consequently ought to hold its \n     authority by a tenure of considerable duration.\n       Thirdly. Another defect to be supplied by a senate lies in \n     a want of due acquaintance with the objects and principles of \n     legislation. It is not possible that an assembly of men \n     called for the most part from pursuits of a private nature, \n     continued in appointment for a short time, and led by no \n     permanent motive to devote the intervals of public occupation \n     to a study of the laws, the affairs, and the comprehensive \n     interests of their country, should, if left wholly to \n     themselves, escape a variety of important errors in the \n     exercise of their legislative trust. It may be affirmed, on \n     the best grounds, that no small share of the present \n     embarrassments of America is to be charged on the blunders of \n     our governments; and that these have proceeded from the heads \n     rather than the hearts of most of the authors of them. What \n     indeed are all the repealing, explaining, and amending laws, \n     which fill and disgrace our voluminous codes, but so many \n     monuments of deficient wisdom; so many impeachments exhibited \n     by each succeeding against each preceding session; so many \n     admonitions to the people, of the value of those aids which \n     may be expected from a well-constituted senate?\n       A good government implies two things: first, fidelity to \n     the object of government, which is the happiness of the \n     people; secondly, a knowledge of the means by which that \n     object can be best attained. Some governments are deficient \n     in both these qualities; most governments are deficient in \n     the first. I scruple not to assert, that in American \n     governments too little attention has been paid to the last. \n     The federal Constitution avoids this error; and what merits \n     particular notice, it provides for the last in a mode which \n     increases the security for the first.\n       Fourthly. The mutability in the public councils arising \n     from a rapid succession of new members, however qualified \n     they may be, points out, in the strongest manner, the \n     necessity of some stable institution in the government. Every \n     new election in the States is found to change one half of \n     the representatives. From this change of men must proceed \n     a change of opinions; and from a change of opinions, a \n     change of measures. But a continual change even of good \n     measures is inconsistent with every rule of prudence and \n     every prospect of success. The remark is verified in \n     private life, and becomes more just, as well as more \n     important, in national transactions.\n       To trace the mischievous effects of a mutable government \n     would fill a volume. I will hint a few only, each of which \n     will be perceived to be a source of innumerable others.\n       In the first place, it forfeits the respect and confidence \n     of other nations, and all the advantages connected with \n     national character. An individual who is-observed to be \n     inconstant to his plans, or perhaps to carry on his affairs \n     without any plan at all, is marked at once, by all prudent \n     people, as a speedy victim to his own unsteadiness and folly. \n     His more friendly neighbors may pity him, but all will \n     decline to connect their fortunes with his; and not a few \n     will seize the opportunity of making their fortunes out of \n     his. One nation is to another what one individual is to \n     another; with this melancholy distinction perhaps, that the \n     former, with fewer of the benevolent emotions than the \n     latter, are under fewer restraints also from taking undue \n     advantage from the indiscretions of each other. Every nation, \n     consequently, whose affairs betray a want of wisdom and \n     stability, may calculate on every loss which can be sustained \n     from the more systematic policy of their wiser neighbors. But \n     the best instruction on this subject is unhappily conveyed to \n     America by the example of her own situation. She finds that \n     she is held in no respect by her friends; that she is the \n     derision of her enemies; and that she is a prey to every \n     nation which has an interest in speculating on her \n     fluctuating councils and embarrassed affairs.\n       The internal effects of a mutable policy are still more \n     calamitous. It poisons the blessing of liberty itself. It \n     will be of little avail to the people, that the laws are made \n     by men of their own choice, if the laws be so voluminous that \n     they cannot be read, or so incoherent that they cannot be \n     understood; if they be repealed or revised before they are \n     promulgated, or undergo such incessant changes that no man, \n     who knows what the law is to-day, can guess what it will be \n     to- morrow. Law is defined to be a rule of action; but how \n     can that be a rule, which is little known, and less fixed?\n       Another effect of public instability is the unreasonable \n     advantage it gives to the sagacious, the enterprising, and \n     the moneyed few over the industrious and uniformed mass of \n     the people. Every new regulation concerning commerce or \n     revenue, or in any way affecting the value of the different \n     species of property, presents a new harvest to those who \n     watch the change, and can trace its consequences; a harvest, \n     reared not by themselves, but by the toils and cares of the \n     great body of their fellow-citizens. This is a state of \n     things in which it may be said with some truth that laws are \n     made for the FEW, not for the MANY.\n       In another point of view, great injury results from an \n     unstable government. The want of confidence in the public \n     councils damps every useful undertaking, the success and \n     profit of which may depend on a continuance of existing \n     arrangements. What prudent merchant will hazard his fortunes \n     in any new branch of commerce when he knows not but that his \n     plans may be rendered unlawful before they can be executed? \n     What farmer or manufacturer will lay himself out for the \n     encouragement given to any particular cultivation or \n     establishment, when he can have no assurance that his \n     preparatory labors and advances will not render him a victim \n     to an inconstant government? In a word, no great improvement \n     or laudable enterprise can go forward which requires the \n     auspices of a steady system of national policy.\n       But the most deplorable effect of all is that diminution of \n     attachment and reverence which steals into the hearts of the \n     people, towards a political system which betrays so many \n     marks of infirmity, and disappoints so\n\n[[Page S317]]\n\n     many of their flattering hopes. No government, any more than \n     an individual, will long be respected without being truly \n     respectable; nor be truly respectable, without possessing a \n     certain portion of order and stability.\n\n     PUBLIUS.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 December 2, 2010.\n       Dear Members of the Senate: As you know, the Senate has \n     debated the merits of the filibuster and related procedural \n     rules for over two centuries. Recently, several senators who \n     are advocating changes to Senate Rule XXII have renewed this \n     discussion. We write this letter today to clarify some of the \n     common historical and constitutional misperceptions about the \n     filibuster and Rule XXII that all too often surface during \n     debates about Senate rules.\n       First, many argue that senators have a constitutional right \n     to extended debate. However, there is no explicit \n     constitutional right to filibuster. In fact, there is ample \n     evidence that the framers preferred majority rather than \n     supermajority voting rules. The framers knew full well the \n     difficulties posed by supermajority rules, given their \n     experiences in the Confederation Congress under the Articles \n     of Confederation (which required a supermajority vote to pass \n     measures on the most important matters). A common result was \n     stalemate; legislators frequently found themselves unable to \n     muster support from a supermajority of the states for \n     essential matters of governing. In the Constitution, the \n     framers specified that supermajority votes would be necessary \n     in seven, extraordinary situations--which they specifically \n     listed (including overriding a presidential veto, expelling a \n     member of the Senate, and ratifying a treaty). These, of \n     course, are all voting requirements for passing measures, \n     rather than rules for bringing debate to a close.\n       Second, although historical lore says that the filibuster \n     was part of the original design of the Senate, there is no \n     empirical basis for that view. There is no question that the \n     framers intended the Senate to be a deliberative body. But \n     they sought to achieve that goal through structural features \n     of the chamber intended to facilitate deliberation--such as \n     the Senate's smaller size, longer and staggered terms, and \n     older members. There is no historical evidence that the \n     framers anticipated that the Senate would adopt rules \n     allowing for a filibuster. In fact, the first House and the \n     first Senate had nearly identical rulebooks, both of which \n     included a motion to move the previous question. The House \n     converted that rule into a simple majority cloture rule early \n     in its history. The Senate did not.\n       What happened to the Senate's previous question motion? In \n     1805, as presiding officer of the Senate, Vice President \n     Aaron Burr recommended a pruning of the Senate's rules. He \n     singled out the previous question motion as unnecessary \n     (keeping in mind that the rule had not yet routinely been \n     used in either chamber as a simple majority cloture motion). \n     When senators met in 1806 to re-codify the rules, they \n     deleted the previous question motion from the Senate \n     rulebook. Senators did so not because they sought to create \n     the opportunity to filibuster; they abandoned the motion as a \n     matter of procedural housekeeping. Deletion of the motion \n     took away one of the possible avenues for cutting off debate \n     by majority vote, but did not constitute a deliberate choice \n     to allow obstruction. The first documented filibusters did \n     not occur until the 1830s, and for the next century they were \n     rare (but often effective) occurrences in a chamber in which \n     majorities generally reigned.\n       Finally, the adoption of Rule XXII in 1917 did not reflect \n     a broad-based Senate preference for a supermajority cloture \n     rule. At that time, a substantial portion of the majority \n     party favored a simple majority rule. But many minority party \n     members preferred a supermajority cloture rule, while others \n     preferred no cloture rule at all. A bargain was struck: \n     Opponents of reform promised not to block the rule change and \n     proponents of reform promised not to push for a simple \n     majority cloture rule. The two-thirds threshold, in other \n     words, was the product of bargaining and compromise with the \n     minority. As has been typical of the Senate's past episodes \n     of procedural change, pragmatic politics largely shaped \n     reform of the Senate's rules.\n       We hope this historical perspective on the origins of the \n     filibuster and Rule XXII will be helpful to you as matters of \n     reform are raised and debated. Please do not hesitate to \n     contact us if we can provide additional clarification.\n       Very truly yours,\n       Sarah Binder, Senior Fellow, Governance Studies, The \n     Brookings Institution; Professor of Political Science, George \n     Washington University.\n       Gregory Koger, Associate Professor of Political Science, \n     University of Miami.\n       Thomas E.

Wawro, Deputy Chair & Associate Professor of \n     Political Science, Columbia University.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Time and time again last year, during the \nRules Committee hearings on rules reform, my Republican colleagues said \nthat any attempt to change the filibuster would make the Senate no \ndifferent than the House. They said reforming the filibuster would be \ncontrary to our Founders' intent to make the Senate a more deliberative \nbody.\n  This argument makes little sense to me. The filibuster was never part \nof the original Senate--the Founders made this body distinct from the \nHouse in many ways, but the filibuster is not one of them.\n  A letter from seven prominent political science scholars, six of whom \ntestified in last year's Rules Committee hearings, states the \nfollowing:\n\n       [T]here is no explicit constitutional right to filibuster. \n     In fact, there is ample evidence that the framers preferred \n     majority rather than supermajority voting rules. The framers \n     knew full well the difficulties posed by supermajority rules, \n     given their experiences in the Confederation Congress under \n     the Articles of Confederation (which required a supermajority \n     vote to pass measures on the most important matters). A \n     common result was stalemate; legislators frequently found \n     themselves unable to muster support from a supermajority of \n     the states for essential matters of governing.\n\n  But we do not have to rely on today's scholars to tell us that the \nSenate's uniqueness is not premised on the filibuster and unlimited \ndebate. Our Founders explained their vision for our Republic in the \nFederalist Papers, and Federalist No. 62 explained quite clearly the \nways the Senate is unique from the House of Representatives.\n  In Federalist 62, Alexander Hamilton and James Madison wrote the \nfollowing:\n\n       The qualifications proposed for senators, as distinguished \n     from those of representatives, consist in a more advanced age \n     and a longer period of citizenship. A senator must be thirty \n     years of age at least; as a representative must be twenty-\n     five. And the former must have been a citizen nine years; as \n     seven years are required for the latter.\n\n  They go on to explain about how Representatives will be directly \nelected by the people, but Senators will be appointed by the State \nlegislatures. This of course was changed in 1913 by the 17th amendment, \nwhich established direct election of Senators by popular vote.\n  This, I would argue, is a far more drastic change to the Senate than \nanything we could do with rules reform, yet even that change did not \nturn the Senate into the House.\n  But perhaps the most important distinction between the bodies is whom \nwe represent.\n  Federalist 62 explains that the equality of representation in the \nSenate was the:\n\n     result of compromise between the opposite pretensions of the \n     large and the small States. . . . [T]hat among a people \n     thoroughly incorporated into one nation, every district ought \n     to have a proportional share in the government, and that \n     among independent and sovereign States, bound together by a \n     simple league, the parties, however unequal in size, ought to \n     have an equal share in the common councils . . . [and] the \n     government ought to be founded on a mixture of the principles \n     of proportional and equal representation.\n\n  It is this fact that makes the Senate very different than the House. \nAs a Senator from New Mexico, I represent just over 2 million people. \nSenators Feinstein and Boxer represent over 37 million constituents in \nCalifornia. And Senators Barrasso and Enzi, representing Wyoming with a \npopulation of just over half a million, actually have fewer \nconstituents than members of the House.\n  Yet we all have the same vote in the Senate. This is what makes this \nbody unique. Our founders did not intend to protect a minority party \nfrom being steamrolled by a majority party, but instead to protect \nsmall States from being run over by the large States.\n  Federalist 62 goes on to discuss how the number of Senators, and the \nduration of their term, is another key distinction between the bodies. \nUnlike the House, who are always facing reelection less than 2 years \naway, two-thirds of the Senate is always free from the same worry.\n  Coupled with the fact that senators were appointed by the State \nlegislatures, the Founders believed that the\n\n[[Page S318]]\n\nSenate would be a check on the House against legislation that was \npassed too quickly and without sufficient consideration. But they \nintended the structure of the Senate to make us a more deliberative \nbody, not the rules that govern us.\n  So whatever changes we might make to our standing rules, whether \nminor or significant, the Senate will always be distinct from the House \nof Representatives. The cloture rule was only implemented in 1917--any \nchanges we make to it today cannot destroy the uniquely deliberative \nnature of this body.\n  So to speak more generally now, today we come to the floor as a body \nto debate changes to the rules that guide this institution. All of the \nproposals we consider today have merit, in my opinion, and all deserve \nan up-or-down vote by this prestigious body.\n  Each proposal is important, but as we consider them one-by-one, we \nmust remind ourselves what brought us to this point in the first place.\n  The reason we are here is simple: This Senate is broken. Because of \npartisan rancor and our own incapacitating rules, this body is failing \nto represent the best interests of the American people.\n  The unprecedented abuse of the filibuster, of secret holds, and of \nother procedural tactics routinely prevents the Senate from getting its \nwork done. It prevents us from doing the job the American people sent \nus here to do.\n  In the Congress that just ended, because of rampant and growing \nobstruction, not a single appropriations bill was passed. There wasn't \na budget bill. Only one authorization bill was approved--and that was \nonly at the very last minute. More than 400 bills on a variety of \nimportant issues were sent over from the House. Not a single one was \nacted upon. Key judicial nominations and executive appointments \ncontinue to languish.\n  The American people are fed up with it. They are fed up with us. And \nI don't blame them. We need to bring the workings of the Senate out of \nthe shadows and restore its accountability.\n  That begins with addressing our own dysfunction. Specifically, the \nsource of that dysfunction--the Senate rules.\n  That is what I--along with my colleagues and friends Senator Merkley \nof Oregon and Senator Harkin of Iowa--have been trying to do these past \nweeks. We have been trying to restore the uniquely deliberative nature \nof this body--while also allowing it to function more efficiently.\n  On Tuesday, Senator Harkin, Senator Merkley and I each were denied \nunanimous consent to bring up our resolutions for immediate debate in \naccordance with article 1, section 5 of the Constitution.\n  Denying us the ability to debate the important constitutional issue \nof how this body adopts its rules was unprecedented.\n  Ten times previous to this--from 1917 to as recently as 1975--the \nSenate debated reforms to the use of the filibuster, as well as the \nunderlying constitutional issue of adopting reforms by a simple \nmajority at the beginning of a Congress.\n  The results of these debates varied. But the point I make today is \nthis: each and every time a rules change was proposed, this Senate \nnever denied those Senators the right to debate their proposals through \nthe constitutional option.\n  During many of these debates, the reform proposal was defeated, often \nby tabling it--but they had the debate.\n  1975 was the last time we had a major reform to our filibuster rules.\n  On three occasions that year, the Senate voted by a simple majority \nto table points of order against Senator Mondale and Senator Pearson's \nreform proposal--a proposal that would have amended the cloture \nthreshold from ``two-thirds to three-fifths present and voting.''\n  It was these votes by a simple majority of the Senate that forced the \ncompromise reform that changed the Senate's cloture threshold to the \npresent rule ``three-fifths duly chosen and sworn.''\n  We are here today debating the substance of several different \nproposals, all of which share a goal of restoring debate, deliberation, \nand transparency to this great body. And this afternoon, we will have \nvotes on these proposals.\n  But, we will have those votes under thresholds that I strongly \nbelieve the Constitution does not require. To deny us the right to have \nthat debate about the constitutional question was unprecedented and, I \nbelieve, a mistake.\n  But, however misguided I believe that decision to be, that decision \nhas been made, and it is one we have to live with.\n  Now we must seize the opportunity that remains, and that opportunity \nis the chance for the most substantive debate of the Senate rules in 35 \nyears.\n  I believe this debate is fundamentally important to the health of \nthis institution. Reform is badly needed. We have a responsibility to \nthe American people to come together and fix the Senate.\n  Whether that is through the constitutional option--as I believe we \nhave the right and the responsibility--or through other means, I \nwelcome the debate.\n  As I said more than a year ago when I first proposed the \nconstitutional option: It is time for reform. There are many great \ntraditions in this body that should be kept and respected, but \nstubbornly clinging to ineffective and unproductive procedures should \nnot be one of them.\n  Mr. President, I want to close by saying this.\n  Since the beginning of this process, my actions have been guided by \nthe great respect I have for the institution of the U.S. Senate, my \nreverence for the many great men and women who have served here, and my \nsincere affection for my colleagues.\n  That remains true today. I want to thank my colleagues for their \nconsideration of our proposals, for their willingness to listen, and \nfor their friendship.\n  And I want to make clear to all those who have supported this \neffort--our work is not complete: our cause endures. History has made \nclear that substantial rules reform is--more often than not--the work \nof many Congresses, not just one.\n  The debate that began in this Congress will serve as a foundation for \nreform moving forward. And I commit to doing all I can to ensure that \nthe Senate is not a graveyard for good ideas--but instead remains a \nshining light of Democracy around the world.\n  So now we come to the concluding point in the debate where I think it \nis very appropriate to thank staff. My two staff members who have \nworked the hardest--all my staff have worked very hard on this, but \nMatt Nelson and Tim Woodbury deserve individual recognition for their \ntireless work. I know that as a result of this, we put a lot of \npressure on the Rules Committee. Jean Boudwich and her whole crew over \nthere have done a great job and the Parliamentarian shop headed by Alan \nFrumin. We have also had great assistance from them in terms of \nanswering questions and working with them, so I applaud Alan and all of \nthe Parliamentarians.\n  At several places in the Record, a variety of different items were \nmentioned. To clarify the Record, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted, No. 1, a New York Times editorial from January 25; No. 2 \nincludes quotes from constitutional scholars and conservative scholars \non the constitutional option; and No. 3 is an op-ed from the Washington \nPost entitled ``Fixing a Broken Set of Rules.''\n  I also commend to my colleagues a Harvard Law and Policy Review \narticle entitled ``The Constitutional Option: Reforming the Rules of \nthe Senate to Restore Accountability and Reduce Gridlock.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 25, 2011]\n\n                         Make Them Work for It\n\n       Senate Democrats now have a rare opportunity to reduce the \n     abuse of the filibuster and increase the chances that the \n     people's work actually gets done. Instead, they are close to \n     an agreement on a watered-down package of changes that will \n     have only a modest effect on the chamber's gridlock.\n       Over the last four years, Republicans have more than \n     doubled the number of filibusters from the previous period, \n     requiring 60-vote supermajorities for virtually every measure \n     to move forward. In most, a single senator has raised an \n     objection, bringing progress to a halt.\n       A group of Democratic senators--led by Tom Udall of New \n     Mexico and Jeff Merkley of Oregon--came up with a reasonable \n     proposal to reduce this practice while preserving the \n     minority's right to wage a fight. It would require 10 \n     senators to start a filibuster and then speak continuously on \n     the\n\n[[Page S319]]\n\n     floor to keep it going. If an issue is important enough to \n     block, then senators should be willing to work for it and \n     explain themselves to the public.\n       Democrats could have passed this rule change with a simple-\n     majority vote. But Senate aides say several Democrats are \n     afraid the new rules will put them at a disadvantage should \n     their party fall to a minority. That misses a much more \n     important point. The rules need to be changed not to cripple \n     one party or the other but to improve the efficiency of the \n     Senate no matter who is in power. There is no excuse for even \n     routine budgets and spending bills to languish for lack of 60 \n     votes.\n       The agreement being negotiated by the leadership of both \n     parties would at least make it harder to block presidential \n     nominations with anonymous holds and would reduce the number \n     of positions needing Senate confirmation--welcome changes.\n       The two parties are also expected to reach a ``handshake \n     agreement'' to cut back on filibusters and allow the minority \n     party a greater chance to offer amendments to bills. But such \n     agreements can easily fall apart in the chamber's charged \n     environment.\n       Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, said Tuesday that \n     the matter would be settled shortly. That means there is \n     still a chance for the Senate to adopt real rules, allowing \n     majority votes to prevail in most circumstances and reserving \n     delaying tactics for unusual cases. Without this reform, the \n     Senate will remain dysfunctional.\n\n            Conservatives Support the Constitutional Option\n\n       In 1957, when the Constitutional Option was attempted on \n     the first day of Congress, Vice President Nixon issued the \n     following opinion while presiding in the Senate:\n       [W]hile the rules of the Senate have been continued from \n     one Congress to another, the right of a current majority of \n     the Senate at the beginning of a new Congress to adopt its \n     own rules, stemming as it does from the Constitution itself, \n     cannot be restricted or limited by rules adopted by a \n     majority of a previous Congress. Any provision of Senate \n     rules adopted in a previous Congress which has the expressed \n     or practical effect of denying the majority of the Senate in \n     a new Congress the right to adopt the rules under which it \n     desires to proceed is, in the opinion of the Chair, \n     unconstitutional.\n       In 2005, Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) wrote:\n       ``The compelling conclusion is that, before the Senate \n     readopts Rule XXII by acquiescence, a simple majority can \n     invoke cloture and adopt a rules change. This is the basis \n     for Vice President Nixon's advisory opinion in 1957; as he \n     outlined, the Senate's right to determine its procedural \n     rules derives from the Constitution itself and, therefore, \n     `cannot be restricted or limited by rules adopted by a \n     majority of the Senate in a previous Congress.' . . . So it \n     is clear that the Senate, at the beginning of a new Congress, \n     can invoke cloture and amend its rules by simple majority.''\n       In 2003, Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) wrote:\n       ``Just as one Congress cannot enact a law that a subsequent \n     Congress could not amend by majority vote, one Senate cannot \n     enact a rule that a subsequent Senate could not amend by \n     majority vote. Such power, after all, would violate the \n     general common law principle that one parliament cannot bind \n     another.''\n       Senator Cornyn also held a hearing in 2003 when he was \n     Chairman of the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil \n     Rights and Property Rights of the Judiciary Committee (S. \n     HRG. 108-227). Some of the nation's leading conservative \n     constitutional scholars testified or submitted testimony at \n     that hearing, and all of it supports the principle that a \n     previous Senate cannot enact a rule that prevents a majority \n     in a future Senate from acting. Below is a sample of those \n     quotes:\n       Steven Calabresi, a professor of law at Northwestern \n     University School of Law, former law clerk for Justice \n     Antonin Scalia, and co-founder of the Federalist Society \n     testified that:\n       ``The Senate can always change its rules by majority vote. \n     To the extent that Senate Rule XXII purports to require a \n     two-thirds majority for rules changes, Rule XXII is \n     unconstitutional. It is an ancient principle of Anglo-\n     American constitutional law that one legislature cannot bind \n     a succeeding legislature. This principle goes back to the \n     great William Blackstone, who said in his commentary, `Acts \n     of Parliament derogatory from the power of subsequent \n     Parliaments bind not.' ''\n       Douglas Kmiec, then Dean of the Columbus School of Law at \n     Catholic University, testified about the unconstitutional \n     entrenchment of supermajority rules and stated:\n       ``We currently have in play a process where carryover \n     rules, rules that have not been adopted by the present \n     Senate, are requiring a supermajority to, in effect, approve \n     and confirm a judicial nominee. As you know, to close debate, \n     it requires 60 votes; in order to amend the rules, it \n     requires 67. These are carryover provisions that have not \n     been adopted by this body and by virtue of that, they pose \n     the most serious of constitutional questions because, as I \n     quote, Senator, the Supreme Court has long held the \n     following: `Every legislature possess the same jurisdiction \n     and power as its predecessors. The latter must have the same \n     power of repeal and modification which the former had of \n     enactment, neither more nor less.' ''\n       Dr. John Eastman, a professor of Constitutional Law at \n     Chapman University School of Law, said at the hearing that \n     ``the use of supermajority requirements to bar the change in \n     the rules inherited from a prior session of Congress would \n     itself be unconstitutional.''\n       Testimony submitted to the Committee for this hearing also \n     supports this principle. Professor John C. McGinnis of \n     Northwestern University and Professor Michael Rappaport of \n     the University of San Diego School of Law stated in their \n     written testimony that:\n       ``[The Constitution does not permit entrenchment of the \n     filibuster rule against change by a majority of the Senate. \n     Although the filibuster rule itself is a time-honored \n     senatorial practice that is constitutional, all entrenchment \n     of the filibuster rule, or of any other legislative rule or \n     law, that would prevent its repeal by more than a majority of \n     a legislative chamber, is unconstitutional. Therefore, an \n     attempt to prevent a majority of the Senate from changing the \n     filibuster rule, through a filibuster of that proposed change \n     in the Senate rules, would be unconstitutional.''\n       Finally, renowned constitutional law scholar Ronald Rotunda \n     stated in written testimony: ``The present Senate rules that \n     create the filibuster also purport not to allow the Senate to \n     change the filibuster by a simple majority. However, these \n     rules should not bind the present Senate any more than a \n     statute that says it cannot be repealed until 60% or 67% of \n     the Senate vote to repeal the Statute. . . . I do not see how \n     an earlier Senate can bind a present Senate on this issue.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Jan. 4, 2011]\n\n      A Senate New Year's Resolution: Fixing a Broken Set of Rules\n\n                             (By Tom Udall)\n\n       Many of us have made new year's resolutions, thinking back \n     on the year that has recently ended and pledging to strive \n     for progress and self-improvement to overcome our \n     shortcomings.\n       Unfortunately, this sort of self-reflection is not a \n     tradition familiar to the U.S. Senate. It is a tradition, \n     however, that I and several of my Senate colleagues hope to \n     institute on Wednesday, when the 112th Congress convenes.\n       On that day, my colleagues and I will introduce common-\n     sense proposals to fix the source of our dysfunction--our \n     broken Senate rules. Reform will make the Senate a better \n     legislative body by instituting the transparency and \n     accountability the American people deserve.\n       Over the past few years, open and honest debate has been \n     replaced too often with secret backroom deals and partisan \n     gridlock. Up-or-down votes on important issues have been \n     unreasonably delayed or blocked entirely at the whim of a \n     single senator. In the past two years alone, more than 400 \n     House-passed bills went unnoticed by the Senate. Stalled \n     judicial and executive nominations left more key government \n     posts vacant longer than during any other period in our \n     country's history. We couldn't even properly fund the \n     government.\n       We need to bring the workings of the Senate out of the \n     shadows and restore accountability within the chamber.\n       Under the Constitution, the Senate and the House each ``may \n     determine the rules of its proceedings.'' On the first day of \n     the new session, the rules can be changed under a simple, \n     rather than two-thirds, majority. It is past time for \n     senators to reflect on our rules, how they incentivize \n     obstructionism; how they inhibit, rather than promote, \n     debate; and how they prevent bipartisan cooperation. We then \n     have an obligation to the American people to implement \n     logical reforms to confront these challenges--reforms along \n     the lines many of my colleagues have submitted over the past \n     year.\n       Ultimately, such changes will not reward one political \n     party over another. Instead, reform will pull back the \n     curtain on those who obstruct the Senate's business for no \n     reason other than to score political points. Rules reform is \n     about restoring good-faith legislating for the betterment of \n     the country. We need to take the backroom deals out of the \n     legislative process and rein in rampant obstruction from \n     individuals; this means no more secret holds and endless \n     delays by threat of filibuster.\n       With reform, we will ensure that all senators have a full \n     and fair opportunity to debate legislation, offer amendments \n     and evaluate nominees. We will respect the Senate's unique \n     history of unfettered debate and ensure that the minority's \n     voice is heard. But we also will prevent the chamber's rules \n     from being manipulated to allow a small minority to silently \n     obstruct the will of the majority.\n       The last Congress produced amazing achievements of which we \n     can be extremely proud--health-care reform, Wall Street \n     reform and repeal of ``don't ask, don't tell'' are just a \n     few. But the Senate also failed in many of its key \n     responsibilities, by, for example, not passing a single \n     appropriations bill, keeping critical government posts empty \n     and leaving hundreds of House bills to die. It also failed by \n     too often keeping the debate behind closed doors while the \n     chamber sat empty.\n       I hope that this is the year we make the Senate accountable \n     to the American people again. It's no wonder constituents are \n     fed up with the way business is done in Washington. The \n     first, fundamental step toward changing that culture lies in \n     exercising our constitutional authority to reexamine the \n     stagnant rules that have allowed dysfunction to\n\n[[Page S320]]\n\n     thrive. I urge my colleagues to recognize the obstruction \n     that has prevented us from doing our jobs and join me in \n     reforming Senate rules for the good of our country.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Finally, once again, I wish to thank our \nleaders. Lamar Alexander and Chuck Schumer, both working on the Rules \nCommittee, have done a remarkable job in terms of negotiating. Leader \nReid and Leader McConnell have made a decision which was announced \nearlier today, and that decision was to change some of the rules, to \nlet us vote on some changes to the rules. And also, I think one of the \nmost significant things--and I know Senator Alexander has mentioned \nthis--is to try to change behavior. More than anything, I think that \ncould be very significant. They talked and decided they would like to \ndo this differently. We would like to get back to the Senate \nfunctioning where we bring things up, we debate them, we allow robust \ndebate, we allow the amendment process to work forward. I know Senator \nAlexander addressed this at one point in his Heritage speech, saying \nthe Senate is a shadow of itself. We want to get back to that Senate \nwith the robust debate and amendment process, and I think both sides \nhave tried to pull that together.\n  So I very much hope this is a new day in the Senate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I wanted to take a moment to commend and \nthank several of my colleagues for their work to end the abuses of the \nSenate rules. Senators Schumer, Harkin, Merkley, Udall of New Mexico, \nUdall of Colorado, and many others dedicated time and effort to this \ncause. Without their effort, the Senate would not be voting on these \nresolutions today. I want to briefly outline my views on the five \nmeasures we will vote on shortly.\n  While I believe there are superior ways to end the use of the secret \nhold, I intend to support the Wyden-McCaskill-Grassley resolution.\n  I oppose the use of the secret hold, which is a notice by an \nanonymous Senator of his or her intention to object to proceeding to a \nmeasure or matter. Under current Senate practice, a Senator can place a \nhold on a measure or matter by notifying the Senate leadership of his \nor her intention to object. Such a notice does not prevent Senate \nleadership from moving to a particular measure or matter. The problem \nis that the threat of a filibuster of the motion to proceed is allowed. \nIt should not be. But if Senators threaten to filibuster, that should \nbe made public so they should have to openly defend their threat.\n  Nowhere in the Standing Rules of the Senate is there any mention of a \nhold. The hold, secret or otherwise, ends when the leader moves to \nproceed. I believe the most effective way to end secret holds would be \nto amend the rules to simply say: ``No Senator may object on behalf of \nanother Senator without disclosing the name of that Senator.'' But the \nWyden proposal is useful nonetheless.\n  The resolution by the Senator of Colorado, Mr. Udall, would establish \na non-debatable motion to waive the reading aloud of an amendment if \nthat amendment has been filed at least 72 hours before the motion and \nis printed in the Record. I support the resolution which is designed to \nend an abuse of the rules where Senators force or threaten to force the \nreading aloud of amendments, not to advance their position, but only to \ndelay and prevent debate.\n  The Harkin resolution would permit a decreasing majority of Senators \nto invoke cloture. I believe the Harkin resolution goes too far in \nweakening the fundamental minority rights. The Harkin resolution would \nallow limited germane amendments during postcloture consideration of a \nmeasure, but in my opinion the germane standard is too technical and \nrestrictive. The Harkin resolution would deny the minority the right to \noffer relevant amendments and therefore I will vote against it.\n  The substitute amendment to S. Res. 10 offered by Senator Tom Udall, \nSenator Harkin, Senator Merkley and others makes important improvements \nto a measure designed to end abuses of the rules that have prevented \nthe Senate from doing its work in recent Congresses. I support most of \nthe provisions in this resolution. I support ending filibusters on \nmotions to proceed; I support limiting postcloture consideration of \nnominations; and, I support the elimination of secret holds in the \nmanner prescribed in this resolution.\n  Those meritorious provisions would go a long way towards ending \ncurrent abuses of the Senate rules. Those improvements to Senate \nprocedure offset my concern with the extended debate provision. I will \naddress this point in more detail when discussing the Senator from \nOregon's provision.\n  In spite of my concerns with the extended debate provision, I believe \nthis resolution would end many of the common abuses of the rules and \ndeserves support.\n  Senator Merkley has put together a thoughtful proposal to address the \nabuses of the rules in recent Congresses where a few Senators with too \nlittle effort have prevented the Senate from doing its work. However, \nit does not protect the minority adequately. Under the provisions of \nhis resolution, a simple majority could offer a bill, fill the \namendment tree, and file cloture on the bill. If there are more than 50 \nbut fewer than 60 votes to invoke cloture--that is, if cloture is not \ninvoked--once the minority is eventually exhausted, the Senate would \nproceed to a simple majority vote on the bill without the minority \nhaving the opportunity to offer amendments. Because the Merkley \nresolution does not protect the right to offer amendments, under the \nrules of the Senate the minority could be precluded from offering \namendments. I am concerned that the Merkley resolution, which is \ndesigned to end abuses of the minority, could thereby become a tool of \nabuse by the majority.\n  Under the current practices and procedures of the Senate, I believe \nthere is too much protection for the minority. However, before the \nrules are changed for ending debate, sufficient protections in the \nrules must be provided to the minority to offer relevant amendments. I \ndo not believe this resolution provides those protections and I, \ntherefore, will vote against it.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I have already congratulated Senator \nUdall, Senator Wyden, Senator Merkley, and Senator Harkin for \nstimulating a good, full discussion about two objectives. No. 1 is, how \ndo we make the Senate the best possible place to deal with serious \nissues that come before our country, because we have plenty of them \nright now, starting with our national debt and the high unemployment \nrates. They have done a good job on that. They have led us today to \nadopt what I believe are two important steps, one having to do with \nsecret holds and another having to do with taking time away, that might \notherwise be better used, by having the clerk read an amendment.\n  This debate has also produced a couple of other things. One is to \ncreate broader support than we have had over a number of years on \ndealing with the persistent problem of the difficulty a President has \nin staffing the government. Senator Reid and Senator McConnell, when \nthey were whips, tried to deal with this issue. We had three bipartisan \nbreakfasts on this, working with the White House, 2 years ago. Senator \nLieberman and Senator Collins, who are the committee chairs, have tried \nto deal with this issue. And we have all failed so far.\n  But Senator Schumer and I will be introducing a bill which we will be \ndiscussing with committee chairmen and ranking members especially, and \nit will have the support of the leaders, Senators McConnell and Reid. \nIt will have the active involvement of Senator Lieberman and Senator \nCollins. What we hope to do is two things. One is to reduce the number \non Senate confirmed positions--Senator Harkin spoke about this a little \nearlier. He has been a ranking member and a chairman. He basically said \nthat we don't need to spend our time here having Senate confirmation of \nhundreds of part-time boards and commission members or the public \nrelations official for some department. We should focus our attention \non issues that affect the American people such as jobs, debt and \nterror.\n  The second thing we should do is to end this practice of making it so \nthat the citizens who are invited by the\n\n[[Page S321]]\n\nPresident of the United States to serve in our government are innocent \nuntil nominated. We drag them through a maze of conflicting forms, many \nof them created by the executive branch and many of them created by the \nSenate. These nominees fill out forms that trap them and trick them and \nembarrass them. It is surprising that anybody will accept the \nopportunity to serve. I remember majority leader Howard Baker was \nnominated by President Bush to go to Japan as Ambassador. Everybody in \nthe Senate knew him very well. He was voted ``Most Admired Senator'' by \nSenators on both sides of the aisle in the 1980s. It cost him $250,000 \nto fill out the forms so that he could be the Ambassador to Japan. I \ncould give many examples of similar difficulties.\n  Washington, DC, has become the only place where you hire a lawyer, an \naccountant, and an ethics officer before you find your house and put \nyour kid in school if you come to work here. We need good people in the \ngovernment. We need to be able to attract them here. We should fix the \ncurrent system. I greatly appreciate the work Senators Schumer, Reid, \nMcConnell, Lieberman, Collins and others have done. I hope our \ncolleagues will join us in bringing this forward in an expedited way.\n  I ask unanimous consent to include at the end of my remarks, remarks \nI made on March 9, 2009, on the Senate floor entitled ``Innocent Until \nNominated.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, only two other things.\n  I wish to congratulate Senator McConnell and Senator Reid for leading \nus in this way. Changing rules is an important step forward. I do not \nin any way want to diminish what I believe we are about to do, but we \nneed a change in behavior more than we need a change in rules. This \ndebate has caused us to talk across party lines about what we want, and \nI think what we want is what Senator Udall said as a whole. We would \nlike most bills to come through committee and then come to the floor. \nWe want to have a chance for most Senators to be able to offer most of \ntheir amendments and then to get votes. That is what we should try to \ndo most of the time. Sometimes the Republicans will want to repeal the \nhealth care law, and the Democrats will use all of their resources to \ndefeat our efforts. Sometimes the Democrats in the House will send over \na bill to repeal the secret ballot in union elections, and Republicans \nwill try to defeat that. We will use all of our resources in those \ninstances. But that won't be most of the time. Most of the time, we \nwill be able to do our jobs better to represent the people who sent us \nhere.\n  I hope those who have provoked this discussion feel a sense of \nsatisfaction about what they have done, even though I know that in \nevery case they didn't get exactly what they want.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that a long response to Senator \nHarkin's excellent comments on his amendment which he has been fighting \nfor for 16 years, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Senator Harkin is very straightforward about his \ndifference of opinion. He believes we ought to bring every debate \neventually to 51 votes. So I would respectfully term his amendment as \nsort of a ``hang me now or hang me later.'' We know that eventually it \nis not 60 votes we are going to require, it is 51, and he says that is \nthe way it ought to be. I disagree. So do many others.\n  I will just cite two distinguished Senators who spoke on the floor of \nthe Senate about 5 years ago when a number of Republicans got it in \ntheir minds that they would like to change the filibuster rule as it \naffects judges. This is what Senator Harry Reid said then:\n\n       The filibuster is far from a procedural gimmick. It is part \n     of the fabric of this institution that we call the Senate. \n     For 200 years we've had the right to extend the debate. It's \n     not a procedural gimmick. Some in this Chamber want to throw \n     out 214 years of Senate history in the quest for absolute \n     power. They want to do away with Mr. Smith as depicted in \n     that great movie being able to come to Washington. They want \n     to do away with the filibuster. They think they are wiser \n     than our Founding Fathers. I doubt that's true.\n\n  The then-Senator from Illinois, Barack Obama, referring then to the \nRepublican majority:\n\n       Then if the majority chooses to end the filibuster, if they \n     choose to change the rules and put an end to Democratic \n     debate, then the fighting and the bitterness and the gridlock \n     will only get worse.\n\n  I would suggest that, as a result of this discussion, we preserve the \nSenate as an institution, a forum for deliberation where minority \nrights are protected.\n  But we have also taken some important steps forward--or are about \nto--with rules changes to make them function better. We have reached a \nconsensus among ourselves--informally, anyway--that is represented by \nthe colloquy that will be placed in the Record by Senator Reid and \nSenator McConnell. They said what we want is an opportunity to \nrepresent the American people the way they sent us here to do it, which \nis to take legislation, bring it through committee, bring it to the \nfloor, and for us to have a chance to amend, debate, and vote. That \nwould be most of the time. Some of the time we will exercise our \nminority and majority rights to defeat a bill, because that is also \nwhat we are sent here to do.\n  I thank the Senators for this spirited debate. As far as I know, \nthere are no more speakers on the Republican side.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\nFloor Remarks of U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN), ``Innocent Until \n                              Nominated''\n\n                            (March 9, 2009)\n\n       Mr. President, in the midst of much talk about \n     bipartisanship and not much to show for it, I have a \n     nomination for an issue upon which we can work together, and \n     that is this: review the maze of conflicting forms, FBI \n     investigations, IRS audits, ethics requirements, and \n     financial disclosures to make it possible for President Obama \n     and future Presidents to put together promptly a team to help \n     them solve big problems.\n       This is an urgent problem today because during the worst \n     banking crisis since the Great Depression, the man in charge \n     of fixing the crisis, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, \n     apparently is sitting in his office without much help, at \n     least from any Obama Presidential appointees.\n       According to news accounts, among the key vacant positions \n     at the Treasury Department are the Assistant Secretary for \n     Tax Policy; the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy; \n     the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Tax Analysis; the Deputy \n     Assistant Secretary for Tax, Trade, and Tariff Policy; and \n     the Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Tax Affairs. \n     The first choice for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury appears \n     to have withdrawn her name from consideration.\n       Four months after the President's election, according to \n     TheBigMoney.com, the list of vacancies on the Treasury \n     Department Web site shows that ``Main Treasury Building is a \n     lonely place, conjuring up visions of Geithner signing dollar \n     bills one by one . . ., watering the plants, and answering \n     the phones when he's not crafting a bank rescue plan.''\n       Of course, there are the career employees available and at \n     least one holdover Assistant Secretary and various czars in \n     the White House--but even one of the czars has expressed \n     concern about the slow pace of filling Treasury Department \n     jobs at a critical time.\n       Part of the problem may be attributed to the Treasury \n     Secretary's boss, our impressive new President, who is \n     nevertheless subject to the criticism that he is living over \n     the store but not minding it.\n       Presidents have many problems to solve, but no one ever \n     suggested that the wisest course is to try to solve them all \n     at once. There is a tradition that Washington, DC, can only \n     do one thing well at a time. And Presidents are supposed to \n     exclude from the White House the merely important issues so \n     they may deal with the truly Presidential problems, which \n     surely must not include being distracted by debates with \n     radio talk show hosts.\n       President Eisenhower, who knew something about leading \n     complex organizations, said in 1952: ``I will go to Korea.'' \n     The country relaxed and elected him, confident that the \n     general would end the Korean war.\n       We need for President Obama to say in Eisenhower fashion \n     ``I will fix the banks''--and then stay home long enough to \n     do it. Then the country might relax a little and gain some \n     confidence that this might actually happen, which is the \n     first step and perhaps the main step in economic recovery.\n       But the President needs a team at Treasury to help persuade \n     the American people that he can and will get the job done.\n       The President has brought on himself some of the difficulty \n     of putting together a team. In addition to having too many \n     balls in the air at once, in my opinion, his standards for \n     hiring sometimes seem to have the effect of disqualifying \n     people who know something about the problem from being hired \n     to solve the problem.\n\n[[Page S322]]\n\n       But another part of the President's difficulty in filling \n     jobs--one that has afflicted every President since \n     Watergate--is the maze of investigations and forms that \n     prospective senior officials must complete and the risk they \n     run that they will be trapped and humiliated and disqualified \n     by an unintentional and relatively harmless mistake.\n       I voted against the nomination of Secretary Geithner \n     because I thought it was a bad example for the man in charge \n     of collecting the taxes not to have paid them. And I thought \n     his excuse for not paying was not plausible. But that does \n     not mean that we should disqualify every Presidential nominee \n     for minor tax discrepancies that result from the complexity \n     of our Byzantine Tax Code, a Tax Code which has reached 3.7 \n     million words, according to a January report by the National \n     Taxpayer Advocate, and which is badly in need of reform.\n       I suspect very few Americans with complex tax returns can \n     go through a multiple-year audit without finding something \n     with which the IRS might disagree.\n       Take the case of former Dallas mayor Ron Kirk, President \n     Obama's nominee to be U.S. Trade Representative, who \n     headlines report paid back taxes primarily because he failed \n     to list as income--and then take a charitable deduction on--\n     speaking fees that he gave away to charity. Common sense \n     suggests, and his tax preparer thought, what Mr. Kirk did was \n     appropriate. After all, he did not keep the money. The IRS \n     apparently has a more convoluted rule for dealing with such \n     things. In any event, the matter is so trivial as to be \n     irrelevant to his suitability to be the trade nominee.\n       Tax audits are only the beginning. There is the FBI full \n     field investigation during which friends of the nominee are \n     asked such questions as: Does he live be and his means?\n       When I was nominated for Education Secretary a few years \n     ago, one of my friends replied to the FBI agent: Don't we \n     all?\n       There are Federal financial disclosures. Then there is the \n     White House questionnaire, and, of course, the questions from \n     the confirming Senate committee. The definition of what \n     constitutes ``income'' on some forms is different than the \n     definition of ``income'' on others. It is easy to make a \n     mistake.\n       This is not as bad as it could be. We have a Democratic \n     President and a Democratic Congress with big majorities in \n     both Chambers. So the nominees have gone through fairly \n     quickly. But when the Congress is of a different party than \n     the President, the congressional questionnaires expand and \n     sometimes delay the nomination for more weeks.\n       Washington, DC, has become the only place where you hire a \n     lawyer, an accountant, and an ethics officer before you find \n     a house and put your kid in school.\n       The motto around here has become: ``Innocent until \n     nominated.''\n       Every legal counsel to every President since Nixon would, I \n     suspect, agree that in the name of effective government, this \n     process needs to be changed. Most have tried to change it, \n     but in Washington style, new regulations pile up on top of \n     old ones, creating a more bewildering maze. So I have this \n     suggestion--and one of the Senators to whom I want to make \n     the suggestion is here today, the Senator from Connecticut. I \n     suggest Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins, who are the \n     chairman and ranking member of the committee with \n     jurisdiction over this mess and who have a tradition of \n     working well together, should set as a goal to clean it up by \n     the end of the year. Invite all the former White House \n     counsels of both parties to give their opinions. Consolidate \n     and simplify the forms so we learn only what we need to know.\n       To help with this, I suggest that Senators Lieberman and \n     Collins form one of those ``gangs'' that we occasionally form \n     in the Senate, maybe a dozen or more Senators equally divided \n     among both parties--some from the Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs Committee and some not--in order to \n     limit the possibility that everyone will run away from the \n     final recommendations because they fear someone might think \n     Senators are not interested in ethical and good government.\n       Good government right now means fixing the banks and having \n     the best possible team to do it.\n       As a Washington Post editorial writer said yesterday of the \n     President:\n       As he convened his ``health care summit'' at the White \n     House . . . the stock market was hitting another 12-year low, \n     General Motors was again teetering on the brink of insolvency \n     and the country was still waiting to hear the details of the \n     Treasury's proposal to bail out banks. Maybe we can make this \n     grand bargain with our new President: If you will keep your \n     eye on the ball--in this case, fixing the banks so the \n     economy will get moving again--we will work in a bipartisan \n     way to make it easier for you and for future Presidents to \n     promptly assemble a team and govern us properly.\n       I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\nThe Filibuster: ``Democracy's Finest Show . . . The Right to Talk Your \n                               Head Off''\n\n\n        Address by Senator Lamar Alexander, Heritage Foundation\n\n                           (January 4, 2011)\n\n       Voters who turned out in November are going to be pretty \n     disappointed when they learn the first thing some Democrats \n     want to do is cut off the right of the people they elected to \n     make their voices heard on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n       In the November elections, voters showed that they remember \n     the passage of the health care law on Christmas Eve, 2009: \n     midnight sessions, voting in the midst of a snow storm, back \n     room deals, little time to read, amend or debate the bill, \n     passage by a straight party line vote.\n       It was how it was done as much as what was done that \n     angered the American people. Minority voices were silenced. \n     Those who didn't like it were told, ``You can read it after \n     you pass it.'' The majority's attitude was, ``We won the \n     election. We'll write the bill. We don't need your votes.''\n       And of course the result was a law that a majority of \n     voters consider to be an historic mistake and the beginning \n     of an immediate effort to repeal and replace it.\n       Voters remembered all this in November, but only 6 weeks \n     later Democratic senators seemed to have forgotten it. I say \n     this because on December 18, every returning Democratic \n     senator sent Senator Reid a letter asking him to ``take steps \n     to bring [Republican] abuses of our rules to an end.''\n       When the United States Senate convenes tomorrow, some have \n     threatened to try to change the rules so it would be easier \n     to do with every piece of legislation what they did with the \n     health care bill: ram it through on a partisan vote, with \n     little debate, amendment, or committee consideration, and \n     without listening to minority voices.\n       The brazenness of this proposed action is that Democrats \n     are proposing to use the very tactics that in the past almost \n     every Democratic leader has denounced, including President \n     Obama and Vice President Biden, who has said that it is ``a \n     naked power grab'' and destructive of the Senate as a \n     protector of minority rights.\n       The Democratic proposal would allow the Senate to change \n     its rules with only 51 votes, ending the historical practice \n     of allowing any senator at any time to offer any amendment \n     until sixty senators decide it is time to end debate.\n       As Investor's Business Daily wrote, ``The Senate Majority \n     Leader has a plan to deal with Republican electoral success. \n     When you lose the game, you simply change the rules. When you \n     only have 53 votes, you lower the bar to 51.'' This is called \n     election nullification.\n       Now there is no doubt the Senate has been reduced to a \n     shadow of itself as the world's greatest deliberative body, a \n     place which, as Sen. Arlen Specter said in his farewell \n     address, has been distinctive because of ``the ability of any \n     Senator to offer virtually any amendment at any time.''\n       But the demise of the Senate is not because Republicans \n     seek to filibuster. The real obstructionists have been the \n     Democratic majority which, for an unprecedented number of \n     times, used their majority advantage to limit debate, not to \n     allow amendments and to bypass the normal committee \n     consideration of legislation.\n       To be specific, according to the Congressional Research \n     Service:\n       1. the majority leader has used his power to cut off all \n     amendments and debate 44 times--more than the last six \n     majority leaders combined;\n       2. the majority leader has moved to shut down debate the \n     same day measures are considered (same-day cloture) nearly \n     three times more, on average, than the last six majority \n     leaders;\n       3. the majority leader has set the record for bypassing the \n     committee process--bringing a measure directly to the floor \n     43 times during the 110th and 111th Congresses.\n       Let's be clear what we mean when we say the word \n     ``filibuster.'' Let's say the majority leader brings up the \n     health care bill. I go down to the floor to offer an \n     amendment and speak on it. The majority leader says ``no'' \n     and cuts off my amendment. I object. He calls what I tried to \n     do a filibuster. I call what he did cutting off my right to \n     speak and amend which is what I was elected to do. So the \n     problem is not a record number of filibusters; the problem is \n     a record number of attempts to cut off amendments and debate \n     so that minority voices across America cannot be heard on the \n     floor of the Senate.\n       So the real ``party of no'' is the majority party that has \n     been saying ``no'' to debate, and ``no'' to voting on \n     amendments that minority members believe improve legislation \n     and express the voices of the people they represent. In fact, \n     the reason the majority leader can claim there have been so \n     many filibusters is because he actually is counting as \n     filibusters the number of times he filed cloture--or moved to \n     cut off debate.\n       Instead of this power grab, as the new Congress begins, the \n     goal should be to restore the Senate to its historic role \n     where the voices of the people can be heard, rather than \n     silenced, where their ideas can be offered as amendments, \n     rather than suppressed, and where those amendments can be \n     debated and voted upon rather than cut off.\n       To accomplish this, the Senate needs to change its \n     behavior, not to change its rules. The majority and minority \n     leaders have been in discussion on steps that might help \n     accomplish this. I would like to discuss this afternoon why \n     it is essential to our country that cooler heads prevail \n     tomorrow when the Senate convenes.\n       One good example Democrats might follow is the one \n     established by Republicans who gained control of both the \n     Senate and House of Representatives in 1995. On the first day \n     of the new Republican majority, Sen. Harkin proposed a rule \n     change diluting the filibuster. Every single Republican \n     senator voted against the change even though supporting it \n     clearly would have provided at\n\n[[Page S323]]\n\n     least a temporary advantage to the Republican agenda.\n       Here is why Republicans who were in the majority then, and \n     Democrats who are in the majority today, should reject a \n     similar rules change:\n       First, the proposal diminishes the rights of the minority. \n     In his classic Democracy in America, Alexis de Tocqueville \n     wrote that one of his two greatest fears for our young \n     democracy was the ``tyranny of the majority,'' the \n     possibility that a runaway majority might trample minority \n     voices.\n       Second, diluting the right to debate and vote on amendments \n     deprives the nation of a valuable forum for achieving \n     consensus on difficult issues. The founders knew what they \n     were doing when they created two very different houses in \n     Congress. Senators have six-year terms, one-third elected \n     every two years. The Senate operates largely by unanimous \n     consent. There is the opportunity, unparalleled in any other \n     legislative body in the world, to debate and amend until a \n     consensus finally is reached. This procedure takes longer, \n     but it usually produces a better result--and a result the \n     country is more likely to accept. For example, after the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1964 was enacted, by a bipartisan \n     majority over a filibuster led by Sen. Russell of Georgia, \n     Sen. Russell went home to Georgia and said that, though he \n     had fought the legislation with everything he had, ``As long \n     as it is there, it must be obeyed.'' Compare that to the \n     instant repeal effort that was the result of jamming the \n     health care law through in a partisan vote.\n       Third, such a brazen power grab by Democrats this year will \n     surely guarantee a similar action by Republicans in two years \n     if Republicans gain control of the Senate as many believe is \n     likely to happen. We have seen this happen with Senate \n     consideration of judges. Democrats began the practice of \n     filibustering President Bush's judges even though they were \n     well-qualified; now Democrats are unhappy because many \n     Republicans regard that as a precedent and have threatened to \n     do the same to President Obama's nominees. Those who want to \n     create a freight train running through the Senate today, as \n     it does in the House, might think about whether they will \n     want that freight train in two years if it is the Tea Party \n     Express.\n       Finally, it is hard to see what partisan advantage \n     Democrats gain from destroying the Senate as a forum for \n     consensus and protection of minority rights since any \n     legislation they jam through without bipartisan support will \n     undoubtedly die in the Republican-controlled House during the \n     next two years.\n\n                                 * * *\n\n       The reform the Senate needs is a change in its behavior, \n     not a change in its rules. I have talked with many senators, \n     on both sides of the aisle, and I believe most of us want the \n     same thing: a Senate where most bills are considered by \n     committee, come to the floor as a result of bipartisan \n     cooperation, are debated and amended and then voted upon.\n       It was not so long ago that this was the standard operating \n     procedure. I have seen the Senate off and on for more than \n     forty years, from the days in 1967 when I came to the Senate \n     as Sen. Howard Baker's legislative assistant. That was when \n     each senator had only one legislative assistant. I came back \n     to help Sen. Baker set up his leadership office in 1977 and \n     watched the way that Sen. Baker and Sen. Byrd led the Senate \n     from 1977 to 1985, when Democrats were in the majority for \n     the first four years and Republicans were the second four \n     years.\n       Then, most pieces of legislation that came to the floor had \n     started in committee. Then that legislation was open for \n     amendment. There might be 300 amendments filed and, after a \n     while, the majority would ask for unanimous consent to cut \n     off amendments. Then voting would begin. And voting would \n     continue.\n       The leaders would work to persuade senators to limit their \n     amendments but that didn't always work. So the leaders kept \n     the Senate in session during the evening, during Fridays, and \n     even into the weekend. Senators got their amendments \n     considered and the legislation was fully vetted, debated and \n     finally passed or voted down.\n       Sen. Byrd knew the rules. I recall that when Republicans \n     won the majority in 1981, Sen. Baker went to see Sen. Byrd \n     and said, ``Bob I know you know the rules better than I ever \n     will. I'll make a deal with you. You don't surprise me and I \n     won't surprise you.''\n       Sen. Byrd said, ``Let me think about it.''\n       And the next day Sen. Byrd said yes and the two leaders \n     managed the Senate effectively together for eight years.\n       What would it take to restore today's Senate to the Senate \n     of the Baker-Byrd era?\n       Well, we have the answer from the master of the Senate \n     rules himself, Sen. Byrd, who in his last appearance before \n     the Rules Committee on May 19, 2010 said: ``Forceful \n     confrontation to a threat to filibuster is undoubtedly the \n     antidote to the malady [abuse of the filibuster]. Most \n     recently, Senate Majority Leader Reid announced that the \n     Senate would stay in session around-the-clock and take all \n     procedural steps necessary to bring financial reform \n     legislation before the Senate. As preparations were made and \n     cots rolled out, a deal was struck within hours and the \n     threat of filibuster was withdrawn . . . I also know that \n     current Senate Rules provide the means to break a \n     filibuster.''\n       Sen. Byrd also went on to argue strenuously in that last \n     speech that ``our Founding Fathers intended the Senate to be \n     a continuing body that allows for open and unlimited debate \n     and the protection of minority rights. ``Senators,'' he said, \n     ``have understood this since the ``Senate first convened.''\n       Sen. Byrd then went on: ``In his notes of the \n     Constitutional Convention on June 26, 1787, James Madison \n     recorded that the ends to be served by the Senate were \n     `first, to protect the people against their rulers, secondly, \n     to protect the people against the transient impressions into \n     which they themselves might be led . . . They themselves, as \n     well as a numerous body of Representatives, were liable to \n     err also, from fickleness and passion. A necessary fence \n     against this danger would be to select a portion of \n     enlightened citizens, whose limited number, and firmness \n     might seasonably interpose against impetuous councils.' That \n     fence,'' Sen. Byrd said in that last appearance, ``was the \n     United States Senate. The right to filibuster anchors this \n     necessary fence. But it is not a right intended to be \n     abused.''\n       ``There are many suggestions as to what we should do. I \n     know what we must not do. We must never, ever, ever, ever \n     tear down the only wall--the necessary fence--this nation has \n     against the excess of the Executive Branch and the resultant \n     haste and tyranny of the majority.''\n       What would it take to restore the years of Sens. Baker and \n     Byrd, when most bills that came to the floor were first \n     considered in committee, when more amendments were \n     considered, debated and voted upon?\n       1. Recognize that there has to be bipartisan cooperation \n     and consensus on important issues. The day of ``we won the \n     election, we jam the bill through'' will have to be over. \n     Sen. Baker would not bring a bill to the floor when \n     Republicans were in the majority unless it had the support of \n     the ranking Democratic committee member.\n       2. Recognize that senators are going to have to vote. This \n     may sound ridiculous to say to an outsider, but every Senate \n     insider knows that a major reason why the majority cuts off \n     amendments and debate is because Democratic members don't \n     want to vote on controversial issues. That's like \n     volunteering to be on the Grand Ole Opry but then claiming \n     you don't want to sing. We should say, if you don't want to \n     vote, then don't run for the Senate.\n       3. Finally, according to Sen. Byrd, it will be the end of \n     the three-day work week. The Senate convenes on most Mondays \n     for a so-called bed-check vote at 5:30. The Senate during \n     2010 did not vote on one single Friday. It is not possible \n     either for the minority to have the opportunity to offer, \n     debate and vote on amendments or for the majority to \n     forcefully confront a filibuster if every senator knows there \n     will never be a vote on Friday.\n       There are some other steps that can be taken to help the \n     Senate function better without impairing minority rights.\n       One bipartisan suggestion has been to end the practice of \n     secret holds. It seems reasonable to expect a senator who \n     intends to hold up a bill or a nomination to allow his \n     colleagues and the world know who he or she is so that the \n     merits of the hold can be evaluated and debated.\n       Second, there is a crying need to make it easier for any \n     President to staff his government with key officials within a \n     reasonable period of time. One reason for the current delay \n     is the President's own fault, taking an inordinately long \n     time to vet his nominees. Another is a shared responsibility: \n     the maze of conflicting forms, FBI investigations, IRS \n     audits, ethics requirements and financial disclosures \n     required both by the Senate and the President of nominees. I \n     spoke on the Senate floor on this, titling my speech \n     ``Innocent until Nominated.'' The third obstacle is the \n     excessive number of executive branch appointments requiring \n     Senate confirmation. There have been bipartisan efforts to \n     reduce these obstacles. With the support the majority and \n     minority leaders, we might achieve some success.\n       Of course, even if all of these efforts succeed there still \n     will be delayed nominations, bills that are killed before \n     they come to the floor and amendments that never see the \n     light of day. But this is nothing new. I can well remember \n     when Sen. Metzenbaum of Ohio put a secret hold on my \n     nomination when President George H.W. Bush appointed me \n     education secretary. He held up my nomination for three \n     months, never really saying why.\n       I asked Sen. Rudman of New Hampshire what I could do about \n     Sen. Metzenbaum, and he said, ``Nothing.'' And then he told \n     me how President Ford had appointed him to the Federal \n     Communications Commission when he, Rudman, was Attorney \n     General of New Hampshire. The Democratic senator from New \n     Hampshire filibustered Rudman's appointment until Rudman \n     finally asked the president to withdraw his name.\n       ``Is that the end of the story?'' I asked Rudman.\n       ``No,'' he said. ``I ran against the [so-and-so] and won, \n     and that's how I got into the Senate.''\n       During his time here Sen. Metzenbaum would sit at a desk at \n     the front of the Senate and hold up almost every bill going \n     through until its sponsor obtained his approval. Sen. Allen \n     of Alabama did the same before Metzenbaum. And Sen. John \n     Williams of Delaware during the 1960's was on the floor \n     regularly objecting to federal spending when I first came \n     here forty years ago.\n\n                                 * * *\n\n       I have done my best to make the argument that the Senate \n     and the country will be\n\n[[Page S324]]\n\n     served best if cooler heads prevail and Democrats don't make \n     their power grab tomorrow to make the Senate like the House, \n     to permit them to do with any legislation what they did with \n     the health care law. I have said that to do so will destroy \n     minority rights, destroy the essential forum for consensus \n     that the Senate now provides for difficult issues, and surely \n     guarantee that Republicans will try to do the same to \n     Democrats in two years. More than that, it is hard to see how \n     Democrats can gain any partisan advantage from this \n     destruction of the Senate and invitation for retribution \n     since any bill they force through the Senate in a purely \n     partisan way during the next two years will surely be stopped \n     by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.\n       But I am not the most persuasive voice against the wisdom \n     of tomorrow's proposed action. Other voices are. And I have \n     collected some of them, mostly Democratic leaders who wisely \n     argued against changing the institution of the Senate in a \n     way that would deprive minority voices in America of their \n     right to be heard:\n       [Video--transcript follows]\n\n                  [From Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]\n\n       Jimmy Stewart: Wild horses aren't going to drag me off this \n     floor until those people have heard everything I've got to \n     say, even if it takes all winter.\n       Reporter: H.V.

Robert Byrd's final appearance in the Senate Rules Committee.]\n\n       SENATOR ROBERT BYRD: We must never, ever, ever, ever, tear \n     down the only wall, the necessary fence, that this nation has \n     against the excesses of the Executive Branch.\n       SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER: The checks and balances which have been \n     at the core of this Republic are about to be evaporated. The \n     checks and balances which say that if you get 51% of the \n     vote, you don't get your way 100% of the time.\n       FORMER SEN. CLINTON: You've got majority rule. Then you've \n     got the Senate over here where people can slow things down \n     where they can debate where they have something called the \n     filibuster. You know it seems like it's a little less than \n     efficient, well that's right, it is. And deliberately \n     designed to be so.\n       SEN. DODD: I'm totally opposed to the idea of changing the \n     filibuster rules. I think that's foolish in my view.\n       SEN. BYRD: That's why we have a Senate, is to amend and \n     debate freely.\n       SEN. ALEXANDER: The whole idea of the Senate is not to have \n     majority rule. It's to force consensus. It's to force there \n     to be a group of Senators on either side who have to respect \n     one another's views so they work together and produce 60 \n     votes on important issues.\n       SEN. DODD: I can understand the temptation to change the \n     rules that make the Senate so unique and simultaneously so \n     terribly frustrating. But whether such temptation is \n     motivated by a noble desire to speed up the legislative \n     process or by pure political expediency, I believe such \n     changes would be unwise.\n       SEN. ROBERTS: The Senate is the only place in government \n     where the rights of a numerical minority are so protected. A \n     minority can be right, and minority views can certainly \n     improve legislation.\n       SEN. ALEXANDER: The American people know that it's not just \n     the voices of the Senator from Kansas or the Senator from \n     Iowa that are suppressed when the Majority Leader cuts off \n     the right to debate, and the right to amend. It's the voices \n     that we hear across this country, who want to be heard on the \n     Senate floor.\n       SEN. GREGG: You just can't have good governance if you \n     don't have discussion and different ideas brought forward.\n       SEN. DODD: Therefore to my fellow Senators, who have never \n     served a day in the minority, I urge you to pause in your \n     enthusiasm to change Senate rules.\n       SEN. REID: The Filibuster is far from a ``Procedural \n     Gimmick.'' It's part of the fabric of this institution that \n     we call the Senate. For 200 years we've had the right to \n     extend the debate. It's not a procedural gimmick. Some in \n     this chamber want to throw out 214 years of Senate history in \n     the quest for absolute power. They want to do away with Mr. \n     Smith, as depicted in that great movie, being able to come to \n     Washington. They want to do away with the filibuster. They \n     think they're wiser than our Founding Fathers, I doubt that's \n     true.\n       FORMER SEN. OBAMA: Then if the Majority chooses to end the \n     filibuster, if they choose to change the rules and put an end \n     to Democratic debate; then the fighting and the bitterness \n     and the gridlock will only get worse.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I am the last speaker after this very \ngood debate, which was preceded by months and months of serious \ndiscussion. I think every one of us is better for going through this \nprocess. We understand the Senate better. We have deeper feelings about \nthis hallowed institution, about what it has done, what it can do, and \nwhat is wrong with it as well. I think every one of us agrees that the \nSenate needed to be fixed, and we also agree that we did a lot last \nyear, despite the fact that it was broken. We had different paths to \nfix it, but fix it we must and fix it we will.\n  I will say this: Obviously, there are going to be some rules changes \nand some statutory changes. But a lot of what will make this work is \nthe agreement--informal but serious--between Senators Reid and \nMcConnell, which Senator Alexander and I were part of. I say to my \ncolleagues, hopefully, we are opening up a bit of a new era, where \nbills are allowed to come to the floor, except under extraordinary \ncircumstances, where amendments are allowed to be added to those bills, \nexcept under extraordinary circumstances, and there is vigorous debate.\n  I ask my colleagues to forbear--it is easy for any Senator to stand \nup and bollix up the whole works. The spirit of the new agreement says \nthink twice, or maybe three times, before you do, because that was the \npath that led us to the dysfunction.\n  I, too, want to salute my colleagues, Senators Harkin, Udall, and \nMerkley for the great job they did. Senator Wyden and Senator McCaskill \nand Senator Grassley will have a dream of theirs enacted into the rules \nmomentarily. This has been a fine debate. I don't think the talking \nfilibuster cuts against anything my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have said. I am going to proudly vote for that provision, and \nmaybe--miracle of miracles--it will get two-thirds. But at least there \nwill be a vote, and maybe we can work toward that in the future.\n  I also do believe that the proposal to not invoke the constitutional \noption for this Congress and next Congress gives us some time to figure \nall this out, without closing the door on it forever, because some on \nour side, I know, were worried about that.\n  Let us go forward in the spirit of comity that we have seen since the \nlameduck session. Let us go forward in a bipartisan way that we have \nworked on these rules changes and move forward in the next few months \nand try to legislate in the way many of us who have been here longer \nthan a few years used to love, enjoy, and relish. If we can bring those \ntimes back, the Senate will be a better place for every one of us, no \nmatter our party or ideology.\n  I thank all of my colleagues, including my colleague from Tennessee \nand the two leaders, who stepped to the plate, and the so-called young \nturks, some of whom have been here much longer than I have been, for \nimportuning us to act.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                    direction of the 112th congress\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, over the past few months, Democrats and \nRepublicans have had many positive discussions about the direction of \nthe 112th Congress. There are many important issues facing our country \nand solutions will require bipartisan cooperation. In particular, there \nhas been a lot of discussion lately about the Senate rules. Many of my \ncolleagues have spoken to me about the way the Senate operated during \nthe last Congress. I think my friend from Kentucky would agree with me \nthat there was great frustration on both sides of the aisle.\n  The Senate was always intended to be, has always been, and should \nalways remain, the saucer that allows the boiling tea to cool to ensure \nrash actions do not get enacted into law; to ensure that laws reflect \nthe cold rationality of reason and not the heat of perhaps misplaced \npassion. But, there has been concern in recent years that the Senate \nrules have been abused--that a very few have turned rules designed to \nensure careful examination into a simple bottleneck for parochial \npurposes. Some have even expressed concern that the Senate is broken.\n  Now, I wouldn't say the Senate is broken, as I am proud to say that \nthe last Congress was historic in its achievements. But the Senate \nRepublican leader, my friend from Kentucky, and I have heard concerns \nfrom many different Senators about Senate rules and processes, and we \nhave discussed the issue with each other at length. Senators Schumer \nand Alexander have been an important part of this discussion. Together, \nwe have made important progress on a number of important areas.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator. Senators in both of our parties \nagree that there has been a significant\n\n[[Page S325]]\n\nbreakdown in the Senate, though I am sure there are different \nperspectives on the causes of the breakdown. We both recall that in the \nnot too distant past, when the minority and majority were reversed, we \nboth had somewhat different perspectives on these issues. But know that \nthe majority leader and I both care about this institution and the \nvital role it plays in our democracy.\n  I am happy about the reforms that we will be adopting today. The \nrules create many rights--for individual Senators, for the minority, \nand for the majority leader. But, with rights come responsibilities and \nSenator Reid and I have discussed how to ensure that we return to a \nbetter balance between those two this Congress, and that the twin \nhallmarks of the Senate--the right to debate and amend legislation--are \nrestored.\n  Mr. REID. Yes, we both would like to see a different Senate this \nyear--with fewer filibusters and procedural delays and more \nopportunities for debate and amendments. In many cases, the problem is \nnot necessarily in the Senate rules, it is in the lack of restraint in \nthe exercise of prerogatives under the rules. Toward that end we will \nnow enter into a colloquy to discuss some of these issues. I have \ndiscussed with Senator McConnell that many Senators in the majority \nhave been very unhappy at the excessive use of the filibuster the last \ntwo Congresses, particularly on motions to proceed but also at other \ntimes when a matter that has bipartisan support is filibustered purely \nfor delay.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. And, in my caucus, I have many Senators who have \ncomplained that the majority leader has abused his ability to ``fill \nthe amendment'' tree, preventing Senators from offering and debating \namendments that they believe are important, especially when a matter \nhas not gone through committee or cloture is filed too quickly.\n  Mr. REID. As we have discussed, in the interests of comity and more \nopen process in the Senate, we have agreed that we should use these \nprocedural options of filling the amendment tree and filibustering the \nmotion to proceed infrequently. And we will do our best to ensure that \nother members of our caucuses respect this colloquy, as well.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I agree that both sides should do their best to \nreinstitute regular order, where bills come to the floor and Senators \nget amendments. Of course, there will be times when there is no \nconsensus and when either side may want to use all its rights to defeat \na bill. But we should endeavor to work together to follow the regular \norder where practicable and use our procedural options with discretion. \nAnd, I will do my best to ensure that other members of my caucus \nrespect this.\n  I want to close by clearly reaffirming my view that if we are going \nto change Senate rules, we must do so within those rules. As rule 5 \nstates, the Senate is a continuing body, and the rules continue unless \nchanged within the parameters of the rules.\n  I strongly reject this notion that a simple majority can muscle their \nway to new rules at the beginning of a new Congress. I believe this is \na flawed approach. Majorities come and go. My Democratic colleagues \nshould be wary of attempting this maneuver because they will not always \nbe in the majority. The Senate is not the House of Representatives, and \nour Founding Fathers never intended it to be. What some of my \ncolleagues in the majority propose would damage the institution and \nturn the Senate into a legislative body like the House where a simple \nmajority can run roughshod over the minority. I would oppose such an \neffort to change the rules with a simple majority in this Congress or \nthe next Congress, regardless of which political party is in the \nmajority. I ask the majority leader to join me in rejecting this \neffort.\n  Mr. REID. The minority leader and I have discussed this issue on \nnumerous occasions. I know that there is a strong interest in rules \nchanges among many in my caucus. In fact, I would support many of these \nchanges through regular order. But I agree that the proper way to \nchange Senate rules is through the procedures established in those \nrules, and I will oppose any effort in this Congress or the next to \nchange the Senate's rules other than through the regular order.\n  And I hope and expect that we will have a more deliberative and \nefficient Senate this Congress. In particular, I hope we can reach an \nagreement to move nominees in regular order. One important reform to \nthe nominations process is reducing the number of Senate confirmed \npositions. Our offices are working with Senators Schumer, Alexander, \nLieberman, and Collins to draft a bill to accomplish this goal. This \nbill will be introduced in short order and we will work to get it \nenacted as quickly as possible.\n  Many of these positions are part-time boards and commissions or \nvarious agency positions that are unrelated to the management of that \nagency. They could be Presidentially appointed rather than going \nthrough the Senate. Although similar efforts have been proposed in the \npast, I think all of my colleagues realize the need to address this \nsituation as soon as all the details are finalized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I agree that the Senate spends too much time dealing \nwith a growing number of nominees. It makes sense to reduce the number \nof positions confirmed and free up committee staff to focus on other \nnominees or legislation. I appreciate the work of these Senators and \nlook forward to passing this legislation as soon as it is complete.\n  Mr. REID. I look forward to putting into practice the sentiments in \nthis colloquy. Finally, I hope Senators of good will in both parties \nwill continue discussions as to how we can make the Senate a better \ninstitution.\n  Our discussion today is in a spirit of bipartisan cooperation to \nexpress hope and anticipation that the 112th Congress will be different \nin many ways than the 111th. We look forward to greater comity on both \nsides of the aisle so that we can move legislation and nominees that \nhave bipartisan support from the majority of Senators in this body. \nThere are areas that we can and should work together to achieve \nprogress for the American people.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I agree with the majority leader that this Congress \nshould be more bipartisan than the last Congress. I do support the idea \nthat the Senate should be able to move forward and complete action on \nmatters with broad bipartisan support. Neither party has all of the \nsolutions to the problems our Nation faces. Many of the successes of \npast Congresses have been the result of bipartisan cooperation and \ninput. I look forward to such cooperation and input in this Congress.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all remaining \ntime be yielded back and that there be 2 minutes of debate, equally \ndivided, prior to each vote; further, that all rollcall votes after the \nfirst one be for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, they have been.\n  Mr. REID. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending measure is S. Res. 28. Under the \nprevious order, a vote of 60 is required for adoption of this \nresolution. There will now be 2 minutes of debate, equally divided.\n  The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, there has been much discussion about the \nproposed rules reforms and how far they go. To those who say that this \nresolution doesn't go far enough, I ask, why have the friends of \nsecrecy fought so hard for so long to allow Senators to anonymously \nblock legislation and nominations?\n  The fact is this resolution deals with a sweeping, almost \nunparalleled legislative power--the ability of one Senator to \nanonymously block a bill or a nomination from going forward. That is \nnot right. Senator Grassley, Senator McCaskill, and I have worked with \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to say that if you want to \nexercise that extraordinary power, you ought to do it in the sunlight. \nThere ought to be public disclosure. There ought to be transparency.\n  I yield the remainder of our time to Senator Grassley, who has \nchampioned this cause along with Senator McCaskill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, the time has come to end secrecy on\n\n[[Page S326]]\n\nthe floor of the Senate. The time has come for Senators who think they \nought to put a hold on a bill to be able to continue to put a hold on a \nbill or a nomination, but it is also time to show that you have guts \nenough to let the people know who you are and, more importantly, to let \nyour colleagues know who you are. So if there is something wrong with a \npiece of legislation or a nomination, we can find out what it is and \nmove the business of the Senate ahead.\n  This is something that is going to make the Senate a much more \nefficient place to work and get the people's business done, and it will \ndo what is most important--the public's business in public.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is an agreeing to the resolution.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. \nFeinstein) and the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Texas (Mrs. Hutchison) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The first blank shall be filled with the name of the \n     Senator, the second blank shall be filled with the name of \n     the covered request, the name of the measure or matter and, \n     if applicable, the calendar number, and the third blank shall \n     be filled with the date that the notice of intent to object \n     is submitted.\n       (4) Notices on the senate floor.--The requirement to submit \n     a notice of intent to object to the Legislative Clerk and the \n     Congressional Record shall not apply in the event a Senator \n     objects on the floor of the Senate and states the following:\n       ``I object to ___, on behalf of Senator ___.''\n       (b) Calendar.--\n       (1) Objection.--Upon receiving the submission under \n     subsection (a)(2)(B), the Legislative Clerk shall add the \n     information from the notice of intent to object to the \n     applicable Calendar section entitled `Notices of Intent to \n     Object to Proceeding' created by Public Law 110-81. Each \n     section shall include the name of each Senator filing a \n     notice under subsection (a)(2)(B), the measure or matter \n     covered by the calendar to which the notice of intent to \n     object relates, and the date the notice of intent to object \n     was filed.\n       (2) Objection on behalf.--In the case of an objection made \n     under subsection (a)(4), not later than 2 session days after \n     the objection is made on the floor, the Legislative Clerk \n     shall add the information from such objection to the \n     applicable Calendar section entitled ``Notices of Intent to \n     Object to Proceeding'' created by Public Law 110-81. Each \n     section shall include the name of the Senator on whose behalf \n     the objection was made, the measure or matter objected to, \n     and the date the objection was made on the floor.\n       (c) Removal.--A Senator may have a notice of intent to \n     object relating to that Senator removed from a calendar to \n     which it was added under subsection (b) by submitting to the \n     Legislative Clerk the following notice:\n       ``I, Senator ___, do not object to ___, dated ___.'' The \n     first blank shall be filled with the name of the Senator, the \n     second blank shall be filled with the name of the covered \n     request, the name of the measure or matter and, if \n     applicable, the calendar number, and the third blank shall be \n     filled with the date of the submission to the to the \n     Legislative Clerk under this subsection.\n       (d) Objecting on Behalf of a Member.--Except with respect \n     to objections made under subsection (a)(4), if a Senator who \n     has notified his or her leader of an intent to object to a \n     covered request fails to submit a notice of intent to object \n     under subsection (a)(2)(B) within 2 session days following an \n     objection to a covered request by the leader or his or her \n     designee on that Senator's behalf, the Legislative Clerk \n     shall list the Senator who made the objection to the covered \n     request in the applicable ``Notice of Intent to Object to \n     Proceeding'' calendar section.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the adoption of S. Res. 29. \nUnder the previous order, 60 votes are required for adoption.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, the resolution before us, \nwhich I introduced, would encourage Senators to file their amendments \n72 hours in advance of a vote to ensure that Members have time to \nreview it, but it would also delay the practice of calling for an \noutloud reading of the amendment in front of us.\n  It addresses a concern I think we all have about the amendment \nprocess. When a full reading of the amendment has been called for, it \nties our Senate into knots. It is a spectacle, with the clerks standing \nhere reading amendments for hours to an empty Chamber. My amendment \nwould prevent needless delays by waiving the live reading of an \namendment when the text has been available long enough for all of us to \nlook it over. It would have to be submitted 72 hours in advance.\n  So I ask for the yeas and nays, and I hope for an overwhelmingly \nbipartisan approval of this important change to the Senate rules.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, this amendment puts into effect what \nthe Republicans called in the health care debate the Bunning rule, \nwhich is, if it is not on the Internet and not available for 72 hours, \nit shouldn't be brought up.\n  We think this is a sensible--I think this is a sensible amendment, \nand I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S327]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the resolution.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. \nFeinstein), and the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Texas (Mrs. Hutchison) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 81, nays 15, as follows:\n\n                       [Rollcall Vote No. 3 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--81\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Blumenthal\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Boxer\n     Brown (MA)\n     Brown (OH)\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coons\n     Corker\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hoeven\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Kerry\n     Kirk\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Manchin\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Portman\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--15\n\n     Coburn\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Hatch\n     Inhofe\n     Lee\n     Paul\n     Risch\n     Rubio\n     Sessions\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Vitter\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Feinstein\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     McCain\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 81, the nays are \n15. The 60-vote threshold having been achieved, the resolution is \nagreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 29) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 29\n\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. READING OF AMENDMENTS.\n\n       (a) Standing Order.--This section shall be a standing order \n     of the Senate.\n       (b) Waiver.--The reading of an amendment may be waived by a \n     non-debatable motion if the amendment--\n       (1) has been submitted at least 72 hours before the motion; \n     and\n       (2) is available in printed or electronic form in the \n     Congressional Record.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the adoption of S. Res. 8. \nUnder the previous order, an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the \nSenators voting is required for adoption. There is 2 minutes evenly \ndivided.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is the same resolution I offered 16 \nyears ago. I continue to offer it. If you believe the minority ought to \nhave the right to slow things down, that is fine. But if you believe \nthe minority should have the right to veto anything that comes on the \nfloor, you don't want to vote for my resolution.\n  What my resolution says is that basically you need 60 votes. Then, if \nyou don't get it, 3 days later you have another vote, it would be 57 \nvotes; 3 days later, 54 votes; after 8 days, 51 votes could move a \nnominee, an amendment, or a bill. So it gives the minority the right to \nslow things down, the right to amend, the right to debate, the right to \nmake their voices heard, but in the end it gives the majority the right \nto move legislation. We are a legislative body. The majority ought to \nhave the right to move legislation. The minority should not have the \nright to veto.\n  Right now in the Senate you have to have 60 votes to pass anything. \nWe used to be able to bring up amendments here and get 51 or 52 votes \nand pass it. That no longer happens.\n  If you believe in democracy, trust the American people, trust the \nballot box. I am not afraid. I am not afraid of the majority enacting \nits will as long as I have the right to debate an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time in opposition? The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this amendment might be called the ``if \nyou are going to hang me later, hang me now'' amendment. This would \neliminate the filibuster by making certain that it only took 51 votes, \neventually, to pass a bill. This filibuster, according to the current \nmajority leader in 2005, ``is a part of the fabric of this institution \nwe call the Senate.'' Former Senator Obama said in the same year, ``If \nthe majority,'' he then referred to the Republicans, ``chooses to end \nthe filibuster, if they choose to change the rules and put an end to \ndemocratic debate, then the fighting and the bitterness and the \ngridlock will only get worse.''\n  We have agreements today that will begin to end fighting and \ngridlock, bring bills to the floor, having more amendments.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on the proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the resolution.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. \nFeinstein), and the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Texas (Mrs. Hutchison) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 12, the nays are \n84. Two-thirds of those voting for adoption not having voted in the \naffirmative, the resolution is rejected.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am necessarily absent for the votes today \non S. Res. 10 and S. Res. 21. If I were able to attend these vote \nsessions, I would oppose S. Res. 10 and would support S. Res. 21.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the adoption of S. Res 10. \nUnder the previous order, an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the \nSenators voting is required for adoption.\n  The substitute amendment is agreed to.\n  There is now 2 minutes of debate, equally divided.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, S. Res. 10 does five simple \nthings: limits debate on the motion to proceed to 2 hours; eliminates \nsecret holds; No. 3, guarantees the majority and minority three \namendments with a 60-vote threshold; No. 4, institutes a talking \nfilibuster; and, No. 5, shortens postcloture debate on nominations, \nboth executive and judicial, from 30 hours to 2 hours.\n  I would ask my colleagues to support the resolution. I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, in his last appearance before the Rules\n\n[[Page S328]]\n\nCommittee, Senator Byrd quoted James Madison's description of this body \nas a necessary fence against rulers and transient impressions and said \nthe right to filibuster anchors this necessary fence and we must never, \never tear down the only wall, the necessary fence, that the Nation has \nagainst these excesses.\n  This amendment does not tear down that fence, but it seriously \nweakens it. I recommend a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the \nprevious order, an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Senators \nvoting is required for adoption of the substitute amendment, as agreed \nto.\n  There is now 2 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Lautenberg for \nintroducing the concept of a talking filibuster 2 years ago, and I \nthank all colleagues who have worked to end the abuse of our current \nfilibuster. The fact is, we have not done any appropriations bills in \n2010. We left 100 nominations without our advise and consent or \nopposition, and we left 400 House bills collecting dust on the Senate \nfloor. The American people believe the filibuster is an act of personal \ncourage. Let's make it so. They believe those who filibuster should \nmake their case before the public. Let's make it so. They believe when \n41 Senators want additional debate, let's make it so. Let's end the \nsecrecy and obstruction of the silent filibuster and establish the \naccountability of the talking filibuster.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, in his last appearance before the Rules \nCommittee, Senator Byrd said:\n\n       Forceful confrontation to a threat to filibuster is \n     undoubtedly the antidote to the malady.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       I also know that current Senate rules provide the means to \n     break a filibuster.\n\n  If Senator Byrd, who knew the rules better than any of us, thought \nthat, we don't need to change the rules.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to S. Res. 21 as \namended.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

On this vote, the yeas are 46 and the nays are \n49. Two-thirds of those voting for adoption not having voted in the \naffirmative, the resolution, as amended, is rejected.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, earlier today I supported S. Res 8 because \nI believe additional action to change existing Senate rules to limit \nfilibusters are needed.\n  I very much appreciate the work of Majority Leader Reid and Minority \nLeader McConnell in developing a colloquy printed in the Record today. \nSpecifically, I support the pledges to limit the use of filibusters on \nmotions to proceed and to fill the amendment tree on legislation only \nwhen necessary.\n  Unfortunately, I do not believe that these pledges alone go far \nenough to address the dysfunction the--epic dysfunction--of the last \nyears.\n  Frankly, the extraordinary measure of a filibuster has become an \nordinary expedient. Today it's possible for 41 Senators representing \nonly about one-tenth of the American population to bring the Senate to \na standstill. The filibuster has its rightful place. I used it to stop \ndrilling for oil in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge because I believed that \nwas in our national interest--and 60 or more Senators should be \nrequired to speak up on such an irrevocable decision. But we have \nreached the point where the filibuster is being invoked by the minority \nnot necessarily because of a difference over policy, but as a political \ntool to undermine the Presidency. Consider this: in the entire 19th \ncentury, including the struggle against slavery, fewer than two dozen \nfilibusters were mounted. Between 1933 and\n\n[[Page S329]]\n\nthe coming of World War II, it was attempted only twice. During the \nEisenhower administration, twice. During John Kennedy's presidency, \nfour times--and then eight during Lyndon Johnson's push for civil \nrights and voting rights bills. By the time Jimmy Carter and Ronald \nReagan occupied the White House, there were about 20 filibusters a \nyear.\n  But in the 110th Congress of 2007-2008, there were a record 112 \ncloture votes. And in the 111th Congress, there were 136, one of which \neven delayed a vote to authorize funding for the Army, Navy, Air Force \nand Marine Corps during a time of war. That is not how the Founders \nintended the Senate to work--and that's not how our country can afford \nthe Senate not to work.\n  Chris Dodd said it best in his farewell address just a few weeks \nago--a speech the Republican leader called one of the most important in \nthe history of the Chamber. Chris sounded a warning: ``What will \ndetermine whether this institution works or not, what has always \ndetermined whether we will fulfill the Framers' highest hopes or \njustify the cynics' worst fears, is not the Senate rules, the calendar, \nor the media. It is whether each of the one hundred Senators can work \ntogether.''\n  That was a speech that needed to be heard. But the question now isn't \nwhether it was heard; it is whether we really listened to it. Because \nwhen it comes to the economy, our country really does need 100 Senators \nwho face the facts and find a way to work not just on their side, but \nside by side.\n  It was with Chris's words in mind that I supported Senator Harkin's \neffort to reform the filibuster rules even though I have concerns about \nhow the provision would affect debate in the Senate by moving to a \nmajority vote. I did so because I believe it is important to protest \nthe actions by the minority over the past four years and make a \nstatement that we must have an end to the unprecedented disruption that \nhas occurred.\n  Ultimately, Leader Reid is right--the question is not the rules, but \nour decisions about how to abuse those rules. I hope the minority will \nend this needless obstructionism as we move forward in the 112th \nCongress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak for the first time in this \nChamber as a Senator. It is an honor to do so. Already, after my \nservice at the end of the 111st Congress, I am keenly aware of the \nimpressive array of skills brought to this place by my colleagues and \nof the great traditions of this Chamber, as well as the tremendous \nchallenges facing both our Nation and this institution as we work \ntogether to make progress.\n  On November 2, the citizens of Delaware elected me to come here on \ntheir behalf and work with 99 other Senators for a very specific goal: \ngetting America moving again and getting our economy back on track. \nWith our country just now recovering from the loss of so many jobs, \nwith a substantial deficit and the painful and lingering wreckage of a \ngreat recession, we must set aside politics and focus on progress.\n  I am honored to have this opportunity to serve. I am especially \nhonored to serve alongside our State's distinguished senior Senator, \nTom Carper, and to serve at a time when the President of the Senate is \nanother distinguished Delawarean, Vice President Joe Biden, whose \nservice in this body for 36 years was marked by a tireless advocacy for \nAmerica's middle class and the people of our State. Membership in the \nSenate is a privilege not to be taken lightly, and I am determined to \nmake the greatest contribution I can to solving the challenges facing \nus all.\n  Similar to my colleagues, my path to the Senate involved many \nexperiences that have shaped my views and priorities. Growing up in \nDelaware, my family taught me the values of faith, hard work, and \nservice to others. As a student, traveling and volunteering in Africa \nand later working with the homeless in this country, I learned \ndifficult truths about poverty and human suffering but also witnessed \nthe awesome power of hope and faith. Later, working for the National \n``I Have a Dream'' Foundation and running an AmeriCorps program, I saw \nthe transformative power of education and of national service to change \nlives.\n  Following these early years of learning and service, I spent 8 years \nas in-house counsel to one of Delaware's most innovative, high-tech \nmanufacturing companies, where I saw the strength of American ingenuity \nand entrepreneurship. Later, as county executive, running a local \ngovernment that served half a million Delawareans, I learned how to \nmake the tough choices that led to reining in spending, to growing our \nlocal economy, balancing a budget, and achieving a surplus. Most \nimportant, today, as a husband and father of three young children, I \nspend more time than ever concerned about their future, wondering \nwhether we will leave them and all our children a nation burdened by \ndebt and struggling to maintain its place in the world or a nation with \na renewed strength and focus on the fundamentals that made this the \ngreatest Nation in human history. As a Member of the Senate, I look \nforward to applying these lessons while working with my new colleagues.\n  I said a few moments ago our constituents sent us here with the goal \nof getting our economy back on track, a goal of focusing relentlessly \non economic recovery. However, mere recovery--recovery alone--cannot be \nour goal. The American people deserve and expect from us policies that \nwill lead to an economy and a job market stronger, more vibrant, and \nmore prosperous than before. To achieve this, I believe we need to \npursue a new manufacturing agenda, one that will lead to the creation \nof inventive businesses and that will open new plants and hire skilled \nworkers for modern and sustainable jobs, one that will produce the next \ngeneration of American manufacturers. It should focus on sustaining and \ngrowing American manufacturing by rewarding innovation and fostering \nentrepreneurship and by pairing those great American strengths to an \nequally great American workforce.\n  As someone long committed to progressive values, I believe the best \nway to help stabilize neighborhoods and support families, to advance \nsocial justice and fight poverty, is through ensuring more and more \nAmericans have access to good, high-quality jobs. I am encouraged \nPresident Obama chose to highlight competitiveness and innovation in \nhis State of the Union Address and its potential to create those \nsustainable middle-class jobs. He is right to call this our \ngeneration's ``Sputnik moment.''\n  We have a choice. We can keep doing the things we have for years, but \nthen we will simply keep getting the same results or we can recommit \nourselves, as we did as a nation during the space race, to outinnovate, \noutcompete, and outproduce every other Nation. That is how we, once \nagain, can spark an era of growth and prosperity. Unlike so many other \nsectors of our economy, with manufacturing, it is not just about \ncreating jobs, it is about creating and sustaining good jobs, jobs that \npay a livable wage, provide quality health insurance, jobs with \nlongevity and security.\n  According to the National Association of Manufacturers, the average \nmanufacturing worker in our country earned 25 percent more than workers \nin all other sectors. That is over $72,000 last year, including pay and \nbenefits, while the average nonmanufacturing worker earned less than \n$59,000. Manufacturing jobs means higher wages and better benefits, and \nthey have for decades been a reliable path for the middle class for \nmillions of hard-working American families. That path is not nearly as \nwide or as clear as it was just 10 years ago. Since then, our Nation \nhas lost more than 3 million manufacturing jobs not only to the \ndeveloping world but to our competitors in the industrialized world as \nwell.\n  For those who have lost jobs, the stakes couldn't be higher, and for \nwe as leaders our mandate couldn't be clearer.\n\n[[Page S330]]\n\n  I strongly disagree with those who believe America's leadership in \nmanufacturing is behind us and that our future lies somehow in being a \ncountry dedicated to services and consumption financed by debt. Those \nnaysayers point to factories that have sprouted up across the \ndeveloping world, that it is cheaper labor and looser environmental and \nworker protections--key reasons why we have, in fact, seen millions of \nour manufacturing jobs move offshore.\n  However, while labor-intensive commodity manufacturing may, in fact, \nhave permanently moved offshore, we can remain a global leader in \ninnovative and high-performance manufacturing, as we still are today in \nindustries ranging from aircraft to pharmaceuticals, if we will just \nfocus our efforts on creating an encouraging environment in tax and \ntrade policy, in education and training that matches the strength of \nAmerican engineering and innovation.\n  Many Americans may not realize it today, but ours still remains the \nNo. 1 manufacturing economy in the world. We still produce one-fifth of \nall manufactured goods worldwide, and this sustains more than 18 \nmillion private sector jobs. Advanced manufacturing businesses know \nthat to achieve the quality and productivity they need, they must find \na top-notch workforce, modern infrastructure, and a fair and \npredictable system of regulation.\n  I learned this myself firsthand when I was working in the private \nsector at a company known as W.L. Gore & Associates. It is better known \nperhaps for discovering and marketing GORE-TEX fabrics, but it is a \nmaterials-based company that manufactures hundreds of products, from \nmedical devices to wire and cable. At one point, I was part of a site \nlocation team that had to decide where to build a new state-of-the-art \nmanufacturing plant, costing more than $100 million. It could have been \nanywhere in the world, but we wanted to locate it right here in \nAmerica. As we considered many cities and States bidding for the plant, \nwe ultimately made a decision.\n  What made the difference? What were we looking for? First, a reliable \nand skilled workforce. Second, State, county, and city governments that \nwere responsive and had already made investments in local \ninfrastructure. While we also considered tax credits and training \ngrants, an educated workforce, responsive local government, and high-\nquality infrastructure were the main factors that attracted our \nbusiness.\n  When we visited the ultimate site, our team was greeted by area \neducators who told us about a strong public education system and city \nleaders who informed us of the public infrastructure we would need, \nsuch as water, electricity, sewer, and ready access to road, rail, and \nair, which were already in place. When we asked local officials how \nlong it would take to get building permits, they said: Just send us \nyour plans. Everything we needed was ready to go.\n  In the end, we were able to stand up a successful and profitable new \nventure in record time and to achieve significant growth in the local \ntax base and the economy, offering hundreds of clean, high-tech \nmanufacturing jobs to a responsive community.\n  That experience on the site selection team taught me two things: the \nadvanced manufacturing sector can really thrive in America, and we in \ngovernment have a critical role to play.\n  It will be the private sector and America's entrepreneurs and \ninnovators that will create jobs. It is our job in government though, \nto ensure our country is the most attractive choice for business \ninvestment.\n  We can do it by reducing bureaucratic hurdles and investing in an \neducated workforce capable of high productivity and ongoing innovation.\n  That's the critical role we can play not only in getting Americans \nback to work but ensuring a bright and prosperous future for America's \nmiddle class.\n  Right now, far too many middle-class families are struggling not \nbecause they made poor choices but in spite of having made the right \nones. People who worked hard in school, who raised good families, who \nserved in the military, who gave back by volunteering in their \ncommunities--Americans who did everything right--in this recession they \nstill lost their jobs.\n  They need to know that we in Congress have their backs.\n  The truth is, we are not going to be able to reopen all the plants \nthat have closed and get those workers back on the assembly lines \nmaking the same products they used to make. This is why we must make \nthis push for advanced manufacturing.\n  Thankfully, we are not starting from scratch. Innovative businesses, \nincluding many from my home State, have long been leaders in creating \nnew manufacturing jobs based on new inventions.\n  This, I believe, is the result of Delaware's highly educated \nworkforce and the State and local government commitment to working with \nbusiness as partners toward growth.\n  One of the most compelling examples of this partnership between \ngovernment and business took place in Delaware over the past 2 years. \nMore than one thousand people lost their jobs when General Motors shut \ndown its plant in Newport, DE, in 2009, a plant that had been in \nproduction more than 60 years and was long touted as one of the most \nproductive in the country.\n  Some of those workers packed up their families and sought work \nelsewhere in the country. Some stayed and found other work. Too many \nare still looking today.\n  But they weren't the only ones looking for jobs. Led by our tireless \nGovernor, Jack Markell, those of us in State and local government in \nDelaware were engaged in a job search as well, and after months of \nsearching and hard work, we were able to bring Fisker Automotive to \nNewport, DE, to take over and reinvest in the shuttered GM plant. We \ndid it by bringing together state and local officials, UAW union \nleaders, and Federal tax credits and investments. This partnership \ncould not have been possible without $500 million in Federal stimulus \nfunds.\n  I was proud to be a small part of the team that brought Fisker to \nDelaware, but I will be even prouder to watch hundreds of Delawareans \nstream through the plant's gates again when it reopens to build plug-in \nelectric automobiles.\n  When I asked the leadership of the new company what made them choose \nDelaware, it was a familiar answer--a skilled and reliable workforce, a \nresponsive State and county governments, strong local infrastructure, \nand access to global markets through our roads, rails, and the Port of \nWilmington.\n  Fisker is just one example. In Delaware, we have recently seen long-\nestablished leaders such as DuPont as well as relative newcomers such \nas Ashland Chemical, Agilent, and Perdue invest in new facilities, new \nresearch or new production.\n  My State has also been at the forefront of high-tech job growth with \ninnovative Delaware companies such as ILC Dover, Solar Dock, and Miller \nMetal, as well as multinational companies such as Sanosil, Motech, and \nFraunhofer USA that have brought jobs there.\n  I am proud that so many new products and technologies that are \ninvented here are also ``Made in America, Manufactured in Delaware.''\n  In Delaware, businesses have seen that we're ``ready to go.''\n  In our State, we have the ability to bring together stakeholders \noften seen as adversaries and deliver productive collaboration. This \ninvolves both labor and businesses making sacrifices and sharing \nresponsibility.\n  We need to replicate this model and these successes all over the \ncountry as much as possible.\n  Indeed, we are already seeing progress nationally, as the latest \nmanufacturing numbers attest. In 2010, our manufacturing sector grew \n136,000 new jobs. Some economists have predicted a further gain of more \nthan double that this year.\n  Despite predictions that American manufacturing was in a permanent \ndecline, we are actually seeing a modest uptick, one on which we must \ncapitalize.\n  The formula for our economic success has long been the unstoppable \ncombination of an innovative citizenry and investment in cutting-edge \nresearch. This is what generates companies that invent new products, \noften high-tech and research-driven products, and, along with these new \nproducts, create skilled jobs right here in the United States.\n\n[[Page S331]]\n\n  Investments in an educated workforce, our public infrastructure, and \ncritical funding for research and development will be the keys to both \nshort-term economic recovery and long-term growth. These investments \nmust coincide with efforts to make it easier for Americans to start and \nexpand small businesses and for multinational companies to locate \nadvanced manufacturing here in America.\n  As we embark on this renewed effort, we must continue, though, to \nsafeguard the important workplace safety, labor, and environmental \nprotections we have put in place over the past decades. Our \nmanufacturing growth must be a function of innovation, not a turning-\nback of the clock.\n  That is why I strongly support policies such as extending the \nresearch and development tax credit, a manufacturing tax credit tied to \nresearch and development done here, in and the extension of the Build \nAmerica Bonds program for public infrastructure improvements.\n  We have unfinished work to do to change the focus of our tax and \ntrade policies. We must stop providing incentives to move productive \nwork offshore. Instead, we should reward those companies that reinvest \nin America--in both inventing a new generation of products and \nmanufacturing them here.\n  We will also need to focus more of our attention on clean-energy \nmanufacturing. Government investment in clean energy technologies has \nbeen a core factor in our competitors' growth. We need to help our \nbusinesses compete with theirs.\n  I was disappointed, frankly, that the Senate was unable to reach an \nagreement to include the advanced energy manufacturing tax credit in \nthe bipartisan tax relief package we passed last December. That credit \nis an example of the kinds of policies that will help spur the \ninnovation, manufacturing, and new deployment that will generate clean-\nenergy jobs. I am encouraged, though, that it included funding for the \ntreasury grant program, which leverages private investment in clean-\nenergy projects, for which I pushed along with a number of my \ncolleagues to be included in the package.\n  Additionally, if we wish to remain on the cutting edge of new clean-\nenergy manufacturing technologies and retain our place as the global \nleader in scientific innovation, we need to pass more legislation like \nthe America COMPETES Act. In addition to creating ARPA-E, which makes \nstrategic investments through the Federal Department of Energy in game-\nchanging technologies, it also focuses resources on science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics education.\n  I am proud to have been a cosponsor of the America COMPETES Act, \nwhich was so actively championed by my predecessor, Senator Ted \nKaufman, who served Delaware so well. This is just the type of \nlegislation that I came here to support.\n  We need to find additional ways to expand educational opportunities \nfor more of our students, especially in these fields essential to \nfuture competitiveness. There is vital work to be done in ensuring that \nour business leaders are at the table as we renew America's education \npolicy, helping make certain that our schools are educating our \nchildren for the demands of the modern workplace.\n  This is especially critical in light of recent international \nstandardized test scores that once again showed American students \nfalling behind their competitors from Asia and Europe in reading, \nscience, and mathematics.\n  A strong educational foundation is the launching pad for new ideas, \nwhich will soar to become tomorrow's products and industries.\n  To achieve this, we must have a strong Federal investment in great \nteachers and strong schools, set high standards matched with the \nresources to achieve them, and engage parents, communities, and \nemployers.\n  We should never settle for just recovery. We must reach for the \nprosperity and growth I know we can together achieve. We can do it if \nwe make these critical investments and changes in direction today.\n  That is why I am excited to get to work with my colleagues on a \nnumber of important legislative projects. Because I believe we need to \nredouble our efforts to protect the fruits of that innovation through \nstronger protections for our intellectual property, I am proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor of the Patent Reform Act and look forward to working \nwith Chairman Leahy on the Judiciary Committee toward its passage.\n  Likewise, I found out this week that I will be serving on the Foreign \nRelations Committee, and I will be pushing for us to be tougher on our \ntrading partners to ensure fairness and a level playing field for \nAmerican exports, as well as new efforts to expand the range of our \noverseas markets.\n  I am honored as well to be a new member of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, and I am eager to work with Chairman Bingaman, \nSenator Murkowski, and the other members on finding ways to spur clean-\nenergy manufacturing here in America.\n  My other assignment will be as a member of the Budget Committee, and \nI look forward to working with my colleagues there to identify ways to \naddress the deficit comprehensively and in line with our necessary \npriorities of simplifying the Tax Code, investing in our workforce, and \nincentivizing manufacturing job growth.\n  Outside of my committee assignments, I am excited to get to work \nreinvigorating the Senate Manufacturing Caucus with many of my \ncolleagues, including Senators Stabenow of Michigan, Brown of Ohio and \nGraham of South Carolina. We are going to renew this Chamber's focus on \nwhat voters sent us here to do: restoring our economy by getting our \nneighbors back to work.\n  The American people have at times grown frustrated with the Senate \nbecause it seems as if this body has not realized the scale of our \nNation's challenges; that legislators have taken a piecemeal approach \nto important policies and have failed to address our most difficult \nproblems comprehensively.\n  Why are we not looking at tax policy, education policy, and job \ngrowth strategy collectively? Our problems are interrelated, and the \nsolutions must be as well.\n  Likewise, our budget deficit should not be treated merely as a \ntalking point or a source of partisan advantage but instead as the \nserious threat that it is. And real deficit reduction will only come \nwith a careful approach, and a willingness to share in the sacrifice \nwill see us toward real deficit reduction.\n  Working together, we can change how we get things done here, and we \ncan find a way to do it without jeopardizing the Senate's vital role in \nour political system.\n  Even more importantly, at a time when many worry about the tone of \nour politics, we as Senators must do all we can to return this body to \nits founding mission as a stabilizing force in our political system.\n  The Senate must lead by example and for this Nation be a source of \ncivility, a beacon of cooperative spirit, and a place where we come \ntogether to address our greatest challenges.\n  That is how we will move forward together to solve our problems. That \nis how we will boost our manufacturing sector and get millions back to \nwork. And that is how we will build a strong, prosperous, and \nsustainable future for America's middle class.\n  Those who have lost their jobs are doing the very best they can to \nfind new ones. We owe it to them to do our best--to be determined and \ndeliberate, to focus on progress not partisanship, to be true to our \nprinciples, but not so unyielding in our positions that we make more \nnews than progress.\n  These are serious times, and our Nation--our people--face tough \nchallenges. I look forward to working with each and every one of my new \ncolleagues to bear down and work together to find innovative solutions, \nreal solutions, that will build a brighter future for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I am very pleased to stand and give them a word of \nrecognition for the enormous amount of effort and energy and \npersistence and argument and conviction that all went into this effort.\n  I will close with one point that I think bears remembering as we \nevaluate whether the test of experience is met in the future, and that \nis what the filibuster changed into, what was really going on on the \nfloor as we all sat in the Chamber.\n  We remember the glory days of the filibuster when you had Senators on \nthe floor reading from the phonebook, standing here as long as they \ncould. The famous example of it from Hollywood, of course, was \nJefferson Smith in the famous movie by Frank Capra, ``Mr. Smith Goes to \nWashington.'' There is that wonderful scene in the movie where the \nreporter is upstairs in the gallery, and he is covering what Jimmy \nStewart is doing down here. He describes the filibuster. He is talking \ninto his microphone. He says: The filibuster is going on down there. It \nis democracy's finest show--the right to talk your head off. The \nAmerican privilege of free speech in its most dramatic form. One lone \nand single American holding the greatest floor in the land, bleary-\neyed, voice gone. You can hear the drama of it. That was the filibuster \nof old, and that is the filibuster Americans understand. It made it \nvery hard for Americans to understand when we said: Oh, there is a \nfilibuster going on in the Senate, and they turned on C-SPAN and there \nwas nobody here. The Senate floor was silent, except for the quiet \nvoice of the clerk slowly droning through the names of Senators in a \ntedious, ineffectual quorum call.\n  The quorum call became the emblem of the modern filibuster. Why is \nthat? That is because the filibuster rule requires a 30-hour debate \nperiod when cloture is invoked to stop a filibuster. If you are the \nminority party and you can force the majority leader to invoke cloture, \nwhat have you just done? You have accomplished a very valuable prize: \nYou have taken 30 hours of the time of this Senate and you have \ndedicated it to debate on a proposition and you do not actually have to \ndebate the proposition. You just let the quorum calls roll, and you \nburn 30 hours of the Senate's time.\n  The New York Times reported that Democrats have been forced to break \n275 filibusters in the past two Congresses. If we had to burn the 30 \nhours for cloture in every one of those filibusters, the math on that \nis 8,250 hours lost to the Senate, lost to silence and ineffectual, \ndroning quorum calls. If you count 8-hour days, that is more than 1,000 \ndays of time wasted, of work undone, of the authority of the Senate and \nof this branch of the U.S. Government stripped away and consigned to \nthe dustbin of wasted time.\n  The test as we go forward is going to be how often that strategy of \njust burning the time of the Senate is used. One important measure is, \nwill we see these filibusters and forced cloture motions on things that \nend up being not very contentious? The people would ask me: Why are \nthey filibustering this? They don't really object to this.\n  This is not like civil rights in the old days when people were \nviolently opposed to it. They would come to the floor, and they would \nfilibuster their heads off. This is a different strategy. Under the \nmodern strategy, you do not just filibuster the bills you hate; you \nfilibuster everything because that is more of those 30-hour blocks of \ntime burned, chucked in the dustbin, unavailable for the work of this \nbody and this country.\n  I hope very much that the spirit of this shows itself in experience \non the floor. I applaud Senator Alexander and Senator Schumer for \nhaving reached that agreement. I applaud the two leaders for having \nformalized it in their colloquy on the Senate floor earlier today. But, \nas Ronald Reagan used to say, trust but verify. And we will have the \nchance to verify in the coming weeks and months whether, in fact, the \nabuse of this rule is done with and we get back to being the Senate of \nwhich we can be proud or whether the abuse continues and we continue to \nbe a Senate frustrated by endless quorum calls and delay and \nobstruction and a continued inability to do the basic business of this \ncountry. I hope we turn out much for the better.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/27/senate-section/article/S332-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S332-S333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NEVADA NATIONAL SECURITY SITE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the 60th anniversary of \nthe Nevada National Security Site, N2S2. The Nevada National Security \nSite, formerly known as the Nevada Test Site, has played an important \nrole in keeping our Nation safe and will continue to do so as we face \nnew security challenges.\n  On January 27, 1951, a half kiloton nuclear weapon called ``Able'' \nwas dropped on N2S2, launching a 40-year era. In that instant, N2S2 \nbecame the Nation's most important nuclear weapons proving grounds. I \nam thankful for the work done by the men and women at the site who \ndedicated their careers and sacrificed their health to keeping America \nsafe. Nearly 20 years after our Nation's last nuclear test, I am proud \nto say that N2S2 is still helping secure America with a new mission \ntailored to 21st century threats and making us energy independent.\n  Mr. President, 928 atmospheric and underground tests were performed \nat the N2S2 before the United States established a moratorium on \nnuclear weapons testing in 1992. The vast majority of testing in this \nperiod took place underground in a network of tunnels and shafts. Even \nthough these tunnels were designed to contain radiation from the \nexplosions, thousands of N2S2 workers still experienced radiation \nexposure from most of the underground detonations.\n  In 2000, after a number of my colleagues and I had begun to hear \ndisturbing stories about illnesses our Cold War veterans had gotten \nfrom their nuclear weapons work and their inability to get any \nfinancial compensation from the government, we passed the Energy \nEmployees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act. This \nlegislation was designed to allow thousands of America's Cold War \nveterans receive compensation that would help pay their medical bills \nand honor the sacrifices they and their families had made for our \ncountry.\n  Unfortunately, it soon became clear that even with this new law, it \nwould not be easy for many workers to get the compensation they \ndeserved. In 2005, I again began to hear from workers and survivors--\nthis time complaining that they were being put through an endless \nstream of bureaucratic red tape only to be denied in the end. I was \nenraged that these workers were denied compensation, so I worked for \nthe next 5 years before successfully securing automatic compensation \nfor most of Nevada's Cold War veterans and their families.\n  On August 23, 2010, I joined Tom D'Agostino, the administrator of the \nNational Nuclear Security Administration, and officials from the State \nDepartment, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Defense \nto recognize the continued importance of one of our Nation's vital \nnational security sites. We established not only a new name, but a new \nmission for N2S2. Changing the site's name from the Nevada Test Site to \nNevada National Security Site reflects the unique opportunities to use \nthe site for detecting dangerous weapons, treaty verification, fighting \nterrorism and nuclear smuggling, and training first responders.\n  The Nevada National Security Site is the ideal laboratory for this \nwork. It is uniquely secure, and close to Nevadans who are eager to get \nback to work as soon as they can find a good job. And it\n\n[[Page S333]]\n\nalready has a workforce of 3,000 men and women dedicated to serving \ntheir country.\n  The Nevada National Security Site is not only breaking ground on new \nways to keep us safe from weapons; it is also breaking ground on \ndeveloping clean energy technologies that will make us energy \nindependent. The former nuclear weapons proving ground will soon be a \nproving ground for advanced solar energy technologies. Last August, I \njoined Energy Secretary Chu and Interior Secretary Salazar to designate \na 17,000 acre portion of N2S2 as the Nation's solar demonstration zone \nfor testing the most innovative and promising solar technologies in an \narea with almost perpetual sun shine.\n  When Nevadans and all Americans look at the N2S2, they will see \nopportunities embodying the core values of innovation, leadership and \nsecurity. I ask all my colleagues to join with me and the people of \nNevada in recognizing the Nevada National Security Site's 60th \nanniversary, its rich history and bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/27/senate-section/article/S333-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO SARAH BRACHMAN\n\n  Mr. REID.

As a beloved member of his \ncommunity in Burnside, KY, Bill was a prime example of a man who poured \nhis heart into serving and protecting his family, his community, and \nhis country.\n  Born in Pulaski County, KY, Bill not only served his community \nselflessly, but touched the lives of all who had the pleasure of \nmeeting him. He courageously served in the U.S. Army during the Korean \nWar, and continued his public service as a Burnside police officer. It \nis no wonder that Bill's friendly demeanor and dedication earned him \nthe position of chief of police, which he held for 6 years.\n  Bill continued to serve his community as an employee at the Pulaski \nCounty Detention Center, a member of Blue John Baptist Church, the \nAmerican Legion Post 38, and, even more impressively, as a 50-year \nmember of the Burnside Masonic Lodge. It is evident that the people in \nthis close-knit community respected and valued Bill's tireless \ndedication, when more than 50 residents, including fellow police \nofficers, lined the streets of Burnside following his funeral \nprocession to pay their respects.\n  I could surely continue to praise the works and accomplishments of \nthis hard-working and humble man, but I would simply ask that my \ncolleagues join me in remembering this unsung hero, who showed \nincredible character and relentless dedication in service to his \ncommunity, his country, and the Commonwealth.

Mr. President, I join privacy advocates, industry leaders \nand government officials from across our Nation in celebrating Data \nPrivacy Day 2011--a day to raise awareness about data privacy practices \nand rights.\n  Today, Americans from all walks of life reap the countless benefits \nof the Internet and the latest technological advances. But, with these \nmany rewards, comes growing uncertainty and unease about how sensitive \npersonal information is collected, shared and stored.\n  In the digital age, our Nation faces the difficult challenge of \nprotecting our computer networks from cyber threats. At the same time, \nwe must encourage American innovation and respect privacy rights.\n  Data Privacy Day provides an important opportunity to remind all \nAmericans about how essential privacy is to our daily lives. This day \nis also a time for us in Congress to remember the important work that \nwe must complete to better protect digital privacy rights. As the \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will continue to do my \npart.\n  This year, I will continue--and hopefully complete--work on \nbipartisan data privacy legislation that will better protect Americans' \nsensitive personal data and reduce the risk of data security breaches. \nThe Senate Judiciary Committee has favorably reported my Personal Data \nPrivacy and Security Act three times. We must finish this pressing work \nduring the 112th Congress and finally enact comprehensive data privacy \nlegislation.\n  I will also continue the important work that the Judiciary Committee \nbegan during the last Congress to update the Electronic Communications \nPrivacy Act, ECPA, so that our digital privacy laws keep pace with the \ninformation age. When I first wrote ECPA in the mid-1980s, no one could \nhave imagined the technological advances and threats to digital privacy \nthat we see today. Updating this law to reflect the realities of our \ntime is essential to keeping us safe from cyber threats and critical to \nensuring that our Federal privacy laws keep pace with advancing\n\n[[Page S334]]\n\ntechnologies. The year ahead will also present opportunities to study \nemerging privacy issues, such as the use of full body scanners at our \nairports and threats to online privacy.\n  The 112th Congress affords all of us in Congress an opportunity to \nmake sure that this universal right to be left alone remains viable in \nthe digital age.\n  I commend the many stakeholders and leaders from across the Nation \nwho are holding events to commemorate Data Privacy Day. I look forward \nto working with Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, and in \nboth Chambers, on legislation to better protect the privacy rights of \nall Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/27/senate-section/article/S334-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   STATE OF THE UNION SEATING GESTURE\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, on Tuesday we made history in a \nsmall but significant way here in Congress. When we filed into the \nHouse Chamber for the President's annual State of the Union Address, \nmany of us cast aside a long-held custom and crossed the aisle--\nliterally--and sat together rather than divided by party. In some \ncases, as with my colleagues from my home State of Colorado, we sat by \nState delegation, Republicans and Democrats together.\n  I advocated for that change as a symbolic gesture. It was something I \nhave done since I served in the Colorado State House.\n  In the days leading up to Tuesday's speech, folks here, and in the \nmedia, had a lot of fun comparing our plans to finding a date to a high \nschool dance. They started speculating on what was next--trust falls? A \nropes course? I am an old mountaineer--I have been joking that the \naisle has become a mountain to climb.\n  And while those jokes have been entertaining for us inside the \nbeltway, I think the media's interest in the drama highlights part of \nthe problem that led me to call for a change in the way we sit during \nthe State of the Union.\n  My staff did quite a bit of research on the history of the State of \nthe Union Address, and they couldn't find any historical reason for \ndivided seating. It seems to have developed along with the evolution of \nbroadcast journalism.\n  So it appears that the media's hunger for drama--and our own need to \nuse the media to project fierce party unity to the audience at home--\nhas made the State of the Union like a pep rally--or a kind of sideshow \nto the main event. We've lost our focus on the content of the speech in \nan effort to get a moment of air time or a good headline.\n  I will be the first to admit that Tuesday's new seating arrangements \naren't going to suddenly change the atmosphere here in Congress. But I \nhope it was the start of a new tradition. It certainly was a step in \nthe right direction. Coloradans and Americans overwhelmingly supported \nthe idea. It is something Americans are hungering for--I was just the \nmessenger. There is no question it got us talking to people outside our \ncomfort zones. I think the result was a more respectful--and less \ndivided--State of the Union Address.\n  And I bring this up today--2 days after the State of the Union--\nbecause I don't want this to be an anomaly--a brief moment of half-\nhearted kumbaya before we slip back into our old habits. There was an \neven more serious reason for bringing us all together. We are not just \ndivided during the President's State of the Union Address--it is nearly \nevery day--in Washington and on the campaign trail.\n  If you go out and talk to citizens--as I do when I am in Colorado--\nthe vast majority of people say they are frustrated with the bickering \nin Washington, and they believe it is hurting our Nation. The words \nused by politicians and commentators on the right and the left have \nbecome over the top--even violent.\n  After the horrific events of January 9, it is only natural that we \nask whether there is a connection between the fact that Congresswoman \nGiffords was the subject of violent gun metaphors on the campaign trail \nand the attack by a disturbed gunman only a few months later.\n  I, personally, think it would be simplistic to believe that one was \nthe sole--or even a part--cause of the other. But it is \nincontrovertible that the level of violence and vitriol in our \npolitical language has been escalating year after year to a point where \nthe space between rhetoric and reality has grown from a gap into a \nchasm.\n  To quote Jon Stewart of the ``Daily Show'' during his rally to \nrestore sanity in politics: ``We live now in hard times, not end \ntimes.'' Yet you wouldn't know it by listening to the 24-hour media \nspin cycle.\n  I know Gabby well. She represents the district my father represented \nfor 30 years. I grew up in Tucson, and a piece of me will always be \nrooted in its sandy soil. It is a border district, full of independent \nwesterners whose ancestors made a good living there, despite harsh \nconditions and punishing temperatures. Its people include moderates as \nwell as staunch liberals and strong-minded conservatives. In order to \nrepresent the area well, you really have to be outside politics, \nwilling to hear everyone's point of view and to bring them together \nregardless of party. That is Gabby in a nutshell.\n  It would be a huge disservice to Gabby, Judge Roll, Christina Greene, \nand all of the other victims of the Tucson shooting if we didn't seize \nthis moment to reflect on how to rein in the rhetoric--to become more \ncivil to each other--and--as our President said eloquently--live up to \ntheir ideals for our democracy.\n  So sitting together was only a small step. I hope we can follow it up \nwith more efforts to work together--perhaps bipartisan retreats--or, as \nwas suggested by a few of my colleagues--doing away with the aisle \naltogether.\n  I want to thank my co-leaders in this effort--Senator Murkowski of \nAlaska, and Representatives Heath Shuler and Paul Gosar. I look forward \nto working with them and any others in ways that will eventually help \nus solve the big challenges that confront us--because if we cannot sit \ntogether, we are kidding ourselves if we think we can win the global \neconomic race, pay down our debt, develop a 21st century energy policy, \nfix our broken immigration system--or address any of the myriad other \nproblems facing our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/27/senate-section/article/S334-2", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JOHNNY THE BRAVE\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN.

A bill to increase criminal penalties for \ncertain knowing and intentional violations relating to food that \nis misbranded or adulterated; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation to hold criminals who poison our food supply accountable \nfor their crimes. This is an issue that received considerable attention \nlast year, and I was pleased that the Congress finally passed \ncomprehensive food safety reforms. But our work is not done. The Food \nSafety Accountability Act increases the sentences that prosecutors can \nseek for people who violate our food safety laws in those cases where \nthere is conscious or reckless disregard of a risk of death or serious \nbodily injury. The legislation I propose will allow law enforcement to \nseek sentences of up to 10 years in jail for those who contaminate our \nfood supply with the intent to mislead or defraud consumers, and \nendanger Americans.\n  Last year, I introduced similar legislation which received unanimous \nsupport from the Senate Judiciary Committee. I hope the Judiciary \nCommittee, and the full Senate, will give it the same consideration \nthis year. I'd like to thank Senator Klobuchar and Senator Franken for \ntheir ongoing support of the bill. Senator Sessions, Senator Hatch, \nSenator Coburn, and Senator Grassley had concerns about its breadth, \nand we were able to work together to address these concerns in the \nlegislation I introduce today.\n  Just last summer, a salmonella outbreak caused hundreds of people to \nfall ill and triggered a national egg recall. The company responsible \nfor the eggs at the root of this summer's salmonella crisis had a long \nhistory of environmental, immigration, labor, and food safety \nviolations. It is clear that fines are not enough to protect the public \nand effectively deter this unacceptable conduct. We need to make sure \nthat those who intentionally poison the food supply will go to jail. \nThe Food Safety Accountability Act will help to do that in the most \negregious cases.\n  Current statutes do not provide sufficient criminal sanctions for \nthose who violate our food safety laws with the intent to mislead or \ndefraud. Doing so is already illegal, but it is merely a misdemeanor \nright now, and the Sentencing Commission has found that it generally \ndoes not result in jail time. The fines and recalls that usually result \nfrom criminal violations under current law fall short in protecting the \npublic from harmful products. Too often, those who are willing to \nendanger our children in pursuit of profits view such fines or recalls \nas merely the cost of doing business.\n  In the last Congress, a mother from Vermont, Gabrielle Meunier, \ntestified before the Senate Agriculture Committee about her seven-year-\nold son, Christopher, who became severely ill and was hospitalized for \nsix days after he developed salmonella poisoning from peanut crackers. \nThankfully, Christopher recovered, but Mrs. Meunier's story highlighted \nimprovements that are needed in our food safety system. No parent \nshould have to go through what she experienced. The American people \nshould be confident that the food they buy for their families is safe.\n  After hearing Mrs. Meunier's account, I called on the Department of \nJustice to conduct a criminal investigation into the outbreak of \nsalmonella that made Christopher and many others so sick. These \nproducts were linked to the deaths of nine people and have sickened \nmore than 600 others. It appears that the company responsible knew that \ntheir peanut products had tested positive for deadly salmonella, but \nrather than immediately disposing of the products, the company sought \nways to sell them anyway. The evidence suggests that the public was \nmisled, and that the company put profit above the public's safety. The \nFood Safety Accountability Act increases the chances that those who \ndisregard the safety of Americans and commit food safety crimes will \nface jail time, rather than merely a slap on the wrist, for their \ncriminal conduct.\n  On behalf of the hundreds of individuals sickened by recent \nsalmonella outbreaks, I hope Senators of both parties will act swiftly \nto pass this bill. We have come a long way, but must continue to be \ndiligent to ensure that our food safety system is strong. The Justice \nDepartment must be given the tools it needs to investigate and \nprosecute crime involving food safety, and we must work together, from \nfarm to\n\n[[Page S340]]\n\nfork, to improve the safety of food in this country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 216\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the reforestation of forest landscapes, \nprotection of old growth forests, and management of national forests in \nthe eastside forests of the State of Oregon; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce critical forest \nlegislation for my home State of Oregon.\n  This is legislation that I introduced in the last Congress. \nUnfortunately, despite making significant progress and gaining the \nsupport of the administration, my legislation did not get passed before \nCongress adjourned. But the need remains as great as ever and it \nremains one of the top priorities for my State. So today, early in this \nnew Congress, I am reintroducing the bill and sending the message that \nthis urgent priority needs to get done.\n  I am pleased that my colleague from Oregon, Senator Merkley, has \njoined me today in introducing this bill. Like me, he recognizes the \nsevere needs in our forests and in the forest dependent communities.\n  For too many decades, Oregon has been at war with itself over the \nfate of its forests. Nowhere has the negative impact of this battle \nbeen greater than in Oregon's eastside forests.\n  Over-logging and disastrous fire suppression policies of the past \ngave way over time to excessive litigation and gridlock.\n  That excessive litigation and gridlock has resulted in millions of \nacres of Oregon's Federal forest landscape containing choked, \noverstocked stands that are at great risk of uncharacteristic \ncatastrophic fires, insect infestations and disease.\n  Controversial logging that holds the industry and the environment \nhostage to competing ideologies serves no one's interest. The focus \nshould be on areas that everyone agrees desperately need management: to \nthin and restore our forests and watersheds, and to reduce hazardous \nfuels putting our forests at risk.\n  That is why I introduced legislation in the last Congress to begin to \ntackle the challenges facing Oregon's Eastside forests.\n  Leaders on both sides of these difficult issues came together with me \nafter intense negotiations to bring peace, jobs, and a healthier \ntomorrow to the 8.3 million acres on the 6 Federal forests in eastern \nand central Oregon.\n  Those leaders realized that each side had armed itself politically \nenough to survive, but not enough to succeed.\n  With each passing month and each attempted timber sale and threatened \nlawsuit, our inability to take action, our inability to address the \nneeds of Oregon's declining forests means that they are growing more at \nrisk of preventable fire and disease.\n  Leaders on both sides of this issue realized that unless something \nfundamental changes, Oregon's Federal forest landscape, with millions \nof acres of choked, at-risk forest in desperate need of management, \nmillions of acres of old growth, species habitat, and watersheds face \nan uncertain future.\n  Timber executives came together with leaders of the Oregon \nenvironmental community to take shared responsibility for saving our \nendangered forests, following months of intense negotiations to reach \nan agreement on legislation.\n  Since my bill was introduced in the last Congress, there have been \ncontinuing discussions and negotiations as my stakeholders and I have \nworked with the Administration and the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee to get the bill ready for passage in the Senate. Today's bill \nreflects some of those changes, but it preserves the core elements of \nthe agreement that I crafted with the stakeholders to this agreement--a \npush to increase the timber produced from our national forests, \nlandscape scale restoration efforts and protections for watersheds and \nold growth.\n  Today in eastern Oregon we are down to only a small handful of \nsurviving mills. Without far greater certainty of supply and an \nimmediate increase in merchantable timber, more mills will close.\n  If that happens, our Eastside forests will pay the price.\n  Without mills to process saw logs and other merchantable material \nfrom forest restoration projects, there will be no restoration of our \nEastside forests.\n  Fortunately leaders on both sides of this issue recognize that and \nthat is why they set aside their differences to forge an agreement.\n  Job One must be saving the remaining infrastructure of forestry--\nOregon's mills and its timber workers--in central and eastern Oregon \nwhile preserving our old growth and watersheds.\n  My stakeholders and I worked very hard on the agreement and to \nadvance this legislation. As I predicted, we have already seen our \nshare of challenges. But I have great faith that we will stand firm to \nsee this legislation implemented.\n  I am not going to let Congressional gridlock stop the historic \nprogress that has been made on forestry issues in Oregon. This issue is \nsimply too important.\n  I also want to point out that none of our efforts will succeed unless \nOregon Federal forests are also adequately funded to properly manage \nand restore these valuable Federal assets.\n  Together, as a team, we will fight for the funding to put our people \nback to work and restore the health of our forests.\n  I want to thank my stakeholders for their support and tireless work \nin crafting this agreement and ultimately in working with me through \nthe legislative process.\n  I am proud to introduce this legislation today, and I am going to \nkeep working with all the folks in my State who are willing to talk in \ngood faith about restoring our eastside forests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/27/senate-section/article/S340-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S340-S341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 28--TO ESTABLISH AS A STANDING ORDER OF THE SENATE \nTHAT A SENATOR PUBLICLY DISCLOSE A NOTICE OF INTENT TO OBJECTING TO ANY \n                           MEASURE OR MATTER\n\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Res. 31\n\n       Whereas throughout the history of the United States, nurses \n     have served the United States Armed Forces during times of \n     peace and war;\n       Whereas the establishment of the United States Army Nurse \n     Corps (referred to in this preamble as the ``Army Nurse \n     Corps''), a permanent nursing corps, was authorized under \n     section 19 of the Act of February 2, 1901 (31 Stat. 753, \n     chapter 192);\n       Whereas for the 110 years since its establishment, the Army \n     Nurse Corps has served with distinction at home and abroad;\n       Whereas more than 21,000 Army nurses served in World War I, \n     providing care in evacuation, mobile surgical hospitals, and \n     on hospital trains and transport ships;\n       Whereas in World War II, more than 57,000 Army nurses \n     served with distinction, including 67 nurses who were \n     captured in the Philippines and held as prisoners of war for \n     3 years before their liberation in February 1945;\n       Whereas Army nurses have served with the United States Army \n     in hostilities in Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, Kuwait, \n     and Somalia;\n       Whereas Army nurses have served shoulder to shoulder with \n     the United States Army for more than 9 years in Afghanistan \n     and 7 years in Iraq;\n       Whereas as of the date of agreement to this resolution, \n     nurses in the Army Reserve, the Army National Guard, and the \n     Regular Army are deployed in more than 15 countries;\n       Whereas the motto of Army nurses, ``Embrace the Past, \n     Engage the Present, Envision the Future'', symbolizes the \n     bond of the Army Nurse Corps to its rich history as well as \n     its commitment to the care of future generations of \n     Americans;\n       Whereas Army nurses, who selflessly serve the United \n     States, will continue to serve the United States Army, \n     regardless of the cause, location, or magnitude of future \n     battles; and\n       Whereas the Army Nurse Corps is committed to providing \n     quality care to the United States Army during times of peace \n     and war, at any time and in any place: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the valor, commitment, and sacrifice that \n     United States Army Nurse\n\n[[Page S342]]\n\n     Corps nurses have made throughout the history of the United \n     States;\n       (2) commends the United States Army Nurse Corps for 110 \n     years of selfless service; and\n       (3) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     that anniversary with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/27/senate-section/article/S342-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 32--DESIGNATING THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY 2011 AS \n    ``NATIONAL TEEN DATING VIOLENCE AWARENESS AND PREVENTION MONTH''\n\n  Mr. CRAPO (for himself and Mr. Lieberman) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S. Res. 32\n\n       Whereas while dating, domestic, and sexual violence and \n     stalking affect women regardless of age, teens and young \n     women are especially vulnerable;\n       Whereas according to Liz Claiborne's 2009 Parent/Teen \n     Dating Violence Poll, approximately 1 in 3 adolescent girls \n     in the United States is a victim of physical, emotional, or \n     verbal abuse from a dating partner, a rate that far exceeds \n     victimization rates for other types of violence affecting \n     youth;\n       Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, nearly 10 percent of high school students have \n     been hit, slapped, or physically hurt on purpose by a \n     boyfriend or girlfriend in the past year;\n       Whereas according to the American Journal of Public Health, \n     more than 1 in 4 teenagers have been in a relationship where \n     a partner is verbally abusive;\n       Whereas according to a Youth Risk Behavioral Survey, almost \n     20 percent of teen girls who were exposed to physical dating \n     violence did not attend school on 1 or more occasions during \n     the past 30 days due to feeling unsafe at school or on the \n     way to or from school;\n       Whereas violent relationships in adolescence can have \n     serious ramifications for victims, putting such victims at \n     higher risk for substance abuse, eating disorders, risky \n     sexual behavior, suicide, and adult revictimization;\n       Whereas being physically and sexually abused leaves teen \n     girls up to 6 times more likely to become pregnant and more \n     than twice as likely to contract a sexually transmitted \n     disease;\n       Whereas nearly 3 in 4 ``tweens'', individuals who are \n     between the ages of 11 and 14, report that dating \n     relationships usually begin at age 14 or younger and about 72 \n     percent of eighth and ninth graders report ``dating'';\n       Whereas 1 in 5 tweens say that their friends are victims of \n     dating violence, and nearly half of tweens who are in \n     relationships know friends who are verbally abused;\n       Whereas more than 3 times as many tweens (20 percent) as \n     parents of tweens (6 percent) admit that parents know little \n     or nothing about the dating relationships of tweens;\n       Whereas teen dating abuse most often takes place in the \n     home of 1 of the partners;\n       Whereas according to Liz Claiborne's 2009 Parent/Teen \n     Dating Violence Poll, although 82 percent of parents are \n     confident that they could recognize the signs if their child \n     was experiencing dating abuse, a majority of parents (58 \n     percent) could not correctly identify all the warning signs \n     of abuse;\n       Whereas 74 percent of teenage boys and 66 percent of \n     teenage girls say that they have not had a conversation with \n     a parent about dating abuse in the past year;\n       Whereas digital abuse and ``sexting'', or sending or \n     receiving nude pictures of other young people on a cellphone \n     or on the Internet, is becoming a new frontier for teen \n     dating abuse;\n       Whereas according to a National Crime Prevention Council \n     survey, 43 percent of middle and high school students \n     reported experiencing cyberbullying in the past year;\n       Whereas 1 in 4 teens in a relationship say that they have \n     been called names, harassed, or put down by their partner \n     through cellphones and texting;\n       Whereas according to a survey by The National Campaign, \n     more than half of teen girls say pressure from a boy is a \n     reason girls send suggestive messages or images, while only \n     18 percent of teen boys say pressure from a girl is a reason \n     for such behavior, and 12 percent of teen girls who have sent \n     suggestive messages or images say they felt ``pressured'' to \n     do so;\n       Whereas according to a 2009 survey by Cox Communications, \n     19 percent of teens revealed that they had been harassed, \n     embarrassed, or threatened online or by text message;\n       Whereas 3 in 10 young people have ``sexted'', and 61 \n     percent of young people who have ``sexted'' report being \n     pressured to do so at least once;\n       Whereas targets of digital abuse are almost 3 times more \n     likely to contemplate suicide as those who have not \n     encountered digital abuse, and targets of digital abuse are \n     nearly 3 times more likely to have considered dropping out of \n     school;\n       Whereas according to Liz Claiborne's 2010 College Dating \n     Violence and Abuse Poll, 63 percent of college students \n     report having a college friend who experienced violent and \n     abusive dating behavior;\n       Whereas according to Liz Claiborne's 2010 College Dating \n     Violence and Abuse Poll, 41 percent of dating college \n     students report experiencing violent and abusive dating \n     behaviors;\n       Whereas 65 percent of college students who were in an \n     abusive relationship failed to realize that they were in an \n     abusive relationship, and 53 percent of such students said \n     that no one helped them;\n       Whereas the severity of violence among intimate partners \n     has been shown to be greater in cases where the pattern of \n     violence was established in adolescence;\n       Whereas primary prevention programs are a key part of \n     addressing teen dating violence, and many successful examples \n     of such programs include education, community outreach, and \n     social marketing campaigns that are culturally appropriate;\n       Whereas skilled assessment and intervention programs are \n     also necessary for youth victims and abusers; and\n       Whereas the establishment of National Teen Dating Violence \n     Awareness and Prevention Month will benefit schools, \n     communities, and families regardless of socioeconomic status, \n     race, or sex: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of February 2011 as ``National \n     Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month'';\n       (2) supports communities in empowering teens to develop \n     healthier relationships throughout their lives; and\n       (3) calls upon the people of the United States, including \n     youth, parents, schools, law enforcement, State and local \n     officials, and interested groups to observe National Teen \n     Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month with \n     appropriate programs and activities that promote awareness \n     and prevention of teen dating violence in their communities.\n\n

Eisenhower, the boy who rose \n     from humble beginnings to lead as Supreme Allied Commander in \n     World War II and later serve as the 34th President of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas from the days of the ``Bleeding Kansas'' border \n     wars through the current deployments in the Middle East, \n     patriotic people of the State of Kansas have answered the \n     call of duty to fight for the United States and the cause of \n     liberty, including Senator Bob Dole who was wounded as a \n     young infantry officer in World War II and later served as \n     Senate Majority Leader and the Republican Nominee for \n     President of the United States in 1996;\n\n[[Page S343]]\n\n       Whereas the State of Kansas continues its proud military \n     tradition by supporting troops and their families in the \n     National Guard in towns across the State and at Fort Riley, \n     McConnell Air Force Base, and the Army Staff and Command \n     College in Leavenworth; and\n       Whereas the motto of the State of Kansas, ``Ad Astra per \n     Aspera,'' which means ``To the Stars through Difficulty,'' \n     pays respect to the turbulent past of the State of Kansas, \n     while remaining hopeful about the future: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (A) the people of the United States should observe and \n     celebrate the 150th anniversary of the admittance of the \n     State of Kansas to the United States as the 34th State;\n       (B) the people of the State of Kansas should--\n       (i) be honored for their pioneering spirit and innovations; \n     and\n       (ii) reflect on the distinguished past of the State and \n     look forward to a promising future; and\n       (C) there is no place like home; and\n       (2) the Senate respectfully requests the Secretary of the \n     Senate to transmit to the Governor of the State of Kansas an \n     enrolled copy of this resolution for appropriate display.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/27/senate-section/article/S343-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we proceed to \nS. Res. 31.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 31) commemorating the 110th \n     anniversary of the United States Army Nurse Corps.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I rise to commemorate the \n110th anniversary of the U.S. Army Nurse Corps. As a proud supporter of \nthe officers, enlisted, and civilian personnel of the Army Nurse Corps, \nI am pleased that we are recognizing their contributions to our Army \nand our great Nation.\n  Since 1901, Army nurses have demonstrated again and again their total \ncommitment to the highest standards of military nursing excellence. \nBoth men and women have served as Army nurses since 1775, but the Army \nNurse Corps did not become a part of the Army Medical Department until \n1901. The distinguished contributions of female contract nurses during \nand following the 1898 Spanish-American War became the justification \nand demonstrated the need for a permanent female nurse corps.\n  When the United States entered World War I in 1917, there were only \n4,093 nurses on Active Duty. By November 1918, there were 21,460 Army \nnurses, with 10,000 serving overseas. During the war, nurses served \nprimarily in base, evacuation, and mobile surgical hospitals in the \nUnited States, France, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. They \nalso provided care on hospital trains in France and transport ships \ncarrying wounded home across the Atlantic. Approximately 270 nurses \nlost their lives in the conflict.\n  When the United States entered World War II, fewer than 7,000 nurses \nwere on Active Duty. By 1945, more than 57,000 Army nurses were \nassigned to hospital ships and trains, flying ambulances, field \nhospitals, evacuation stations, and general hospitals at home and \noverseas. In Europe, Army nurses assisted in developing the concept of \nrecovery wards for immediate postoperative nursing care. Military \nnursing gained a greater understanding of the process of shock, blood \nreplacement, and resuscitation. Air evacuation from the combat zone by \nfixed-wing aircraft brought patients to definitive treatment quickly. \nArmy flight nurses helped to establish the incredible record of only 5 \ndeaths in flight per 100,000 patients.\n  Nurses endured hardships caring for their patients. In May 1942, with \nthe fall of Corregidor in the Philippines, 67 Army nurses became \nJapanese prisoners of war. During the 37-month captivity, the women \nendured primitive conditions and starvation rations. Yet they continued \nto care for the ill and injured in the internment hospital. On Anzio, \nnurses dug their foxholes outside their tents and cared for patients \nunder German shellfire. Their example bolstered the spirits of the \nsoldiers who shared the same tough experience. By war's end, 215 brave \nnurses died for their country.\n  Army nurses once again played a major role in support of combat \ntroops when President Truman ordered U.S. forces into Korea in June \n1950. Army nurses cared for combat troops during the landing on Inchon; \nthe advance across the 38th parallel into North Korea; the amphibious \nlanding on the east coast of Korea; the drive toward the Yalu River; \nand the retreat to the 38th parallel. Throughout the Korean war, 540 \nArmy nurses served on the embattled peninsula.\n  Mobility and increased patient acuity characterized service in \nVietnam. Evacuation by helicopter brought wounded to medical units \nlocated within minutes flying time of the battlefield. The UH-1H \nhelicopter ambulance, nicknamed the ``Dustoff,'' not only transported \npatients from battle locations 50 percent faster than in Korea but also \nprovided triage and resuscitative services for casualties. Trauma care \nspecialization, as well as shock trauma units, developed from this \nexperience. The ``chain of evacuation'' from Vietnam was extraordinary. \nA soldier could be wounded on the battlefield one day and 2 days later \nbe in an Army hospital in the continental United States. In Vietnam, of \nthe nearly 5,000 Army Nurses who served in 44 hospitals, 8 women made \nthe ultimate sacrifice for their Nation.\n  During Operation Desert Storm, approximately 2,200 nurses served in \n44 hospitals. Two of every three nurses in the Arabian Gulf were from \nthe Army National Guard or Army Reserves. This was the first major \nconflict that DEPMEDS, Deployable Medical Systems, were used. Another \nunique feature was that Army hospital staff coexisted with host nation \npersonnel in fixed facilities forming joint national professional \norganizations. Before, during, and after the 100-hour ground war, U.S. \nforces sustained a disease and nonbattle injury rate that was the \nlowest ever recorded in a conflict.\n  Recent years have seen Army nurses active throughout the world both \nin armed conflicts and humanitarian endeavors. In 1983, they supported \ncombat troops in Grenada; in 1989 in Panama; and in 1991 in the Middle \nEast. Since December 1995, Army nurses have been deployed with medical \nunits in support of NATO alliance troops in Haiti, Bosnia, Herzegovina, \nand Kosovo. Nurses have continued to serve proudly during relief \nefforts following natural disasters such as Hurricane Mitch in 1998. \nToday, the legacy of these military nurses lives on. Currently, Army \nnurses serve throughout the world in support of multiple overseas \ncontingency operations.\n  Throughout its history, the Army Nurse Corps has earned the deep \nrespect and gratitude of the American people because of its dedication \nto providing the best possible care to our soldiers and their families \nwhile serving our country in war and peace. Army nurses have \nunselfishly come to the aid of victims of disaster and disease \nthroughout the world. Over time, the mission has grown broader. Yet \nthere has been one constant--the devotion of the individual nurse in \nproviding excellent nursing care.\n  Today, as soldiers serve our Nation, defending freedom across the \nglobe, they can rest assured, should they get\n\n[[Page S346]]\n\ninjured or become ill, an Army nurse will be by their side, as they \nwere there by my side during my hour of need.\n  Happy 110th anniversary, Army nursing.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid on the \ntable, there be no intervening action or debate, and any statements \nrelated to this matter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 31\n\n       Whereas throughout the history of the United States, nurses \n     have served the United States Armed Forces during times of \n     peace and war;\n       Whereas the establishment of the United States Army Nurse \n     Corps (referred to in this preamble as the ``Army Nurse \n     Corps''), a permanent nursing corps, was authorized under \n     section 19 of the Act of February 2, 1901 (31 Stat. 753, \n     chapter 192);\n       Whereas for the 110 years since its establishment, the Army \n     Nurse Corps has served with distinction at home and abroad;\n       Whereas more than 21,000 Army nurses served in World War I, \n     providing care in evacuation, mobile surgical hospitals, and \n     on hospital trains and transport ships;\n       Whereas in World War II, more than 57,000 Army nurses \n     served with distinction, including 67 nurses who were \n     captured in the Philippines and held as prisoners of war for \n     3 years before their liberation in February 1945;\n       Whereas Army nurses have served with the United States Army \n     in hostilities in Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, Kuwait, \n     and Somalia;\n       Whereas Army nurses have served shoulder to shoulder with \n     the United States Army for more than 9 years in Afghanistan \n     and 7 years in Iraq;\n       Whereas as of the date of agreement to this resolution, \n     nurses in the Army Reserve, the Army National Guard, and the \n     Regular Army are deployed in more than 15 countries;\n       Whereas the motto of Army nurses, ``Embrace the Past, \n     Engage the Present, Envision the Future'', symbolizes the \n     bond of the Army Nurse Corps to its rich history as well as \n     its commitment to the care of future generations of \n     Americans;\n       Whereas Army nurses, who selflessly serve the United \n     States, will continue to serve the United States Army, \n     regardless of the cause, location, or magnitude of future \n     battles; and\n       Whereas the Army Nurse Corps is committed to providing \n     quality care to the United States Army during times of peace \n     and war, at any time and in any place: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the valor, commitment, and sacrifice that \n     United States Army Nurse Corps nurses have made throughout \n     the history of the United States;\n       (2) commends the United States Army Nurse Corps for 110 \n     years of selfless service; and\n       (3) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     that anniversary with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/27/senate-section/article/S346-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S346-S347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      NATIONAL TEEN DATING VIOLENCE AWARENESS AND PREVENTION MONTH\n\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 32) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 32\n\n       Whereas while dating, domestic, and sexual violence and \n     stalking affect women regardless of age, teens and young \n     women are especially vulnerable;\n       Whereas according to Liz Claiborne's 2009 Parent/Teen \n     Dating Violence Poll, approximately 1 in 3 adolescent girls \n     in the United States is a victim of physical, emotional, or \n     verbal abuse from a dating partner, a rate that far exceeds \n     victimization rates for other types of violence affecting \n     youth;\n       Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, nearly 10 percent of high school students have \n     been hit, slapped, or physically hurt on purpose by a \n     boyfriend or girlfriend in the past year;\n       Whereas according to the American Journal of Public Health, \n     more than 1 in 4 teenagers have been in a relationship where \n     a partner is verbally abusive;\n       Whereas according to a Youth Risk Behavioral Survey, almost \n     20 percent of teen girls who were exposed to physical dating \n     violence did not attend school on 1 or more occasions during \n     the past 30 days due to feeling unsafe at school or on the \n     way to or from school;\n       Whereas violent relationships in adolescence can have \n     serious ramifications for victims, putting such victims at \n     higher risk for substance abuse, eating disorders, risky \n     sexual behavior, suicide, and adult revictimization;\n       Whereas being physically and sexually abused leaves teen \n     girls up to 6 times more likely to become pregnant and more \n     than twice as likely to contract a sexually transmitted \n     disease;\n       Whereas nearly 3 in 4 ``tweens'', individuals who are \n     between the ages of 11 and 14, report that dating \n     relationships usually begin at age 14 or younger and about 72 \n     percent of eighth and ninth graders report ``dating'';\n       Whereas 1 in 5 tweens say that their friends are victims of \n     dating violence, and nearly half of tweens who are in \n     relationships know friends who are verbally abused;\n       Whereas more than 3 times as many tweens (20 percent) as \n     parents of tweens (6 percent) admit that parents know little \n     or nothing about the dating relationships of tweens;\n       Whereas teen dating abuse most often takes place in the \n     home of 1 of the partners;\n       Whereas according to Liz Claiborne's 2009 Parent/Teen \n     Dating Violence Poll, although 82 percent of parents are \n     confident that they could recognize the signs if their child \n     was experiencing dating abuse, a majority of parents (58 \n     percent) could not correctly identify all the warning signs \n     of abuse;\n       Whereas 74 percent of teenage boys and 66 percent of \n     teenage girls say that they have not had a conversation with \n     a parent about dating abuse in the past year;\n       Whereas digital abuse and ``sexting'', or sending or \n     receiving nude pictures of other young people on a cellphone \n     or on the Internet, is becoming a new frontier for teen \n     dating abuse;\n       Whereas according to a National Crime Prevention Council \n     survey, 43 percent of middle and high school students \n     reported experiencing cyberbullying in the past year;\n       Whereas 1 in 4 teens in a relationship say that they have \n     been called names, harassed, or put down by their partner \n     through cellphones and texting;\n       Whereas according to a survey by The National Campaign, \n     more than half of teen girls say pressure from a boy is a \n     reason girls send suggestive messages or images, while only \n     18 percent of teen boys say pressure from a girl is a reason \n     for such behavior, and 12 percent of teen girls who have sent \n     suggestive messages or images say they felt ``pressured'' to \n     do so;\n       Whereas according to a 2009 survey by Cox Communications, \n     19 percent of teens revealed that they had been harassed, \n     embarrassed, or threatened online or by text message;\n       Whereas 3 in 10 young people have ``sexted'', and 61 \n     percent of young people who have ``sexted'' report being \n     pressured to do so at least once;\n       Whereas targets of digital abuse are almost 3 times more \n     likely to contemplate suicide as those who have not \n     encountered digital abuse, and targets of digital abuse are \n     nearly 3 times more likely to have considered dropping out of \n     school;\n       Whereas according to Liz Claiborne's 2010 College Dating \n     Violence and Abuse Poll, 63 percent of college students \n     report having a college friend who experienced violent and \n     abusive dating behavior;\n       Whereas according to Liz Claiborne's 2010 College Dating \n     Violence and Abuse Poll, 41 percent of dating college \n     students report experiencing violent and abusive dating \n     behaviors;\n       Whereas 65 percent of college students who were in an \n     abusive relationship failed to realize that they were in an \n     abusive relationship, and 53 percent of such students said \n     that no one helped them;\n       Whereas the severity of violence among intimate partners \n     has been shown to be greater in cases where the pattern of \n     violence was established in adolescence;\n       Whereas primary prevention programs are a key part of \n     addressing teen dating violence, and many successful examples \n     of such programs include education, community outreach, and \n     social marketing campaigns that are culturally appropriate;\n       Whereas skilled assessment and intervention programs are \n     also necessary for youth victims and abusers; and\n       Whereas the establishment of National Teen Dating Violence \n     Awareness and Prevention Month will benefit schools, \n     communities, and families regardless of socioeconomic status, \n     race, or sex: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of February 2011 as ``National \n     Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month'';\n       (2) supports communities in empowering teens to develop \n     healthier relationships throughout their lives; and\n\n[[Page S347]]\n\n       (3) calls upon the people of the United States, including \n     youth, parents, schools, law enforcement, State and local \n     officials, and interested groups to observe National Teen \n     Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month with \n     appropriate programs and activities that promote awareness \n     and prevention of teen dating violence in their communities.\n\n

Eisenhower, the boy who rose \n     from humble beginnings to lead as Supreme Allied Commander in \n     World War II and later serve as the 34th President of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas from the days of the ``Bleeding Kansas'' border \n     wars through the current deployments in the Middle East, \n     patriotic people of the State of Kansas have answered the \n     call of duty to fight for the United States and the cause of \n     liberty, including Senator Bob Dole who was wounded as a \n     young infantry officer in World War II and later served as \n     Senate Majority Leader and the Republican Nominee for \n     President of the United States in 1996;\n       Whereas the State of Kansas continues its proud military \n     tradition by supporting troops and their families in the \n     National Guard in towns across the State and at Fort Riley, \n     McConnell Air Force Base, and the Army Staff and Command \n     College in Leavenworth; and\n       Whereas the motto of the State of Kansas, ``Ad Astra per \n     Aspera,'' which means ``To the Stars through Difficulty,'' \n     pays respect to the turbulent past of the State of Kansas, \n     while remaining hopeful about the future: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (A) the people of the United States should observe and \n     celebrate the 150th anniversary of the admittance of the \n     State of Kansas to the United States as the 34th State;\n       (B) the people of the State of Kansas should--\n       (i) be honored for their pioneering spirit and innovations; \n     and\n       (ii) reflect on the distinguished past of the State and \n     look forward to a promising future; and\n       (C) there is no place like home; and\n       (2) the Senate respectfully requests the Secretary of the \n     Senate to transmit to the Governor of the State of Kansas an \n     enrolled copy of this resolution for appropriate display.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/27/senate-section/article/S347-2", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 223\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, this legislation is the FAA authorization \nbill, which is extremely important. We have been trying to do this bill \nfor years. I hope with what took place today, we can move to this bill \nand have a good debate on an extremely important piece of legislation. \nThe vast majority of the Senate wants this to get done, Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  This will greatly aid the Nation and the traveling public. This is \nsuch an important bill. We throw the words around ``jobs bill.'' This \nis a jobs bill. At the minimum, this bill will create more than 100,000 \njobs. It will do it by investing in airport infrastructure and \nimproving aviation technology in every State in the Nation. This is a \nconservative estimate as to how many jobs will be produced.\n  The bill improves air service for rural communities such as those in \nColorado that are struggling to have air transportation.\n  I can remember Nevada, when there was good transportation in Ely and \nElko, but now it is very difficult. You have to go to Utah first to get \ninto Nevada. This bill will allow us to work toward changing things \nsuch as that.\n  It also provides for a passenger bill of rights. How many times have \npeople who are listening to us talk today been frustrated by what \nhappens at an airport? We will not go into what has happened. We have \nall had those experiences. We now have the rights of a passenger that \nare laid out in this bill. So air travelers, if they are stranded, have \ncertain rights--maybe a meal, maybe a refund of their ticket. It will \nbe a bill of rights so you do not have to go beg people to talk to you \nas to what can happen or not happen.\n  Frankly, it is better for the airline personnel that they will know \nwhat their rights are. People will have the ability to know what they \nhave and will not be able to abuse, as they do sometimes, these airline \nemployees.\n  This legislation will help strengthen air safety. There will be \nenhanced oversight of air carriers, especially in foreign repair \nstations. We have heard some of the horror stories about these \nairplanes being repaired in places a long way from where they are used \nhere in the United States, in foreign countries.\n\n[[Page S348]]\n\n  The bill creates a modernized air system that will provide enormous \nindustry and environmental benefits by reducing the rate of fuel burned \nas well as reducing noise and fuel emissions. This is a win-win for the \nAmerican public.\n  I can remember once I was stranded at an airport in Texas--Dallas. We \nwere pulled up to the gate. Actually, we did not pull up to the gate. \nThat was the problem--3\\1/2\\ hours waiting out there on that tarmac. \nThere were people pretty upset about that. This legislation addresses \nsituations such as that.\n  So it is a good bill. It is a jobs bill. We have said we would move \nto a jobs bill. I have discussed this legislation with Senator \nMcConnell. This is the time to have a debate. People can offer \namendments. There will be no tree filled. This is the time for a good, \nold-fashioned Senate debate, something that will help the American \npeople. Then we will send it to the House, and I think they will be \nable to finish it fairly quickly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/27/senate-section/article/S348-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENTS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

As Senators \nknow, we are going to be voting on a lot of Mondays and Fridays during \nour work periods here, but we are not in a position to do that now.\n  We look forward to moving to the aviation administration bill \nquickly. There is no reason we can't start that legislation on Monday. \nThat is when it will be on the Senate Calendar.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/27/senate-section/article/S348-4", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, JANUARY 31, 2011, at 2 P.M.\n\n  Mr. REID.
